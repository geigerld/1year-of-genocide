and we can now speak to James denlo he's the head of conflict and humanitarian policy at save the children UK he joins us from London good to see you now the UN says Gaza has become a graveyard for children just how serious is their plight well it doesn't get much more serious than the numbers we've seen of children killed uh of children injured of children uh forced from their homes of children in desperate need of food and water of children who had their daily routine completely turned on its head in Gaza as their education completely paus for instance but the the most traumatic images are of the children who have lost their lives it's worth always reminding ourselves that children have a different physiology to adults and not just little adults they have less blood to lose they have thinner skin more brittle bones and of course the kind of warfare that we're seeing in Gaza today uh is extremely deadly for them MH now what about your colleagues in Gaza I mean it's in your name you want to save the children but are they even able to provide any help at this point well our staff in Gaza and our thoughts are always with them and unfortunately with the power cuts and various Internet outages often we can't be in touch with all of them all the time as we'd like uh but they're having to look after and save their own children uh first and foremost and of course the vast majority of our team uh like the majority now of the population of the Gaza Strip have been forced from their homes by the events of the the last three weeks so it is uh the most dangerous place in the world to be an aid worker today uh there have been dozens of Aid workers uh killed in the last few weeks uh and it makes it impossible to to do the amount of humanitarian programming that we need to do if you consider that the population was 80% dependent on humanitarian Aid before the events that we've seen unfold yeah now some humanitarian Aid has been getting through the Rafa border crossing are you at all hopeful that this will increase in the days to come well we have to have hope but we Al also have to remember that uh there was an average of around 500 trucks a day going into Gaza before uh this conflict broke out uh and that number is now some just over 200 in the space of three weeks so there's a huge backlog the needs are far higher and uh the numbers of trucks that we need to go in need to rise exponentially but in addition to that you need all the water turned back on you need electricity turned back on so the desalination plants can operate you need fuel for the power plants uh but most critically you need a some form of humanitarian ceasefire so that um so that children in Gaza can be reached a Seas fire that the Israeli government says at this point is off the table that was James Denow from save the children all the best to your colleagues thank you so much thank you now wounded Palestinians and foreign passport holders have been allowed to leave Gaza for the first time today officials say several hundred have entered Egypt through the Rafa border crossing we just heard about it they are the first to benefit from an agreement brokered by Qatar among those allowed across are German citizens working for international Aid agencies people in Gaza have waited for weeks for this gate to open towards Egypt and now it has within an hour these ambulances were rushing through according to the UN thousands of civilians have been injured in Gaza since Israel began its war on terror group Hamas many of them critically wounded are in urgent need of Medical Care Egyptian authorities say 81 gazin were allowed to go across based on a deal struck between Egypt Israel and Hamas and mediated by Qatar on the other side Egypt has set up a field hospital to treat injured Palestinians and thousands of doctors have registered to help at the same time Volunteers in Egypt are trying to get more Aid into Gaza today 60 trucks have passed yesterday another 60 the priority is for medicine to pass we've seen children undergoing surgeries without anesthesia these border crossings take time as vehicles and documents are checked to ensure safety that adds to people's anxiety to get across for no one knows how long the Raa Crossing will remain open for those standing in Gaza it's the only way out of War our correspondent Rebecca ritters joins us now from ashalon in southern Israel Rebecca Long awaited relief at least for some people what more can you tell us about about efforts to evacuate people through the rougher Crossing well Nicole as you've been reporting today was the first day that the Border has actually been open and people have been able to cross we started getting word about this maybe last night that things might be moving along this morning uh we saw a list of up to between four and 500 people foreign Nationals largely and and some Palestinians who work for foreign or for an NGO organizations uh now we have seen that come to fruition a few less than we a few fewer than we thought with we we're seeing more than 320 uh people foreign Nationals and NGO workers have managed to cross over as well as just a little over 80 of severely injured and sick people as well to uh receive some medical help in Egypt so there been a huge sigh of relief obviously and hopefully it is thought that this will Kickstart uh more people being able to cross we believe there's about 7,000 people on these uh Jewel National lists and also other Palestinians working for foreign NOS or NGO workers um who have been put on these lists now we know that the US uh the UK Germany for example they weren't on the list today so we should be seeing more come we did hear today that German Nationals were told also to start heading towards rafic Crossing and we know that tomorrow it's thought that the The Crossing will be over um open again sorry and uh more people will be through so it's a huge sigh of relief but of course many people still trapped inside with continual bombardment yeah US President Joe Biden has also announced that um US citizens will be able to leave Gaza soon now what do we know about the fighting in Gaza the Israeli military says more soldiers have been killed there yeah just in the last little while actually the number of dead soldiers that the IDF has announced has risen to 16 soldiers um you this is coming out slowly the families need to be notified uh before they can make an official announcement we're seeing also some videos some obviously unverified videos on Hamas channels that that looks like it could in fact be a greater number but we won't know that of course until the coming days when official numbers do come out but obviously it just indicates how difficult this ground invasion is for uh the soldiers on the ground we're talking about tight spaces they expanding this ground Invasion and they're coming up they're meeting uh some substantial resistance even though the the the Israeli military saying that they have now broken the Hamas line that they are making successes but they are paying a great a great cost though Benjamin Netanyahu the Prime Minister saying that they would be continuing would they would be expanding that this will be a long uh a long war and it will be a difficult one for Israelis but one that is worth fighting D correspondent Rebecca Ritter is always great speaking to you thank you so much and I'm now joined by Daniel G he's a Middle East analyst and Editor in Chief of tenit magazine which focuses on the Arab and Muslim world he joins us tonight from Alexandria in Egypt welcome back to DW now Daniel Egypt has opened its border for foreign passport holders and some critically injured Palestinians for the very first time what can you tell us about the agreement and how it came about well it seems that was quite a nerve-wracking negotiation because of course uh the people that are involved in the Egyptian side here are the security officials the intelligence officials the ones that are really caring like have a very military and very security oriented uh look on the situation on the other side you have the qataris who are talking to Hamas and hamas's allies trying to uh negotiate the liberation of Civilian hostages at the same time and then you have the Americans who play a very important uh role in the in like behind the behind the screens because the because Anthony blinkin is talking to the qataris to the Egyptians and uh to the Israelis at the same time so I think these are really moments for classic diplomacy and not for uh great announcement and words in public because whatever you say what you might you know uh marginalize or anger one of the sides involved and all the goodwi of all sides is very important here so I can imagine that these negotiations were tough and they're not really clear when we talk about the number of people that are allowed into Egypt for treatment um it's not really clear if it's about the qataris were pushing for 500 per day um then it wasn't sure like when would they have to return to Gaza so all all of this is not really uh agreed upon as far as I know at least it is not public and I don't have the sources on that yeah many unknown still at this point but Qatar that seems for sure has been instrumental in bringing this evacuation about what leverage does DOA have over Hamas well Qatar has a lot of Leverage leverage over Hamas because uh Hamas depends on the Qatari mediation efforts uh let's not forget that the political leadership of Hamas which is not the same as the military on the ground I think there is a big a big gap between between the political leadership and which is also exiled and based in Doha and the people on the ground in Gaza but but but of course Qatar is leverage on them because they could simply kick them out and uh and hand hand them over to whoever they wanted so that is leverage that that the qataris have on the other side let's make no mistake the the qataris are a small negotiation team and uh as far as I know they're really working day at night but they need also um something to give to the other side from the Israelis and that has been a big issue because of course Benjamin nany is under intense pressure and he wants this military campaign to go full into uh into the Gaza Strip and uh civili casualties are not or or avoiding civilian casualties seems not to be the first priority um they're taking the risk and of course the Americans are really depending on the qataris at the same time so it's a very interesting like let's say network of actors here and of course the Europeans can play a role but I don't think the Europeans or the Germans are playing the key role here now Qatar has supported Hamas politically you mentioned it there and financially over many years they have blamed Israel barely for the October 7th Massacre so how come Israel is accepting them as a mediator look um Israel and Qatar have a long-standing intelligence uh I wouldn't say cooperation but communication all the money that the qataris have provided for humanitarian Aid also for the let's say uh maintenance of the administration in uh in Gaza uh was transferred of course in coordination and agreement with the Israelis that's what the qataris have always said and Israel has never denied it it's also quite interesting that we hear a lot of uh criticism against Qatar in Germany uh in other European countries I have frankly not heard that from the Israeli side the mosad director um David B went to uh Doha according to the sources that I've talked to uh last Sunday I believe to discuss the uh hostages situation and the Israelis are really really depending on the qataris because they are at the moment the only ones who could probably uh talk to Hamas and and and and Liber and and negotiate at least the liberation of the civilians so the Israelis know what they have there and it's quite an quite paradoxal situation of course that they strongly disagree on political issues but they in a way bound to cooperate and I don't think the qataris are doing this to do a favor to the Israelis they're doing this because they want to establish themselves as a mediation power and foremost because they uh would like to do the Americans a favor and support the Americans they know that the Americans would also support them those Middle East analyst Daniel G in Alexandria thank you for that thank you let's bring in on shora she's a foreign affairs columnist at foreign policy magazine and joins us now from Tel Aviv welcome to the day first of all anshal people have been let out of Gaza for the very first time since October 7th US President Joe Biden says American citizens will leave Gaza today is this a oneoff or are we looking at some true relief for the civilians in Gaza well it's limited relief and it's unclear whether it's a one-off or not from what we've picked up so far that it there will be limited openings for limited time periods which means that this may happen again but the number of people to benefit will remain rather small if you look at the overall population of Gaza that is stuck uh uh you know as Israel continues its operation there so it is a relief certainly but how many times will the Border open for how long and how many people would be able to get out is unclear and it's expected thus far to remain a small a small Affair now Qatar has been positioning itself as a key player in the negotiations between Egypt between Hamas and Israel how key have they been in securing this development specifically well this development not so Keen I would say I think there are three strs to the negotiations that are going on or in future are expected to happen one is and most important is for uh the people of Gaza to get uh basic Aid that is happening between Israel and Egypt and Hamas uh because Egypt is the only country that Gaza has a a border crossing uh an opening with uh the other is Hostages this is perhaps from Israeli perspective the most crucial that's the one that Qatar is leading so in this specific one I don't think katri have played any role uh uh if if you'd ask me and the third is the long-term talks and uh or or a ceasefire an talk of an enduring ceasefire there perhaps Qatar could play a role it certainly wants to but even there we'd see Egypt is is is is a competitor I want to keep looking at the role of qar here though because it is a very interesting player it is extremely close to Hamas it's giving uh their their political uh Branch um a basis they're they're funding them in part they have in fact exclusively blamed Israel for the massacres on October 7th so to what extent is Israel really willing to work with them here well just to clarify Qatar is playing a very very important role and has huge huge amounts of Leverage over Hamas now whether it is is exercising that leverage or not we are not very clear because thus far only four hostages have been released there are at least 240 uh uh hostages the last number that we're aware of so Qatar has huge influence over Hamas Israelis have asked Qatar to use it uh uh is it using it you've got hamas's office there which means hamas's leadership is there in Doha in that office in Doha they're not just sitting and having Cups of Tea but they're actually meeting with their Iranian and patrons they're meeting with all sorts of their allies they're planning things Qatar could use its influence it is hosting the hamas's office it sends millions in AIDS in Aid to uh Gaza every year this money goes through Israel and Israel knows where it is going but it is going to Gaza to support uh the people of Gaza but the Israelis have long suspected and others have said that a part of this money goes to Hamas or at least sustains hamas's government uh or governance uh uh its bureaucracy there so Qatar has huge influence thus far it says it is trying to get the hostages released but only four hostages have been released it is kind of right now I think from what I've gathered playing the role of you know it's passing messages it's saying uh uh Israel needs to stop bombing Gaza so Hamas can gather all the hostages and then send at least the civilians uh back to Israel and because Israel isn't stopping the bombing uh the transfer of the hostages are not being released so that's um I think all it's really doing is sort of conveying what Hamas wants to Israel and what Israel wants to Hamas but it perhaps can play a bigger role do you think a release of all civilians that Hamas is currently holding is in the cards it is from what I've picked up I've been talking to an official who's aware of negotiations uh ongoing negotiations and uh uh yes civilians could be released uh by Hamas if Israel stops or agrees to a ceasefire which uh has not happened thus far although there's talk that there might be pauses humanitarian pauses remains to be seen uh but the message that we're getting from Doha uh is that uh Hamas has agreed uh to at least return civilian hostages but not armed uh uh um Israelis and in exchange for armed Israelis it wants its own Palestinian prisoners uh uh all of them released so just just to be clear you're saying that Qatar is a major player Egypt as well at Qatar wants to come out on top of course what's in it for them though well they want to be uh big players in global geopolitics this is one of the richest countries in the world with one of the highest per capita incomes and third largest gas reserves they've held the they've hosted the uh soccer uh um world cup and other sporting tournaments and you know they they were in Limelight again when uh Europe cut off Russian uh gas supplies after the after Russia's Ukraine Invasion and and gatar has a lot of gas so you know they want to play uh they want to be prominent and they're surrounded by very they're surrounded by bigger much more influential much more prominent uh neighbors and they've kind of feel that they might be undermined their Authority the authority of this small Kingdom small but very the kingdom might be under undermined and uh they they want to secure their secure their place and just to be clear i' would like to clarify one thing here Egypt has a different role to play kataris are essentially looking at hostage negotiations whereas Egypt from what I've picked up plays a bigger role when it comes to an enduring ceasefire or when it comes to the passing of Aid so these are two different negotiations fascinating insights that was Anora of the foreign policy magazine joining us from Tel Aviv thanks for your time
