Israel says it is moving toward the next stage of its offensive against Gaza prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rallies troops on the border saying more is coming in the campaign against Hamas the military says it is preparing to attack Gaza by land sea and air to destroy the group a week after it carried out a terror attack in Israel and took more than a 100 people hostage Israeli air strikes pounded Targets in Gaza overnight ahead of the anticipated ground assault the World Health Organization says an Israeli order forcing people to evacuate from hospitals in Northern Gaza is a death sentence Israeli officials say there are two safe routes for families to relocate south of the W gazi Gaza Wetlands that run across the territory many displaced gazans have taken Refuge at United Nations schools in southern Gaza food water and medical supplies are running low Israel's military says it has been attacking targets it believes are linked to Hamas but Hamas says more than 70 civilians were killed in an air strike on one of the highways the morg at gaza's alifa hospital is overflowing workers stack corpses in the parking lot outside bodies are coming in faster than relatives can claim them and the hospital has run out of SP space for the remains Israel's bombing campaign on the territory of 2.3 million has leveled entire neighborhoods killing more than 2,000 Palestinians and wounding many more some of the injured are being treated in hospital corridors many of them are children a shortage of beds medical supplies and power outages have left hospitals in the north struggling to cope the World Health Organization says forcing the critically ill to move South amounts to a death sentence It also says the evacuation order has left exhausted health workers facing a choice between abandoning patience or staying behind and putting their own lives at risk Israel's evacuation order means the clinic became a shelter for more than 35,000 refugees many have set up makeshift tents in the front of the building using carpets curtains and whatever they could Salvage from their homes we received messages on our phones so we left quickly we came here to the hospital but the place is more crowded than the schools everyone came here there are no bathrooms no food no water nobody cares about us I was displaced with my family 16 of us we go from place to place may God help us the UN is calling on Israel to immediately reverse the evacuation order but for countless garans it's already too late our correspondent Tanya Kramer is in ashad southern Israel near the Gaza border you told us more about the situation on the ground well right here now in southern Israel it's quiet this morning but it's also a 10's morning because of course everybody here also is waiting what's happening next a lot of the towns and Villages and kibuts around the the the Gaza border area have been evacuated as well a lot of people are here also on the Move staying with relatives further up north um last night there has been uh have been several rocket barges into Israel also to ashot and also to Tel Aviv but as you said as well the air strikes and the bombing bombardments of Gaza also continuing at this time are indications any clearer today that Israel May soon launch its ground offensive on Gaza I mean this is what everybody is of course waiting for the timing is unclear there will be an element of surprise still although everybody's expecting it um it seems to be rather imminent but we don't know uh the Army said that they plan to implement a wide range of operational offensive plans and The Wider ground operation they said that in a statement um it is certainly also made more difficult by the fact that there are over 100 hostages being held in Gaza so um it is not uh you know just going in for a ground operation but it's not just the South that Israelis are looking at also looking up north because in recent days there have been a lot of exchanges of fire also with Hezbollah again yesterday and also now with Syria and we understand that uh the U the US is sending another carrier that's quite unusual uh to the Eastern Mediterranean to support Israel again also to show and to probably in a message to other actors here in the region not to take part in this war deterrent uh Tanya almost half the gazen population as you well know residents in the north has been told to relocate in what we all keep reminding viewers is one of the world's most congested places now we hear many can't flee South into Egypt because the Rafer Crossing there is closed one of the reasons why the UN and Aid group say humanitarian crisis is looming there any relief coming for those Palestinians well we understand that there are trucks on the Egyptian side for the moment they're not passing but the whole situation in Gaza is deteriorating by the hour I had the chance to talk to one of our colleagues there another fellow journalist in Gaza who's also himself on the move he is from Gaza City and moved down to the southern part and he was telling me how difficult it is you know he still had some fuel in his car but there's not much gasoline left at the the stations they refer from one to the next for people who have a car those who don't have transport they go by foot others go on Donkey cards the water situation is a problem there's no electricity so there are all kind of problems and we heard from who also warning that they cannot it's impossible to evacuate those hospitals uh because to move those patients it's really problematic so we also understand that there are efforts to try to get out some Palestinians who have a dual citizen Citizenship or foreigners with a foreign passport but as of last night they were still stranded in the raer crossing as well as the aid that's supposed to come in but you also have to understand you also have to be able then once the Aid comes in that it can be distributed and with this very weak infrastructure at the moment that there is with all these problems this will be very very difficult to say it's a dynamic situation would be a gross understatement that is a Tanya Kramer in ashdod many many thanks Margaret Harris from the World Health Organization described what's being done to help civilians in Gaza so we're doing everything we can including condemning the um evacuation orders for the 22 hospitals in the north of Gaza um the northern part of Gaza that have been given repeated orders by the Israelis to remove they cannot they're treating more than 2,000 inpatients uh many of them are severely ill their lives are hanging in the balance as it is and they certainly can't be moved and even if they could there's no capacity in the southern hospitals they're already completely overstretched we are also verifying and condemning attacks on health we are seeing that we've verified at least 41 attacks on health that have led to the loss of life of 11 healthcare workers on duty we've learned of another four who lost their lives just recent in the last 24 hours we are verifying those um and we know of 16 injuries but the critical thing and the thing we can't do is get the supplies in all the medicines are running out there's desperate need for pain relief for instance with all these people with injuries just imagine trying to treat a child with Burns who's crying in pain and you can't do anything for them we have the supplies ready they're waiting 20 km away but we need the borders open we need to be able to to deliver them so on the Egyptian side we are told it can be open but it uh it is apparently not yet safe um too open uh on the other side uh that it is still an unsafe Crossing uh but we have certainly our director General Dr Tedros adnam gabrus had a meeting with the Egyptian president some days ago and there was agreement that they would open the border for our supplies to go in but it has not been possible to bring them in other developments gazan officials say Israel's air strikes have killed more than 2,300 people hamas's Terror attacks claimed more than 1300 Israelis the US has sent a second aircraft carrier to the Eastern Mediterranean to support Israel and prevent any regional conflict Israel's Communications Minister once alzer's local Bureau shut down having accused the katab based news channel of incitement let's bring in DW's senior International correspondent funny Fatar who's in Jerusalem funny it's now been a week since hamas's terrorist attacks what's the climate in Jerusalem right now if you have never been to Jerusalem you may get the impression that there is a sense of normality because there more people out on the street but that's nothing compared to what life looked like here uh more than a week ago before this terrorist attack was Unleashed by hamus militants on Saturday killing uh hundreds of people and abducting at least an estimated 150 people still unclear as we have just heard in the report what exactly is happening to them when it comes to the atmosphere all around and even just the impact on israelian society that's really early to tell one has to understand that prior to all of this this Society has been much much polarized when it comes to the uh domestic government here that's not going to disappear overnight what I do see have that people talk less and less actually about domestic politics and rather they are united uh both in their grief uh in their anger as well how it could come to the situation that so many people in Israel have been killed but also increasingly questions are being also raised with regard to Israel's moral responsibility when it comes to people in Palestine in in in Gaza Strip and when it comes to the Palestinian people people are asking themselves here why is it that the entire Gaza region has to PID the prize for the actions of the Hamas militants so basically for the actions of a few and as we have seen there by my colleague maanda filing the report from Tel Aviv uh people are asking for the release of their family members they are asking for the government to pay attention making sure that they're not becoming to say so a collateral damage as uh Israel is is amassing the forces there alongside the Gaza border ready to go in ready to strike and unclear what that's going to mean for ordinary citizens but as well as the hostages uh that are inside in Gaza St funny very quickly we have less than half a minute while the US Secretary of State is on a lightning tour through the Middle East in hopes of limiting the conflict Washington has dispatched the second aircraft carrier to the Eastern Mediterranean what's the message the US is trying to send here briefly deterrence making sure that for example Iran or Iran backs Hezbollah the militant group in Lebanon does not get involved that Syria does not get involved in this conflict making sure that there's deescalation before this conflict is widening and even though we're hearing that security state blinkin has met Crown Prince uh Abdullah in in Saudi Arabia it is completely unclear whether he can achieve this deescalation DW's funny
