the international court of justice in the Haag has ordered Israel to stop its military offensive in the city of Rafa in southern Gaza the 's top Court described the humanit humanitarian situation there as disastrous and ordered Israel to allow unhindered access of aid but Israel rejected the ruling and says its operations against Hamas a group considered an terrorist organization by multiple countries will continue far from the front lines of the war and Gaza Israel's military campaign suffered a major legal blow Israel must immediately hold its military offensive and any other action in the RAF Governor which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part the latest icj ruling unequivocal about the need for Israel to protect Palestinians and do more to provide vital Aid the unhindered provision at scale by all concerned of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance and of course necess states that the respondent maintain open land Crossing points and in particular the ra crossing the decision welcomed by South Africa which brought the case and has accused Israel of committing genocide this order is groundbreaking as it is the first time that explicit mention is made for Israel to Halt its military action in any area of Gaza this time specifically in Rafa Israel rejects accusations of genocide and the latest icj ruling War cabinet minister Benny gun said the fight to return its hostages would continue including in Rafa the icj also ordered the unconditional release of hostages being held by ham while the court has no way of enforcing the ruling it poses a major challenge for Israel's allies we have to choose between our support of the international institution and the rule of law or our support to Israel and both things is going to be quite difficult to make competible the ruling is the second blow to Israel's war this week the international criminal court has applied for arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister and defense minister over war crimes both judicial decisions adding to Growing Global criticism of Israel's war Mark Weller is Professor of international law and international constitutional studies at the University of Cambridge in the UK he told me more about the Court's reasoning well Israel is of course entitled to the right to self-defense in response to the horrible atrocious uh events of the 7th of October but the right to self-defense is not unlimited and it can never transgress humanitarian law the law that surprise that supports the Dignity of human persons human beings in any circumstance even in war and the court has now spoken for the third time in just a few months which is unprecedented ordering Israel the first time uh not to do anything which could constitute acts of genocide against the people of Gaza the Palestinians the second time it has ordered Israel to ensure that there is full humanitarian access and now almost unprecedentedly it has ordered a state claiming to be in the middle of a self-defense operation to Halt a major element of that campaign it's rough offensive okay so let's pick up the two you mentioned there uh two previous rulings there nothing that constitutes genocide and full humanitarian access today's ruling uh required Israel uh to uh provide verification or to allow verification uh of humanitarian access which seems to indicate that the court does not believe that Israel has complied with its earlier ruling well it certainly hasn't complied uh in the sense that the court has found that the situation has gotten much worse and therefore very unusually it has made yet a further ruling in this case and the court is very very concerned about the future of those individuals who were sent to Rafa as a safe place by Israel to escape the consequences of the fighting and who are now being displaced from there without adequate measures have been taken to ensure their survival in other places and the court has noticed that no such adequate steps have been taken okay so there we have a problem don't we because the court rules uh do something about humanitarian access the court rules today uh against uh Israel and says stop what's going on in Rafa and let us check that you've complied with our earlier ruling we heard yesterday from an Israeli government spokesman who was quoted as saying no power on Earth will stop Israel from protecting its citizens and going after Hamas in Gaza the court can rule until it's blue in the face where's it or else well uh how many Legions does the pope have as was famously asked the court doesn't have an army to enforce its wishes it could have an army if the UN Security Council were able to exercise its role because the UN Security Council has in principle the power to enforce judgments of the court but of course with the US veto that is not possible and therefore it is the very very significant diplomatic pressure you saw the indictments by the international criminal court in relation to Mr Netanyahu a completely sear we should say and those uh have been backed up now yet again uh in addition to their individual responsibility by these actions directed towards the state of Israel and it really makes the Diplomatic space for Israel much much more difficult to maneuver in Israel has been arguing we have been a model of humanitarian law compliance but with all of this evidence those arguments ring increasingly Hollow as most people who watch television of course already know but once you have these authoritative findings from the highest judicial bodies in the world it is much more difficult for Israel to maintain its position that it is in a modest way defending itself does this ruling impose any duties or obligations on any other signatures uh to the court to do or not do anything I'm thinking of the United States amongst others who it could be argued are are is or are supplying Israel with the wherewithal to carry out the activities that the court has now prohibited B you should say that as of course you're hinting at Germany is at present subject to a case in the international court of justice where nicaragu has argued that the continued provision of Arms by Germany to Israel violates the genocide convention and for a state like Germany which Prides itself as a model of compliance with international law um on the one hand but which also wants to remain a very strong friend of Israel that is a real huge dilemma coming up for it the United States uh will will not likely uh consider uh the court in relation to its arms exports which are of course quite massive uh the United Kingdom may be in a different position because under its ministerial code it cannot uh license uh the export of weapons uh if these weapons are likely to be used against international law or certainly in favor of a campaign of genocide so these various pronouncements again make the space to maneuver for Israel and for its allies uh significantly smaller doesn't end the conflict but it is another piece in the Mosaic uh which will help I think persuade Israel ultimately to try not to isolate itself entirely from the International Community and just a final word on genocide because today's ruling is a part of a broader uh lawsuit brought by South Africa last year accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza just explain to us briefly what impact today's decision has on that well this is part of that case it is the third interim action by the court to protect the people of Palestine during the many years it will take the court to give the actual ruling as to whether or not genocide has taken place so this action does not actually Prejudice the finding of the court at the end of that lengthy period of legal argument as to whether or not genocide occurred remember the Bosnian case were most thought uh we were faced with a significant campaign of genocide and after many years of deliberation the court found that Sanita was genocide but the rest of this Dreadful campaign of crimes against humanity didn't quite measure up to that high legal standard that's very clear Professor thank you so much for walking us through that Professor Mark Weller from the University of Cambridge Mary Ellen oconnell is Professor of Law and professor of International Peace studies at the University of Notre Dame in the United States one of for numerous books is self-defense against non-state actors she joins us from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil a welcome to DW Professor uh this ruling sounds pretty unequivocal uh not a lot of wiggle room for Israel there is no wiggle room in this order remember it's the third order issued by the international court of justice in this case the two prior orders have been defied people are still dying in large numbers especially civilians especially children the court like everyone in the world including President Biden sees this operation against Rafa as nothing short of catastrophic the court has ordered a halt to this operation what else could it do well Israel has said all along that it has pursued these actions in the defense of its citizens following that bar barbarous attack by Hamas terrorists why wasn't that enough for the quot the Israel's argument its attempted justification has flaws in it on a number of levels on the first level the international court itself has ruled in 2004 that a war an allout War under the UN Charter's um recognition of the right of self-defense cannot be waged against a zone of occupation by the occupier of course Israel can take defensive measures it can do whatever it wants on its own territory to defend from incoming attacks further terrorist attacks but it cannot launch an allout War having launched this war in defiance of the Court's own prior decision it then has to comply with certain rules derived from the Geneva conventions known as inter International humanitarian law that whatever your military objective is you have to first and foremost distinguish between Fighters and civilians you must only carry out those operations that are necessary to accomplish the military objective not cause disproportionate loss of civilian life and at all times remember Humanity the humanity of the victims of armed conflict and the fighters own the Israeli soldiers own humanity and the court has had evidence brought by South Africa that Israel is not complying with either its prior ruling in the wall case or these fundamental principles of international humanitarian law not allowing food in sufficiently the large the very high number of deaths which are not dis when you drop a bomb on an apartment building in the hope of getting one potential fighter this is the very definition of disproportionate the court has said time and again yes Israel can take defensive measures it must respond and protect its own citizens as every country does against terrorism Okay police measures appropriate to the challenge does not see the the court has ruled repeatedly uh about Israel's conduct I think you said this was the third ruling and one of today's rulings was that Israel must allow investigators to establish whether it has complied with a previous ruling so where is the all else the court can rule till it it's blue in the face if Israel just sits there and says I don't care well one of the clear consequences of Israel not complying with the prior to orders it didn't comply with the first order in January so then the second order came in March it didn't comply with the second order the third order has come and this order as you pointed out is really definitive is as as clear and as black and white as any order the international court has ever issued it means not only that Israel must comply but every state in the International Community whose law we're talking about the law of the International Community has to assist the court has to assist South Africa and in bringing enforcement we all know that the country most in a position to really help enforce this most recent order is the United States President Biden himself has warned Israel about this Rafa offensive he has the he's the last country that's providing really extensive weapons offensive weapons to Israel President Biden is the person I want to listen to this order and say okay we must halt delivery of offensive weapons to Israel Israel has to know it's alone in believing that what it's doing complies with the law because it does not and following on from that does this ruling o open up the possibility of international sanctions against Israel I possibly but I think sanctions are beside the point at this moment what really needs to happen is for the Israeli government to listen to its own people to listen to people around the world saying we do not want this kind of Carnage in our name this kind of a failure to comply with the law we do not want to be law Breakers we want to be those who uphold the rule of law that sanctions are not necessarily A a great option it is a sanction of course for the US to withhold weapons lots of countries now have changed fundamentally their position Visa Israel because of failure to comply with international law either as as exemplified or as as explained by the court or as their own legal advisers have seen this I at this point we've seen sanctions not doing as much as they should do to persuade Russia I I don't think sanctions Beyond withholding weapons are really going to be the the the thing that moves Israel now okay but whatever it takes I'm happy to hear governments stepping up let's talk about two things today's uh Court ruling hasn't ordered number one uh a ceasefire and number two uh any ruling on whether or not uh Israel has committed genocide it it cannot then the second point it cannot rule on that point definitively yet these are emergency orders that the court has been ruling these three sets of orders are emergency orders provisional measures pending the outcome of a full case on the merits so until that happens Israel the court cannot uh rule definitively on whether genocide is occurring or has occurred by the time it rules on the merits as the court said after its first uh set of orders in January there are there's plausible indications of genocide but it is in no position and it would be a Defiance of its own rules to make a definitive uh finding on that point right now so that's the first one please remind me of your second the ceasefire so no talk in this ruling of a ceasefire in the whole of this conflict the remember the first two orders are more comprehensive they apply throughout Gaza and they say that Israel has to take all these measures to prevent genocide that's that's as much as the is unfortunately from my point of view it's not a case about peace and compliance with the prohibition on the use of force it's a case about uh the genocide convention so the court in before it's made its full uh findings in the in the case in a preliminary way is trying to ensure that the genocide convention is not violated so it's pointing out to Israel that it's got to take more measures to ensure that that what Israel is doing is not uh uh eliminating the Palestinian people in whole or in part and that's a different um goal than perhaps if it had a more General basis for ruling on violations by Israel in Gaza so it's limited in terms of the treaty under which the case is brought thank you so much for talking us through that professor professor Mary Ellen oconnell from Notre Dame university in the United States thank you thank you let's take a look then at potential Israeli and American reactions to this ruling the Atlantic council is an American think tank in the field of International Affairs and Alysa Pavia is associate director middle Easter programs she joins us from Washington DC welcome to DW can we start with your thoughts on this latest ruling against Israel of course and and thank you for having me um so this late latest ruling against Israel comes in the wake of a week uh week long um a week where we've seen a number of other instances occur in the International Community that have been quite outspoken against Israel and so the first one was the ICC arrest warrants that were made at the beginning of the week um against uh both Israeli and Hamas leaders and on the Israel side those were um against uh Benjamin nany and you have Galan the Prime Minister and the minister of defense and subsequent to that we also saw number of European Union countries that have come out um in defense of Palestine by backing and by by um by backing the creation of Palestinian State and these are Ireland Norway and Spain and so this much we we we've covered you you like your your thoughts time is short obviously I'd like your thoughts on today's uh ruling of course so on on today's ruling um this obviously is is um a ruling by the by the icj that that um is trying to pressure Israel into not going into rafine they want and the icj is eager to see a more International uh more International pressure onto Israel um and of course as your as the as as the person before me covered this will um likely hinge on whether the United States will want to support or not um the icj's ruling because the icj um on its own doesn't have um much of an enforcement mechanism onto these onto this ruling but the way it can enforce it is through a United uh United n security coun United Nations security Council um resolution but for that to happen the United States needs to needs to be in favor of that and can't veto that a deafening silence so far from the White House why do you think that is deafening silence they are deciding on the next steps um the United States has had somewhat of an ambiguous um role or an ambiguous uh uh way of of of deciding on on these latest instances when it comes to Israel um we've seen a two-tier approach when it comes to President Biden specifically where in public um in some instances he's been more vocal and critical of Israel but in other instances but he's mostly in practice supported um Israel's war in AA and so as of now and also as of now that we've heard of Benjamin netan um agreeing to speak uh at Congress again in defiance of of of prime minister of uh President Biden um this way this may bring to a greater wedge between the relationship between netan and Biden that may um uh that that may have an effect on the way President Biden decides to um tackle this latest ruling okay so this this wedge being driven between the the leaders of the United States and Israel except that um when we had the announcement from the uh international criminal court uh prosecutor this week there was virtually no Delay from the United States in condemning this move that is correct there is no delay again um the sense is that because Benjamin nany is is going to defy uh President Biden in Congress and speak in front of Congress this may be uh the moment for President Biden to strike back um against prime minister Netanyahu but um it is also likely that he may not do that because up until now um he has been forceful in his um backing and supporting Israel through um providing military and uh fincial support by um vetoing un Council resolutions so the sense is that he is um waiting to kind of provide more pressure onto Biden but at the end he will again oppose the icj ruling is there an argument that Benin netanyahu's government has actually gone too far to row back now having declared their intention to destroy Hamas and rescue the hostages must they now keep going the argument on Israel's side is that um Rafa is the last goalpost where Hamas is hiding and if they don't continue now um they will not be able to win essentially the war that they started in October um President Biden has said repeatedly that to an extent he he agrees but he also disagrees with with it in the sense of U wanting to see more wanting to see Israel be more cognizant of civilan casualties but at the same time yeah we're going to leave it there thank you so much for for joining us andisa Pavia from Atlantic Council thank you so much thank you so much well from Ontario Canada let's now bring in Michael link professor of Law and also a former un special rapor on human rights in the Palestinian territories thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us again here on DW Professor link how much of a blow is this ruling for Israel well it's another blow in another remarkable week with respect to international law as your commentator mentioned um uh the arrest warrants application that was announced on Monday by the prosecutor uh was certainly uh U devaluing um Israel's reputation in the International Community uh the remarks by three European countries on Wednesday to recognize Palestine as a state was a further diplomatic blow and today with the international court of justice ruling on the further application by South Africa uh concluded that Israel must immediately halt its military offensive in uh in Rafa and it must maintain the Rafa Crossing which Israel controls from the Palestinian side it must maintain that open in order to allow uh the unhindered flow of humanitarian Aid which is probably at the very worst stage that it's been in the S and half months of this of this awful War so you know it's hard to imagine uh how much lower Israel's International reputation uh can go uh and if it if it proceeds as it appears it will uh with its full-blown Rafa offensive I suspect we'll see more condemnation of Israel in the days and weeks to come yeah and talking about other countries let's go a bit deeper there because the court doesn't really have the ability to force Israel to comply but does this ruling oppose any duties or obligations on other countries to do or not do anything countries like the US and Germany for example which are supplying Israel with weapons sure I mean I not it doesn't uh affect them directly but certainly there could be domestic um litigation in both countries because they are by far uh the largest arm suppliers to Israel as you mentioned uh to try to uh go to the courts in each country uh to say that there is complicity uh in uh in Germany's actions uh in a an offensive that uh both both the world Court uh has wound up condemning and has been condemned at the general assembly of the United Nations as well um so this may well up opening up domestic challenges uh that will build upon what the court has said yeah I'll definitely be interesting to see how that pans out but this ruling is just one part of a broader complaint that South Africa filed late last year accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza what impact does today's decision have on that well it probably continues to harden the court uh with respect to Israel's conduct if you had a visual view of what the uh what the audience in the court looked like today there were three lawyers representing Israel and the rest of the seats where ordinarily a very large Israeli delegation would be seated were entirely empty uh I'm not I'm not sure that was meant as contempt by Israel for uh for the court um or that was meant as a resignation knowing what the Court's ruling was uh was likely uh going to uh going to be so this is all um fairly objective so far but Professor I'd like to ask you what your opinion is what do you think this ruling will actually accomplish well in the short run it it won't accomplish anything Israel has U shown disdain for the three prior r ings that the international court has um has issued with respect to the South African application and remember the South African application for charges of genocide against Israel won't be heard uh in full by the court for probably several years uh down the road if we're measuring um by the same yard stick um the proceedings against myamar brought by The Gambia uh at the international court of justice um but it will continue I think to deeply stain uh Israel's diplom atic and political standing in the world I think we've already seen obviously on campuses in Europe and particularly in North America the kind of Uprising um that are calling upon their universities to stop uh academic relationships and investments in uh Israel all of this I think will continue um there's no sign of a a ceasefire being reached in Gaza I suspect uh even if Israel was to win all of its War gains and and decapitate Hamas politically and militarily that will take a large number of months yet so I suspect this kind of protests these kinds of legal actions this kind of political censor against Israel will continue through the summer well Professor Michael link thank you so much for your expertise and your analysis there thanks for being with us here on DW again thank you very much H for having me
