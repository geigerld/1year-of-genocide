Israeli troops have stormed the largest functioning Hospital in Gaza now the Army describes the operation at the NASA Hospital in the southern city of Han yunes as precise and limited it says there is credible intelligence that Hamas which carried out the October the 7th Terror attacks held hostages in the complex mobile phone footage appears to show Israeli forces entering NASA Hospital in hunis the main medic facility in southern Gaza the Israeli military says it was a limited operation aimed at finding hostages remains we have credible intelligence from a number of sources including from released hostages indicating that Hamas held hostages at the NASA Hospital in kanun and that there may be bodies of our hostages in the NASA Hospital facility further south some 1.5 million displaced Palestinians are now living in cramped conditions in the Border city of Rafa where Israel is still believed to be planning an assault but International warnings are growing louder large scale military op operations in densely populated areas risks extensive civilian casualties Australia believes this would be unjustifiable our message to Israel is listen to the world do not go down this path the United Nations says there is no safe place for gazans to evacuate too with so many people amassed along the border the un's humanitarian Chief has warned of a spillover into Egypt given the scale of the devastation the un's trade agency says Gaza will need International Investment on the scale of Europe's postwar Marshall plan to recover after the fighting but for most gazans the future is far from their mind they're struggling just to survive every day our correspondent Aman ISF joins us now from Jerusalem Aman what more do we know about the situation right now in this Hospital well uh the IDF has stormed the nassa hospital which is uh essentially the largest still functioning Hospital in Gaza right now they said They carried out a precise operation using uh Special Forces uh and that they made all efforts to keep the hospital in operation uh their mission there they said early on was to recover the bodies of hostages that they claim have been killed by Hamas so these are not living hostages but just the bodies of uh those already hostages already killed by uh Hamas according to their intelligence um uh but when they were in there they also took several people into custody as suspects uh now we're also hearing from the staff of the hospital hital there that's run by the Gaz and&amp; Health Ministry which is in turn run by Hamas which is considered a terrorist organization by Israel and several other countries uh They said that the uh storming of that hospital began with tank fire on this Hospital which killed uh at least one person that we know so far a patient they claim and uh we have to remember that this hospital is not just being used as a hospital but also a shelter for many hundreds of civilians that have been fleeing uh the war t areas across the country okay and Israel also says that it does plan to move forward with its offensive on Rafa we've talked about the growing number of international calls not to do that uh what more can you tell us about um what Israel is saying about this well that's that's correct um the uh uh plans to move ahead with this uh ground incursion into Rafa have uh there's been many warnings from Israel's closest allies including Germany uh which sent its foreign minister to Israel to discuss uh the this assault on Rafa and to warn Israel not to go ahead with it until more Aid can be brought into the area and until uh Israel can come up with a credible plan that would allow civilians to exit this area uh safely to another safe area in Gaza the problem there is that there are ESS no more safe areas in Gaza a lot of the land is strewn with unexploded ordinances uh Israeli Defense Forces are operating across the country right now um and most of the country is Rubble Rafa is really the only city left where there's functioning infrastructure and that's why 1.3 million gazin have fled there and are living in dire conditions uh Israel has recently uh succeeded in blocking more food Aid that would come into Gaza and help uh Supply the needs of those over a million people who are there the UN said that it would not be a party to another Force displacement uh but Israel said it had it will go through uh with this ground offensive MH and there have been reports of fresh strikes uh Israeli strikes on on Lebanon can you give us an update on the situation there that's right there seems to be an ongoing exchange of fire and of bombings across the Lebanese Southern border the Israeli northern border which has been going on basically since the o just after the October 7th Hamas Terror attacks Hezbollah is a strong Iran bed uh militant Group which Israel consider considers a terrorist group uh which controls the south of Lebanon and it has fired into Israel Israel has responded but just recently uh uh yesterday there was uh an attack by Hezbollah which reached deeper into Israeli territory than we've seen so far killing one IDF Soldier and Israel responded ferociously with uh several attacks across the south of Lebanon killing 10 civilians including several children they also were able to kill three Hezbollah militants at least three uh including one senior Commander which has uh greatly angered the leadership of Hezbollah and said Israel is going to pay the price for that attack I mean thanks so much for that update that's DW's Amy and EF reporting from Jerusalem there
