you so analina Bok spoke prior to her departure to the Middle East tell us what she had to say well she stressed that it's exactly three months to the day that Hamas terrorism brought unimaginable suffering to this region to is Israel and to Gaza and she said that that cycle of violence does have to stop but she also said that there are people in Lebanon who are now concerned that uh there could be a potential escalation of the conflict to that region she said it only takes a spark to set the entire region on fire and that that is not sustainable that now we also must be must make sure that um humanitarian suffering ends and that people do talk about ways to come to sustainable peace again Nina beok is expected to hold talks with Palestinian foreign minister Riad al-maliki in the Palestinian territories on Monday tell us more about that planned meeting and what the reaction has been from Israel yeah that's right she is going to meet with him and of course there are two topics on the agenda one the concrete steps that need to happen now during this current phase of the hot War if you will um so how do people get the human humanitarian Aid Germany is one of those countries that has been calling for more humanitarian pauses to let Aid deliveries actually get into the Palestinian territories where so many people are threatened with starvation that that is not a situation that is sustainable but of course also now is the time says Bok the German foreign minister to talk about the postwar Gaza situation and what is required to achieve such a situation we heard the report about Anthony blinken her American counterpart Germany and the US do work hand in hand when it comes to trying and brokering peace here in this region Germany says that five things essentially are needed uh to reach this uh sustainable peace and security for the region that um there can be no more terrorism threat from Gaza towards Israel but at the same time also no more reduction of the Palestinian territories especially Gaza no occupation of Gaza and then also there needs to be a strong Palestinian Authority so all these things will be on the agenda um in the Palestinian territories right this isn't Beach's first trip to the region in in recent months as we've mentioned remind us what role Germany has taken as the Israel Hamas War rages Germany feels very strongly affected itself Germany because of its history because of the Nazi past where Germans killed so many Jews 6 million Jews Germany says that Israel does have the right to exist as a state and that any attempt to abolish the state of Israel must of course be counteracted and so Israel Germany says is a country that has the right to defend itself at the same time Germany's also putting pointing the finger at all the humanitarian suffering that is going on and is one of the biggest deliverers of humanitarian Goods into the Palestinian territories but also into countries like Egypt where for example uh young babies are being treated that are coming out from Palestine thanks Nina Chief political correspondent nah has in Jerusalem for
