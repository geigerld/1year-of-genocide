Israel's prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu has canceled a visit to Washington by an Israeli delegation after the United States did not veto a un Security Council resolution demanding a truce between Israel and Hamas the resolution calls for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza for the remainder of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan if passed or it passed 14 to zero after the United States abstained and did not employ its veto power the US previously vetoed three resolutions demanding a ceasefire the council has been divided over the Israel Hamas War since the October 7 Terror attacks on Israel I'm now joined by Rebecca rers in Jerusalem and Stefan Simons in Washington welcome to you both uh first to you Stefan the UN Security Council demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza this is the first time the UN Security Council has called for this yes uh that's true uh there were four resolutions attempts uh which called for a ceasefire on the tale before three were vetoed by the US one was vetoed that was last Friday by China and Russia that was the draft the US put forward now we have it this was a resolution drafted by Chinese and Russian diplomats as well as supported by the block of Arab Nations 22 in the U in at the UN now us diplomats and other diplomats of course at the UN had worked all weekend long to massage to tweet uh tweak the the text which came forward then as a resolution and the US abstained to however the uh US ambassador ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas greenfeld said that she was not and the US is not happy with everything said and how it was spelled out in this revolution but that the US agreed to the fundamentals meaning there must be the US wants also a ceasefire in the United States and more more rapid Aid into Gaza that's why the US abstained uh Rebecca the decision of the UN Security Council came as a surprise to many and Israel has reacted harshly after that decision tell us more yeah we've actually just been hearing from the Israeli ambassador to the UN gillad Eran he's been addressing the the security Council uh He Came Out Swinging condemning the council for not having come out in these last six months to condemn the Hamas attack he was saying that it was double standards that the security Council he used the example of the recent attack in Moscow that the security Council came out immediately to condemn that attack but they haven't done the same in the six months against the Hamas attack he said that this was a disra Grace and that the UN should look at its moral contradiction he then went on to reiterate a statement that the prime minister's office came out with almost immediately after the vote uh that statement saying that that the US's decision not to veto a resolution or any resolution that supports the ceasefire without the release of the hostages uh in fact hurts the war effort and hurts their attempts to get the hostages out the prime ministers of first Benjamin Netanyahu has then almost immediately as soon as the vote was announced cancelled uh a delegation an Israeli delegation that was meant to head to the US today to meet with um American and a US delegation to discuss the ongoing uh operation in Gaza particularly when it comes to Rafa and going forward now we know that the US have been trying to coax Israel away from a major offensive in Rafa and that's something that Israel says they're not willing to do but they were willing to send this delegation that is something that has now been cancelled however the defense minister yav Galant is already in the US and will be meeting with representatives there to discuss that raer operation but yes and definitely some strong reaction here from from Israel what do you think this is going to do Rebecca to relations between Israel and us which are so important in how this war goes ahead in Gaza well Ben this is certainly a blow to the bilateral us Israel relations that have been uh very strong during this war now prior to the war breaking out we did see that relationship uh falter slightly the US Administration under uh President Biden and the Israeli Administration under Benjamin Netanyahu not always seeing eye to eye Visa particularly changes trying being made to the Supreme Court or attempts uh of the Israeli government to do that so we did see some uh friction there already but as soon as uh the Hamas attack on October 7th we saw the US come out in complete support they have been standing side by side with Israel throughout this last nearly six months uh but we have been seeing the US rhetoric change uh in recent days uh days if not weeks we've been starting to see their uh their yeah rhetoric as I say to particularly when it comes to this Rafer this you know planned raffer offensive change they're starting to step away they're trying to urge Israel uh not to go in that direction and they they're seeing friction with uh relationship so we're definitely seeing that further tarnished today with this decision not to veto this Security Council vote and the the the relationship certainly being strained we've seen one failed vote after the next uh this really is a a huge breakthrough of types uh Stefan can you bring us any reaction otherwise from Washington as to this breaking news Well toward us the uh un vote there is no reaction from the White House per se but of course the White House expressed its disappointment that Israel and Benjamin netan canceled the delegation visit to the US however as Rebecca pointed out the Israeli defense minister is here and is going to meet and talk to SEC National Security advisor Sullivan and he is the top dock in National Security here at the White House so this is not a a meeting which shouldn't be underestimated however as Rebecca also pointed out the US um has and President Biden himself has said now very very clearly uh and straight forward that they do not want Israel to go forward with any operation into Rafa uh secretary of state blinkin had to hear this from prime minister Netanyahu uh on Friday uh while the CIA director William Burns was negotiating hostages in Qatar with uh uh through Qatar with Hamas uh so this is what the US is is hoping to focus on now the hostage negotiation they want everybody to support um Hamas to accept the deal uh to release hostages that's important for uh the Biden Administration also politically here inside the United States but uh and Biden has said as much uh there is uh all options are on the table when it comes to what support is on The Chopping Block if Israel goes into Rafa with a uh sustained military operation uh that's not what the Biden Administration wants and uh it looks like as Rebecca hinted at this or said frankly too uh relations are not at their best at the moment having said that it is also prudent to remember that Israel will be as well as you the US will be vice versa always a key Ally to uh each other the US to Israel and Israel uh in this region for the US you heard it from stepan Simons there and Rebecca ridd is our correspondents both from Washington and Jerusalem thank
