talks in Qatar about renewing the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have collapsed Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered his team to return home Hamas which has been designated a terrorist organization by multiple countries has told the media it will not release any more hostages until all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel are released Israel is stepping up air strikes on Southern Gaza which is where it told civilians to flee to during the first phase of the war Relentless strikes on Southern Gaza where many people had sought safety hope for some here is now gone there's nothing left to fear our houses are gone our property is gone our money is gone sons have been martyred some died and some left disabled in the hospital what's left to cry for and then they tell us we'll get Aid where is it this two-month War has seen entire Palestinian families wiped out many people have been displaced multiple times like those in this makeshift camp near a hospital in the city of hunis they say no place is safe with Israeli bombs dropping everywhere so some are ignoring Israel's calls to move further south and are staying put in the first shelling they told us to evacuate to the South because it's safe now they tell us to go further south this is nonsense we're not going anywhere we'll remain here and they can do whatever they please Israel says it has struck hundreds of Hamas targets including what it says were a command center and military compound but it denies claims there are no safe places to evacuate to in Gaza we determin safe areas in Gaza and coordination with International agencies and with our American friends we determine safe areas to where the population knows it can evacuate we did it in the North and we will do it elsewhere and this is important because we have no desire to harm the population there is no sign of another pause in fighting Israel has pulled its negotiator out of the ceasefire talks the deputy leader of Hamas said any further release of hostages would only happen as part of ending the war always good to welcome military Affairs analyst Frank ledd who joins us now he's a senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmouth University and a former UK Military Intelligence officer Frank uh ceasefire talks have stalled Israel is warning people to get out of parts of Southern Gaza fair to assume the next ground offensive is imminent yes good morning Michael certainly and ground operations have been continuing not least of course to uh deal with the continue to deal with the vital tunnel systems in the north of Gaza the uh divisions and brigades are engaged I think pretty much every day and even during the ceasefire there were breaches with combat as for the uh PA in the negotiations we we look at any negotiations be they legal or commercial and of course military like this kidnap kidnapping uh uh negotiations included you're always going to get pauses people walking out threatening what's interesting here is we see now the all for all deal that Hamas has been pushing for for quite a while and I think it's not at all appealing shall we say to the uh to the Israelis we in the media keep referring to the masses of people there and it Bears repeating we're talking about as many as 1.5 million Palestinians who might have to move many of them already displaced how is that even possible let alone keeping them relatively safe well I suspect it isn't possible there are a number of constraints first of all it seems that the instructions that Israel are G giving and you can see these across the media where you are told well go from this Zone to that zone uh or uh move move to this Village are evidently confusing and there's a second issue as well which is rarely spoken of and that's of course the fact that Hamas doesn't want people to move because a Hamas is using these people as human Shields so from the Israeli perspective they are causing evidently causing cusing some confusion perhaps they're trying to do certainly they're trying to do their best I would imagine but also uh Hamas has an interest in keeping people there and of course how long is this going to go on for shifting people around like pieces on a chessboard it uh it doesn't it's not a good look should we say Frank Israel's made their objective clear their aim is to eradicate Hamas full stop do you think as a military strategist that Israel's military strategy is not going to change regardless of how densely populated its targeted areas might be or how much International support it might lose well Michael Israel doesn't have a military strategy yet and they're they're being reminded this fairly constantly by us Pol politicians senior us politicians not least of course uh Mr blinkin himself I no doubt at all that President Biden is on the phone to Netanyahu quite regularly and uh vice president Harris yesterday made it very clear to these ra you will not be conducting you will not we will not permit population transfers ethnic cleansing quite rightly so so there there is no strategy now president macron today said something very interesting I think he's right about he said look militarily speaking if your aim is to kill Hamas physically that's going to take 10 years this was similar to the aim of course well the aim outlined in 1982 when uh Israel invaded Lebanon to destroy the Palestinians in in a way and that started a 20-year conflict president macron's raising an issue I think that's very important here Israel needs not only itself to understand but most importantly needs its allies friends and indeed adversaries to understand what is not the end game here but what track are you trying to get on what is your political objective realistic political objective here how do you want this to look at the end of the military operation they can reduce Hamas to a rump no doubt about that of course it seems that they're they're electing to do so uh using or rather with um extensive civilian casualties uh but what after that and finally of course constantly worth worth mentioning you can't kill an idea and that idea tends to grow when many many people are killed who shouldn't be killed that is a military analyst Frank leadwich as always many thanks Frank thank you
