Israel has suffered its biggest loss of life on a single day since the war in Gaza began 24 soldiers were killed today most in an explosion in the central part of the Gaza Strip the Army says that two buildings mined for demolition collapsed when Hamas militants fired at a nearby tank Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called it a tragedy but has vowed Israel will not stop fighting until absolute Victory is achieved over Hamas which many countries classify as a terror IST organization families and friends of some of the soldiers killed on Monday gather at the national cemetery in Jerusalem to pay their final respects the military says an investigation is underway to determine what caused the highest single day death toll since Israel launched its counter offensive in Gaza initial reports suggest the majority 21 reservists were killed after a rocket propelled grenade fired at an Israeli tank set off a secondary explosion that brought down the buildings they were in it seems that an RPG missile was fired by terrorists at a tank that was guarding the force in parallel there was an explosion of two two-story buildings the structures collapsed as a result of this explosion at a time where most of the soldiers were inside them inside them and near by the buildings likely exploded as a result of Mines that our forces had planted inside in order to destroy the buildings and the terrorist infrastructure in the area the Israeli Prime Minister said it was one of the hardest days for his country since the start of what he called an unjust War we bow our heads to the memory of our fallen and yet we do not for a moment stop striving for an Irreplaceable goal the achievement of absolute Victory together we will fight and together we will win a sentiment echoed by many on the streets of Jerusalem upon hearing the news of the soldiers you know it's our it's our sons it's our brothers it's it's terrible but we got to do we got to do to so that October 7 doesn't happen again it's very sad but I think that you know we are a strong Nation with a strong Army we're not supposed to to to to be down I am sick that we're losing these wonderful young men we need them alive in Israel we didn't want this war we have to fight for Israel but one doesn't have to travel far to find an opposing Viewpoint across the street a crowd is gathered demanding Israel switch tactics in Gaza and reach a deal which would allow the remaining hostages to come home all right let's get the ladies now from our correspondent Rebeca Ritter she's in Jerusalem Rebecca tell us how have people in Israel been reacting to news of the dead soldiers well Brent there's been shock and sadness and even anger as you heard in that report right across the country uh in the single deadli as 24-hour period for soldiers uh since this offensive began uh the president Isaac Herzog said it was an unbearably difficult news to wake up to this morning and and we heard also that prime minister Benjamin Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken out calling it a tragedy but vowing to push on until Victory is achieved still maintaining his line that Victory will be achieved and can be achieved that of course being the complete eradication of Hamas uh we saw mourners Gathering there for the funerals this was as you've been reporting the single deadliest day with 21 people 21 soldiers I should say uh being caught up in one single s Le attack now the uh the military have done a preliminary investigation they found that the soldiers perhaps weren't protected enough they said they would learn uh the lessons from this incident and that even though this was in an area that was pretty much has been taken by the IDF and it's pretty much shed up that it's still very difficult to stop these pockets of humas Fighters coming out and shooting at them and and what do we know what's the latest on the fighting in Gaza well the F the military they say that they've completely surrounded that southern city of hanun now that has been a focal point for some weeks now we know that it is a stronghold of of some key Hamas brigades and that has been a particular Target of the Israeli military as they work their way South now we know that hospitals are coming under um coming under particular Target in the last 24 hours or the last few days even uh the the bombardments are really continuing new near one of the hospitals the AL Amal Hospital uh and the red cresant there the staff that they run that hospital that say they've actually lost contact with staff at the hospital now now another really the biggest hospital that is still functioning in Gaza the NASA hospital is also Under Siege with one doctor writing on Facebook that he was fearing for his life and that the smell of death was everywhere so so hospitals a particular Target at the moment we know that the Israel military say that Hamas use hospitals as command centers as bases for uh to carry out their operations and so they have been a particular Target throughout this offensive Shalom lipner worked for seven consecutive Israeli Prime Ministers between 1990 and 2016 now he's with the Atlantic Council Think Tank I asked him for his reaction to the news of the deaths of so many Israeli soldiers in one day well Israelis are obviously understandably shaken up by the largest single day casualty count since October 7th um in the in the incident where the building collapsed I think in Gaza we're looking at 21 there were a couple more the totals I think they're about 25 um Israel is a small country with a citizen Army I don't think there's anybody here who doesn't know somebody directly affected a family member a neighbor um so there's obviously you know a lot of consternation today I think that um that set there's still pretty much a broad consensus here um that the campaign should continue that obviously you know the events of October 7th should never be allowed to repeat themselves so people are are pretty much determined to continue that um what you have seen on the sidelines I would say that was maybe an exacerbation of pre-existing tensions um concerning maybe the best way to go about pursuing the war objectives sort of the sequencing among them the priorities so you know that tension is is surfacing not so much you know deterring people from continuing but lots of questions about what that might look like moving forward Mr lner I wanted to ask you about uh Benjamin netanyahu's comment that this was one of the most difficult days for Israel and so is this likely to affect Israel's strategy in the war against Hamas well again these are questions that you know they become louder I think after after events like these um there's been this an ongoing discussion between the the nature of the two primary objectives the government has set forth um to you know bring about the defeat of Kamas and to also um when the freed of the the release of the hostage is being held in Gaza government's been arguing that those two goals are that to pursue a deal like that will be if the pressure is is ratcheted up so you know those two things continue um at the same time you know you hear La voices on the other side suggesting that uh that those two goals do not actually coexist very well and that um you know that uh that there should be a sequence to that and that given the fact that the hostages have been you know held in captivity for 100 over 100 days already that that goal should be put ahead of the other one even if it requires you know sort of to put the the pursuit of the campaign in continuing phases onto a back burner so you know that that's certainly on the table as well and that's just another Factor affecting the question of the intensity at which this campaign is being pursued and here's DW correspondent Tanya kma in Jerusalem with more on how the soldiers died yeah it has been described here in the Israeli media as the deadliest day for the Israeli troops fighting in this War uh in Gaza so from reports here um what is being known at this point is that apparently uh currently the uh Israeli Army is clearing what they call structures and and buildings uh along the perimeter on the Israel Gaza border uh to allow at some point uh the Israeli um communities to return back that are living close to the border so they're trying trying to create apparently a buffer uh Zone and were planting mines and explosive there in structures so an RPG from one of the militant groups was apparently shot and uh a one of the structures soldiers were working in uh planting those mines and explosives uh uh exploded uh there talks about a devastating scene there that a SE rescue uh there's on the way so 21 soldiers are confirmed killed in this incident bringing the overall death toll of troops in Gaza to 219 and of course we're seeing all kind of also reactions here from the political level pouring in uh saying that you know this incident uh should be taken that the war on Gaza needs to be uh needs to
