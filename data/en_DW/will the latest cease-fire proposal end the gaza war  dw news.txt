the Hamas militant group says it has accepted an Egyptian Qatari ceasefire proposal to hold the 7-month war with Israel both Israel and Washington say they are reviewing that plan earlier an Israeli official said the proposal was watered down and unacceptable to Israel despite that hamas's announcement prompted immediate celebrations in southern Gaza just hours earlier Israel had ordered tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians Sheltering in the southern city of Rafa to leave and head to a refugee camp ahead of an expected Israeli ground incursion in the last hour the Israeli military said it had begun what it described as targeted strikes against Hamas in the eastern part of Rafa now DW correspondent a Ibrahim joins me from Jerusalem U we getting reports of heavy bombardment in Rafa what do you know well the prime minister's office a short while ago announced that the security uh the war cabinet Parton has unanimously uh voted to continue Israel's operation in uh Rafa and what the Israeli uh military now claims is that it is targeting uh Hamas operatives in in in Rafa and that southern moster most southern part of uh the Gaza Strip uh however Rafa is hugely densely populated at the moment over a million uh Palestinians had fled there uh throughout the course of this war because the southern part of Gaza is of course where Israel had uh urged civilians for a very long time throughout the war virtually since the beginning to evacuate to as it started its operation uh in the north so that's a million people in addition to people that were already living in so as has been the case in this war even though the military will claim that they are targeting militants civilians will uh inevitably be caught in uh the crossfire and this of course comes after there was actually a sense of relief and joy tonight in Rafa and elsewhere throughout the Gaza Strip at news that a a ceasefire proposal had been accepted uh by Hamas uh leadership uh the Israeli uh prime minister has uh said that even though the proposal is not I'm paraphrasing his statement now is not up to what Israel was hoping for that he would still send a delegation to Cairo to exhaust all uh options uh for negotiations and we've also heard some families of some of the hostages that are still believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza H give a statement tonight saying that everyone who said that they' been committed to returning the hostages should now really uh get together and try to make this work as they are of course also desperate to get their loved ones back now talk us to what we do know about the truce proposal that Hamas says it has accepted so it would appear that they would be it is a it is a multi- uh phased uh proposal that would have an initial phase of returning at least some of uh The Host ages Israeli hostages believe to be held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners currently in Israeli jails that there would be an initial period of about 45 days of a truce a humanitarian truce to allow for that exchange but that afterwards uh that um uh uh truce ceasefire would be extended and more uh Israeli hostages would be exchanged as well as uh bodies of the deceased that are still being held by Hamas uh in in Gaza would be returned to Israel followed then by a phase of uh rebuilding and and and re construction but again whatever uh the exact details it would appear that that is not something that the Israeli Prime Minister is willing to accept at this point however as I just mentioned there will be an Israeli delegation going to KIRO so this could also uh uh change the United States has said that they are now studying uh the results of uh this the Hamas response and that they are Consulting with their allies in the region so it appears to be there appears to be movement there and a real commitment at least from the side of the United States to try and reach some kind of agreement Abrahim they're reporting from Jerusalem and from more on the US side of things the W correspondent Benjamin Alvarez grba joins me now from Washington DC Benjamin we've just uh had the reactions from the US what can you tell us that's right Washington is still reviewing this response that he got from Hamas to a ceasefire proposal what the spokesperson of the state department said is that yes as we just heard from our colleague a Ibrahim is discussing with its Partners in the region and he also added that CIA director Bill Burns is in the region working on this but the state department declined to characterize to take a position towards this response that he got from Hamas but it's sad that Washington believes that a hostage deal is in the best interest of both the Israeli and also the Palestinian people State Department spokesperson stressed that a military operation in Rafa right now would dramatically increase the suffering of the Palestinian people and would lead to increase in loss of civilian life and with the reports that we're getting now it remains to be seen how the US will react what we got was a statement also by the Pentagon saying that defense secretary LD Austin had had a talk with his Israeli counterpart saying that Israel needs a credible plan to evacuate civilians and maintain humanitarian Aid and their Washington has not seen details on that yet now President Biden also spoke on the phone with Benjamin Netanyahu to today what do we know about that conversation that's right it was a half an hour call so 30 minutes the White House called it constructive and it also said that President Biden urged prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu against launching offensive in the southern Gaza City of Rafa the National Council Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the President Biden reiterated a clear stance on Rafa but offered no details on what a clear stance would actually look like or if there would be any consequences if Israel goes ahead with a broader attack that might be indeed imminent looking at the pictures that we're getting from Rafa it remains to be seen how Washington will react if Hill would react with actions and not just with a conern statements and words and during a meeting that President Biden held here in Washington with Jordan's King Abdullah he also said that an Israeli attack that's what King Abdullah said it threatens to lead to new and I quote a new Massacre so pressure is increasing on the White House and Senator Bernie Sanders one of President Biden's biggest Critics on its support for Israel tweeted out today saying that President Biden must back his words with action asking him to end all offensive military aid to is Washington correspondent Benjamin AR grber there reporting thank you
