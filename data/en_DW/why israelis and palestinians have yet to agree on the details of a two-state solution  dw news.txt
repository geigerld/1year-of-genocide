Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under pressure to set out a post-war plan for Gaza his political rival Bennie gun has given Netanyahu a June 8th deadline to produce one or he's threatening to quit the government for years a two-state solution for Palestinians has been at the center of Middle East peace efforts but it's been a difficult road map to follow this is Gaza in Ruins after 8 months of War but there are plans to rebuild it the so-called day after when the war ends Israel's biggest Ally the US wants Israelis Palestinians and Regional governments to take steps towards establishing an independent Palestinian State side by side with Israel the two states solution is as old as the state of Israel itself in 1947 the United Nations Drew up a plan for Israeli and Palestinian Nations the territory marked here in red would be Palestinian that in Gray would be Israeli but those plans were rejected by Arab states British occupying forces pulled out in 1948 and Israel was founded triggering a war with its Arab neighbors hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were expelled from their homes the war and its aftermath pushed the founding of any Palestinian State into the future in 1967 another war with its neighbors left a Victorious Israel in control of all the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean the the beginning of its occupation of Palestinian lands starting in the 1990s there was a diplomatic push for a longterm peace deal where Israel would allow a Palestinian state in exchange for security guarantees the proposed state was already much smaller than in 1947 it would include the West Bank East Jerusalem and Gaza but there are many obstacles to establishing even this diminished Palestinian state right now Israel's wartime government led by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in charge of a Nation still in shock after hamas's Terror attacks of October 7th Netanyahu has repeatedly said that an independent Palestine would result in more terror attacks and has vowed to block it then there's the issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank these communities and outposts are illegal under International and Israeli law but receive government protection they take up much of the land that would be part of a Palestinian State other disagreements are also not easy to solve both sides dispute who should control Water Supplies many Palestinians want a right to return to their homes that they lost in 1948 in Israel itself and both sides claim Jerusalem as their Capital but the city is cut off from the rest of the West Bank by a wall of all these obstacles the biggest may be the mood in Israel Netanyahu may be unpopular but public opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to a Palestinian state in the meantime one idea is an International Coalition that would administer Gaza temporarily on route to it becoming part of a Palestinian State along with the West Bank my next guest joined fata the party which controls the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank at the age of just 14 he spent 5 years in an Israeli prison for violence during the first in today he says he sees a way to end the conflict in the Middle East I'm happy to Welcome to the program Palestinian activist Sama Sela Mr singala it's good to have you with us an end to this fighting and peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis how do you propose both sides get to that place well thanks a lot for inviting me uh I think you know we are passing very hard days today the public mood is very much confused there is a cocktail of uh feelings anger uh sadness grieve uh so the public mood is is in a very bad uh position today so but yet when this war will end the Palestinians and is Israelis will realize that there are in this piece of land 7 million Palestinians and 7 million Jews and they are living in the same land and they need to find a way to coexist and I think there is only one way to achieve this goal because apparently the most important issue for the Israelis is to be able to live in a Jewish Democratic State and to achieve this they need to separate from the million of Palestinians so the only option that is practical and this is still applicable is the two step solution if we take this two solution outside what is left on the table what will be left on the table it's is an aparti which nobody is willing to to be there so I think it's in the best interest of the Israelis and in the best interest of the palestin to is to achieve the two- step solution and this is a solution that is endorsed by the the International Community let me ask you Mr singel let me just ask you though you know what the the polls what public opinion is in Israel right now so why do you think Israelis would ever be on board and and you know support the plan that you're supporting this two-state solution what do you think is going to change in in the mindset of Israelis I know Israelis very well I have been in dialogue with the Israelis for the last 30 years and I talk to Israelis is from the left from the center and from from the right and sometimes I tell them I I know you better than you know yourselves because they don't talk to each other I talk to all of them MH let's take the example of uh 1973 the war when Egypt launched the war against Israel the whole public opinion in Israel was anti- Egyptian they hated the Egyptian there was a lot of anger against Egypt and then when Sadat decided to come and have his visit to the keset and addressed the Israelis in a straightforward speech that was calling for co co coexistence that was calling for reconciliation that he offered peace the Israelis all signed in he changed the public opinion in one night this could be happened now also in our case now between the Israelis and Palestinians what we are lacking here is leadership unfortunately we have lack of leadership on both sides I want to ask you about that if we have leaders let me ask you about that in just a second Mr zela about about leadership um but let let's talk about the current War right now would it be in Israel's interest to end this war you know there are calls for a ceasefire would it be in Israel's interest um to end this war if Hamas has not been destroyed well we need to put realistic targets for this war and eight months now and it has been clear that there is no military solution for Hamas Hamas cannot be defeated completely through this war nobody expected that this war will go for eight months and it was clear that the Israelis have used their maximum power in this world and there was full support from the International Community from the Americans the ammunition the the the arms were supported to Israel I mean Israel had everything that it needs military to to defeat Hamas but they couldn't leave they couldn't reach there so you think it's possible done now do you think it do you think it's possible though I mean do you agree with the Israeli government Hamas must be destroyed if if we want to let this war for another 10 years with this number of huge civilian casualties on the Palestinian side yes maybe but I think nobody wants to allow this price I mean Israel has given a chance to achieve military what whatever they can do but I'll tell you how Hamas can be defeated Hamas can be defeated if we stop the war now release the Israeli hostages and start a process of reconstruction and start a process of maybe isolating Gaza from Israel but opening Gaza to the world having a relief having hope for Palestinians 2.3 million Palestinians are now uh very much sensitive from the destruction that Hamas brought upon them they would like to see a way of construction of Hope and they would sign in this is the way that we can let me pick up I want to pick up on that you you're calling for Hamas to release the Israeli hostages you've condemned the attack on Israel October 7th um why hasn't Palestinian Authority president mmud Abbas or any other Palestinian leader for that matter um why haven't they condemned the atrocities of October 7th because I think he has he hasn't the vision of of a leader he hasn't the the capability to understand what was the moment at that time what was his obligation at that time and he did not only maybe disappoint the International Community on on this he keeps disappointing the Palestinian people on a lot of issues this this man was elected for a term of four years on 2005 that ended in 2009 and he continued to self- employ himself until today this man controls completely everything the Executive Branch the legislative branch he he controls the judicary system the media the diplomacy the money he controls everything and he is 90 years old and you can imagine each task of these needs a a team of 30 40 young Palestinians to be able to perform well so he's holding everything in his hands and his per performance is very negative so he is is not capable to do any good job not only to assess what he should be should be doing on the 7th of October or later let's talk about you know if someone were to replace him um considering what has happened in the last eight months it's feasible to think that the Palestinians maybe would choose someone who's even harder on Israel much more radical I mean do you not worry that replacing him would only make the conflict worse I mean many many of the allies of the Palestinians as well as the Israelis consider aboss to be a safe Pair of Hands well this is uh completely this is completely disconnected from the reality the Palestinian people are upset they are not happy from the corruption that Abbas brought upon them in the West Bank and from the destruction that Hamas brought upon them in Gaza most of the Palestinians the majority of Palestinians would like to see an alternative that brings hope and construction an alternative that will be able to work with the Israelis on some kind dynamics that will benefit both the Israelis and Palestinians we need to bring up a strategy from the Palestinian side that puts that puts the Israeli security at its basis from our own interest and then maybe we will persuade the isra Isis to bring up a strategy that will put the human dignity and well-being and National aspiration of the Palestinians at its basis these two strategies can help the Palestinians and Israelis Rec step by step let me ask you before we we've got just about a minute left um is there someone who is an obvious replacement for mudas is there someone that you would recommend there is yes there is a generation of leadership the younger Generations that abas have been blocking them to to participate in in in in leading the Palestinian people including for example Muhammad dlan who lives in Exile now Abbas deported him and Dr Nas he is the strongest candidate to have a unification government that can have the respect of the street and the International Community and also the trust of the Israelis we need to have a candidate like these people who are able to have the trust of the Palestinian people and work in in in in in cooperation with the Israelis and the International Community Mr singel unfortunately we're out of time but I appreciate you taking the time to talk with us and I appreciate you being very forthright and open with us thank you thank you let's get more from Israeli Peace activist gon Basin he's also an author and negotiated with Hamas for the release of Israeli soldier gillad Shalit back in 2011 welcome Mr Basin Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in January flatly rejected the idea of a Palestinian state that means the two-state solution is dead isn't it no the most surprising outcome of this war that we're seeing this horrible war in Gaza is that the two-state solution is back on the table more than perhaps it's ever been before we've been talking about a two-state solution for more than 30 years it is true that in the last years it seemed that it was no longer viable but it's back on the table and increasing numbers of countries around the world which have yet to recognize the state of Palestine or the state of Israel are doing that and this is going to push both Israel and Palestine to the table in a regional framework we we have something else that developed during this war is we saw the creation of a regional defense Alliance that defended Israel on the night that Iran attacked it these are all opening up possibilities for a renewed disc of the two-state solution and turning it into something that is viable you say that the two-state solution is back on the table but is it back on the table of benam in Netanyahu because he is clearly opposed to it and also it appears that the majority of Israelis are also opposed to the plan therefore I ask again based on this it would appear that the two-state solution in Israel is dead right well I I think we should be realistic and look at the fact that public opinion during war time is is slanted it it's not accurate it doesn't really assess what the public may think the day after the war right now people are traumatized both in Israel and in Palestine and with regard to Mr natano Mr natano is history it's just a matter before he's thrown out of office in new elections or in some other way that will happen here because nany is blamed by the majority of Israelis for what led to October 7th and for the mismanagement of the war since October 7th he is a lost most of his base and I think that very few people think that he actually has a chance of coming back to Power after we have new elections in Israel and the people of Israel are demanding new elections minister in his government Benny gun has threatened to walk out of the government by Saturday if his Sixpoint plan for the day after in Gaza isn't approved you are saying that the Netanyahu government will fall if he does so no Natan still has a clear majority in the government even if Gans leaves the government but I think once Gans leaves the government if he does there will be even more massive demonstrations taking place in Israel by the Israeli public calling for an end to this government there are voices within the Hardline Coalition of nany who believe that they will Faire better after elections and they may Bolt the government there's going to be increased International pressure particularly from the United States on the Natan government to accept the plan that the Natan government put out on the table for the return of these ready hostages and a ceasefire and an end to the war as the United States wants and the whole world wants an end to this war so yes I think that the increasing pressure is going to eventually lead to the fall of this government and and this is what we in Israel who believe in peace need to work for let's talk about uh peace and in particular the the two-state solution because uh Benny Gans has also talked about um a a governing alternative for Gaza and you have also suggested in a blog that you wrote for the Times of Israel that it should be the Palestinian Authority will Hamas accept this right I didn't say the Palestinian Authority I actually said members of the opposition to the current Palestinian Authority mainly from the fat party it has to be authorized by president abas but president abas and his authority cannot govern Gaza they can't send anyone to Gaza it needs to be Palestinians who come from Gaza who live in Gaza as well as other Palestinians who are respected and have legitimacy amongst the Palestinians no non-palestinian body can govern Gaza without being looked at by the Palestinian people as another form of occupation so it really has to come from within Palestine they need to determine what kind of peacekeeping force can be brought to to Gaza probably an Arab LED peacekeeping force that will enable and force Israel to withdraw from Gaza Israel cannot remain in Gaza this should be clear clear to everyone after Israel had 18 years experience of fighting Insurgency in Lebanon there is no sustainable solution for Israel to remain in Gaza does this plan assume that there will be no Hamas in Gaza and therefore there will be somebody in Gaza who can represent the Palestinian people in Gaza no Hamas is not disappearing let's be realistic about this Hamas is part of Palestinian Society it is the Palestinian people's challenge how to disarm Hamas how to make Hamas into a legitimate member of the government or the polity I I do not Envision any kind of acceptable government acceptable by the International Community acceptable by the Arab states by Egypt and Jordan and Saudi Arabia and the Emirates and others that would be governed by Hamas Hamas is the voice of yesterday Hamas is a Palestinian problem and the Palestinian people need to determine how to integrate a legitimate Islamic political party into their governance but it cannot be an armed militia within a state which is being called a sovereign state and being recognized as such as a state they have a responsibility and an obligation to international law and to being a just and legitimate member of the community of Nations which means that they cannot have a an armed militia within their borders we'll leave it there for the moment thanks so much for joining us today Israeli Peace activist garan Baskin thank you sir thank you
