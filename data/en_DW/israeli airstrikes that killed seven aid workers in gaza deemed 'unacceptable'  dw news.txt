now to the war in Gaza and world leaders have condemned an Israeli strike on a humanitarian Convoy there that killed its uh killed seven people working for the NGO World Central Kitchen foreign Nationals from Australia Poland the UK and the US are among the victims US President Joe Biden has said he was outraged and heartbroken by the tragedy while Australia slamed the attack as completely unacceptable Israel has blamed the strike on a misidentification and called it a grave mistake Secretary General Antonio gues also condemned the attack and has called for an immediate ceasefire the devastating Israeli air strikes that killed World Central Kitchen Personnel yesterday bring the number of Aid workers killed in this conflict to 196 including more than 175 members of our own un stuff this is unable but it is an inevit able result of the way the war is being conducted DW's Tanya Kramer is covering the story in Jerusalem she told me earlier that it's not clear if International criticism will put further pressure on Israel's prime minister to change his Gaza strategy well I think this is still uh to see because we've heard a lot of this uh International criticism a lot of international pressure on the Israeli cabinet uh to protect or to do more to protect civil Ians given the high death toll in Gaza among the civilian population but that also of course includes humanitarian workers that doing essential work there to bring uh this much needed uh Aid uh to the civilian uh population and uh we heard you know this is this this pressure is not really always reflected uh on the ground and the military efforts there seem uh most of the times uh take a precedent although Israel says it it does enough to protect civilians now un officials here in Jerusalem have said after the incident that uh this is not an isolated incident but it's of course the most serious the most uh tragic one uh but that there needs to be done uh more uh to have a a working mechanism to make it possible to that these convoys can go uh into Gaza and uh deliver the aid that's needed and also that humanitarian Aid workers are uh protected under International humanitarian law now Israel describes the incident as a grave mistake and it's promising a thorough investigation but is that likely to have any consequences Tanya well as always the military then says after such incidents that they're investigating there are investigations underway as to why and how this could have happened but of course it's also uh seen as problematic because it's the military investigating itself so we have to wait and see what are the outcomes of this investigation the military said they will share this then with uh the NOS with World Central Kitchen and other humanitarian actors now what is very important here for humanitarian workers and for Aid workers here is uh that there will be uh a review of the security Arrangements they are saying basically the uh mechanism or deconflict I in mechanism as they call it which means they're coordinating with the military every movement of their convoys of their cars that are moving around in an active combat zone it's a very dangerous environment for them is not a properly working and we've heard from World Central Kitchen they had fully coordinated as they said with the military and as more details emerged there a lot of questions now how this could happen as this was a convoy of three cars one of them at least was clearly marked as World Central Kitchen two of them armored uh as we understand and they were all three are targeted apparently according to reports here by a drone strike so this is very important for the aid workers here so they can continue to do their work Israel is also implicated in the attack in Damascus that killed top Iranian generals Tanya the Pentagon says it believes Israel carried out the air strike how is Israel reacting to all this Tanya well Israel is usually not commenting uh on such strikes but uh again here in the media of course among military analysts it is very much discussed uh as to the implications and the consequences uh of this strike that was uh in the Syrian Capital Damascus uh and we heard from the Iranian supreme leader uh saying that this uh will require punishment now the question here what's being discussed is how will the retaliation look like uh there's a discussion here that this is a you know this Shadow War as it was called between Iran and Israel is coming out of the Shadow and it's a serious seen as a serious escalation and now of course everybody is waiting to see how Iran will uh react to this uh there could be uh you know several possibilities we don't know yet they could you know uh attack a diplomatic overseas um um embassies for example but also more closely here in the region you know its proxies such as the houthis uh from Yemen or Iraqi militias uh or hasah in uh Southern Lebanon could retaliate and that of course is a concern because the Northern Area here the Border region is already uh uh uh on a on very high tensions Tanya thank you very much much that was our correspondent Tanya Kramer in
