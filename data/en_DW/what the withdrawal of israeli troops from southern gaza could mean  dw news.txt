Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that Israel's forces are one step away from Victory the Army says it's pulled all its troops out of Southern Gaza including the city of Kan yunes but the military says that a significant force will continue to operate within the Hamas run Gaza Strip the health authority run by Hamas and Gaza says more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed since the War Began this is can units after months of bombardment displaced residents have been rushing back to their homes after Israel announced most of its troops have been pulled out of the area it's a shock a shock what happened was not small on my way here in the car I saw the destruction it's unbearable I'm going to my house and I know that it is destroyed I'm going to move the rubble so I can get a shirt a bit further north in der Al Bala much needed Aid arrived at schools and shelters for the first time in two months the need for everything from food to medical supplies is urgent according to a agencies the UN says famine is fast approaching many children have suffered from malnutrition as a result of overcrowding there've been respiratory and health problems such as hepatitis all of these things are a result of overcrowding in the Shel shelter because a large number of people left their homes because of the war a war that has now lasted 6 months and with no end in sight Netanyahu has again said there can be no truce without the release of the remaining hostages being held by Hamas addressing his cabinet Netanyahu summed up what he sees as Israel's accomplishments in the war let's have a listen we're marking 6 months of War today the achievements of the war are great we've eliminated 19 out of 24 Hamas Battalion including senior commanders we've killed wounded or captured a significant number of Hamas terrorists we've cleared chifa as well as many other terrorist headquarters we've destroyed rocket manufacturing plants War rooms weapons and ammunition cachets and we continue to systematically destroy the underground were a step away from Victory let's bring in Marina Miron she's an associate professor at Kings College London welcome to DW Marina what do you make of these achievements as Netanyahu calls them over these past six months now good evening Maran um well netanyahu's um assessment is very interesting because these are the metrics by which he judges success however ever as has been shown in the past such as during the Vietnam war so-called counting um enemies casualties doesn't really provide you real metric of success of the operation and what we're seeing right now um with events on the ground and the fact that one battalion will be left in the southern part of Gaza we see that the two aims um destroying Hamas was the first one and releasing the hostages they have still not been achieved and the question is how compatible are those two aims with one another well you know as you say despite the fact that the objective of the Israeli government was the elimination of Hamas is this at all likely at any point in the foreseeable future that will depend on manufacturers and we're seeing Israel as under a lot of international pressure right now especially after the killing of Aid workers in Gaza um a few days ago so the UK and the us both voiced a lot of concerns there are also un Security Council resolutions on the one hand so Israel is contingent on external help in order to continue the fight on the other hand there are threats um coming from Lebanon through Hezbollah Iran has pledged to avenge the death of its um Generals in Damascus so another front could open up so Israel is now focused on Gaza however as we know there are also crossb attacks taking place meaning Israel will have to mobilize more reservists endangering Israel's own economy and then you have the people who are demanding the release of hostages and we don't know how many are alive so there are a lot of political factors and external factors which Israel doesn't control which can determine the course of the operation because after all military a military instrument is subordinate to politics and what Netanyahu will do and what the ceasefire the truce talks in Egypt will show will determine the future course of how this war will continue and as we just reported the Israeli Army says it's pulled out all its troops out of Southern Gaza what do you make of that well from my understanding one Brigade of about thousand to 2,000 soldiers will still be left in southern Gaza in order to control the car Corridor to Northern Gaza the what what what I make of it essentially is that Israel might shift to a more localized strategy meaning that small unit units will be deployed in order to eliminate um Hamas cells but you will not have the same scale of operations as we had before the the other possibility is of course that they are waiting out now regrouping and um hoping that they can resume the operation in Rafa there there may be preparations for some sort of humanitarian Corridor and this time will of course allow for humanitarian Aid to reach the southern part of Gaza but from a purely military perspective the fact that so many Hamas operatives have been destroyed doesn't mean the group has destroyed so this break means that the group can all also regroup and recover which from a military perspective is not ideal from Israel's point of view that was Marina Miron a military analyst and associate professor at Kings College London thank you so much for all of your insights thank you for having me and in the studio I'm now joined by DW Middle East analyst shanie rosanes uh shaie why do you think this is happening now is it because of us uh uh pressure um it was very clear that the Americans did not want to see a ground invasion of Rafa that's true but if you ask Israelis officially then though this has nothing to do with International Community pressure which we've been seeing mounting in last week following the killing of Aid workers in the strip um it could be that they were just using the fact that it's a six month anniversary and trying to make it not connect otherwise not connected to any certain events but sort of make it symbolic but the military has been winding down down operations in the last couple of weeks and they've been saying that they don't have have any need to leave the soldiers exposed you know once they are in Gaza and they're not maneuvering they're not in action um then they're exposed to maybe uh targeted um attacks by Hamas militants they don't want to do that um so for now I mean and IDF the way they try to sell it it's always been part of the plan um it does not mean anything about Rafa because um any action taken in Rafa will have to be taken only after the population has been evicted this is something the Americans are demanding Israel has agreed to that and that will take weeks and weeks uh what does this withdrawal mean for this ceasefire deal that never seems to happen but always so close right yeah that's interesting question because Israel has always you know officially tried to to to say that the only way to get Hamas to get any concessions and agree to anything on the on the negotiations about the hostage deal is through applying military pressure and a lot of it and this is why they've been doing in the last 6 months we've seen over 32,000 Palestinian casualties due to that pressure um and so Israel kind of withdrawing its forces it also means a slow uh withdrawal of that position of of only pressure will be the one bringing any any um breakthrough in the negotiations it could be connected to the fact that now we know we know that the talks are being resumed there's going to be a new delegations going you know in and out of Cairo in the next days maybe we're in a point now uh where most points have already been agreed on and now what's on the table has nothing to do with that it's hard hard to say we really don't know what's happening between closed doors uh in those negotiations and talks I mean it has been six months um how has the view of I mean I know it's a very divided country lots of different opinions but uh how has the country changed in terms of its perspective on the conflict well I think there's a slow understanding that something isn't working you know Nano kept saying in a very confident voice again and again Israel will keep on F fighting until the complete obliteration of Hamas they're far from doing that we've seen racket you know Rockets against Israel this day from from Gaza you know as if six months has not happened so it's clear something isn't working it's clear there need to be a change but it's also clear there's going to be a political backlash from the right uh side of netan who want to see more action and not less military action in Gaza and we will see how it unfolds in the next days tww Middle East analyst shaie rosanes thank you so much you're welcome
