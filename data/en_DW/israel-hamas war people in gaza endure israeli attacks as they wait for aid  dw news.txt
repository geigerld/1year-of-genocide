gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry says more than 4,000 Palestinians have been killed and 13,000 wounded in Israeli strikes Israel has continued it shelling of the territory including the South where it had previously told gazin to go for their own safety Hamas has also fired Rockets into Israel as Palestinians wait for that humanitarian Aid to cross the border from Egypt they are ready and waiting a percentage of these Aid trucks is supposed to be allowed through the Rafa crossing the only Crossing into Gaza not controlled by Israel 20 in all Aid trucks for Gaza there 2 and a half million people that need assistance 20 trucks is a drop in the ocean of need right now in Gaza on the other side of the Raa Crossing there is Mayhem and despair even if Southern Gaza is where Israel told Northern gazans to go for safety's sake heavy air strikes in conun in the South meant the overflowing nasar Hospital took in even more wounded for critical care there's no safety there's nowhere safe in gasa you have to be ready to die and to just stay in your house when there is a threat originating or being conducted against Israel from the south and we will strike absolutely Israel's Army will soon move into the Gaza Strip Israel's defense minister told the troops massing on its border I promise you that whoever sees Gaza now from afar will see it from the inside good luck and Israel ground operation will likely focus at first on the North with Hamas expected to put up Fierce resistance all of that pushing even more gazen Southward in need of food water medical supplies and back on the other side of the Rafa Crossing aid supplies stream into a nearby airport destined to join the backup waiting to get into Southern Gaza for more we can now speak to Frank ledwich he's a senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmouth University and a former UK Military Intelligence officer he joins us from Oxford Tonight Frank good to see you again now since October 7th the Israeli Army has killed several members of Hamas top commanding brass how much of a blow is that for the terror group yes Nicole good evening they killed about six or seven major leaders and operationally I suspect it won't have decisive effect because leaders are always replaceable and we found that ourselves while dealing with the Taliban and indeed the Islamic State no one's Irreplaceable however I think down at the Tactical level the combat level what will be happening is people be asking who can I trust the Israelis seem to be getting some pretty Senior People how are they finding them is it through traitors is it through Tech is it through intercepts So to that extent it' be sewing Discord and uh and cutting away at morale I think but Hamas has been quite open about their commanders getting killed why is that because as you said they presumably risk looking weak it's part of combat They will announce their losses uh with some pride I suspect these become Martyrs and heroes to their cause I don't think that's I think that's fairly normal in these circumstances uh they they'll announce them with pride Hamas has released two hostages today reportedly on humanitarian grounds after qari mediation do you think this is a oneoff or could we be seeing a major breakthrough here I don't think it's a oneoff this would be a strategic negotiating tactic on the one hand and a propaganda uh a propaganda effort on the other it's worth mentioning by the way that uh under Islamic law it's fairly settled that women and children should never be harmed and preferably should not be held as hostages so this release can be used I suppose to establish some kind of legitimacy but but of course that's that's just propaganda What's Happening Here is a negotiating tactic and we'll see I think several more of these releases to remind the world of who they have and what can happen if uh if their if their demands aren't met yeah negotiating tactic to what end because the timing here is interesting isn't it could this be an attempt at staving off Israel's announced ground offensive I don't think so and if it is such an attempt it it's going to fail the I I never I don't think many of us expected the offensive to go off before before now of course they're all the political visits and so forth but in one sense Israel has the upper hand it's got the whip hand the longer it holds off the longer it has time to build up its picture of the battlefield to set up its intelligence framework and its targeting and uh there's nothing I think Hamas can do to to delay that let's talk about the ground offensive that does seem imminent Hamas is hiding in civilian infrastructure in a sophisticated tunnel system while holding all of these Israeli and international hostages over 200 at this point how does the IDF plan on going about this incursion there's a huge amount of assistance they're getting they they they have probably World leading capabilities in hostage identification location and rescue the idea will be to get what what are called Triggers on on and each each hostage there'll be certain groups they will know where certain groups are us intelligence the huge us intelligence um infrastructure is now directed towards this as well and it's I think it's in the open certainly is in the open sources that US Special Forces are on the spot to so the first problem of course is to locate the hostages and the second problem the more serious one I think or even more serious is to get people in and get them out and those efforts will start if they haven't started already very soon and we will see results but sadly it's I think In fairness uh it's a it's a long stretch to hope that they will all get out but all the efforts of Israeli formidable uh Israeli intelligence system plus the US and I suspect the UK Germany France and others are focused on this problem now and that's a pretty formidable array yeah both Hamas and Israel have not been oblivious to what's been happening in Ukraine in the past year and a half how could that influence the current conflict between them considerably both sides have been watching particularly the uh developments in well in two in two two elements first in the air the Drone war will be very intense in in in in in Gaza I suspect uh Israeli soldiers as so before will have to look up they'll be looking up and uh uh watching for strike drones suicide drones and of course for for surveillance the Israelis will be using uh drones and indeed Ai and uh AI directed drones as you see or beginning to see actually in Ukraine as well so there's that aspect too uh Precision uh artillery very important we haven't seen too much of that yet but we will so far we've seen AA air take the uh take the lead in Precision strike but artillery will be a major factor but of course there are elements in in Gaza are totally different not least the uh the nature of the battle it's totally Urban and of course the tunnel systems and the fact that Hamas knows the ground so much better than the IDF how big of a complicating Factor could that be pretty pretty considerable the IDF of course has has mapped every Square centimeter of Gaza over the last 20 years and we'll in in theory know it well but you're quite right that that intimate local knowledge is very important is it decisive no there is another aspect I think which isn't is which is rather unpalatable but it's nonetheless significant Israel soldiers want to survive Hamas uh terrorists are are not interested one way the other and therefore there's that human element which will undoubtedly work to the detriment of many people or the increased casualties and finally of course Hamas have that weapon of uh of the many thousands of human Shields that they are holding not just the hostages but their own people and the political effect uh engendered by their their their their killing yeah and I mean the world has been watching uh in in horror really um to the the deteriorating situation of innocent civilians in Gaza and that is even before this ground offensive has even started how can Hamas I guess as well as the IDF go about accomplishing their goals while respecting International humanitarian law which both Waring parties are obligated to abide by well they may be obligated to abide by it as indeed they are only one side's making the slightest effort to do so we have to draw that bright white line between deliberate killing and inadvertent uh inadvertent killing uh look IDF commanders understand fully the effect of of of the destruction of human life in a situation like this and when people do die you can be sure that whether there's Compassion or not Israeli commanders are are wishing it didn't because they understand the political effect more widely of this and the effect it might have on International particularly locally when I say locally I mean in the region of course from Hamas side the more of their own people that killed from that perspective the better and in one sense Israel's walking into a trap it has no choice there's no no no alternative I think for Israel to do this but uh this this is this is the situation Hamas wanted and it's a situation into which Israelis troops are going to have to to assault Frank let witch thank you so much always great speaking to you thank you Nicole well Julet tumar is director of communications at the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees and she joins us from the Jordanian Capital Aman welcome to DW when do you expect the Rafa border crossing from Egypt to open I don't know actually I really do not know what we do know is that people are in dire need and uh they need humanitarian assistance and supplies needs to need to reach them as soon as possible and The Siege on the Gaza Strip must be lifted unra and other humanitarian agencies have not been able to deliver any humanitarian supplies to people in Gaza in the past two weeks alone what do you what do you understand the hold up to be I I really do not have those details what I do know is that the situation on the ground for people in Gaza including half a million who shelter in anra schools and other facilities is absolutely Terri and this is largely duee to the lack of supplies uh that have been running out for the agency I work with under what can 20 lur loads of Aid achieve in a situation that used to require 100 a day it's a drop in the ocean this is exactly why the UN and Andra included are calling for sustainable humanitarian access and regular humanitarian access so that Aid flows into the Gaza Strip for people in need among them women children old people flows on a regular basis the situation in Gaza was described as catastrophic even before this war broke out is there a difference in the aid that you need to get in now now that there are bombs and missiles to before or is it just more of everything that is needed yeah two million people who live in the Gaza Strip that's uh that's like the population similar to to Brussels as one example imagine if the whole of Brussels is in need of humanitarian Assistance or have been impacted in one shape or another by a war so we need a lot of supplies because people are in need of supplies and they're running out of water that's the most critical part this is why we're asking for fuel because fuel is absolutely critical for the pumping station so that tabs in people's homes can start running with clean water so what's on those lores waiting to get in besides uh Fuel and uh food what else are you trying to get in there uh water Food Supplies that are essential like cleaning supplies um yeah the part of the the deal that that appears to be being struck between Egypt and Israel about this this G this uh this uh Crossing into Gaza is that someone will have to guarantee that um Aid does not get to Hamas it only gets to the Palestinian people will that will that that policing involve uh people uh from the UN or will that be done uh by the someone from uh Israel or or indeed Egypt ra has been on the ground in the Gaza Strip for seven decades now we have been giving supplies and assistance including development assistance like schooling um for people for many many years now we have very strict scrutiny systems in place our own staff 13,000 of them they get screened so we know where the assistance goes and it goes to people who need it most thank you for joining us Juliet tumar director of Palestinian refugees thanks so much Israel is planning to evacuate the city of kirat Mona following days of clashes with Hezbollah Fighters along the border with Lebanon the city is home to 20,000 people and is just 2 kilometers from the border Israeli authorities have been steadily evacuating communities along the northern Frontier and Ido Goldstein have driven up to kot Shimona to pick up their father they're taking him South an out of range of rockets fired across the border by Hezbollah my father is live here in K we take him take take take her to my home and uh try survive and this is why they're leaving siren's whale as a barrage of rockets streaks towards Israel from Lebanon kiat Shimona has already been hit by those Munitions the Army says it's time to go this kind of evacuation allows the IDF to expand its operational freedom to act against the Hezbollah terrorists many residents have in fact already left before the enforced evacuation but they're confident they'll return actually the situation in Israel right now is very difficult like my brother say but you know what we're going to win no one can beat us that's it no one is can beat us this is what all over the world need to understand we're going to fight and fight out residents fleeing the north are now joining tens of thousands of Israelis who have left their homes in the South near
