gazen officials say Israel's air strikes have killed more than 2,300 people uh hamas's Terror attacks claimed the lives of over 1,300 Israelis the United States has sent a second aircraft carrier to the Eastern Mediterranean to support Israel and we know Israel's Communications Minister wants a alzer's local Bureau to be shut down accusing the culture-based news channel of incitement let's get more now on the military situation with Peter Lerner a spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Force welcome um with this major ground offensive looming can you tell us what the IDF strategy is here thank you CLA yes indeed we are currently uh in in in the action of destroying hamas's capability to ever conduct a massacre against our people ever again uh the activities include um air air strikes against hamas's infrastructure as an organization its leaders who orchestrated um and Ma The Mastermind yya sinir who instructed and utilized the whole system of Hamas in order to um conduct this attack and of course the ground terrorists the people that breached the attack breached the fence breached the perimeter and penetrated our um our border just last night we killed alidra a NBA Commando leader of Hamas we killed him um and he's a commander from the hunas area he was actually involved in the attack uh the butchering of people in kibuts Nim so we are very determined to destroy hamas's capability to remove that threat from the people of Israel yeah just to be clear uh Hamas itself has not yet confirmed those deaths I'm curious how concerned the IDF is that here it is walking into a trap that could lead to many more Israeli deaths do not think that a military response here is exactly what Hamas wants that's a very interesting question and actually I'd say that's the first time I've been asked this over the last couple of days you know what are the Alternatives the alternatives are Hamas continue to butcher babies in their bedrooms um our government has instructed the IDF to remove the threat of Hamas to remove them from governing Gaza as a staging ground against our people and that is what we intend to do now we will take the necessary steps in order to uh protect our people and um destroy hamas's cap abilities and I would say they need to be banished um from the realm of this existence we will be fighting in on in the Gaza Strip um up against this extensive tunnel Network that Hamas has and it surely will mean many more deaths for Israelis is this a risk does this make sense as a risk to take so the Israel Defense Forces that is our mission we have to take the necessary steps and as a soldier you do that also the potential of sacrificing yourself for the for the country to defend the civilians you know we um on October 7th we failed the people of Israel um as the our border was penetrated we can't let that happen again and that is why there needs to be a change of system in Gaza and I would say that you know when Hamas penetrated our border and butchered over 1,300 people in their ruthless attack we they they broke the rules of the game and now we are changing the game now the IDF let's turn to the people uh who are living in Gaza the IDF has said it will offer it has offered safe passage for people from the northern part of Gaza to escape from expected Israeli strikes yet we have both the United Nations and Aid groups pleading for you to reverse your evacuation saying that it is not only impossible but it is even a death sentence for the vulnerable how is an evacuation of more than 1 million people under circumstances like this safe and and in compliance with international law absolutely we operate within the realm of the laws of armed conflict our instruction and to the people of Gaza to move South is a humanitarian effort in order to keep them out of Harm's Way it's our action uh to differentiate the terrorists and non-combatants know the people of Gaza they are not our enemy but Hamas that have utilized all of the civilian infrastructure they put drones with explosives on their rooftops of houses they put rockets in the basements of of uh High Fly highrise um uh buildings they utilize command and control positions out of public in infrastructure they do it all out of a sense that they can jeopardize the people of Gaza without having to pay a price now the people of Gaza need to move and they are listening to us I'm very glad that they are listening to us cuz what we've seen over the last few days is Hamas trying to prevent people from evacuating from what is going to be our conflict Zone our ground of operations because they want to prevent us from rooting them out that is our role at the moment you know we've seen them um erect physical barriers you know yesterday it was widely reported I think on uh do as well about the uh about a convoy that was supposedly attacked by the IDF I can tell you now the 0 civilians dead that was that was from Hamas and and again and this was you if you listen to what Hamas is saying you you you're OB obviously being um uh fooled because our investigation uh has come to the conclusion there was no IDF action in that area the images suggest that the explosion Came from Beneath not from above and uh we we intend to expose the images that we have from this incident that actually prove that so I eyt accounts it is not just the claim from Hamas we've heard from eight agencies that there were other Witnesses who claimed to see this I want to come to a point that you've made sorry if you if I may I want to come to a point that you made just earlier um you know the Israeli military is one of the most advanced it's one of the best funded in the world and I'm wondering if you are looking at leveling whole parts of Gaza buildings uh to reach Hamas where while there are civilians present is this a proportionate response to hamas's capabilities our military operations are based on the military necess necessity necessity the proportionality and the the mission itself and absolutely within the realm of the laws of armed conflict there is no goal to flatten Gaza that is absolutely outrageous our goal is to destroy hamas's infrastructure now yes they have located themselves within civili the civilian Arena as I pointed out they have no regard for human life that is exactly what they're doing but they cannot be permitted to do it at the expense of Israeli babies being butchered in their bedrooms but if if Hamas is so embedded among the civilian population how will it be possible to destroy their infrastructure without also leveling Gaza we are targeting their leaders we're targeting their terrorists we're T targeting their command and control positions and yes indeed we're telling this is precisely the reason we're telling people you know you have to head south from um Gaza City to wadii Beyond Wadi Gaza in for your own well-being now this is the current situation unfortunately this was a war that Hamas chose as a strategy it wasn't one freak account of a small group of terrorists that has happened in the past these types of events it was a strategy they penetrated they opened a launched a war on Israel they killed 1,300 people in one day and it must be condemned outright there's no there's no question funerals in Israel taking place today 200 funerals because of their Butchery can never ever happen again allow I cannot imagine the suffering that Israel has gone through and is continuing to go through um with that there's no question but I just want to come back to you in your position with the IDF you can talk to me here about Israel's response not what Hamas has done um and just one one more question to you you know for the people who are heeding your order to go from northern Gaza to the South what guarantees can you make that they are going to be safe there in the South our operations are are primarily targeting Hamas and their activities their leaders from yya sinir The Mastermind of the massacre who has subordinated the entire organization to the needs of terrorism the who has utilized all of the tools of governing Gaza to empower The Butchers of The Butchers of the party near they put the the people that came in and took people out OFA this is some this is the organization that needs to be removed the people of Gaza are not our Target we will do what we can within the realm of the law ofan conflict to limit civilian casualties your report itself you know he told you in your report that you just broadcasted that um he received a text message a military announc that they are coming you need to evacu evacuate evacuate your area in a text message to a Palestinian living in an area I must jump in and just make the case for the people who receive those messages but don't have the means to leave the elderly the sick those who don't have transportation to organize fleeing to an already very densely populated part of Southern Gaza this is the criticism we've been hearing from Aid organizations um I think we can leave it there thank thank you so much that is Peter Lerner the spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces we really appreciate you taking the time to speak with us on DW news thank you CLA and we can speak to DW's senior International correspondent funny farar in Jerusalem for more uh funny the Israeli military today saying that there are 126 people being held hostage in Gaza it's it's almost impossible to imagine what families and Israel are going through not knowing what has happened to these people to their loved ones um what have you been hearing there the fact that these families are going through a very difficult time is really an understatement in fact if you uh listen first of all to the number that you just mentioned they 126 and even that number keeps changing really have you been hearing every any number now here between 100 and 150 since the uh hamus militants attacked Israel on October seven sevens and H killed official number they killed at least one 1,300 people people in Israel and abducted more than 100 people and the question really is what is happening to them in fact the people who took to the street yesterday in Tel Aviv protesting because they say they want to make sure that of course they will see their relatives alive and there have a lot of mixed voices Within These protest people who say there has to be a very strong response by Israel but then also their relatives who say no it cannot be that there's a strong response in the sense that is's a ground offensive because they are concerned for their relatives that they will be killed as well because one has to imagine uh the hideouts of uh the militants the Hamas militants in Gaza is uh not just a vast Labyrinth Ong ground but also there they are hiding in in in in residential buildings so it's it's not as black and white as it may appear militarily that uh the Israeli military goes in and can really localize to say so the ham militants without uh causing casualties in fact that's also the concern not just by human rights organizations but pretty much everyone who has followed the history the Gaza Wars previous Gaza wars in the past just pointing out there the Gaza war in in 2014 the last major ground offensive by Israeli forces back then more than 2,000 people have been killed in uh Gaza Strip most of them the Palestinians so with that in mind uh people are increasingly worried just what is happening to to their relatives whether there will be any negotiation but with whom exactly Israel does not want to uh negotiate with the terrorist organization so who can play that part to somehow make sure that those people who are going through hell right now have a way uh to get out safely and and and return uh uh to Israel so concerns for people in Gaza concerns for the hostages can you tell us more about what people there in Jerusalem are making of Israel's expected ground offensive into Gaza and what this will mean for them there are a lot of questions here actually when it comes to that uh ground offensive and everybody's speaking about this really uh for days now first of when is it going to happen and what once it starts how long it's going to last what will it mean uh for the Palestinian people in Gaza Strip who have been ordered to leave from the northern part of of uh of Gaza Strip to the South how is that even possible to do so uh without any humanitarian consequences uh the UN has very much criticized Israel for that order uh it's impossible to carry it out without any casualties they say and at the same time once again they're very very mixed reactions in Israel when it comes to this question really what is the answer uh to uh uh to to to the terror attack and the the massive casualties here in Israel uh more than a week ago when this um attack was carried out what should the Israeli government do even though people are very much United here in Israel when it comes to their sorrow and also uh just simply um they do not understand how was it even possible that the Hamas militants could strike why wasn't Israeli government protecting them so there's a mix of people are angry but there's also a a a this feeling of there must be some sort of Revenge while at the same time people are also raising the question with regard to the moral responsibility of Israel towards the Palestinian people why they have to pay the price is a question getting very often lately why the Palestinian people in Gaza Strip are the ones who are going to pay the price for the action that was carried out by hamus militants funny thank you so much for sharing some insights from your reporting that is funny forar in Jerusalem for us and Israeli officials say a missile strike from Southern Lebanon has killed at least one civilian in Northern Israel Pro Iranian Hezbollah militants have claimed responsibility for the strikes the Israeli military said it responded with artill fire and also announced the closure of the area near the border crossb fire has intensified since last Sunday authorities say more than 10 people in Lebanon and at least two in Israel have been
