welcome to the program I'm Jared Reed Gaza has started vaccinating children against polio a day before a massive vaccine campaign is expected to begin this comes after Gaza recorded its first case of polio in over two decades a hospital in Han unus began administering the first dose of the two dose vaccine even though the world health or health organization's campaign officially begins on Sunday the who plans to administer the vaccine to more than 600,000 children the war has disrupted routine vaccinations and destroyed medical facilities allowing the return of the highly infectious and deadly disease Sam Rose is in Gaza with the agency for Palestinian refugees known as anra he has more on the challenges that lie ahead it's certainly going to be extremely challenging we as as as a system as a humanitarian system and I think it's probably fair to say as a health system have never faced any anything quite like this I should say that unra is a big player in this we estimate that we'll be administering around half of all those vaccines so reaching over 300,000 people but it really is a joint effort LED globally by the World Health Organization UNICEF also heavily involved unra my organization involved in administering a lot of the vaccines and and the Ministry of Health as well the local Ministry of Health and without all those different entities working together it wouldn't have been possible to get as close as we are to the start now and we're really just hoping that we will get over the Finish Line with these vaccines over the next uh couple of weeks in in what you've already said will be a very complex a very fraught effort similar to everything that we've had to do over the past 10 11 months in GDA nothing has been easy but this one in particular is is is particularly challenging given the situation but also given the consequences and the need to get it right could you spell out some of these challenges in what is as you've described at an absolutely enormous uh undertaking absolutely I mean the challenges have started from getting the vaccines in getting the Cal chain in as well the the the fridges uh the storage equipment to allow the vaccines to be moved around negotiating supplies of fuel so that those vaccines can be transported to distribution centers then on on to health points the the humanitarian pauses and the agreement to uh avoid evacuation orders over the period of the uh the campaign as well we very much welcome that we recognize it it's not been easy and we call on parties to the conflict to adhere to those agreements and beyond that just the the mechanics of of reaching the the the people uh wherever they are we estimate 640,000 children need to receive the vaccine that's everybody under the age of 10 in Gaza we don't know precisely how many uh how many children there are given the situation the tens of thousands killed overall and the many tens of thousands more underneath the rubble so the basics of it that we would normally take for granted are are extremely difficult and then it's reaching the people normally when we run a campaign like this the children the parents would bring their children to our health clinics this is what would normally happen and this is why before the war unra had a 99% coverage of vaccinations uh through our health clinics a lot of those health clinics are no longer operational and and the people aren't where they would normally be so we have some fixed points we've set up some health points in shelters where many hundreds of thousands are are Sheltering and we'll also have mobile mobile teams who will Who will go tent to tent to administer vaccines and there'll be separate teams looking at people and trying to capture people on the streets and and it's more complicated by the fact that we're not able to do this uniformly in the same time across the whole of Gaza there'll be four days in the middle of the Gaza street we will then move South and then after that we we will move north and of course we've got to do the whole thing again in four weeks because every child needs two doses of the vaccine that was Sam Rose for from the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees speaking to us from Central Gaza thank you so much much Sam for your time
