a spokesman for the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says an Israeli tank is now stationed outside the city's biggest Hospital the alifa hospital says it's not accepting any new patients after running out of fuel to power its generators the Israeli military says it will allow what it calls a self- evacuation corridor from the facility on Monday which would enable people to seek safety in southern Gaza the World Health Organization says thousands of people are trapped inside stitching up a head wound by the light of a mobile phone doctors in hospitals in Northern Gaza are struggling to save patients here too at the alifa hospital they're running out of fuel water and medical supplies and are vulnerable to the ongoing Israeli air strikes in the area Hospital under under fires the last example is chifa Hospital ICU there is another Private obric Hospital was targeted directly today and two of our colleague who are specialist in obric and Gynecology were killed tonight there is no service for Pediatric patients in the Northern Area Israel denies targeting civilians and says that this footage is proof that its military provided the alifa hospital with 300 L of fuel for its generators but that it was rejected by Hamas we offered actually uh last night to give them enough fuel to operate the hospital operate the incubators and so on because we have we have obviously no battle with patients or with civilians at all uh and I think every civilian death every dead baby is a tragedy but that tragedy should be placed squarely at the responsibility of Hamas that is keeping its military installations inside hospitals it's command posts inside hospitals inside schools inside unra un facilities and so on the director of alifa has denied rejecting the fuel which he says would not have been enough to power the hospital's generators for even one hour the worsening situation in Northern Gaza is forcing thousands to flee southwards mostly on foot even some health workers have made the decision to leave the situation last night was very tense very extreme the bombing targeted schools and hospitals I work for the office of the Ministry of Health at the hospital yesterday the Israeli Army bombed the hospital where I work that's why today I did not go to work or fulfill my duties and I fled tens of thousands have already fled the ongoing missile strikes and ground operation Israel is coming under increasing International pressure to minimize civilian suffering in Gaza well Toby fra is from UNICEF and joins us from Aman in Jordan Palestinian officials say power outages are threatening the lives of premature babies in particular some of them can't survive without incubators what are you hearing yeah I mean the reports from alifa in particular but also other hospitals across uh Northern Gaza Strip are um you know are disastrous when you seeing premature babies uh who rely on incubators who rely on oxygen you know they need power um it's really catastrophic situation and um you know we have a situation where half of the medical facilities half the hospitals inside Gaza are now not functioning and and that's bad at any time in peace time yell alone when you have a crisis like this where you're have also taking in massive numbers of injured people injured children what about um the claims from Israel's military uh which says it's been helping evacuate some patients mostly kids from alifa hospital are you able to confirm that well I mean evacuations of hospitals uh at any time are incredibly difficult and Incredibly dangerous um particularly for very vulnerable patients like you know like newborns um and other children other civilians who are on dialysis for example so evacuating uh hospitals is almost impossible to do that safely at a time when the hostilities are still so intense inside the G strip um so this is a you huge concern just to be able to bring people out is so so difficult if there's a safe passage and if the doctors are able to to manage that uh then maybe there is a way but right now the situation is far too acute and dangerous for that to happen well Toby what is the way because at the moment things aren't going to change uh according to Israel until uh all hostages are releases are released from the Gaza Strip so what what can be done to help these kids in Gaza well I mean there's a simple way and and that is to have a ceasefire you know to have a humanitarian ceasefire which will stop children being killed stop uh children being injured and at the same time said that's not going to happen until Israel uh sees those hostages release I was just going to say at the same time is for the immediate release and unconditional and safe release of all the Israeli children civilians and children especially uh who have been abducted which is a great violation um and and so those conditions are absolutely vital that both those are achieved um for the sake of every child but at the same time then we also need to scale up massively this life saving support to help children civilians who are in the shelters who are all over the Gip displaced as well CU at the moment we just keep going in circles don't we uh and and this war has been going on for for a month now yeah you're right I mean day in day out we we're saying the same thing and um and and it's not getting any better um it's getting worse if anything um and that's what's so tragic is that we're not able to to secure you know any uh conditions that can improve the lives and better protect children and that's up to the parties of the conflict you know as UNICEF as a humanitarian agency we're here to advocate for the protection of we're here here to support them and do whatever we can to provide life- saving assistance but this is up to the parties to the conflict this is up to to others who can help to influence that and and we do our advocacy and we'll keep doing that until children are better protected UNICEF stby frer there for us joining us from Aman in Jordan thank you very much for the insights
