short while ago I spoke with our correspondent Ben fulan in Jerusalem I asked him what Israel has been saying about the strike in the middle of that crowded jabalia refugee camp Terry Israel is justifying this by saying that it has knocked out one of the key Hamas commanders uh the commander who is said to have prepared and also executed the October 7 attacks uh hamus denies that any uh senior official was in the camp at the time of this air strike uh it also justifies this by saying that dozens of combatants were killed in the same tunnels that collapsed under the air strikes um the IDF uh gave out that statement earlier um saying that many reports of Civilian deaths were a result of this attack now we're not getting exact numbers from them the numbers we're getting from the Palestinian health Ministry in the control Gaza Strip is uh somewhere around 50 Palestinians they don't uh usually um say whether or not these are civilians or combatants in this case uh 150 wounded humus itself interestingly enough is saying 400 Dead uh so huge discrepancies here and you can really tell um for the first time when we had this Hospital blast uh just recently the Al Ali Hospital uh there were real doubts about whether or not the health Ministry in controlled Gaza was giving accurate numbers because they came out so quickly after the attack um in past conflicts they have been known to line up with Israeli estimates um in this case today what we're hearing is a huge discrepancy between Hamas and the health Ministry in Gaza um and what this is all really showing is that this is becoming an information War and that was DW's Ben fulan in Jerusalem now the Israeli military is pushing deeper into Gaza they say they've destroyed hundreds of militant Targets in recent days and are also engaged in Fierce hand-to-hand combat with Hamas the Israel Defense Forces released footage they say shows its ground troops operating inside the Gaza Strip while the IDF doesn't reveal the location of its forces locals report seeing tanks in Gaza City and on the road between between the North and South of The Enclave the Israeli Army reports killing dozens of Hamas militants in Fierce Close Quarters combat with some of the fighting taking place inside the vast tunnel complex where Hamas is believed to be holding 240 hostages rescuing the hostages is one of Israel's stated objectives in Gaza the other is to wipe out Hamas on the ground and from the skies this video also from the IDF proport reportedly shows the air strike that killed a senior Hamas Commander said to be involved in directing the October 7 attacks Israel claims its air strikes are targeting militants and Military infrastructure the Hamas run Health Ministry of Gaza says the attacks have killed over 8,000 civilians the high death toll has led to international calls for a ceasefire calls that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed he says Israel's forces will not stop until Hamas is no longer able to govern Gaza or threaten Israel again let's bring in Frank ledwich here he's a senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmouth University and a former UK Military Intelligence officer he joins us from Oxford Frank I want to first ask you about that strike by the Israeli military on a Target in the jalila uh refugee camp what do you make of that given the high number of casualties uh what do you make of of Israel's justification for that strike Frank well good morning Terry there's no doubt at all that this was a high value Target and as such serious consideration will have been given and deliberate consideration to whether the Damage Done to Hamas would be justified by the uh excess it would be excessive Damage Done to civilians would be excessive in relation to the military Target and as I said this was a high value Target so this would have been deliberately considered it's also worth bearing in mind of course as he is say that civilian casualties are are a natural and predictable consequence as they would say and I think they're right of of hamas's strategy so the question to be asked is is is the Damage Done to civilians excessive and that is something I think which we don't yet know particularly in view of what Ben said concerning the varying casualty estimates now many countries Frank as you know expressed their outrage at the cost to civilian lives in Gaza as Israel continues its campaign to wipe out Hamas uh could that outrage not translate into an even bigger security risk for Israel in the short and long term I I think it could it was pointed out I think by several people many people at the outset of these operations and indeed on the 7th of October and shortly afterwards that Israel may be walking into a trap they would say it's a trap into which they have to walk and trap Ben put his finger on it before is connected very closely with this information war that is going on and Israeli commanders are more than cognizant of that I've no doubt at all there's a lot of pressure from them from their own political leaders and on netanyahu's war cabinet there's a huge amount of pressure coming down from the US that will filter down to the operational level because and the message will be every Palestinian civilian you kill is a strike against us and that all plays into this information War but Israel has little choice they would say we have to walk into this political trap we have to understand that civilians are a weapon of Hamas and we have to act accordingly one would question what their choice is uh and then we can get into discussions of ceas fires that out with out with this but all this is part of an information War it's an information trap essentially into which Israel has to walk Gaza has again been plunged into a Communications and internet blackout Frank do you know if that's been instigated by Israel to support its strategic objectives or is that just a consequence of the destroyed infrastructure well tell the answer to your questions I don't know I'm not sure anyone does however it would be natural proper and normal for Israel to try and cut the connective tissues of its enemy Russian said that to ukrainians ukrainians would love to do it to the Russians Communications are what holds holds a cohesive unit together and cyber Communications or internet communications of course are one key element Hamas will have others they'll have redundancy in the tunnels they'll have telephones they'll have radios even which also be attacked I think by Israeli electronic counter measures but I would suspect this is a deliberate uh cyber uh cyber assault by by the Israelis to remove that or at least to damage that connective tissue but I don't know it may be a natural consequence of the damage being done Frank thank you very much that was military analyst Frank ledridge in Oxford thank you Terry and here's a look at some other developments in the Israel Hamas War uh US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin plans to visit Israel on Friday for talks blinkin also plans to make other stops in the region Israel's military says nine soldiers were killed in combat operations in Gaza on Tuesday bringing the total number of Israeli troops killed since October 7th to 326 and Jordan's King abdull has called on the US to support an immediate humanitarian ceasefire that would allow Aid convoys to flow into
