US President Joe Biden has endorsed what he calls an Israeli proposal for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza the plan would unfold in three phases and assure a permanent ceasefire the return of Israeli hostages and the Reconstruction of Gaza Hamas has released a statement saying it views The Proposal positively the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said it still wants to see the destruction of hamas's military and governing ability here's Biden speaking from the White House this is truly a decisive moment Israel's made their proposal Hamas says it wants to cease fire this deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it Hamas needs to take the deal I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely some some are even in the government Coalition I ask you to take a step back and think what will happen if this moment is lost we can't lose this moment it's time to begin this new stage for the hostages to come home for Israel to be secure for the suffering to stop it's time for this war to end over to Benjamin Alvarez grber in Washington Benjamin tell us more about what's in this plan that Biden has just announced so president Biden laid out what he described as a three-phase proposal for a ceasefire the first phase involves a six- we ceasefire when Israel forces would withdraw from what he called were all populated areas of Gaza some hostages would be freed in exchange for some Palestinian prisoners and Palestinian civilians would return also trucks of humanitarian Aid would be allowed into Gaza in the second phase then Hamas and Israel would negotiate terms of a permanent end two hostilities in the third phase will then include a reconstruction plan for Gaza what President Biden said is that this was a proposal that was transmitted by Qatar to Hamas and what we heard that they would be open and well also willing and accepting and saying that they look further to also going in that direction Benyamin Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said that he won't stop until Hamas is completely destroyed he's resisted calls even from the US for a ceasefire up to this point what has changed that's right and it's also interesting that it's the president of the United States and not the prime minister of Israel that presents this Israeli proposal because just recently Israel said that it would not end the war in exchange for the hostages and looking into the reactions and looking what the office of the Prime Minister of Israel also said to this proposal and a quote that it would also enable Israel to continue the war until all its objectives are achieved and that of course sounds quite different to what President Biden said when he mentioned that this is the time for this war to end and called on the Israeli leadership to resist pressure from those in Israel who were pushing for this war to go on and go on President Biden almost implored Israelis to not miss the chance for a ceasefire and it's not just the Israelis who have resisted calls for a ceas of the Israeli government is we just need to remember the US vetoing resolutions in the UN secure Council calling for humanitarian Poes to deliver 82 millions in in Gaza yeah the war in Gaza a tragedy on every side but also a thorn in the side for this white house as the election approaches what are the stakes for Biden in this proposal there's a lot of stakes for Biden and why it's important also for him to find this proposal and to push forward we have seen pressure on the streets many protests rallies we have seen that all also on us college campuses across the country but also increasing pressure from within the Biden Administration to pressure a Washington to change its position on the war in Gaza only on Thursday a two more us officials resigned over the Biden's Administration position on the war in Gaza the officials accus the administration of not telling the truth about what they said was Israel's obstruction of Aid to Palestinians in Gaza and this is also about The credibility that the White House has and just to mention two things on one side we have all seen those pictures of this $320 million expensive peer that the US constructed in Gaza and that broke apart and on the other side also this announcement that a major offensive in Rafa by the Israeli Defense Forces would be Biden's red line with many wondering what he meant by a mayor offensive is Israel confirmed that its forces are in Central Rafa and are expanding this offensive in the southern Gaza City all right DW correspondent Benjamin Alvarez Gruber thank you very much all right we want to go now to our correspondent Tanya Kramer she's in Jerusalem T you good to see you so tell us more about this plan the US President says that the plan was presented by Israel right that's right we understand it was given actually to the mediators Qatar and Egypt and also to Hamas earlier this week and this proposal is something similar that we've uh been uh hearing uh weeks earlier but those talks have broken down about three weeks ago so this new proposal that is now uh on the table would see a uh uh a deal in three phases now the first phase would uh would last about six weeks it would include a full uh and complete uh ceasefire temporary ceasefire in that uh regard a withdrawal from fora from all populated areas and the release of a number uh of hostages including uh women and uh elderly and the wounded in exchange for as he said hundreds of Palestinian prisoners now what is significant here is then when it would go into the second phase during the first phase Hamas and Israel would then indirectly then continue to negotiate to come to this second phase and that phase would last as long as they negotiate and then to attain uh what was described as a uh a ceasefire that a cessation of hostilities permanently and also this second phase then would include the release uh of um hostages of male uh soldiers and other hostages living hostages and that would then continue into a phase three which was mainly see the Reconstruction of Gaza now of course the the ball is now in hamas's court because their St had also hardened in recent weeks especially now with the offensive in going on and they had always called for a complete cessation of hostilities to actually go into such a deal but now of course both sides have to come back to the negotiation table they have to decide uh to come back and Hammer out the details of such a deal so this proposal then it looks like a a road map to to a a version of peace that includes bringing the the Israeli hostages home how do you think that this is going to sit with Israelis well I think first of all I think for the families and relatives of those remaining hostages this is a good news because if you just heard just yesterday the National Security advisor uh saying that uh the war could carry on until at least the end of the year and many here were asking you know what does that mean for any deal but uh the US President Joe Biden he also had a message to the Israeli government and also to Israelis saying you have to put pressure on your leaders because he also said that he knows that there is there are some in the cabinet that don't want to see an end to the war that don't want to see uh Israel coming uh to a deal and that there has to be made a decision to be made and that uh this is very important at this stage also saying that basically Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another October 7th attack and that they their capabilities have been degraded um meaning basically that Israelis can go forward now and end this war tw's Tanya Kramer with the latest tonight from Jerusalem Tanya thank you
