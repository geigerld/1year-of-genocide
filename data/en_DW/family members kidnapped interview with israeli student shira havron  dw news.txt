days after deadly attacks by Hamas many Israelis are still left wondering about the whereabouts and well-being of their relatives I'm joined Now by Shir havron who has a dozen family members who you believe to have been kidnapped and being held hostage she wrote welcome to DW can you tell us what you know about your relatives so far yeah um so basically on Saturday morning we got the news that the kibuts was raided byas and we lost contact with 11 of our family members that hid in their shelters um and since then haven't heard anything maybe seen just a bit someone of the family members in a video but lost contact and we got two pieces of information that led us to believe that their houses were burned down and were empty so now we believe that they're in the Gaza Strip hopefully alive how do you feel so many family members so little information I never thought I would be in this situation it feels very surreal and really hard to grasp this new reality it's probably half of my family from My Father's Side people who are I grow grew up in their houses with their kids um it's hard to communicate this and be in touch with my feelings because it takes a lot of strength to tell the story for my cousins who might be orphans for the the young kids who were kidnapped who are eight and 3 years old my cousin's kids it's very hard to put it in words just I can just say that I I really don't wish it to anyone to be in this situation yeah thank you for trying to put it into words for us and you've also been putting it into words here at the European Parliament we're in Brussels you want to put those words into actions what would you what's your ask what's your request of parliamentarians and the European Union in general we ask the people here um to act and put pressure upon our government to um um arrange some kind of a deal where in which the the the people in captivity will return to their homes as soon as possible because time time is the clock is every minute we stand here talking is time where injured people might be dying my family may may be dying and before the war gets will move on and people will forget about those people who are there and bombed and and destroy everything we want them back and we ask people here to put a pressure talk talk to whoever they need to talk act and and activate their their effect in our region and help us get out of this situation um this is what we're asking for Shir you said you would like to put pressure on your government so you are Israeli you were traveling here in Europe when you got this Dreadful news there's also a lot of anger toward the Israeli government is that how you feel of course it's very complicated relationship with the government in my country it's a very complicated place to live in we are people who support peace and equality and rights for All Humans no matter who they are and what's their religion or origion or anything so we feel abandoned right now and the fact that we are here is is a desperate act to ask for more help to to solve the situation because our government is is is is busy with stuff that are not my family right now and I want my family back this is what I want it has never been this personal it has never been this this size of catastroph me catastrophe for me personally and obviously it's it's very hard feelings to to ask people who are not my government for help even though it's also their responsibility but the fact that it's so desperate and the time has passed it's been 96 hours and nothing has been done we can't hear from them we can't see them and it's not just me I'm just a representative of my family you said you wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone we both know the most likely outcome here is that there will be more innocent Bloodshed particularly in Gaza among Palestinians how do you feel about that as I said I grew up on values of equality and Humanity for everyone and it's the same it's never changed it's the same here even though my family 11 members of my family half of my family are missing my heart are is with with the all with the other families who suffer from the same situations isra and Palestinians obviously it has always been this way for me this is the only way to live I was born in Israel I'm an Israeli by birth this is my family this is where I grew up in but I care for other people I want this to stop I want the stopping in Israel to stop and I want the bombing in Gaza to stop I want everyone to live in peace this is a very large request right now so right now I'm taking care of my family but once it's done and hopefully the result will be them coming back to us alive each and every one of them young kids grandfathers parents three generations that are missing once it's done I I just want everything to end I want everyone to live in peace I want families kids from here from Gaza from the West Bank all over the world to feel safe this is the basic human right this is a very important message I just everyone suffers because of it everyone it's not one-sided and people have to remember this even in this situation in the hardest time this is the time to remember it Shar havon thank you so much for speaking to DW and and sharing your story with
