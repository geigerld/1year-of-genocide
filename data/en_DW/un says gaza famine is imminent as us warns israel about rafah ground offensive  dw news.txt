well un back report has issued a dire warning for Gaza half of gazans are experiencing catastrophic hunger and famine and famine is imminent unless there's urgent intervention now the warning comes as Israel faces increasing pressure from its allies to allow more Aid into the territory huge crowds of gazin gathered to receive Aid at this shelter run by the United Nations Agency for Palestinian refugees amid an increasing hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip where AID has only been trickling in since the beginning of the war people are dying we are asking the Arab people to press for a ceasefire in Gaza we are exhausted and dying the United Nations has published its latest report warning that Gaza is on the brink of famine the UN humanitarian coordinator in Gaza says that he's working with Israel to open up more land routes for a shipments as soon as the goods come in the 200 trucks a day or whatever the case may be it's not enough to satisfy the the numbers that we have to address and so as soon as goods come in they don't get stored anywhere very for very long unless we can put significant Supply increases into those areas those people who are at catastrophic levels of uh malnutrition or food insecurity will uh face real serious problems the eu's top Diplomat Joseph Burell believes Israel is using famine as a weapon of war in Gaza we are no longer on the brink of famine we are in a state of amine affecting thousand of people we cannot stand by and watch Palestinian star what are we going to do because this is this forine is not a natural disaster it's not a flood it's not a earthquake is entirely man-made by whom that's there to say it by whom while an aid shipment arrived in Gaza from Cyprus and some countries of sponsored airdrops Aid agencies say that this is nowhere near enough and cannot replace the aid delivered via land Crossings where dozens of humanitarian Aid trucks await permission to reach people in Gaza well US President Joe Biden has asked Israel to send a delegation to Washington to discuss Israel's plans for a ground offensive on Rafa in southern Gaza Biden has warned prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu that an assault on Rafa would be a mistake roughly 1.5 million people are Sheltering there here's US National Security adviser Jake Sullivan our position is that Hamas should not be allowed to save Haven in Rafa or anywhere else but a major ground operation there would be a mistake it would lead to more innocent civilian deaths worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis deepen the Anarchy in Gaza and further isolate Israel internationally more importantly the key goals Israel wants to achieve in Rafa can be done by other means on the call today President Biden asked the prime minister to send a senior inter agency team composed of military intelligence and humanitarian officials to Washington in the coming days to hear us concerns about Israel's current Rafa planning and to lay out an alternative approach that would Target key Hamas elements in Rafa and secure the Egypt Gaza border without a major ground Invasion I'd like to welcome Gerald firestein he's a former US ambassador and once served as Deputy Consul General in Jerusalem he is senior vice president of the Middle East Institute Ambassador welcome to DW Joe Biden has asked Benjamin Netanyahu to send officials to Washington over his plans for a ground offensive in Rafa at the same time that Netanyahu really appears to be doubling down on these plans how much pressure do you expect the US to put on Netanyahu here uh it's a pleasure to be with you this evening and I I think that that clearly the administration is extremely concerned about the potential uh humanitarian catastrophe if the Israelis follow through on their threats to go in uh to Rafa they've been signaling consistently for weeks now uh that they don't believe that the Israelis have put in place uh the means to protect the civilian population there uh and to uh to Target Hamas operatives that are still in the Rafa area uh and until they uh do that until there's some clear understanding between Washington and Jerusalem about how to go forward I think that we're going to see the administration continuing uh to emphasize the risks uh and there is an increasing view particularly among uh Democratic members of Congress uh that uh that the U uh that the US Administration needs to be more explicit in telling Israel to stand back let's talk about that the US is pushing for what's being described as an alternative approach and you're saying it will probably be more explicit what do you think this alternative approach could mean well I think that as as we heard from uh from Jake Sullivan uh the alternative approach would be not a major ground offensive interfa uh but something more targeted more uh more precise in trying to identify uh where Hamas leadership may be hiding uh and to uh and to use other kinds of military means to achieve those targets uh without threatening the security of the civilian population Ambassador as someone with many years of diplomatic experience particularly in the Middle East I'd like to ask you what do you make of where things stand right now in this conflict well I think that uh that increasingly there is a great deal of frustration over the failure of diplomacy to achieve even a limited ceasefire uh we uh have seen that there's going to be another Israeli delegation going uh to continue the the negotiations uh but but the administration I think is very frustrated that they haven't been able to uh impress on either the Israelis or Hamas uh the need to take steps now uh that would address the humanitarian crisis and bring this fighting to a Hal and I think that again as the uh the days of the weeks go by the pressure on the Biden Administration to do something more uh to bring this conflict to an end is only going to increase that was former US ambassador Gerald firin Ambassador thank you very much for your time and your insights today it's a pleasure
