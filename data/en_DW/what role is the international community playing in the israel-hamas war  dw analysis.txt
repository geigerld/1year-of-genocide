German Chancellor Olaf Schultz has become the first major world leader to visit Israel since hamas's deadly attacks in a joint press conference with Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Chancellor Schultz warned Regional Powers not to get involved militarily in the conflict saying the war must not escalate and spread throughout the Middle East the chancellor also stressed what he called Germany's special responsibility to support Israel following the Nazi era Holocaust in which some 6 million Jews were murdered the Israeli Prime Minister compared hamas's terror attack to those crimes 80 years ago our people experienced the worst savagery in the history of humanity with the Nazi crimes against the Jewish people on the soil of Germany and Europe I must tell you my friend that the savagery that we witnessed perpetrated by the Hamas murderers uh coming out of Gaza were the worst crimes committed against Jews since the Holocaust and here is what Germany's chancellor had to say the security of Israel and its citizens is German reason of State the German government acts according to this principle and is supported in this by Parliament across the party Spectrum it is important for me to say this today in this difficult time in all clarity Germany's history our historic responsibility originating from the Holocaust makes it our duty to protect the existence and security of Israel let's talk more about this with DW's Chief political editor Mela kufner who has been following that pressor hi Michaela um both Schultz and Netanyahu mentioning and invoking the Holocaust that feels um deeply important can you tell us what you made of their comments just now yeah yes it was a historical moment whatever comes next um here we see the country who just suffered the largest loss of Jewish life since that Holocaust and um the today's Chancellor of the nation that were the perpetrators of the Holocaust uh standing together against Hamas and it was a very striking parallel from Benyamin Netanyahu there that he basically refer to Hamas as the new Nazis as a Reincarnation of the Islamic State putting it into more contemporary uh reference there and Germany's response has been since that uh attack by Hamas but this was now delivered in person by the German Chancellor that the security of Israel is Germany's um it is the fundamental principle of the German State and um this is something Olaf Schultz as the first major leader visiting here wants to breathe life into also by assuring Israel that if it requires assist Germany will be someone who looks at you know whatever they need and will be eager to provide assistance as required so we got a small peek into what the two leaders spoke about before that press conference um Schulz said that he spoke to Netanyahu about how to get humanitarian Aid to civilians in the besiege Gaza Strip and that he was going to raise the topic with Egypt's President as well what should what would you make of those comments I think this gives us an idea of the coordinates of um Germany's role um as a a country that is keeping channels of communication open with everyone and trying to ensure Israel um uh being safe by talking to um to leaders who can allow for humanitarian assistance because the major challenge is actually to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza we saw OA feline the EU commission president announced that there would be um flights uh out of Egypt into Gaza this is still very unclear how this would technically actually take place um but also the German Chancellor while assuring Israel that it will ST stand by its side um basically calling on Israel um to um prevent unnecessary loss of life not in as many words but by really drawing attention to the humanitarian situation that is basically epitomized the suffering that is taking place in Gaza as we speak at this moment in time yeah now of course there's been a lot of concern about Regional spillover um from this conflict but I thought one thing that was noticeable for the fact that it wasn't mentioned in this press conference were the names Iran and Hezbollah why do you think that they didn't bring them up here yeah it's interesting that the German CH chose not to call them out uh previously also there was a German French meeting between him and Emmanuel MCO and Emmanuel mcco briefly tweeted or exed um a a message that included Iran it was was then deleted so um here you see Germany the Europeans treading very cautiously but he did clearly mean Iran and Hezbollah out of Lebanon and the immediate threat of course being Hezbollah joining and turning this into a conflict where Israel has to fight two different fronts here and that is something the German Chancellor wants to help prevent and that's also why we see him travel on and he clearly more than hinted at many calls that he's already made so this was a hugely symbolic moment historic moment you've called it I'm curious if we know what kind of actual support Israel can now expect uh from Germany after this trip by Schultz okay well quite clearly this this pledge of political support uh but what we do know is that Germany leased two drones uh from Israel which were supposed to be transferred to Germany at some point in time they will now remain where they are that is a form of assistance then initially there was a request from the Israelis for ammunition for some of their Navy ships and they've since basically cancelled that and it seems that the Israelis rely much more on concrete assistance from the Americans with whom they sh share a lot more um defense systems so uh that doesn't seem to be the case for now but clearly we've heard the German Chancellor say time and time again that he is checking in with Benyamin Netanyahu time and time again on what assistance Germany May provide and it has already provided um medical equipment and medical material so far qat has taken on a role as mediator in the war between Hamas and Israel Doha has had ties with Hamas since its early days this gives it an important position of influence over what the EU us and some Arab states label a terrorist group but it also brings into question how appropriate Qatar is as a mediator for peace talks no a friend to the west and to their sworn enemies katar walks a tight rope on foreign policy doha's communication Channels with Hamas have made it a major International player and an important us and EU Ally a small state with a long history of mediation as in past flareups Doha this time immediately took on the role of negotiator holding talks for the release of hostages held in Gaza CA cut diplomatic ties with Israel in 2009 but it is experienced at balancing Rel with opposing players for example counting both Teran and Washington as friends Doha has hosted the political headquarters of Hamas for more than a decade over the weekend the political leader of the militant islamist group Ismael Hana met with Iran's foreign minister in Doha qat is also widely regarded as a major financial backer of Hamas through its funding of civil services in Gaza it says the the financial support is for humanitarian and political efforts to maintain stability and support gazen families Doha has tried to use monetary incentives to find diplomatic Solutions in past conflicts Qatari leaders say their priority now is to deescalate protect civilians and to prevent any spillover that could trigger a regional War now US President Joe Biden is preparing to head to Israel on Wednesday day um earlier we also know that the German Chancellor uh excuse me that the chancellor met with King Abdullah in Berlin we know that the leaders there discussed the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and also how to prevent further escalation between Israel and Hamas in Gaza the Jordanian leader also warned against Palestinian refugees being pushed into Egypt or Jordan uh calling this a red line and the Jordanian King stressed the need for Aid to alleviate the suffering of civilians on both sides but he said the humanitarian issue must be dealt with inside Gaza and the West Bank that is a red line uh because I think that is the plan by certain of The Usual Suspects to try and create de facto issues on the ground no refugees in Jordan no refugees in Egypt this is a situation of humanarian Dimension that has to be dealt inside of Raza and uh and and the West Bank and not to try and push the Palestinian Challenge and their future onto other people's shoulders I'm joined Now by DW senior International correspondent funny faar from Tel Aviv funny this is a very difficult position for Israel isn't it um how can Israel ensure the safety of these hostages in Gaza while it is also bombing the territory Israel is facing a huge dilemma their aim is is to root out Hamas militants they keep saying but at the same time they're confronted with the fact that Hamas but a vast tunnel system we're talking about an underground city basically of 400 kilomet long tunnels and the entrances to these tunnels are close to schools close to hospitals in a very densely populated area and in that tunnel system now are not only the militants and the people who support them but also apparently also the hostages and and this is the Dilemma that Israel is facing now they did say that everyone who can basically shall leave the northern part of Gaza towards the South a forced a uation basically but that itself poses a huge danger for Palestinians for the people who need to leave now because once they are trying to leave they either lack fuel so a lot of people are trying to leave from the north to the south on foot but once they get to the South what is going to happen to them the only opening to the world that could become an opening is the rougher border crossing with Egypt but that remains closed and yes we do hear that the US and Israel are talking about somewh trying to create so-called safe zones in the South but also trying to get Aid in but at this point there's nothing precise about these plans and things are getting worse by the hour for the people as these talks are ongoing so urgently uh there is there the UN is calling for a to get in and obviously the people who are protesting here behind me are calling for the release of those hostages yes um as we've seen it's not just Israelis there are also many foreigners among the hostages what kind of role are foreign governments playing here in trying to secure their release well first and foremost they're coming here to Israel to uh Express their solidarity and at the same time trying to gather some intelligence trying to get some information actually who in the region not only here in Israel but in other countries be uh uh Qatar for example Saudi Arabia who in the region can help to negotiate with Hamas militants and try to help release those hostages for example Qatar already offered its help very early on since October 7th uh because obviously Qatar being one of the main financial backer of hamus militants have very close contacts contact with with with the terrorist organization the question is though whether whether they will be able to help and release those hostages before a potential ground offensive starts or any offensive because as we hearing the one of the spokesperson of IDF is saying now it doesn't necessarily actually have to be a ground offensive it could be anything else so there are a lot of things that are that remain unclear so is it remains unclear what is happening exactly right now with those hostages that are trapped just like the Palestinian people in Gaza trip and Finny uh US President Joe Biden arriving in Israel tomorrow what can we expect from his trip to reaffirm solidarity us solidarity with Israel something that obviously US Secretary of State Biden but also US Secretary of State blinkin uh excuse me has has done on his Middle East Tour it keeps continuing as well as the US Secretary of of of Defense who's been here in Israel as well but also obviously that visit that expected visit by President Biden here in Israel is another way to show deterrence making sure that for example the hisbah militants in Lebanon but also that Iran do not get involved to make sure there's deescalation here before the conflict may be widening let's get more from a geopolitical strategist I am joined Now by Fel chakarova German Chancellor Olaf Schultz in Israel today and we know US President Joe Biden is due to arrive on Wednesday what do you think they will be pushing for and how effective will they be thank you for the invitation well first of course the German Chancellor is going to um meet the Israeli leadership to show actually solidarity not only on behalf of Germany but in General on behalf of uh European Union member states uh there are German hostages so he will also meet families of those who have been taken hostage uh now of course what is also important from German perspective is going to be the discussion on humanitarian Aid and uh preventing humanitarian uh catastrophe uh when it comes to the visit of the American uh president uh here of course we have a very very different agenda which is more geopolitical one first and foremost showing of course support uh including Military Support with the aircraft carriers uh uh in the Mediterranean uh which is to prevent any further escalation but of course right now all the efforts are focused on preventing ground defensive preventing actually of another let's say longlasting War where other key players in the region may see actually an incentive to get involved key word for you of course Iran so here all of the American efforts right now are to on the one hand show of course support and solidarity uh for the key partner in the region Israel but on the other hand also to get engaged with all the relevant actors to also prevent this cast catastrophe from happening uh third important point is of course to also make sure that there will be humanitarian uh corridors uh for the Palestinian people right now all the neighbors uh the key neighbors that could actually take more refugees are um have closed doors for different reasons so Egypt Jordan but we also have the situation in the north with Lebanon where there is a risk of actually another escalation and second front so a lot of problems on the agenda a lot of issues and as I said we still have um let's say uh good uh uh perspective for actually preventing this war from happening yeah so how worried are you about potential spillover in the region then do you think that diplomacy can prevent it from becoming embroiled in a wider War well first and foremost from my perspective this has been the most uh optimistic uh context Regional context for most of the actors involved prior to what Hamas actually has conducted in terms of the most severe terrorist attack on civil Ian in the in the modern history of Israel so before this attack most of the actors in the region have been already engaging in various um multifaceted uh normalization processes and diplomatic economic and so on ties so in fact nobody really wants a war right now if we take a look at the agenda of most of the actors even Iran was engaging with Saudi Arabia on the one hand think of of the broker deal by China but also with the United States and think of the potential for Iran deal 2.0 so even Iran is not really incentivized to start a war but right now we in a very delicate situation because of the escalatory trajection of this uh conflict and this is where uh some actors may see an incentive to further escalate and this is what United States is trying to prevent right now so all the key players United States China and even Russia don't want a war yes we may argue Russia would be uh interested in having some kind of military tensions to draw the attention away from Eastern Europe and from Ukraine and then all the regional players on the ground including Israel have been actually working proactively on normalizing relations so I still have let's say more optimistic scenario for uh preventing the worst which would be of course ground offense and then of course we don't know for sure what the cascading effects would be from a ground offensive and in terms of the humanitarian disaster thank you so much for joining us with that that is geopolitical strategist of Alina chakarova we really appreciate your time today thank you very
