We Begin the day with the question are we any closer to a ceasefire in Gaza according to the US Secretary of State the answer is yes and only one thing is standing in the way the militant group Hamas Hamas which is regarded by many countries as a terrorist organization reportedly reacted positively to the proposal backed by the US for a truce but now it's asking for changes many of those changes blinkin says are a nogo the secretary of state is in Qatar to drum up support for the initiative aside from what Hamas wants to amend this plan has still not received a clear public endorsement from Israel this stands in stark contrast to the UN Security Council on Monday the council endorsed the plan calling on both Israel and Hamas to enact it immediately with no conditions well tonight the world is still waiting for that to happen and here's a primer on what the plan that for now has unprecedented international support would call for let's take a look at it it's made up of three phases the first phase would include the release of some hostages the return of Palestinian prisoners and partial troop withdrawal all of this under a six week truce the second phase includes a permanent ceasefire now that would mean the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip the third phase would focus on a plan to rebuild Gaza while blinkin have said that some of the counter proposals from Hamas are unacceptable we we still have no information on what those amendments call for here's more now from Anthony blinkin the entire world almost without uh fail has been uh behind this proposal and we've heard it again and again and again so we were waiting on one response and that was the response from Hamas and as the Prime Minister said last night we received a response Hamas has proposed numerous changes to the proposal that was on the table we discussed those changes last night with Egyptian colleagues and today with the Prime Minister some of the changes are workable some are not I'm joined Now by Jonathan panikov he's one of the leading Middle East analysts at the Atlantic Council that's a us-based global Affairs think T Jonathan it's good to have you back on the show when you and I spoke 24 hours ago you were cautious about what seemed to be growing optimism that this plan would be the plan leading to peace I have to say it's very preent of you Hamas hasn't signed on and it wants the plans changed what do you say about what's happened thanks for having me back thrill to be with you look I think it's a challenge and I think there's not a lot of surprise frankly by Israel or the us or the Europeans that this was the re response this was a yes but and the question is how big is the butt so is this a poison pill which would mean that Hamas isn't really looking for this to end up and conclude in a deal and so what they've put back in the Amendments they've proposed are so extreme that they know Israel won't agree to it or is it going to be as secretary blinkin said just an opening negotiating position such that some of the changes are workable and might be able to be accepted and some of them are just not but Hamas might ultimately let them drop I think it's a little too early still to say but I wouldn't expect Israel to sign off or even agree to anything until Hamas makes the first move and makes clear what they will and won't accept yeah let's consider for a moment the decision-making process within Hamas you told me yesterday that everything the group agrees to or rejects depends on the Gaza based Hamas leader Yaya senoir what makes this man who does not take part in any negotiations because he is hiding somewhere in Gaza what makes him the only important decision maker so sinir is The Mastermind behind the October 7th attack he is the political leader in Gaza um but ultimately has control of the brigades as well the reality is that Hamas leaders sitting in Doha mes don't actually have the ability to Kajol or command the the brigades the terror side of Hamas to make a decision to agree to a deal or not agree to a deal sinir does Hamas as a terrorist organization as a whole has a variety of factions the political faction in doigh just mentioned the political faction in Gaza faction that's really there and signed up to Hamas simply to be able to work and to be able to get money and and living expenses and then a faction that's incred militant that is the brigades and the ones that carried out the October 7th attack sinir is the only one that can actually have authority over all of them and so at the end of the day no matter what everybody else wants it's going to be his decision yeah yeah I mean we often think of Hamas is being this one big monolith I'm wondering is there a dispute within Hamas about the future course or is everyone without exception behind Sino war no I don't think everybody's behind him I just think a lot of people don't have sufficient what you'd say is Wasa to oppose him sufficient influence to oppose Sino so I I think there's actually a number of splits and a number of ideological splits within the group a number of differences in terms of preferences of what different leaders if they were in his position might do but the truth of the matter is he has control now if he were to be killed by the Israelis or assassinated then it might open up space ironically it could change things as you have different leaders battling but right now he's the man in charge Anthony blinkin said today that the present agreement that's on the table is virtually identical to a proposal that Hamas put forward itself over a month ago but today they come back and make further demands I mean this sounds like it looks like a delay tactic um how is that in hamas's interest well you're right it is and obviously some of that would depend on what are and if they're about the timetable then it really it's showing that Hamas isn't interested we have very clear reporting now um from another Outlet of sinar's comments about frankly using the Palestinian people that the more civilians you die it's ultimately beneficial for Kamas propaganda I think in the saddest of forms you're seeing the impact of that and that come to life that the focus is on the group the focus is on sinir himself and his survival and so for the brigades it makes sense because if there's a resolution to the conflict or the conflict ends at least I should say well then sino's Powers probably going to be diminished there's not going to be a Hamas leading Gaza right now though the opposite seems to be true as you're saying he's delaying and that keeps him as the person in the driver's seat yeah and you know what you're talking talking about um this report The Wall Street Journal they they published leaked messages from sinir which in which he calls the deaths of Palestinian civilians necessary sacrifices and he says quote we have the Israelis right where we want them so yeah that doesn't sound like um a leader who wants a ceasefire deal I want to ask you about Qatar Qatar has been conducting these ceasefire negotiations for months now the qari Prime Minister described the process today as frustrating um what would happen if Qatar gave up its role as mediator well my guess is what you would probably have is the Egyptians stepping back in but we saw a couple of weeks ago that didn't go so well the last round of negotiations ended largely because of contentions um that Egypt was not negotiating as a mediator perhaps in the best form it was giving different drafts to the Israelis than to Hamas I'm skeptical that Qatar really is going to step out I think they view for their own foreign policy frankly Global and Regional mediation as a key tenant of what they want to be known for of what Doha wants to be known for throughout the world but there's no doubt that you got officials in Cutter that are extraordinarily frustrated at this point and John let me ask you before we run out of time lesper just pretend for a moment that the Rifts can be bridged and that a a ceasefire agreement can be reached reached does it make sense to go into such a a a ceasefire without a plan for the day after the war in Gaza it doesn't make sense but that may be where we are look there's a lot of plans out there a lot of think tanks um and individuals associated with think tanks including the Atlanta Council have people who have proposed plans or involved in um various behind the scenes non-governmental engagement ments about developing plans I I think the US governments and a number of European allies some key tenants that are clear about what needs to happen um but it's true there's going to be a lot of questions about security about the humanitarian recovery effort about reconstruction about governance that right now are just unknown and we're going to have to see how they come to fruition I think the US has been so focused maybe rightly on just getting to a place where we can even have a ceasefire so that conversation is possible Jonathan panikov with the Atlantic Council Jonathan we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us again tonight we appreciate your analysis thank you thank you
