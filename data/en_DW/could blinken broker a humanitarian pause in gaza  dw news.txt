dozens of Palestinians have been killed in overnight Israeli air strikes on the south of the Gaza Strip including children in Rafa fears are growing that Israeli troops could push further into gaza's southernmost town where roughly half of the strip's population have taken refuge in the coming days US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is expected in the region and on a visit to Cairo the French foreign minister has condemned talk about forced displacement of gazin into Egypt as the fighting continues so to do efforts to Halt the nearly four-month War Hamas now says Israel and international mediators have made them a tentative truce offer but the militant group considered a terrorist organization by most western states says it is still reviewing the details even as battles have been raging on the ground for weeks reports of circulated that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was about to happen Israel said discussions in Qatar had been productive Palestinians have called insistently at the United Nations for a pause in the fighting the best way to avoid Regional escalation is not the threat or use of more fire but action for an immediate ceasefire there's also been pressure from within Israel itself some families of hostages want to see an end to fighting I need a results I need I need I need to deal with I need to see my sister coming back and to see her crossing the border but as I know there is still open question that all around it is just wasting our time and the question is about the ceasefire and as you know there is a people that try to see it as a lost in combat or lost in the war or anything else and a SE of fire it just mean a cease of fire and to save life an earlier cease fire last Ed a week in November and saw more than 100 Israeli hostages released from Gaza while food and fuel was shipped into the besieged territory and more than 200 Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel Hamas still holds around 130 hostages but several are believed to be dead since then Israel's biggest backer the US has avoided using the term ceasefire to talk about negotiations even while it says it's been applying pressure behind the scenes look we've seen um the way the way we got those 100 hostages out was through a one a week-long humanitarian pause stopping a temporary stoppage in in the fighting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also largely avoided using the word ceasefire while recognizing the need to get hostages out of Gaza and applying strict conditions we are working to achieve an additional framework for the release of our captives but I stress not at any cost I have read lines among them we will not finish the war we will not remove IDF from the strip and we will not free thousands of terrorists we are working on all three together and we will not concede on any of them despite all those obstacles the two sides kept negotiating in Qatar what's unclear now is how long a ceasefire will actually last for more on these negotiations I'm joined Now by Oliver murnan he's theor director of the NGO Forward Thinking which works on conflict resolution and mediation especially in the Middle East welcome back to DW Mr murnan now what can you tell us about the conditions of the us back proposal for a fresh ceasefire that Hamas is currently considering well I think the problem is the gap between the position of Netanyahu and his government and the Hamas um military leadership I'm told that the Hamas leadership want a permanent ceasefire and then to negotiate on the principle all for all all the hostages for all the Palestinian prisoners Netanyahu as we've just heard from that clip you played is determined a there won't be a permanent ceasefire and secondly that he will not negotiate on that principle all for all now what I understand the proposal that came out at the Paris meeting last week was that again to have these short pauses to have a two- week pause I believe to begin with in which whatever young people are elderly that are still held in Gaza can be exchanged and then to see how that can progress but there is no talk of a permanent ceasefire and I think that's the root of the problem I can't see how with the complex U mechanism also for negotiations how they can reach um agreement I hope I'm wrong yeah not much rigle room are you optimistic at all that a deal maybe not this deal but any deal that will bring some relief to gazin and the people waiting to get their hostages back home will be made the pain of the families um that are waiting for the relatives to be released from Gaza must be enormous I knew the Shalit family in the five years they suffered I got little sense of it but at the same time what we have to keep in in mind and in focus is that 2.3 million people in Gaza are suffering unimaginable human conditions lifechanging conditions even if the war were to stop tonight the situation there has changed people's lives forever now I think that's what's got to be kept in the equation and my hope for them as well as the amilies of the hostages is that the leadership will put as Sun said they were protecting innocent life in bombing um Yemen deoti Targets in Yemen I think the same principle now must apply in Gaza priority must be given to protecting innocent human life US actually heading to the Middle East to Works towards not only the release of the hostages but also a humanitarian pause in Gaza to bring that relief that you were just talking about what leverage does he have at this point well the US have has enormous leverage if it will use it but I think they're saying one thing publicly and at the same time supplying arms that we understand is still going on and giving political protection to Netanyahu and his his government to continue the war so I I can't I think unless unless they stop acting out of what may be short-term political interests and apply the universal Norms that have kept the international order um for the past 75 years or so that he must apply those norms and in applying them I think he needs to say right now not putting forward proposals that just prolong the fighting but right now to say enough is enough we're providing you with no more arms all political protection you've got to stop the fighting you've got to stop the the continual assault on the 2.3 million people in
