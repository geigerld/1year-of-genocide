it has been slammed as a PR stunt to distract from recent allegations of anti-Semitism against billionaire businessman Elon Musk and his platform X formerly known as Twitter on Monday the world's richest man toured one of the sites devastated by the Hamas terrorist attack on a visit to Israel musk visited a kibuts with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin and Yahoo and discussed anti-semitic content on his social media platform musk also held on the potential use of a starlink satellite technology for communications access in Gaza Israel said musk had agreed starlink could only be used in the territory with Israeli government approval do of and let's take a closer look now at this topic with Doug mie he's the director of Internet analysis at the monitoring company K take welcome Doug there seems to be a deal now but Israel was not at all pleased about musk's initial offer to bring starlink to Gaza what were they concerned about so just taking a step back uh with how how does a uh a satellite service come uh come active in a country the every country their government has a telecomunications regulator that offers uh that requires a license uh for a country to operate for a satellite service to operate there and um you know as of October 7th uh sarlink did not have a a license to operate in Israel I'm not where they were in the process they were probably pursuing it um but uh I guess this would FastTrack uh an authorization for them to use it from a technical standpoint there's no reason why if someone had a Ground Terminal uh they wouldn't be able to get the service but as far as the the caution I think you know from the LA from the last couple of months I think we've learned a couple things one is that the Israelis you know have cut off service to Gaza uh for extended periods of time uh that have coincided with IDF operations in Gaza so so I think from the Israeli point of view they look at internet service as something that they um want to control as part of uh their uh their military operation against Hamas now mus claims that starlink can help restore communication with eight organizations for example in Gaza what would be the hurdles now to get the system to work there so really boil down to just getting them uh the ground terminals because as I said the the satellites the way this works so it's a low earth orbit constellation of thousands of satellites uh that are flying overhead all of us at any given moment uh they're going over Gaza and they have been uh whether it now whether they operate there or not is uh becomes a regulatory matter or you know do they have a license to operate it sounds like they're going to get that license so then it's just a matter of uh getting terminals in uh that can connect they have to you know no longer black uh Blacklist or block out uh that geography from service and uh obviously those terminals need electricity which is sometimes hard to come by in in with that obstacle but the number one thing probably at this point is just to get uh ground terminals uh the antennas the dishes into Gaza the Israeli government has said that they are concerned about Starling being misused what could that look like so um I think uh yeah they they made a comment about how they would like to tightly control who has got uh uh service and you know devices like these uh can be moved uh so something could uh be uh you know moved from Israel into Gaza or elsewhere we saw that in when Isis invaded and took over parts of uh Syria and Iraq and they were buying terminals in Turkey this is before the days of starlink and they were able to uh carry those over the border and operate those um uh in in Iraq and Syria but I think you know starlink has plays a critical role in the conflict in Ukraine so we can see you know its application in a military setting both for uh battle field uh Communications for coordinating military activities as well as uh uh coordinating um drone surveillance and drone attacks those have been um uh performed with the aid of the Starling service those internet and infrastructure expert Doug madori thank you so
