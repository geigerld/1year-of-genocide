well ceasefire negotiations in Qatar have resumed with Israel indicating that talks could last another two weeks the country's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing growing criticism over his handling of the war against Hamas that criticism coming from abroad and domestically on Sunday the families of hostages who are being held in Gaza protested in Tel Aviv they accused the government of not doing enough to bring their relatives home well now a Alani is a former Qatari defense intelligence director he joins us from Doha welcome to the W now we know Israel has rejected hamas's ceasefire proposal though it has sent a delegation to uh Qatar to continue uh talks even as Benyamin Netanyahu talks about launching a ground operation in Rafa so how far are the two sides away from each other well thank you for having me Phil uh to be honest right now things are very murky on the uh situation in Gaza because we've got this new incursion into the um Al shifa hospital and the threat of uh invading or land Warfare uh on on Rafa uh now obviously the qari and American negotiators the sponsors of these negotiations play this very close to their vest so there are not not a lot of details but uh um if we've seen what happened in the past the qaris remain optimistic they remain hopeful that before the Eid celebrations which will be in 3 weeks uh that there may be a uh resolution to the uh situation right now and hopefully a Sease fire and do you think that Israel wants to get its hostages back through diplomatic means rather than military they I've seen speculation that the Prime Minister would prefer to get the hostages back militarily rather than by negotiation because a military Victory would defeat Hamas where a negotiated uh hostage return would allow Hamas to rearm well that is confusing uh to be honest Phil because on net uh the attempts by the IDF to rescue um Israeli hostages have yielded more uh hostages killed then rescued yes there were some attempts that um had suc eded but on that again more killed than rescued on the other hand the negotiations have released tens over a 100 uh of the hostages so it it is confusing to see that uh continuing to endanger the civilians and the hostages in Gaza seems to be the order of the day with the IDF it probably may be uh driven by internal politics rather than Global rationale to end uh the war and save the hostages and rescue obviously even the the civilians who right now and the numbers in front of me over 31,000 killed and over 70 3,000 wounded this is really a dial situation and it is confusing now Hamas of course is is looking for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the release of prisoners from Israel How likely are they to get what they want well what I can say is what has been already mentioned by by for instance the Qatari negotiators Qatar is pushing both sides both the Israelis and Hamas urging them to be at the negotiation negotiating table and to re and to reach a resolution not for any political goal for either party but for the safety of the hostages and the civilian population of Gaza now there are calculations on both sides however I think the ultimate goal must be something that all parties interested should push for and that's what the qataris have been doing and the Americans who are sponsoring again these negotiations okay good talking to you thank you so much for uh for joining us former Qatari defense intelligence director naaf Al thank
