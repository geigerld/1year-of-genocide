to the Middle East next where Israel's prime minister has told his cabinet that the country is already in a cot multi-front war with Iran amid Rising tensions the G7 group of Nations has joined calls for restraint in the region following Wednesday's assassination of Hamas political Chief isma hania in Teran the US says Israel has its Ironclad support in the face of any retaliatory attack from Iran let's get more now from Sara bazuband she's an analyst focused on Iran at the German Institute for Global and area studies she joins me now from Hamburg Sarah good morning diplomatic efforts are continuing we saw Jordan's foreign minister Aman safadi making a r visit to Iran can diplomacy like that prevent a major Iranian retaliatory strike good morning and thank you for the invitation um we need to in order to answer this question we need to keep in mind the mindset behind the negotiation strategy from the Iranian side um they Philosophy from of the negotiations in Iran side in every aspect of their um encounters with um outside world especially with the west through nuclear negotiations through uh hostage taking negotiations and now through the crisis negotiations with Israel is to show a major big gesture create a big splash to put the other side in a corner of especially a media and psychological war and then to gain uh so-called brownie points from them to to be able to use that as a negotiation chip as a bargaining chip um now it of course they will have their demands we don't know what their demands are um there are negotiations ongoing at the very senior level as uh your report also mentioned that uh Jordanian uh fire Minister after nearly one decade is in Teran was in tran for for having a very Frank and very direct conversations with the authorities in Iran um but would they let that go at this stage I highly doubt it uh un fortunately we are entangled in this crisis that Tit for Tat will continue it's every step it seems to become bigger and more serious the US is saying that Israel has its quote Ironclad support how well is Israel actually prepared for a possible Iranian strike from a military point of view well Israel has maintained a a so-called um quantitative military Edge in the region uh with the support of the United States Israel has had um much more advanced uh military um equipment to defend itself but we also need to keep in mind that the size of the country the size of the military um between the two countries is completely asymmetric um Iranians have trained equipped financed several groups across the region that um are trying and all of them are very much in line with Tan's strategy in hurting and damaging Israel so it's not exactly the most powerful situation for Israel but of course Israel would have the support of the West and we've and especially the United States and we've seen that as John kby mentioned in his remarks that you uh just showed um that in April um that we we were in that situation that the Western Coalition had to come and and support Israel and that will happen so Israel would not be alone in this but it will not be an easy um challenge um it it would not be an easy crisis for Israel to deal with I would imagine neither would it be for WR to be honest with Israel's prime minister meanwhile is saying that Israel is already in a quot multi-front war I mean is that really the case given that full-blown war with Hezbollah has not yet broken out and who are these comments really for then um yes Israel and Iran have been in in a multif front War uh there was a day in our calendar we should not forget that was 7th of October a lot has happened on that day and the reason that we are in this situation is is that there that incident that event uh Israeli people were living their lives and and suddenly a group of terrorists attacked them and beheaded their children and raped their women uh that that is what triggered it and that was a major event and Israel could not just sit back and watch and move on that we all understand there is also like I said the proxy war proxies that are financed trained and equipped by Iranians uh there is also the Cyber war that if you uh for example look at the regular reports that Microsoft produces there is a huge investment from Iranian side on cyber attacks on influence operation on psychological operation uh to affect and influence Israeli society and a a you know Global Community as as a whole um there is definitely a multif front War um Iran and Israel have been entangled in this rivalry it but it was always an indirect uh rivalry but we it seems that we are getting closer to more direct rivalry and I just want to add one sentence we keep hearing this um on media uh that Israel is trying to drag the United States into this war but I I don't think that is the case I think that's a shortsighted conclusion because again going back to 7th of October and what has happened that was imposed on Israel and and you know this doesn't this doesn't mean that justifying uh you know atrocities in Gaza and so on and so forth should be accepted but we need to keep in mind that Israel was attacked and Israel is trying to regain its deterrence uh in the region we'll leave it there for the moment thanks so much for joining us today Sarah bandi from the German Institute for Global and area studies thanks so much
