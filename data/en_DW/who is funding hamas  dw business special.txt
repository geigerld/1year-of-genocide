hello and welcome to this week's DW business special I'm marizen in Berlin welcome today we will be looking at who is funding Hamas terrorist activities against Israel for its incursion Hamas has used thousands of drones and Rockets and carried out cyber attacks the conflict has raised questions as to how the group is able to finance these complex attacks Israeli retaliation also has enormous costs for the economy of the Gaza Strip which is under Hamas rule joining me for this conversation is Matthew levit he's the director of the program on counterterrorism and intelligence at the Washington Institute for NE East policy thank you for joining us today Matthew thanks for having me Matthew Hamas has been using drones cyber attacks and Rockets against Israel where is it getting the funding for these weapons from hamas's funding streams have changed over the years in particular in 2007 when Hamas took over the Gaza Strip by Force of Arms pointing its guns not at Israel in that instance Israel had already withdrawn but against Palestinians once it controlled territory it was able to tax some might say extort the local population uh and that is its primary source of income right now the second most important uh source of income and this is something that has been consistent over decades since the founding of Hamas in the late 1980s is funding from Hamas US Government estimates that Iran provides Hamas somewhere between 70 and hundred million dollar a year probably additional funds in moments of Crisis like this and that has been constant that is money that is inine that is weapons there's on top of that training intelligence support Etc and then Hamas gets some money from other states that are trying to support humanitarian uh stability in Gaza for example the state of katar provides salaries for Hamas employees even if that actually goes to Hamas employees it frees up funds for other things Hamas has Investments and they have people Who oversee their Investments the US government has designated persons in turkey and Jordan for example who sit on the Hamas finance committee overseeing their investments in the region and finally Hamas raises funds through through uh front organizations illegitimate Charities and some Charities that pretend to be legitimate raising funds publicly for needy Palestinians which of course is a legitimate purpose but in fact taking that money and providing it to Hamas and there have been a series of cases recently people arrested in Israel a father and daughter team in the Netherlands arrested just uh a couple of months ago in that case reportedly having raised over five million euro for Hamas right so a lot of uh things to unpack here but let me start by asking Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the US by the EU and other Western governments it's sanctioned it's cut off from the international banking system how come that doesn't seem to be successful well in the first instance because it's not cut off in the International Financial system just because for example the European Union has designated all of Hamas as a terrorist organization doesn't mean that they've taken any effective action based on that Authority and most accounts are not going to be in the name of Hamas Incorporated so it it requires intelligence and law enforcement investigations to be able to identify that and frankly most security cter terrorism investigators prosecutors over the past few years have been focused on other things from the Islamic State in al-Qaeda more recently Iranian assassinations around the world and so they're not entirely cut off the second reason is that they're not only using the formal Financial system they frequently use money exchange houses or haala which is an informal way of transferring money from one place to another where money actually doesn't actually move just like value moves and also there's a tremendous amount of Reliance on trade-based money laundering so if you are a Hamas leader in turkey or Lebanon and you want to send funds to the Gaza Strip you don't send $10,000 you send $110,000 worth of sugar or wheat or some other basic commodity that would be needed by people but you send it to someone that is affiliated with Hamas and they can either then use that material for their own people or sell it and have the benefit right okay so circumventing a lot of the sanctions there what role does cryptocurrency play for Hamas Hamas has used cryptocurrency and here in the United States the Department of Justice has taken several public actions targeting amas cryptocurrency campaigns Seas wallets for example the Israelis have done the same just since even the uh the the attacks um the Israelis have seized additional wallets it does not seem to be a primary means of moving funds and I should say this as a way of moving the funds not so much raising it in the first instance but it is something that people are watching and that is increasing right and talking about these funds do we know how much Hamas actually needs to sustain itself we don't know exactly uh most people estimate somewhere around 300 or $400 million and that includes all of hamas's salaries garbage collection all the things that go into governance but what Hamas has made very very very clear especially over the past few days is that it prioritizes its militancy over its governance our Think Tank the Washington Institute recently published a poll taken in July demonstrating that an overwhelming majority of Palestinians including Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are not happy with Hamas Rule and would prefer the Palestinian Authority to be there recently Hamas taking 150 hostages or at least 130 120 some are believed to being held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad Israelis are saying and it's quite controversial but the Israelis are saying they're going to put they are putting Gaza under Complete Siege the idea is to give Hamas the choice are you going to prioritize the needs of your constituency by releasing the hostages in which case Israel says it will allow water and medicine and gas and electricity to go back into the Gaza Strip or are you going to prioritize maintaining 150 kidnaps people from multiple countries at least 20 countries have been affected so far we know that there are Americans who are kidnapped we know that there are 20 Americans at least have' been killed and it forces a Hamas to make that that choice right and on this blockade how dependent is the territory on supplies coming in uh from Israel uh Gaza is tremendously dependent on U material coming in from the outside most of that ironically comes from Israel not from Egypt and you'd have to raise that with the Egyptians but from the Israeli perspective and I think this might be surprising to many you they want stability in Gaza the Israeli calculation has been make sure that there's enough ility in Gaza enough Economic Opportunity so that there will be calm and clearly that calculation did not fly because at the end of the day Hamas decided to put that at risk so that it could carry out a barbaric attack like the one that it did in southern Israel all right and on the point of tax collection Gaza uh is struggles with poverty unemployment level where do those tax revenues come from that uh Hamas uses for its terrorist operations first of all Hamas is able to tax any money that comes in so when the government of katar for example provides money for Hamas salaries they're able to use some of that money for the actual salaries but the government also takes a cut of its own the Gaza Strip is a closed small enclave and there's not a whole lot of economic activity but there is economic activity daily life does go on and every aspect of daily life is taxed by Hamas any Goods that come in and do Goods do come in again primarily from Israel on a daily basis uh the Israelis used to allow truck after truck to go through and all of that is taxed so at the end of the day there's a significant amount of economic activity that does happen even in an enclave like the Gaza Strip and Hamas taxed that heavily right and going back to its uh one of its most prominent external funders Iran Iran is funding the likes of Hamas and Hezbollah uh and will face Western sanctions for this so what's really in it for a funer like Iran for Iran this is an extremely effective and cost effective way to extend its influence well beyond its borders Iran is under all kinds of sanctions but Iran like Hamas does not prioritize its constituency it prioritizes its militancy and so even under the Trump administration's maximum pressure campaign Iran prioritized getting money first of all to Hezbollah and the amounts We Believe be somewhere between 700 million And1 billion dollar a year and secondarily to Palestinian groups primarily Hamas which together we believe is about a hundred million a year most of that to Hamas in the scope of things Iran is a big country it's a big economy even under sanction these are funds again if you prioritize this over your constituency that you can afford even under sanction right and on this point of uh Hamas relations with other countries in Mar uh Hamas delegation went to Moscow for talks with Russian officials uh do we know any any details about the relationship between Hamas and Russia we do and obviously it's a growing and disturbing relationship that extends not only into the Middle East but well into Ukraine as Iran is providing drones and now there's talking even of different types of missiles to Russia to use in its war of choice against Ukraine targeting civilian targets there in return Iran wants help being able to evade sanctions it wants help with its military program and people worry potentially even about its nuclear program Iran and Syria are also close allies in defense of the Assad regime in Syria where they're also working closely with Lebanese Hezbollah in at least one financing scheme that the US Treasury Department targeted Iran was engaged in an ilicit oil scheme that involved raising funds for its own Islamic revolutionary guard KS Force also for Hezbollah and in this case also for Hamas that particular financing scheme involved Russian Financial activity as well right so we have been able to trace Russian activity to funding that has gone to M then yes coming back to the uh to the gazan territory how important will remittances will Aid be for the people in the gazen territory going forward with the situation remittances are not as big an issue for the Gaza Strip but International Aid is the money coming from Qatar the goods allowed in from Israel and United Nations European union and United States and other International Aid is critical Hamas by taking an action like this puts all of that at risk you've probably heard about the EU debating internally whether or not to cut off Aid to the Palestinians and general just to Hamas and the Gaza Strip is there a way to continue funds going into the Gaza Strip without it going to Hamas no uh so this is a very very complicated issue nobody wants the average citizen in that has suffer Hamas is bringing the suffering upon them right so you're saying that there is no way to provide Aid to people in Gaza without it also going into the hands of of Hamas Hamas controls the Gaza Strip full stop International organizations are there on the ground but they operate at the whim of Hamas they're also operating under War conditions right now also the choice of Hamas and so the idea of stopping funds to International organizations is is a very very uncomfortable one they will be able to do some things but they can't do everything and uh um at any large scale level activities that go on in the Gaza Strip go on with Hamas is blessing or not right and looking at the Israeli side of this conflict now uh what kind of costs is Israel facing now with with this conflict conflict like this uh the Hamas War uh could cost Israel easily into the billions of dollars both in the expenditures for uh defense and and and uh trying to uh save the hostages and to make it so that Hamas is not able to do something like this ever again and also of course in terms of uh lost uh Economic Opportunity uh report reportedly 300 to 400,000 Israelis have been called up to reserve duty that's a very significant proportion of a population of about five million uh those people are not at work that that uh you know business activity is not happening and so uh this will be very expensive uh but when a country is attacked from an external neighbor it has no choice but to uh rally itself to uh defend its citizens and its borders and to uh deal with the consequences uh in terms of the domestic economic effect afterwards Matthew love it thank you so much for speaking to us today my pleasure and that was our DW business special for more in-depth
