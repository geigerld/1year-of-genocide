now during the Hamas Terror attacks on October 7th the group killed and kidnapped not only Israelis but people of other nationalities as well the biggest group of foreign Nationals was from Thailand most of them had been working on the farms near the border with Gaza officials say that eight Thai migrants workers were being held hostage many of them come from Northeast of Thailand DW's G Mattis traveled there to speak with survivors and families still waiting for their loved ones to be free just a few cenet take up a whole hour making carpets with the neighbors helps Kami lamow pass the time sick with worry lamow hasn't been able to work since Hamas terrorists kidnapped her son more than 140 days ago the only visitors to her tailor shop these days are local officials inquiring about her situation it's a lot of pressure I can't rest I can't eat I think about my son all the time I'm constantly wondering how he is I was told that they only get a blanket and I'm sure they don't sleep because they're so anxious like many ties her eldest son was in Israel working for a farmer the â‚¬1,000 he earned a month helped the family back home Kami lamow bought this tractor for the family farm with the money her son sent she says he continued working in e despite knowing it was dangerous he's actually experienced a similar situation before two people were killed right in front of him when they were hiding in the shelter during another attack I told him to come back but he said it was normal there in the neighboring Village this family is reunited anusa Angel was released after 50 days of captivity the money he earned from four years working in Israel helped him buy a house and set up a chicken farm but he says he will never forget the morning of October 7th they put us in an empty house for about an hour initially and then moved us to the tunnels they hurt us badly especially in the first two to three days we were only given bread and water just enough to survive I counted the days by meals otherwise we just lay on the ground and slept these are the other tie workers he was held hostage with on the day of their release one of them is from the same Village as Kami Low's son talking to his mother gives her hope that the most dangerous part may already be behind him on the day of the kidnapping there were a total of five th workers who were taken captive but the car could only fit four more people so they executed one right there led by better wages than they can get at home tens of thousands of tha Nationals especially from this remote region work in Israel they're able to do so because of an agreement between the two countries but officials like the town mayor feel the government should do more to protect citizens it's my personal opinion it is up to the individual where they want to go they are the ones who take a risk and the ones who benefit from it but the government should provide adequate information about risk zones so that people can make an informed decision the labor agreement with Israel has been suspended for the time being many people here would now rather go to Taiwan or South Korea for work kamiam now says she wants her son to stay in Thailand when he finally returns she bought some cattle and land for him the rise in these fields will be ripe in about a month she hopes he'll be back home in time for the Harvest tww Asia Pacific bureau chief goog Mattis who filed that report for us also spoke with Thai politician aren uten he spoke directly with Hamas and took the lead in the negotiation process that led to the release of 23 Thai hostages in November now UT raisen said that the release of Thai hostages still held by Hamas is linked to the end of Israeli air strikes on Gaza why is it so difficult to get the remaining Thai hostages in Israel set free after the release Tai workers left Israel they were wearing t-shirts featuring Israeli symbols this allowed Israel to claim that they secured the release of the hostages moreover one of the 23 released hostages condemned her mass in an interview with the media so when it saw the interview Iran later asked us why one of the released Tha hostages said that he was tortured by true because of his interviews whether we choose to believe him or not I expect that talks for the release of the remaining hostages will become more challenging so you would say the fact that Tha hostages that were released spoke out about their treatment at the hands of Hamas that had a negative impact on the current negotiations one of the former hostages spoke in a negative way and then Hamas also questioned why the released hostages didn't leave via Egypt why did they stay in Israel for a week so they were unsure if the hostages really spoke for themselves so should thae hostages that were released lie about how they were treated actually by Hamas it would be best if a released hostages would talk about their release in a positive way so that it would be beneficial for the remaining hostages they should say things that will help for eight remaining hostages be released more easily if you can Hass you frustrate them how can you expect that they will release for eight remaining hostages I think it would be good if the released hostages said things that would help for others to be released you have been negotiating directly with Hamas in Iran what is your recommendation to the Thai government what should happen next to get the remaining hostages free I believe the Tha government should call on Israel to stop the bombing for a week or at least for a few days this would allow the negotiations to begin however Thailand has remained quiet and do not try to make Hamas understand our position better we should make it clear that we don't side with Israel because now it has become really difficult to free the in hostages that is unless the Thai government clearly communicates with Israel to stop the bombing as requested by Hamas so that talks can commence so you would say the historically good relationship between Thailand and Iran is reason for hope that the remaining hostages will be freed soon certainly negotiations can proceed only if a current bombardment stops right now there will be no negotiations like this if a bombardment stops however they will release for remaining hostages just like they did last time it's clear that the Thai people are not their enemy so they don't need to keep them as hostages but how can they release them now the bombs are a threat to the hostages and we head out to Jakarta where we speak with DW Asia Pacific Chief gor Mattis who filed that report for us so G I mean pretty intense situation for those families there how are ties whose loved ones are still held hostage by Hamas coping I think one of the biggest problems they face at the moment is uncertainty because a lot of those relatives told me it's very difficult for them to to obtain any sort of information all they are told by T authorities is to sit and wait and that may have something to do with the general situation that there is not much information or there is confusing information so I had the chance to talk to one of the key negotiators who was involved in the in freeing the last group of hostages and he said there's now reports that Hamas denies that those eight people are in their hands and he says that may be a sign that they have been abducted by another group or that uh the fact that they are still abducted is simply denied so there's a lot of uncertainty here and of course for those families these are all unsettling facts tell us about the impact that you see the abductions have had on Thai Society more broadly as well well all of this obviously came as a huge shock for for Thailand uh 39 people dead almost the same number five people less abducted at least these are the official numbers and and of course this sheds a lot of light on the fact that there are these huge numbers of Migrant workers some 30,000 who have gone to Israel now the question or the debate that has started it is why are people taking opportunity over security why are they taking those risks and and the answer is at least that is what the head of the labor department in urani in this Northeastern Province told me is that simply they make a lot of money and uh they make up to five times what they can earn at home um and how you can address that and how how you can offer Alternatives is very difficult because I said for instance maybe education is the answer for that region but then I was told even academics are going abroad to Korea to Israel to Taiwan because there is this deal with these countries and they make so much money Thai officials say that they were involved in negotiating uh the negotiating process that led to the release of a number of Thai hostages back in November is Thailand still making efforts for the release of the Thai hostages still held in Hamas I mean what what sort of role are they playing in in all of these negotiations that are ongoing yeah the foreign Ministry has just announced that efforts are made to push uh for their release uh now the person who has been involved tightly in those negotiations in the past told me at the moment there is no contact and and he also told me that Hamas actually made no demands or requests uh to release um the the hostages in the past however the foreign Ministry in Thailand has now announced that uh it appears that a ceasefire has become a precondition or a demand uh for further talks so no talks taking place at this moment DW Asia Pacific bureau chief G Mattis thank
