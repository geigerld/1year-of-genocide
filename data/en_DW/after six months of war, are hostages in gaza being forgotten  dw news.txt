6 months to the day since the Hamas Terror attacks on Israel vigils are taking place around the world to commemorate the victims in Jerusalem thousands have gathered to remember the 1,400 killed and the more than 200 kidnapped they're also calling on the government to bring home around 130 people still being held hostage in Gaza our correspondent Aman essv joins us now from a vigil taking place in jus Jerusalem Aman it must be quite an emotional Gathering what have you been hearing this is a very somber Affair uh the people gathered here well over a thousand in Jerusalem but also a thousand more in tviv and other cities around Israel they've gathered to commemorate to honor uh the hostages uh those still held captive by Hamas over 130 still held captive uh we are hearing testimony from families right now and you can see the crowd behind me um it goes on about 500 met behind me and another few hundred meters in front of me um we're hearing testimony from families of those hostages still held captive now they give often a very somber account of what they've gone through what their loved ones are going through now but a lot of times these accounts these testimonies end with the chant bring them home now and when they chant this there's anger in their voice because a lot of people here in Israel uh cannot believe that after six months of War a very bloody war in Gaza uh that these hostages have still not been uh brought back safely well Aman of course also taking place this weekend are negotiations between Israeli delegation and also Hamas uh in Cairo um the aim is to negotiate some sort of uh hostage release deal temporary ceasefire what can you tell us about what's happening this [Music] weekend well the hostage negotiations are um going to uh take place Israel is actually going to send a delegation which is not a given there have been several occasions where Israel did not send a delegation to these talks in Cairo but some Israeli officials have warned that uh by sending a delegation they might get up the hopes to to to raise the hopes of hostages families without returning anything that's because a lot of people a lot of officials in Israel don't believe that if hamas's demands remain the same uh that there's any chance of a deal Netanyahu has been very clear that if Hamas continues to demand that troops are withdrawn completely from Gaza before any hostage deal goes through before any release of Israeli hostages uh that he would not agree to that so uh there's some hope now that Israeli delegation is going to Cairo that some breakthrough might happen but a lot of people still don't have hope that anything um will happen in the near future as long as netanyahu's government is in power and as long as uh they're uh um basically taking a hard line against tamas that was our correspondent amian essf in Jerusalem Aman thank you so much for your reporting joining us now is Alon G his mother kerit was killed during the October 7th attacks his wife yardan was kidnapped and spent 54 days in captivity in Gaza before being released but his sister Carmel is still being held hostage welcome to DW and thank you for taking the time to speak to us what are your feelings today on this six-month anniversary of the Hamas Terror attacks and the kidnapping of your family members so hello uh um we just saw a video that shows you things that happened on October 7th and after that and I just want to tell you uh for you to understand that uh those people at the party you saw them running and some of them were murdered some of them are my friends the uh uh the misses that been shot at Israel in the last 10 years this is Miss that were appointed at my family at at me and at me um for many years when I lived in kibuts Berry until October 7th and the people that were kidnapped this is my myself as well with my daughter three years old geffin that was kidnapped uh with me and with my wife yardan and with my sister carel and with my mother K that my mother K was murdered in the kibo and my sister Kam was kidnapped two guys and your then that was kidnapped and was released in the first humanitarian deal so those those images that you see not as just just random people this is this is my family this is uh friends of mine and this is what you need to understand it's much more complex and much more um um it's it's more complex than what what you just see photo it's it's it's people and what have been done in October 7 this is something that we and we can't accept and we have to stop this uh this violence that it's now in now in Israel but later on it will continue to other places I imagine you must have been Overjoyed when your wife was released from captivity but at the same time as we've mentioned your sister is still being held hostage somewhere in Gaza have you had any sign of life or received any information on her condition so about my sister camel uh the only information we have is from other hostages that were kidnapped with her and that were released in the first humanitarian deal uh the only deal that was happened um and uh from them we understood that they were together and Kamel so uh when they exit the kibuts Cel so the body of my mother lying in her own pool of blood uh um that was murdered the few minutes before and uh from there they continue into Gaza STP and they were uh they were locked in a in a house with the terrorist and uh Cel initiated their uh Yoga practices and mindfulness and they wrote a diary together and lifted one another uh up when one was in a bad condition but after 50 days they were released and the door was shut behind Cam and C stayed there by herself 39 years old occupational therapist uh a woman that are suffering there every second six months on much of the International Community is now focused on the immense destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinian civilians there do you feel that this has taken attention away from the plight of the hostages of course people need to understand it first of all those people those civilians in Gaza we don't want to harm them we want the the best for them and some of those people this is families that used to work in kibuts B and we I personally used to donate money to those families uh for the PE for their families in Gaza um until October 7th and um we care about them and you need to understand that the most uh humanitarian Cris that we have in Gaza Strip This is the hostages that are locked in basement in tunnels and that there is sexual abuses and there is a violence over there that we know that there were was violence with the hostages that were with carel that all of them were suffering from violence from the guards and it's continuing this was 50 Day Day 50 and now we are in day 184 after half a year think about the the the violence that going on over there right now the sexual abuses and this is something that we can't accept and we need to release those hostages as soon as possible this is the first step of fixing the situation in Gaza and to get rid of Hamas which is a terrorist organization that it's not just they are not pointing at Israel uh only they told here then that she was in captivity they told her that Israel was only the beginning and the rest of the western world is next and when they understood that um she's a German citizen they told her don't don't worry in Germany we have a lot of Kamas people and they will be next so this is a a global radicalism Islamic uh movement that uh they want to get to all of the world and I'm not telling you that to scare you but I think that the next place could be here in Germany and you need to understand that that Israel can't be a president that nobody doing anything about those oages that are now in captivity and we need to take care of that and this is the first step of getting a relief and getting to a better situation in Gaza so what do you think needs to happen for Hamas to agree to release your sister and all the other hostages first of all this is the the most humanic this the the natural thing to do isn't it they already took innocent people from their beds and draw them into into Gaza and now they are abusing them of course this is the the the right thing to do is to release theages and what we are going to Israel is going to is going to give uh uh in return terrorist that murdered people in Israel this is the people that uh that we are going to release and bring instead of those hostages that are innocent people and this is the the situation that now we are don't have other choice to agree on because they are holding our beloved ones that was Alan got a family member of hostages still being held in Gaza thank you so much for your time and all the best for your family if I can add one more thing yes yeah go ahead um I just want to to say that uh we are feeling the support here in Germany um from the German people and from the government uh we are feeling the support uh towards Israel and we are so appreciated uh for that and um we I'm urging you to to keep keep uh this support and helping us in releasing those suest that mean to press Hamas and to provoke Hamas uh on his acts all right alen God many thanks again for for your time thank you and now many Is railers are questioning their government staging Mass rallies Saturday urging a deal to release Hamas health hostages and calling for new elections tens of thousands blocked the streets in Tel Aviv and across Israel their anger pointed directly at the country's leaders demonstrations against prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government were common before the war and flared back up as the conflict dragged on a call for fresh elections growing louder and more urgent we demand that election will be set as soon as possible because this government is doing everything they can to destroy this country the demonstrations are focused on the safety and future of Israel while not anti-war some protesters have voiced unease with the way Israel has conducted its assault on Gaza this country must exist we don't have another country but we have to be a good country a moral country that's that protects itself but acts according to human rights at the heart of the rallies is a demand to free all remaining hostages held in Gaza as people gathered for a weekend of protests Israel said Special Forces had recovered the body of L Kia the 47-year-old died while held captive in the Palestinian territory his family say they believe he could have been saved if the Israeli government had struck a deal the families of other hostages hope that it's not too late for Israel to change Tac and save their loved
