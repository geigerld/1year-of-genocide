a day after repelling hundreds of missiles and drones fired by Iran Israel is weighing its response and says the conflict is not over prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu has met with his War cabinet observers say ministers favor retaliating but are divided over when and how to strike back Iran launched more than 300 weapons but nearly all were shot down by Israel the US UK and Jordan world leaders are urging restraint on all sides US President Joe Biden has told Netanyahu Washington will not participate in any military retaliation Tran says its assault was measured and justified in response to an earlier attack on its Consulate in Damascus flashes in the sky over Jerusalem and ion doome in action this footage shows the interception of missiles and drones launched by Iran after the first ever direct military attack on Israel from Iranian territory concern is growing over a possible further escalation Israeli War Cabinet member Benny Gans made a defiant statement that did little to elay those fears this incident is not over we will build a regional Coalition and collect the price from Iran in a way and at a time that suits US US President Joe Biden reaffirmed what he called America's Ironclad commitment to to the security of Israel but the White House added Biden had told Netanyahu that the US would not participate in any Israeli counter offensive against Iran in tan prover Iranians took to the streets to celebrate the wave of strikes against Israel the elite revolutionary guard says the overnight assault was a response to a deadly air strike on the Iranian Embassy compound in Syria earlier this month which killed several of its most senior commanders Iran's to the United Nations wrote on social media that its attack on Israel can be deemed concluded the Iranian foreign minister made a statement after the attack that seemed to be aimed at giving assurance that tan was not looking to escalate the conflict we notified our brothers in the region where the United States has military bases in their countries that our goal is only to punish the Israeli regime and that we are not seeking to Target American bases in the region but as Israel says its confrontation with Iran is not over that may do little to calm fears of a full-scale regional War let's go to Jerusalem now where DW correspondent Aman ISF is standing by foris Aman good to see you so what has come out of the Israeli War cabinet meeting well not much of anything that answers the questions that are on the minds of most Israelis right now and uh the World At Large for that matter uh there has been no uh publicized decision about how exactly Israel is going to respond to this Iranian response of course this was a reprisal for the uh Israeli attack um the attack that they did not claim on the Damascus Consulate in Syria um where Iran generals were killed uh that's important context uh for this but Israel is trying to decide on a reprisal now and we didn't get many answers out of that cabinet meeting what we did get was a statement from Benny gance that said uh that Israel was going to retaliate uh but it was going to do it on its own terms and on its own time frame uh and it was going to do it with an International Coalition now what's interesting here is that a columnist a well-respected columnist in Israel said uh according to sources if that meeting had been publicized if it had BR been broadcast on YouTube you would have had 4 million Israelis headed for benan airport and tell aiv to head out of the country uh so that's gives you an idea of the the kind of reprisals that were being debated there but it seems for now cooler heads have prevailed all right but do we have any idea Aman what could that retaliation look like then well it could be anything on a spectrum from a massive attack to knock out uh Iranian uh nuclear weapons or budding nuclear uh facilities uh it could also be something small it could be another assassination or an attack on Iranian proxies of course the far right here um and there is a very far right uh in the government in Israel uh um Ben gavier Ben gavier excuse me uh from the far right uh party is has been calling for Israel to go berserk uh so it gives you an idea of what he wants to see happen but of course the war cabinet contains not only liud which is right-wing that's netanyahu's party but also Centrist uh so uh it seems that there's still a debate there and we don't know which side of the spectrum this reprisal is going to fall on although they said there will be something is Israel likely to heed calls for restraint from the US and others it seems that they already have um a 24-hour period that was closely watched has closed now and it seems that after a phone call between Netanyahu and uh US President Joe Biden um instead of retaliating immediately what Israel did was call A A U uh un security conference meeting uh to gather the International Community around it seems that they're seeking International legitimacy for whatever they do next so that is a form of restraint now the president Isaac Herzog also said we are acting restrained we know what the consequences are um but of course when they say that they are going to retaliate that puts a lot of people on high alert uh because Iran said if there is any retaliation for this retaliation in other words Iran wanted it to be over now if there's any kind of retaliation then they would strike back even harder with more missiles more ballistic missiles more drones and uh maybe even damage Israel in a way that it hadn't been able to do in this last attack 10th times Aman DW correspondent Aman ISF in Jerusalem for thanks well leaders of the G7 Nations have condemned Iran's attack on Israel in a video meeting called by President Biden they also urged Iran to exercise restraint the G7 says it will work to prevent an uncontrollable Regional escalation and will seek an immediate and Lasting ceasefire in Gaza the UN Secretary General Antonio gues has warned the International Community against descending deeper into conflict speaking at an emergency session of the UN Security Council he said the region cannot afford a wider War it's time to step back from the brink it's vital to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East civilians are already bearing the brunt and paying the highest price and we have a shared responsibility to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation let's get some analysis now Alex vatanka is director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC welcome to DW news so was this an attack was this attack excuse me a strategic success for Iran well yes in away and no yes in the sense that um they came out after 1 of April strike by Israel under Damascus and said they would have to retaliate in kind meaning because they considered uh the embassy compound in Damascus to be Iranian soil they said they would have to uh strike Israel on its soil and that's basically what they have tried to do here although as you have heard uh in the reports uh that about 99% uh uh of all those uh missiles and drones were intercepted um I do have to point out uh that yes again in terms of Iran doing this for the first time they have started a new chapter in this enmity with Israel uh but I have to also as an analyst believe that the way Iran carried this operation suggests to me that they didn't really want this to escalate any further this is what they're saying publicly but their actions before and also showed that was the case I mean in any military operation you don't give days of advanced warning you don't send off small uh slow moving drones that give your enemy uh plenty of time to prepare so they wanted to make a point they wanted to strike Israel but they wanted to make sure the damage was such that didn't necessarily necessitate an Israeli retaliation in kind and Iran's hope right now clearly is that this is the end of this round and they want to move on all right you said it but the Iranian foreign minister has said the attack was aimed only at Israel and not at the US so what does that tell us well that just tells us the United States in a pretty uh you know bad position in a way because he has to mediate in a in a conflict between an ally Israel and an opponent called Iran uh that doesn't really want to even talk to the United States directly but nonetheless both Iran and the United States as as as bizarre as it sounds have one thing in common neither side wants to get into a regional conflict and both sides recognize a simple fact that Iran Israel conflict will not be limited to Iran and Israel and invariably United States very well will be forced to enter that conflict which as again we've heard over the weekend the Biden Administration clearly clearly is not interested and it's doing everything he can to prevent that now with this attack Global attention has turned away uh from the war in Gaza so has this helped Israel do you think look you know you could you could say that uh that might turn out to be the case not not in the short term we've heard Israeli officials talking about what is Iran did to them this weekend as providing Israel with what the Israeli leaders are calling strategic leverage and the building of a new international and Regional Coalition against Iran now if you do that and if you're success F in doing that then absolutely this will be a a win for for Israel in the long term but it's not going to help them in the short term in their in their operations in Gaza and the regional and international opposition they face in the way they've carried themselves uh so far um so there you have it okay but could Iran's attack on Israel uh reshape alliances or power at all in the region um not in the short term look I think for example let me give you one concrete example if this Iranian attack uh is for example seen by Israel to reenergize the mood say in the Gulf States countries like Saudi Arabia to look at at normalizing relations with Israel to sort of go back to where they were before the Gaza crisis then I think it's way too premature to assume that uh our public opinion uh is still very much upset about what's going on in Gaza uh that doesn't mean they like the Iranian approach to it Israel at all in fact we've seen Arab countries very silent and in some cases in the case of Jordan actively participating against this Iranian operation and this is actually a separate point but a very fundamental point I do wonder if Iranian leaders now in tyan need to take a moment and think about what it is they're seeking to do with Israel because their enmity towards Israel is an ideological Mission there on Iran is not an Arab country Palestine doesn't need to be an Iranian cause and the Arab world doesn't want Iran to take the leadership on this all these are tough questions the Iranian leaders have to answer particularly given that Iranian public opinion is very much opposed to what Iran is doing in the region and its position on Israel all right we don't have a whole lot of time but briefly if you could what do you expect to see happening next I think uh what we've heard so far from the Israelis clearly is that the United States is telling them right now you can call it a win you can call it a major spectacular military success and call it a day and move on we'll come back to Iran but we need to time to figure it out it's not something we will do in days or weeks it's a major project uh and for that reason I think the Americans would Prevail the Israelis cannot do this on their own really in a successful way so they have to wait for that American uh preparedness to come to their aid and do whatever it else that needs to be done in the long term down the road uh but it won't happen in the short term thanks Alex Alex vatanka from the Middle East Institute in Washington DC for
