ahead of Anthony blinken's visit to Israel today DW Washington bureau chief Enis pole talked to Nathan treack Deputy spokesman at the US Department of State about the United States plans to press for a humanitarian pause in the Israel Hamas War Nathan Tech thank you so much for making time for deell thank you so much glad to be here so uh the US Administration is Seeking a pass in the fighting between Israel and Hamas how can in the US government influence prime minister Netanyahu who doesn't seem to slow down well just to clarify what we're looking for is not just a single pause but rather pauses and in fact as my colleague Matt Miller the department spokesperson has noted before we have seen in effect defacto pauses in the past to ensure for example that humanitarian Aid can enter in Via truck through the Rafa gate into Gaza and at the same time we've seen pauses to ensure that American hostages uh can get released and leave Gaza as well so our goal when we say humanitarian pause is to ensure that military operations do not interfere with the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the civilians who need it uh do not interfere with the the with the release of hostages or with the exit of foreign Nationals stuck in Gaza who are just trying to go home so is prime minister Netanyahu kind of listening to the wishes of the US government well uh look at the end of the day we enjoy a very strong relationship with Israel and that strong relationship allows us to be in a position to offer our Israeli friends advice and the best practices of our own experience in fighting terrorism and that's exactly what we're doing uh we are making clear to the Israelis that as democracies we have a responsibility to take every measure to ensure that uh uh human life is preserved civilian life is preserved that the international uh uh humanitarian law is respected and protected unfortunately by the way it's just important to note that Hamas of course has shown no regard for international humanitarian law so the Burden Burden is not solely on Israel here right it's in fact important to note uh that Israel is responding to a Despicable brutal terrorist attack that took place on October 7th no country no sovereign country would AC would accept or do nothing in the face of that kind of an attack and Israel is simply exercising the right it has and the obligation it has to defend itself the Arab Muslim Community here uh in the United States is Raising concerns uh frustration um about President Biden being in such strong s support of prime minister netan and some are saying no we won't vote for him again next year what does that mean for the president well uh we don't do politics here at the state department uh but there's certainly no question as I said before the United States is a diverse and vibrant democracy people have a wide range of views and they exercise those views at The Ballot Box uh I think what's important also to note is that of course we have lots of friends and partners in the Arab world in the Muslim World overseas uh We've engaged in robust almost daily conversations with our partners in the Arab world about this issue uh and we're grateful for those relationships that we have and we're going to continue to work with uh allies and partners uh including countries like Egypt Jordan Qatar uh and others uh to ensure that we can protect Palestinian civilians and ensure that Israel maintains its right to exist and defend itself secretary of state blinkin is right now traveling in this region how big is the fear that the conflict spreads and might also bring terrorism back to the United States well our goal of course is to stop this conflict from spiraling from spreading Hamas is doing everything it can to pull in other uh Regional uh countries to uh destabilize the entire Middle East uh we of course firmly oppose that and part of the reason why this is the secretary's I believe third trip in just a matter of a few weeks to the region is because he is so firmly committed to doing everything we can using the tools of diplomacy to ensure that this conflict does not spread throughout the region what does this conflict in Israel mean for the conflict for the war in Ukraine well uh as we like to say in the United States we can walk and chew gum at the same time we can do two things at the same time we're a great nation and we've got great Partnerships and alliances around the world as well uh the United States will continue to provide Ukraine with what it needs to do what it takes to defend itself from Russia's brutal unprovoked uh an illegal further Invasion uh our goal continues to be to provide Ukraine with with what it needs militarily diplomatically and economically uh to ensure that it can defend its own sovereignty we have not forgotten Ukraine Ukraine is still at the top of the agenda and even with the new speaker in the house who kind of uh is saying pretty much the opposite from what you are saying what would be your message to ukrainians can ukrainians rely on the United States uh the ukrainians can absolutely rely on the United States President Biden has made that clear secretary blinkin has made that clear uh and uh the Ukraine can also appreciate the fact that we built a very strong set of alliances uh strengthen NATO like it's never been strengthened before uh and uh and a broad Coalition of countries of over 50 countries in fact who are working to provide Ukraine with what it needs to defend its sovereignty thank you very much thank you appreciate it let's now speak to journalist kareim El goari who is in Cairo uh Kareem US Secretary of State uh blinkin is in Israel to Presser humanitarian pauses in Gaza what would those pauses mean for the transit at the Rafa border of course the uh poses or a pause as the Arab world is demanding it would make a big difference because uh it is very difficult to move within the Gaza Strip right now um towards for example the Rafer border and it would make it much easier to get humanitarian Aid in and injured people out as it's happening now but in small numbers for example we had like roughly a bit more than 500 trucks since the beginning coming into the Gaza Strip that was the amount of trucks that was before the war needed every day in Gaza we understand uh you met with some people who managed to leave the Gaza Strip what have they told you yeah it's a group of austrians who were evacuated from the Gaza Strip uh two days ago and they managed to talk to them they T me basically like how difficult it was to coordinate this whole evacuation within the Gaza Strip with the communication of and down was often having no electricity having no internet so that was the first Big Challenge they talked about the relief when they came out walked through this gate in Rafa coming out with their family in safety but at the same time saying okay we left all our old life behind and then they were talking about the situation in Gaza he was telling me for examp the story that he with his family every night there is no shelter or nothing when the bombardments are on and he said they were basically lying all he his daughter six and N years old and the family were lying in one bed with the argument when the house is bombed then we are dying all together or we surviving all together that's the strategies of people in Gaza right now oh my goodness um besides uh preparing regular hospitals Egypt is building a field Hospital in the Sin close to the border with Gaza will it be enough to care for the many critically wounded people being transported there well it it once they really transported in big numbers because until now it's not many the field Hospital right besides not far away has 50 beds but they already dispersing injured they are coming now to CYO to ismia to other hospitals in Egypt so that's not the problem the problem is H to transport them out of Gaza there are lists prepared by the doctors in for example the shiffer hospital in Gaza coordinating with the Egyptians who can come of course the heavily injured cannot be transported but they're trying to get some kind of relief in the Gaza Strip with a health sector that is more or less is collapsing or on the verge of collapse so this we will probably see more injured people coming out of the Gaza Strip in the next days as you well know Kim uh hezbollah's leader Hassan nazali is due to make his first public uh comment since the beginning of the war what can we expect to hear yeah that is a moment of real tension I just came back from Lebanon two days ago and we could see already the trailers in television on social media of this speech saying like the promises will be fulfilled in similar things so we're waiting what's going to happen uh this speech is going to be this afternoon there is basically three possibilities uh he might generally speak about the excess of resistance which is Hamas and hisbah against Israel and just be keep being on vague and trying to bind as many Israeli forces in the north as possible he might determine some red lines the Israelis are not to overstep and and then hisb might start a war or he might order to press the button so we really don't know until now both forces the Israeli side and the hisbah are basically in an escalating way shooting to each other at the border but still staying in their normal Rules of Engagement which means that everything until now area very quickly I heard you say third option he might press the button did I hear you correctly and what do you mean by that pressing the button means that he would start a war and of course hisb has a huge missile Arsenal and start using it but I think this is probably the most unlikely scenario Ahmed alandari is the World Health organization's Regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean uh he joined us earlier from Cairo and I asked him whether he expects Egypt to accept further injured people for treatment good morning Claire thank you very much for giving me the opportunity yes definitely you know this this is based on our discussion with the president you know ABD fatahi three weeks back when Dr tedras and I met him uh and also after that you know we have been arranging with the health authorities here in Egypt as well as the red Cresent in fact you know to receive as as many as possible number of patients wounded patients and children and women for further treatment um Mike Ryan who is the Deputy the executive director of the emergency department was here last week uh from Geneva and we have had several meetings including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as minister of health and BR Cresent where will people there be treated I'm curious what resources are available and which facilities in Egypt they have they have prepared themselves very well Mike Ryan visited Alish sa hospitals there in that area uh they have a several hospitals in fact prepared to receive different types of casualties patients with different types of illnesses uh they have very good capacity ambulances you know with with equipped with all you know necessary equipments and machines Mike Ryan visited that place and he came back very positive about it now um I we've had media reports that Egypt is building a hospital for the injured uh in Sinai um can you give us any insight into how that process is going and how many people it would be able to receive yeah I mean based on our discussion with them they are preparing themselves to to receive currently now at this position more than 15,000 patients of different types of you know illnesses as you said they have established a field Hospital in addition to the current hospitals they have in in in sa um equipped with stuff with ambulances with machines drugs um and they they coordinate with us with red Cresent with other agencies as well now I understand that you personally have also just been to Beirut meeting with officials there to discuss preparing lebanon's health system in case hostilities do spill over into Southern Lebanon um at this point how well equipped is lebanon's Health System to deal with possible casualties thank you for this question clear in fact as we all know Lebanon has been you know undergoing very severe political as well as economic crisis uh you know the country have been facing a very tough time when it comes into the health system so the visit there I met the Prime Minister Health minister of health and other agencies and I visited uh several locations um they are trying their level best you know to prepare themselves for whatever scenarios uh you know making sure that you know their hospitals are well equipped we distributed supplies to several hospitals we have made training of healthcare staff uh you know and and we are trying to secure finan funds you know to support the health system in coordination with other un agencies donors and partners so it sounds like a lot of work and funds are needed uh to be able to bring it up to enough capacity to to deal with that possibility um can you tell me a little bit more about what is being done to bolster its capabilities um as I have mentioned you know we have been coordinating with the minister of Health for training of Staff nurses uh we established the Emergency Operating centers with a command by the Prime Minister you know for the whole of government sectors uh we have being coordinating with other un agencies to provide Supply like for example with UNICEF I uncr uh you know to different hospitals we have been strengthening the surveillance system uh to make sure that you know if if God forbidden there is a public health threat we can identify these threats and act fast on it uh we have been providing supplies like drugs you know trauma kits emergency kits to several hospitals in in distributed in the country but mainly at the areas that we expect you know that the conflict is is more there for more let's now speak to Julet tumar the director of communications for Ana the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestinian refugees she joins us now from Jordan's capital Aman Juliet the commissioner general of unra visited Gaza and said that he has never seen any anything like it paint a picture of what he saw Yes uh he did say that it was a very very sad day for him um one of the saddest in his uh humanitarian service and he's been doing that sort of work for nearly 30 years now um he was very sad to see the people of Gaza the Palestinian community in Gaza so stripped of the dignity all they were asking for was a sip of water and a piece of bread um it is safe to say that we've never ever seen Gaza in such a desperate situation as we have a few days ago as more than 1 million people have been forced to f their homes our own staff included our own resources stretched to the the limits the limits of the limits it's unprecedented Israel says it has essentially besieged Gaza City how many people do you estimate are still in the city and what are they Facing The Siege is across the Gaza Strip not only Gaza City the whole Gaza Strip from north to south is under siege which means that very very very very little Aid and assistance is coming in uh and including those trucks that are a drop in the ocean that really do not correspond at all to the overwhelming needs of uh the people it is very very hard for people to get out of Gaza um this has come on top of a 16e long blockade that Gaza has been going through your Secretary of State uh blinkin is in Israel to press for humanitarian pauses in Gaza what is it that you require in that deal in order to provide effective help on the ground given that unre facilities have been also hit in air strikes anra has been calling for many long weeks now for a humanitarian ceasefire this is long overdue we have lost 72 colleagues of of hours including most recently our colleague ma who is herself displaced she also had physical disabilities and she was working with us as a software developer she was killed with members of her family we are calling for a humanitarian ceasefire once again our calls have been falling on deaf ears and we're asking how many more and how much more suffering grief and loss how much more a ceasefire is very much needed for Humanity but to the extent that you can get particular and specific about this you've also been hit your infrastructure has been damaged uh how long does that ceasefire need to be imagine you get one what do you actually need from all the forces here in order to do the work that you do how long is the ceasefire forever the ceasefire needs to last and as for our facilities yes 50 of our facilities of un facilities among them schools as well but also our headquarters in Gaza City they have been impacted during this war and only yesterday you may have seen four schools that were Sheltering around 20,000 people have been damaged because of the bombardment and because of the ongoing War it had those un facilities I had un flags on them we share the coord with parties to the conflict and there were people who were killed including children who were seeking shelter and safety in un facilities I'm curious about something speaking to the media your unra Chief said that quoting now hunger is turning into anger and that civilians in Gaza have absolutely nothing are people already Starving in Gaza they're certainly getting hungry sir they're certainly getting hungry the markets are emptying up uh our own supplies are running out those um the the trickle of Aid that has been coming into Gaza since the 21st of October is by far not enough is by far not enough we have been giving wheat flour to bakeries but also the bakeries are running out of cooking G and they're running out of fuel this is exactly why we've been asking for Urgent shipments of fuel that is uh Juliet Tuma the director of communications for anra many many thanks
