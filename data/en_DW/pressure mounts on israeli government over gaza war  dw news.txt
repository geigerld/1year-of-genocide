the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is facing mounting pressure within Israel amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the increasingly dire humanitarian situation there this was the scene in Tel Aviv late Saturday where thousands of people gathered to protest against the country's leadership they are calling for new elections it's now more than 3 months since Israel launched its counter offensive in Gaza after the unprecedented crossboard attacks by Hamas on October 7th Hamas is classified as a terrorist organization by multiple countries let's talk to our DW correspondent in Jerusalem Rebecca ritters Rebecca great to see you again uh thousands of people are protesting against Israel's leadership what exactly are the demonstrators demanding yeah that's right Michael we saw multiple protests across the country country last night that one in Tel Aviv that you speak of that is certainly the largest of the ones that we saw yesterday and it's something we've been seeing every week uh since the beginning of this conflict people coming out there to demand uh largely different strategy to the way that the hostage situation is being dealt with and that's something those calls growing louder and louder the longer uh people these hostages remain inside Gaza fam is becoming increasingly anxious and increasingly angry towards the government we're definitely seeing calls for fresh elections calls for the government to stand down we saw other protests in other cities such as hia even in uh caesaria which is where prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a private residence there were people outside his house campaigning protesting uh for him to stand down people increasingly across Israel frustrated with the way that he's been handling this many saying that he's doing everything he can to save his own political bacon and he's not taking uh what they see is the most important thing of course the hostages uh and trying to get the hostages out of Gaza he's not taking that seriously enough uh we're also seeing other protests we saw um protests yeah calling for him uh to stand down anti- government protests but these are in no by no means anti-war protests there is still a great deal of support for the war aims the war aim of dismantling and destroying Hamas completely making sure they are no longer a threat to Israeli society and Israelis but the way in which that Benin Netanyahu is carrying these aims out is something that people are becoming increasingly angry about Rebecca Netanyahu issued a statement Saturday essentially saying he opposed A Palestinian sovereignty it seems to contradict US President Joe Biden's description of his telephone conversation with Netanyahu earlier yeah these statements are not a surprise for Benjamin Netanyahu he said it even before uh this whole situation began on October 7 this was a longstanding stand of his saying that that Israel needed to maintain uh security over the entire region and that uh runs in conflict with a Palestinian state or Palestinian sovereignty certainly uh that's something that he's maintained we have been seeing a lot of pressure from the US that a two-state solution that a diplomatic solution is the only way forward and that things must start to develop towards forming a Palestinian State and then you know there was of course a lot of disagreement people thinking that that was not how the government was was U leaning here in Israel but then we had that conversation between US President Biden and Netanyahu on Friday and them you know the White House certainly signaling that Benjamin Netanyahu made noises or or or made suggestions in that phone call that he was open to that two-state solution as you say now coming out with conflicting messaging saying that he isn't that's really you know flying in the face of US President Biden he staunches Ally Biden uh you know through his own political um you know it has not looked good for him domestically politically to stand so strongly uh by Israel he's cing a lot of flak both in the US and internationally for it and yet he maintains that and now we see prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu coming out against his statements so very interesting to see where will all lead Michael that's Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem many thanks Rebecca and for more on this we can speak now to abian she is an American Israeli living in Tel Aviv two members of her family were killed in the October 7th terror attack three others were taken hostage two were released but one is still being held hostage in Gaza Abby thank you so much for taking the time uh to speak to us um can you tell me more about what happened to your family thank you for having me yes on October 7th um in the middle of the chaos we understood from family text messages on Whatsapp that our family was hearing gunfire and Arabic and um people being killed around them and that they were scared for their lives and later that evening when the military finally got to near Oz the kots in which they lived uh there were five family members that were unaccounted for and are are working assumption was that they were missing or had been taken hostage on October 8th we had video confirmation of my cousin's son in the hands of Kamas it was a video that Hamas indeed uploaded um and so then we we went really with the notion that they had been taken hostage 10 days into the war we got confirmation that two of the bodies had been found uh not on the kots and that my 80-year-old cousin Carmela Dan and her 13-year-old granddaughter had been murdered by Hamas and 52 days in into the war during the kind of big exchange of prisoners for hostages my cousins two children 12-year-old Aras and 16-year-old Sahar were returned but their father ofer who is 53 remains on day 107 in uh captivity okay well thank you for sharing that story I know it must be incredibly painful to keep keep reliving it um uh just as regards the freeing of the hostages and the pressure that's coming along uh onto the government in these big demon ations we were just reporting on um do you think that the government is going about freeing them in the right way does there need to be a change in policy somehow I think that there's some sort of split in the war cabinet of people who believe that the hostages should be the first priority and people who believe that the um eradication of Hamas should be the first priority I think as a member of a hostage family as someone who lives in Israel that bringing the hostages home has to be be the first priority that there's no winning there's no success which I don't think there's winning in the situation anyway but there's no way forward for Israel without the release of every single one of the hostages alive and dead and as regards the pro protest and and the hostage families I was reporting myself recently in Israel and these families are an emerging political force that the government can't really ignore do you think they're going to be able to have effect on on government policy as they continue to demonstrate I hope so I mean we're we're after a year of protesting in this country with regard to the judicial reform and I think in the aftermath of October 7th we saw a lot of unity uh with which hadn't been the case and I think now we're seeing this split again which is these families are saying you have to put the hostages you have to put our family members first and and the call for net Yahoo to step aside and for elections I think that as Israelis we're in one of our hardest moments because we as a country want peace we want a two-state solution we want to live next to a Palestinian state that is being run by a government to acknowledges Israel's right to exist and the main challenge to that is that we don't have a partner at that table you talk of a two-state solution I you know President Joe Biden has been saying that he still thinks it's a viable thing and thinks that prime minister B Netanyahu believes it is as well however Netanyahu just came out uh shortly after speaking with Biden on the phone and saying that's not at all the case as an American citizen would you like to see your American government do more to to pressure Israel to bring it around to that to that perspective you're describing I think so I think at this point that Netanyahu is the only one that's going to be able to come to the table to to make an agreement to release the hostages to at this point right and so if Biden and his um government can help us get there then and I can tell you as an American this our government in the United States has done everything possible to make Israel feel supported to make American families of hostages feel supported carela my cousin that was murdered was in American as well and they have shown up with full force and I think America and Israel have always been strong partners and this is the time to continue to pressure Israel to work in the right direction and for me as a a citizen of both countries that direction has to be the freeing of hostages no matter what right now that's the only step forward and I think that's what has to be both a priority for the United States and for Israel okay Abby thank you so much for your time and for sharing your story Abby on talking to us from Tel Aviv thanks more than 25,000 people have been killed in Gaza according to the Hamas controlled Health Ministry and there are are growing fears of widespread famine and disease among those still trapped there the United Nations is calling for the Urgent scaling up of humanitarian Aid and basic supplies it says only 15 bakeries are still functional across the entire strip one group of volunteers is working to try to fill the Gap it was a staple before the war now bread is the main source of food for gazin but it's in short supply these International Volunteers in Rafa have set up a makeshift Bakery to help feed displaced people still they can't keep up with the demand the bakery produces 22,000 loaves of bread a day we are currently in the process of establishing a second Bakery to double the production and serve a larger number of displaced people in the Gaza Strip around 1 million people have fled to Rafa to escape Israeli bombardments according to the United Nations Rafa's border crossing with Egypt is the main Lifeline for basic supplies like food and water but only a fraction of what's needed is getting [Music] in as famine looms parents feel helpless what matters most for a child is to eat they want to eat more than two three or four times a day because they play outside the tent in the sun all day and come back hungry according to the UN the nutritional needs of children and pregnant women are not being met most babies and toddlers are surviving on just bread and milk fighting in Gaza is hampering vital Aid deliveries humanitarian groups are appealing to Israel to speed up inspections of Aid convoys and to reopen border crossings that were closed in the wake of the October 7 Terror attacks by
