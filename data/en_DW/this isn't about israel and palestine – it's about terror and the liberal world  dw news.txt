women children elderly Holocaust survivals it's beyond my comprehension to be able to imagine what they're thinking beond my comprehension and the last thing I heard was my youngest who's 12 saying don't take me I'm too young and that was it the line went off and they were gone you know a whole world breaks down you don't understand you you don't get it you said she was on the festival what what happened why why do people behave like this none of us want to leave in a world where elders and babies and children and civilians get [Music] kidnapped welcome to the show nearly two weeks after Hamas brutal incursion into Israel the extent of the Havoc they wed is anything but clear today Israeli authorities adjusted the number of hostages taken to over 200 advising families that it's likely to grow even further the military has vowed to do everything possible to bring the hostages home and with more than 40 nationalities represented among the abducted that mission is receiving a lot of international support the head of the United Nations too has called for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages on a wall outside the Israeli defense Ministry in tele Eve and on walls across Israel the images of those taken and missing the Israel government must Focus first of all on doing whatever is necessary in order to release the hijacked people in the October 7th attack Hamas terrorists killed indiscriminately and they kidnapped civilians Soldiers the elderly disabled and children so many children now the hostages are somewhere in the Gaza Strip or under it in the untold hundreds of kilometers of tunnels Hamas has built now there'll be lots of effort put into coordinating identifying locating where the hostages are being kept as much as possible and of course in the background there's talk of potentially hostage rescue attempts but these are very very uh dangerous s with not always a guaranteed chance of success what Hamas recognizes Scott Walker says is that Israel has consistently prioritized the safe return of their citizens Shalom case in point the 19-year-old Israeli soldier held by Hamas for 5 years Israel got him back by giving up more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners to Hamas they always want to take captives they know what captives can do one Israeli soldier gilad Shalit and that's the price that Israel is willing to pay the hostages ruthlessly taken on October 7th and likely guarded now by some of the Hamas kidnappers face a lengthy captivity and indeed the threat of death from the captors the families of those hostages are shaken and Afraid desperate for any word and hopeful that the images of their sisters brothers parents grandparents remain in the Forefront of Israel's moves against Hamas I'm now joined by two relatives of four of the German hostages taken by Hamas it's Ron Roman whose sister was kidnapped and ADI zesi whose aunt and uncle have been taken thank you so much for joining us on tww today let's start with you Ron when did you last hear from your sister and her sister-in-law who's also been taken by Hamas where were they actually I was in h South Africa with my father um when we uh saw the last message from my sister that says that they are all right with the picture of her and her three year three years old uh kid Gein and um at that point actually it's kind of weird to say it but with that it's it's uh usual they they have a routine of alarms getting into the shelter so we wasn't very afraid um but uh as the time passed on we realized that this is very different situation and this is unusual extremely unusual and um since 10:00 a.m. at Saturday morning we haven't heard from her uh what about you AI what what was the last you knew of your uncle and your aunt H so like Ron said on Saturday morning we all woke woke up from missile alarms again not something too unusual but then I heard on the TV that terrorists have broken into Israel and our Massacre are murdering a members of the kibuts near the Gaza strep and then I hear that my cousin is crying on TV saying that her dad ER was pictured in Gaza H that's how I found out you found it on TV yes and and they were in B kibuts one of the sites of of the worst kber ER took a hard hit in this terror attack 114 uh deaths for now and that number just keeps rising and a lot of hostages also from kibuts and it's it's very concerning it's and um my mom is from the kibuts B she grew up there it's such a nice place I used to go there all the time and just seeing those pictures from the kibuts just feels like a nightmare feels like a whole movie Now You unfortunately share this fate with with many other families in Israel right now does it give you any sort of Solace that you can share this Agony that you're in this together well there I will say there there is a lot of solidarity right now H between the people of Israel a lot of people are volunteering to help OT of people were called up to the Army um when before the seventh of October we were divided in Israel ER for politic issues but right now I think it's safe to say that we are all in this together uh it doesn't matter right now about politics we just want to to get this over with to bring our hostage back home and uh to live peacefully yeah and it's a top priority of the government to bring the hostages home have they been in touch with you and your families are they keeping you in the loop are they keeping you informed do they know anything about where your family members are um I think that uh our government uh everyone was really in shocked nobody expect this attack so it took some time for the government to understand and I think that even right now they don't really understand uh we don't know the the final numbers of the people who got murdered of the people who got kidnapped so until now there is a lot of Unknowing um the government is trying to reach us and uh keep us updated but they don't know my sister uh still uh in a status of missing although I'm sure that she's kidnapped I I know it we were uh at the point that she was uh last seen and my brother for five days was in the war field and looking for her no signs of blood and no signs of fight so for sure they just re kidnapped her after she run away and we're waiting for information and we're waiting for a sign of life and that this is also the reason that we are here in Germany because we really do need every help to to to know what is their condition yeah your sister is a German citizen and your uncle is a German citizen your aunt is a German citizen what kind of support have you been receiving from the German government since you arrived here um we arrived here after almost week that uh we were in this insane as you said movie uh in Israel and we just decided that we need Germany by our side and actually not by our side with our side because we are a a German citizens and Germany should be a real active here and a a real actor not only a third party this is a matter also of Germany so we came here and I have to say really we already met uh the chancellor and uh Mr book and a lot of people in the uh Parliament and we really feel a lot of support and commitment to us to to help our loved ones and I really do hope that they will do more than everything that they can uh first of all to bring us a sign of life and then right after then get them released yeah now there is talk about an imminent ground offensive of course also with the aim of of freeing the hostages how do you feel about that because it comes with a lot of danger of course um well I I don't know what to say because I'm I'm not familiar with what the actions should be all I know is I want Israel and Germany as well do anything they can to bring out the hostages uh we don't we don't know what it takes but uh I'm sure uh that you will do anything it takes do you feel hurt at this point um well in Germany I've been here for two days and all we've received his love and support and all the and the politicians we met and also the public H love that we're receiving H it really is comforting ER to be here although there are still anti-semitic actions here in Berlin but that's that's everywhere in the world right now yeah because we we we are not safe everywhere not in Israel and not outside of Israel that is a very unfortunate reality um if you had a message for your sister right now what would it be the only thing that um I think that the only thought that my sister has in her mind right now that uh she doesn't know that Gan is alive her daughter her daughter yeah she doesn't know that she with her father uh succeed to hide and got back to the Army for so this is the only thing that I would tell her because because I know that she knows that I love her I know that she knows that every one of us or her family is doing everything that we can to get her back so I don't need to tell that yeah oh what about you I I just hope they're both safe I hope they're together H I'm really concerned about my aunt as well because rise has a autoimmune disease and she takes a lot of pills medic H medically a lot of pills every day and um it's been two weeks now that she hasn't received any medical attention I assume we don't know and that's why we need the the help of humanitary aid for the hostages as soon as possible because we don't know how much time she has left without those uh without those Medicals their time is running out this is not a event uh that happened in the 7th uh of October this is still uh were still under attack my sister R also and at least uh 200 more adapt uh kidnapped um people they are still under attack and I also would like to say that this is not an issue about Israel and Palestine really it's not this is about Terror and the liberal World they weren't um started a war against our army because of a matter of ideology ideologic uh issues this is innocent people women children old people ill people that are now in a war zone just they need help and they haven't done anything bad and their time is running out ADI thank you so much for sharing your story all the best to you and your families thank you thank you we can now speak to Orie slonim he's an experienced hostage negotiator who's working with the families of the abducted in Israel Mr slum good to have you on the day you have dealt with hostage situations for decades but this is unlike anything Israel has ever seen before isn't it is UN unprecedented uh presidential event not only in Israel in the history of Israel but I believe in worldwide I never I I can never remember or heard of such an event with this scale with this situation of having such a event within war and having in captivity um old ladies old men above the age of 80 um babies one of them I believe is couple of days baby and uh citizens were in a festival in music festival and uh and soldiers which is more it's regular within War but all the rest is something unprecedented it's a real a real kidnapping you know now that you mentioned you know the the the elderly the babies the toddlers uh the f goers why did Hamas take them what is their plan with them I don't know I think I think I don't know I can I can think of of their desire to to hit Israel they are telling that they would like to smash the state of Israel out of this ground and they they are a they are a bunch of people I believe who are worse much worse than Isis we've seen efforts by Qatar who are of course very close to Hamas to have at least Women and Children released is that a Reason for Hope uh first of all I I'm always hoping otherwise I could I couldn't stay in this job so many years H but uh you know it's a it's awful for for our understanding that uh they took such a big big number of hostages they took girls and raped them they they took people and they some of them they they're preventing medicines from old people may preventing food from babies of from couple of days until they have 30 babies there yeah and they killed they killed many they killed many people who don't know the exact number but they kill in in In Cold Blood like I can tell you like like the Nazis yeah and time is is of the essence here you have been involved in many hostage negotiations in your experience what's the toughest part in negotiating with Palestinian militants first of all I think that the the most awful situation in any kidnapping any hostages taking is their family that are living with the uncertain uncertainty H they don't know their their faith they don't know about them especially the old people and the babies but I can tell you that uncertainty is the worst situation of any human being how do you manage their their fears and and expectations because they they pin lots of hopes on the people trying to to free their loved ones so how how go about that not not let them down offer them support but also not create false hopes are you talking about the families here yes ER it's our main main task and we are very experienced ER how to take how to take care and how to treat and how to try to ease their life but there is one thing that you cannot you cannot deal is the the uncertainty how it will end so you're living the whole day and night with you know with this uncertainty and I I use this word a lot because if if you know that even the friend French poet said once that the uncertainty is much more wealth than the ugliest certainty if you have certainty if somebody gives you some some news about your health and he said look you're in a very bad situation it's quite final you try to find the better doctors better pills you have some hope but if you live in uncertainty for for years sometimes times then you don't sleep you don't you don't even breathe it's something which is I believe the the unhuman the most unhuman feeling at our lives L thank you so much for those insights and your
