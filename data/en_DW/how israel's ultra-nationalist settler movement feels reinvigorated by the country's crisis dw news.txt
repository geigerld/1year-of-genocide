while Israel's government has not yet confirmed its post-war plans for Gaza the farri settler movement has been clear about what it wants Israeli Ultra nationalists are calling for the building of settlements in the Gaza Strip once the war is over with Hamas the militant islamist group that launched the terror attacks on Israel on October 7th the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out a resettlement but several members of his government have joined the calls to begin building air strikes and operations on the ground as Israel tries to root out Hamas from Gaza death and destruction throughout the strip but here at a conference in Jerusalem farri Israeli settler organizations are making plans for the day after Daniela Vice is a settler and activist the aim of this assembly is to bring together the people who claim that we have to return to the Gaza Strip and establish Jewish communities right away in the gush katif area in the city of Gaza itself and all over the street the Arabs will not stay in Gaza not the Hamas not the supporters of Hamas and those who do not support Hamas don't want to stay anyway those kinds of plans are not government policy prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel does not intend to Esta Lish a permanent civilian presence in Gaza again but a number of his ministers were at the conference calling for Israeli settlements in Gaza including the national security minister today everyone understands that Retreat brings about war and if we don't want another October 7th we need to return home to Gaza and control the territory to encourage voluntary immigration of Palestinians Mustafa bouti of the Palestinian national initiative told the AL jazer news outlet that this is not a joke these are the people who are making the policy in Israel and they were calling for the complete ethnic cleansing of the people of Gaza in 2005 Israel evacuated its settlements in Gaza the largest of which was called gush katif after a 38-year occupation the evacuation was framed as a move to improve security but Hamas started firing Rockets into Israel soon afterwards building new settlements in Gaza doesn't have majority Israeli support a recent poll found 44% in favor but Netanyahu has not shut down his own Minister's calls for a return he's just said the plans are not realistic those calls have been condemned by Israel's allies Germany and the us some of this rhetoric in the language that that was uh uh attributed to some of these uh ministers at this event uh irresponsible uh Reckless incendiary I'd go so far as to say uh and certainly isn't doesn't comport with our strong policy statement what we have made clear that there can be no reduction in Gaza territory what is it the fact that resettling Gaza is being discussed at all has raised fears that the issue has come out of the fringes and will gain legitimacy meanwhile Daniela Vice told DW she might not wait for permission she wants to lead a group of settlers to start building in Gaza a Ibrahim uh filed this report he she joins us from Jerusalem now Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said publicly that Israel is not planning for a permanent presence in Gaza but the attendance of his ministers at that meeting seems to suggest at least some support of the discussion is he playing both sides there what the Prime Minister has also not done is start formal uh planning or formal conversations within his government about plans for the day after and analysts have been telling me that's because there's a fear that once these conversations really start there will be a a huge break in his uh cabinet because as we've seen in that report there seems to be a lot of differences there what the settler uh leaders of the settler movement have uh told me and told other media Outlets as well is that netanyahu's statements because he said many things about Gaza to them leave a gap of interpretation so while he has said that he thinks that settlements are not uh realistic or a return of settlements in Gaza are not realistic he's also said on multiple occasions that Israel uh needs to maintain security control of the strip and at times he has said that that uh that that the maintenance of that security needs to be uh indefinite he has also uh rejected calls for a two-state solution uh and the return of the Palestinian author authority to the G Gaza Strip as a governing body and what that says to S settlement leaders and uh members uh right-wing members of his cabinet is that there's a room for interpretation that's how they see it and that's why they are organizing at the scale that we just saw in that report and for me what's been astonishing covering the story is um how um the you know the the movement for a call of resettlement has has evolved just in the past couple of weeks it it was always there since the disengagement in 2005 since since Israel pulled out but how far it's made it into um into the mainstream political Spectrum with um ministers even outside even within um uh the prime minister's party has been astonishing in November there was a small conference in the south of Israel with a couple of Fringe figures from the knesset uh there have been more meetings since and then uh from November till uh this uh this weekend where we've seen that huge conference we've seen ministers from the leud at least more than 10 government ministers attend and endorse these plans and that's very alarming the pace uh of this movement and how it has sort of imposed itself on public discourse and the Prime Minister has left a huge vacuum as to what his exact plans are now uh legality and government support aside is there a chance that settlers could also take matters into their own hands I think we have to look out at how the settle the settle the settlers have been acting in the occupied West Bank um to get a little bit of an insight into how they see all of this now the West Bank um is a occupied territory it's been occupied by Israel um since 1967 Israel consecutive Israeli governments but especially this government have supported the building of settlements uh Jewish settlements there which are considered uh illegal under international law but are not illegal under Israeli law Daniela Vice and sort of that group that we've seen in that report they have been also involved in establishing what are called outposts now these are settlements that are even illegal under Israeli law not just international law and they have been successful in getting these outposts recognized and legalized by the government a number of these outposts legalized and recognized by the government after the fact and so again going back to what I was saying earlier what these settlers see they see a gap right they see a a possibility if the prime minister is saying things like we will maintain security control if he's not making def definitive plans that they maybe will get maybe will get to do the same in the Gaza Strip another important thing to note is that um Israel pulled out in two out of Gaza in 2005 under what is called the disengagement law the disengagement law included a pull out of Gaza but also a pull out of uh some settlement communities in the northern West Bank and what some lawmakers have been successful at doing earlier this year earlier last year pardon in March 2003 is repeal part of the disengagement law that pertains to the West Bank so these these four or five settlements in the north of the West Bank um they've managed to get the disengagement law pertaining to them already repealed and then have have returned to them and so they're also fears that now the legal Avenue CH the chipping away of the disengagement law has already started and that they continue to pursue repealing the disengagement law as it pertains to the Gaza Strip the correspondent a Ibrahim in Jerusalem there thank you very much
