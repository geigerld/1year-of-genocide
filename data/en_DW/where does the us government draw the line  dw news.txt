the White House has condemned the loss of life of dozens of civilians as a result of an Israeli air strike in Rafa at the weekend but Washington says it doesn't believe Israel's offensive in Gaza has violated President Joe Biden's declared red line for withholding future transfers of weapons to Israel now Secretary of State Anthony blinkin says that Israel must outline in any case its strategy for bringing the war to an end in the absence of a plan for the day after there won't be a day after a plan the day after that does not leave Israel responsible for Gaza which it says it does not want to be but if it is it will simply have an enduring Insurgency on its hands for as far as one can see into the future or not if not Hamas will be left in charge which is unacceptable or if not we'll have chaos lawlessness and a vacuum that eventually will be filled Again by Hamas or maybe something if it's possible to imagine even worse and we can now speak to Laura Blumenfeld she's a Middle East analyst in New York Times bestselling author who joins us from Washington DC welcome Laura Joe Biden has said in the past that the fullscale Israeli military operation in Gaza would cross a red line is there any clear evidence though that such a red line really exists well you saw what happened today I mean the White House described the latest um unfortunate loss of Civilian lives as heartbreaking but not red line breaking and I think if anybody smudged that let Red Line This week it would be the icj by allowing a little bit of ambiguity in their language they talked about an incursion into Rafa might they use the word might endanger the Palestinians there and Israel with its talmudic interpretation their lawyers quickly got busy saying that you know we won't cause a great loss of life or in this case they were talking about genocide and that left just enough ambiguity um we heard you know John Kirby from the White House say Do not smash into the the the major population centers with the major ground offensive um and so the Israelis were saying we proceed you know with a scalpel not a bone saw Jake Sullivan the National Security Council adviser argued last week that there was no mathematical formula to assessing how big an IDF operation is so the scale will always be subjective where do you see the administration actually drawing its lines well I think there are two important things for the administration not only in terms of their relationship with Israel and Gaza the Palestinians but their their position in the world and the first thing is leadership I mean we are not a go at alone Nation uh Netanyahu said if we have to fight alone we will with our fingernails um Biden represents alliances you know decency versus Revenge so I think the most important thing is where we can maintain our leadership and our alliances with the west and with other you know friendly Nations um you know the second most important thing is that we maintain our moral moral High Ground that's very important to us how do you fight bad and stay good and I think if we see that kind of erosion of the morality um in the battlefield in Gaza that's where we will draw the line that's where we always have and that's in a way also some of the lessons that we're trying to learn and and mistakes we're trying to make up for in terms of our behavior in Iraq and Afghanistan but you know saying that that there's no real way to to assess how big this is using words like smashing into rafo which is Israel is probably not going to do because they know that the world is watching is that not a get out of your obligations free card in a way not at all I actually think that although we're not watching I think the United States actually has Israel by the Scruff of the neck right now I mean as I heard from your previous report about Ukraine in some sense guns are the love language of America to other nations and Israel is heavily dependent on guns and weapons you saw again after this tragic fire in the tent um encampment um with Palestinians on Sunday night uh the Israelis were quick to point out that they Ed the smallest Munitions available a 37 pound bomb I'm sure that was because the United States was saying you know it's our guns it's our ground rules and so I think that even diplomatically at the UN I mean now there's going to be a un uh Security Council resolution to condemn and and to Halt the incursion into Rafa I'm sure the United States is going to exact a price from Israel if they are going to abstain or veto actually I think more likely is what Israel is going to be looking for and they're going to say to Israel okay you know maybe we'll give you that veto at the UN but let's see some flexibility on the hostage deal which the United States really does see as unlocking the whole mass and and the key to to moving forward um or perhaps you know with Aid we'd like to see those 350 trucks which you promised us at least a 100 trucks coming in from the north so I think there are ways that they're using their leverages just behind the scenes because Israel is absolutely depend of the United States at this point yeah this is an election year and there are many people in the US that would like to see the Biden Administration take a more robust stance towards Israel there's also people who are saying that you know the administration is not doing enough to support Israel in this so I want to know from you to what extent is Joe Biden's policy determined by those domestic political pressures and is he always going to lose support whatever he does I I great point the domestic pressure on him Cuts both ways in fact one of the most interesting demonstrations I saw on a college campus was where you had the prop Palestinian uh protesters chanting and the counter protesters chanting the same thing which was F Biden I think for the president the most important thing is not to look weak weak is kind of code for old right because that's one of the biggest problems for him um he's got to show that he's sticking with his ally um we saw Nikki Haley who was potentially going to go into a trump Administration um over there in Israel um you know riding on a shell uh an artillery shell that Israel is planning to use um you know finish them so the good news for Biden however is finish them is what Nikki Haley is saying now but if you recall Donald Trump said finish it he doesn't want this war to go on either I mean as of now it's kind of been a sloppy slow and lowly kind of lonely kind of fight and Trump does not want to see that on his watch either that Middle East analyst Laura Blumenfeld thank you so much for sharing your insights it was great talking to you thank you great to be here
