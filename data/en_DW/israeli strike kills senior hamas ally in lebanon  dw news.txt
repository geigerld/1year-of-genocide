I'm Marina Evin it's good to have you with us we begin in the Middle East where there are growing fears of an allout war between Israel and the iran-backed Hezbollah militia in Lebanon Israel released these images which it says show Saturday's strike that killed a senior Hamas Ally in eastern Lebanon near the country's border with Syria the Israeli military said he was targeted for his involvement in Terrorist activities against Israel isra and the Lebanese militant group have been trading near daily border fire since the October 7th Hamas attack let's get some analysis now with makram Raba he is an assistant professor of history at the American University of Beirut welcome to DW so what do you believe what do you believe would trigger a full out war between Hezbollah and the Israeli Army what do you think are the red lines for each of the sides well there's a number of red lines to cross in order for a full scale War the problem is that everyone is expecting a kind of the conventional War whereas in fact what the Israelis are doing right now are surgically targeting uh junior level or even senior level military operatives what will break uh the camels back I believe is if if Israel actually goes forward and starts targeting people who are part of the political apparatus of of hisbah and it is not a coincidence that recently the Israeli the Israeli government has been hinting to the fact that even the Secretary General of of hisbah Hassan nah might be a potential Target we have seen that also another thing which might actually pour gas on the fire is if Israel goes after Iranian targets like it did when it targeted the the Iranian culate in Damascus all of these elements might lead us to a fullscale war but I think that one has to always keep in mind that what is happening right now in Lebanon isn't itself a fullscale war however it is still limited and going forward we we don't know that everyone who is interested in keeping the war limited might actually lose control and we might have a fullscale war on our hands well Israel and Hezbollah did fight a war previously back in 2006 if it does come to a full War this time around how would it be different well there's a major difference in in ' 06 Lebanon was still quote unquote a normal country in the sense that lebanon's economy was still excellent compared to the abysmal situation we are uh experiencing right now second and more importantly Lebanon had a lot of allies and friends across the world and particularly across the region one has to remember it's not only about going to war but the internal front has to be unified as it stands because of hezbollah's sectarian messaging and how hisbah has treated its opponents within leban the Lebanon Lebanese political system it has called a it has caused a kind of a secretari and tension so going forward if any uh real war breaks out we don't have the luxury or we don't have the safety net that was provided by the senura government at the time nor do we have a lot of friends in the International Community who are willing to come to our Aid and more importantly after the end of the war are willing willing to pump money to help in the Reconstruction so it is not only about going to war but actually exiting the war which is a real problem you mentioned these sectarian divisions and as we mentioned you yourself are based in Beirut how are Ordinary People in Lebanon responding to these Rising tensions and the Border between Hezbollah and Israel what do they make of it well unfortunately the majority of the leines don't really experience what the people of the south on the border with with Palestine are are actually experiencing however the real tension is that I am getting phone calls on a daily basis from Lebanese experts who are uh who are planning to come to visit for the summer vacation and as you are well aware lebanon's economy hinges primarily on the contributions of the of the Lebanese diaspora who are around 10 million around the world so all of these tensions are actually disrupting the whole idea of what Lebanon is and this has been also causing a lot of people to try to get their families out because at the end of the day these people who are visiting Lebanon for a summer vacation don't want to be stuck here and more importantly the idea that this time around there will be no ceasefire and as you mentioned in report there's always the idea of a repeat with what is happening in Gaza which is something of a kind of a doomsday scenario which everyone wants to avoid that was makram rabah from the American University of Beirut thank you so much thank you
