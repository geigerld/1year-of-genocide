and with Israel's war against Hamas now in its 12th week the political pressure on Benjamin netanyahu's government is becoming more apparent recent polls show the support for his lot party is plummeting from winning 32 seats in Parliament just over a year ago lud would only hold on to 18 if elections were held today Centrist General Benny gun has meanwhile seen his own popularity rise the former Army Chief of Staff joined netanyahu's War cabinet shortly after hamas's October 7th attack on Israel from winning just 12 seats in Parliament last November po show his National Unity party would take 37 seats in new elections netanyahu's loss of support now comes amid mounting International criticism over his handling of the war this image of Israeli Prime Minister with his War cabinet members ministers yav Galant and Benny Gans is misleading it's meant to show Unity while behind the scenes there are growing tensions and deep political divid between [Music] them opinions and polls show a clear trend of eroding support for the men who has managed in almost a mythical way to hold on to power through many ups and downs longer than any other prime minister in Israel but now as the fighting in Gaza continues with over 120 hostages still in the hands of Hamas classified by multiple countries as a terrorist organization public anger grief and frustration are catching up with Yu the man who promised to be Israel's protector and as critics say failed meanwhile the cist politician Benny gun a former Chief of the IDF and a member of the war cabinet is winning Hearts he has tripled his standing in the polls and to counter the popular General in his own cabinet Netanyahu is toughening his tance the Palestinian Authority in its current format cannot get control cannot get control of Gaza after we fought and we did all this to give it to them but Nan's break further to the right and his refusal to discuss a path to a two-state solution and a long-term arrangement for Gaza Strip is not just an internal discussion it puts the Israeli government at odds with the Biden Administration to the dismay of benig Gans many observers Wonder now how much longer can this makeshift political partnership still last that report by our Middle East analyst chani rosanes she joins me now in the studio hi CH does this loss of popularity that you've outlined here mean Israelis don't support Nano's approach to the war well it's it's a very big question I think the very idea that this question is looming above netan is his decision-making process clean of politics that's for itself is a big Shadow to carry but you know when we talk about the war there are many different aspects there what's happening in the media term uh should Israel move to this third phase of fighting uh there's the long-term Pro uh solutions for Gaza there's the what's happening in the West Bank there's Lebanon there's Iran you know overlo the Iranian threat over looming over Israeli um in general so all of these questions you know put Nan in a place where if he does not have complete trust by the public that what he's doing you know the decision he's making are clean professional and only driven by the need to fight then that for itself puts him in a bit of a of a of a bind so we asked people in is for their opinions on Netanyahu let's take a listen he thinks he's you know undefeatable that's impossible I mean we live with it and this is the biggest burden here to live with the knowledge that this crook is still leading this country it's just impossible I think uh he knows what he's doing also because he was in the Army and special units and uh I think I feel secure I wish he would go this is exactly what I think that's some really harsh criticism there what needs to change well you got to remember Israelis are are stricken by grief by Shock by by horror frustration you know the world still you know moves on in a way but Israel is are still very much stuck on the 7th of October feeling betrayed by the government that's a very strong sentiment what needs to change well as long as Ben gun which we've mentioned before uh he is a war Cabinet member he is also the former uh head of the military as long as he's there he's considered by many Israeli as the responsible adult in the room they trust netan that as long as decision making are done with Benny Gans and to next to him then it's done properly once we see Benny Gans deciding to step back or out of the government that's where Netanyahu is going to probably lose massive uh control over his political future uh we don't see it happening anytime soon the assumption is this scenario will only start after moving to the third phase meaning Israeli soldiers withdrawing from the heart of Gaza and trying and setting them themselves up on the on the margins sort of as a buffer between Palestinians and the Israeli Mainland uh that will probably be happening later into the into uh about a month from now late January only then we might be seeing a shift inside the war cabinet and therefore afterwards made the first Domino uh break to fall and bring bring about a change in the political landscape in Israel you spoke about upcoming phases another one that people want to focus on is what happens after this war we heard Netanyahu in your reports say the Palestinian Authority can have no control what else can happen he he he recognized that the Palestinian Authority is a very good point for him to to play for his base there's very little trust there's very little will to see the Palestinian Authority going into Gaza or going stronger in the West Bank so he recognizes the sentiment and he plays on it to play for his base but it's we seeing the international communi between the American uh the American strongly pushing against that there is nobody else that seems to be willing to step into the vacuum that will be created in Gaza once Hamas is gone so and this is also partially why netan is is not so happy to discuss the next day for Gaza the the end goal because that's where he needs to start talking about uh things that are more complicated than they just say let's be tough and let's fight which is something most Israelis still stand behind and can get you know United behind there's also the hostages issue that's a very you know contested issue n feels that pushing strong that's the only way to get them out if you look at the left leaning crowd in Israel they feel they that they need to take them out even if it means stopping the fight is worth it um and we still you know we need to remember Israel was very divided before this war started and we're probably going to start seeing these cracks uh showing up very soon again quite a lot to unpack there thank you so much for doing that so well for Shani ranas you're
