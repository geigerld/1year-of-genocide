Israel is coming under increasing scrutiny for its treatment of Palestinians in its detention facilities the Israeli military is currently investigating several soldiers suspected of serious crimes against a prisoner at one detention center but human rights groups say this is not an isolated case rather part of a widespread pattern of systemic abuse across Israel's prison system DW correspondent Rebecca Ritter reports from Hebron where she met with a former prisoner without food without alte fde was a different man after leaving prison in Israel how much did you lose in total uh 18 18 to 19 k kilog a wild spent more than 4 months in jail after being arrested in August 2023 he was held under what is known as administrative detention which allows Israel to arrest and hold people without charge he says the security services weren't after him they wanted his son a lot of prisoners are detained without any accusation I was arrested to put pressure on my son he says that after hamas's deadly terror attack conditions in the prison became a lot harsher as soon as the war started every aspect of life changed I was beaten I had a bruise hair on my face I had blood coming out of my ears I remember it happened in the beginning of November they got into our cell beat us inside took us to the bathrooms and beat there too a Wilder's testimony is among many to have surfaced in the wake of October 7 in a month-long investigation Israeli human rights organization bed selum interviewed dozens of former prisoners collating what they say is evidence of abuse across both the prison system and detention centers run by the military that's their question the situation they say is so bad that Israel's prisons amount to a network of torture camps it was quite surprising to for us to understand that that what we're talking about is not a single cases it's a policy what we see now is actually that the Israeli um jail system was turned into something very different from what it was into a place where its main objective its main a conduct is to abuse Palestinian prisoners Israel's prison service denies such allegations saying they act in accord ordance with domestic and international law but one case at a military Detention Center has recently made Global headlines this video obtained by Israeli media appears to show IDF soldiers frog marching a Palestinian detainee and then allegedly raping him using Shields to hide from the surveillance cameras the incident took place in July at the state T man Detention Center which has held most of the Palestinians seized in Gaza since the War Began five soldiers are being investigated for crimes including rape in a statement to DW the Israeli military said it rejects outright allegations concerning systematic abuse of detainees in the state hon Detention Facility including allegations of sexually abusing detainees but whistleblowers have been speaking out about human rights abuses at the facility for months we spoke to one on the condition of anonymity everyone was hand cuffed to the side of the bed their arms and legs were strapped separately so that any movement was impossible they were all blindfolded the patients eyes saw were naked except for a diaper the United States says the rights of Palestinian prisoners must be respected and has called on the Israeli government to investigate any claims of abuse but for former detainees like a Wilder the damage has already been done in prison I felt humiliation in every sense of the word this is collective punishment beating without any legitimate reason just for the sake of Revenge and torture in other words this is the true face of the occupation he says his experience and the experience of those around him was a tragedy serving only to fuel their hatred and resentment of Israel Shia Parnes is a spokesperson for the Israeli human rights organization betum which carried out the investigation of Israeli prisoners uh prisons I asked him to tell us more about the testimonies of prisoners interviewed for the report well first of all thank you for having me uh I would say uh during this month uh of work we interviewed 55 former detes from all over the region it includes gazin West bankers and even uh for uh Israeli Palestinians um from different cities who were held in different facilities in 16 Israeli facilities 13 of them by the Israeli prison system and three in uh military facilities uh in different ages the youngest was 16 the oldest was 65 from both genders and what was uh shocking it is in many details they shared pretty much the same story of uh severe violence starvation humiliation sleep deprivation and and that's why we're saying it is routine and systematic the Israeli government of course rejects the allegations of it being systematic but I I wanted to ask you about video obtained by Israeli media um that video that we showed part of it in our report just now it appears to show Israeli soldiers frog marching at Palestinian detainee at a military detention center and then allegedly raping him in a recent interview you said you were not surprised when Israeli media released this video why is that not surprising to you um because as far as investigating itself Israel is unable and unwilling to uh really investigate her conduct or investigate the decision makers and the policy makers what we've seen for years that every once in a while they do uh investigate a case when it gets major headlines uh in international Media or International tribunals and they do investigate these low ranking officers or as you might may put it simple soldiers but uh the Israel par regime the system itself is unable and unwilling to investigate itself its policies how do you explain the conditions and treatment of Palestinian prisoners described in your report where where do you think that's coming from I have no idea where it's coming from but what we've seen in the last 10 months is horrific as the you put the the detainees who are released losing dozens of kilograms what we're seeing in Gaza daily and of course what happened in October 7th what's going on in this region for the last 10 month uh must be stopped and that's why we're calling the International Community uh not uh stop condemning the actions but uh put in action um and we we just have to have ceas fire and a deal to return the hostages um this vice versa Revenge uh and the catastrophic human rights violation going on uh must be uh stopped and I we must say that that's the International Community and the interational tribunal's duty to do that now Israel's prison service says that they act in accordance with domestic and international law the Israeli military rejects allegations of systematic abuse as we mentioned what do you say to that well uh as we've seen in the report it was uh it was the deterioration wasn't uh just a stepping the hill it was a it was a process and first when Ben was appointed he just said it out loud that it's is tosen the conditions of these uh prisoners and as I said we it's not one testimony to two it's 55 from all over the region even some of them are Israeli citizens and you shown the pictures yourself of these decanes who were released so it means even the aparted regime couldn't find them couldn't accuse them of anything and you we've seen together in your item just minutes ago how they walk out of prison looking like skeletons the the policy of starvation is is obvious what can human rights organizations like yours and others do to prevent the kind of abuse described in your report yeah uh so that's the pretty much what human rights organization have to do in their mandates uh we we investigate the cases We Stand side by side with the victims in this case the the torture victims we're trying to advocate for the for the victims in uh in tribunals in in the media in Israel media in international media and we do everything our mandate as an human rights organization and our reputation can uh can what we can do uh to stop stop what's going on and that's also part of the reason I'm speaking with you because also your country as a major political and economic country can take actions to stop what we' see Mr PES thank you very much for speaking with us today that was Shai pares a spokesperson for the Israeli human rights organization betella let's hear from Naji abas the director of the prisoners and detainees department at pH itions for human rights Israel welcome nii now many were shocked by the findings of the BET Salem report your group put out its own report in February and you've heard similar testimony haven't you yes and actually we are still hearing this testimonies because since October our lawyers managed to visit hundreds of Palestinians in the detention facilities the Israel detention facilities and all the prisoners and all the detainees that we are visiting are speaking and telling the same thing they are speaking about a very systematic way of abuse torture and violence we are documenting and getting testimonies and actually official documents showing a a systematic way of violating every basic human rights that a the Palestinians needs in the detention facilities so the BM report just assured or give a face when they brought these testimonies brought a face for all the information that we are speaking loud in the in the 10 best months yeah how have conditions for Palestinian inmates in Israeli prisons changed since the Hamas terror attack on October 7 let's let's say the the the the conditions in the Israeli jails and the Israel detention facilities shouldn't be related to what's happening in Gaza and to the attack of Hamas it's a different system and we are speaking about different people most of the Palestinian nowadays are from the West Bank not from Gaza and regarding the condition we are speaking about a whole different story about a whole different situation from what we had before October before October the the the conditions were were hard it's not weren't a good place to be the Israeli jails but after October everything changed medical negligence and L medical treatment became the official policy the Israeli IPS the Israeli prison service abandoned the access of family visits the access of the icrc they stopped all the medical treatment they took all the prisoners belonging and left them with nothing people we are visiting people that still in the same clothes since October and now how changed a a a fact just one fact can describe the whole situation we are speaking now about more than 60 Palestinians who died in the detention facilities since October yeah that is according to your investigations and we're talking about Palestinians in Israeli prisons but what is your group say is happening to Palestinian detainees within Gaza the Israeli Army don't hold people in Gaza inside Gaza a when they arrest people from Gaza and now we are speaking about more 2,000 gazan Palestinian who are in detention they are all brought to inside Israel and they are being held in detention facilities or under the custody of the Israeli army or under the custody of the Israeli Pres service and in all these facilities in neither the army or the IPS the situation is very dangerous what we are saying for months that these conditions and these policies official policies actually the Israel authorities are proud to speak that they are making the life of Palestinian theese harder and harsher these policies brought us to a situation that there are risk for every every Palestinian in the facilities for his health and even for his life there na abas with Physicians for human rights Israel thanks for your time thank you thank you
