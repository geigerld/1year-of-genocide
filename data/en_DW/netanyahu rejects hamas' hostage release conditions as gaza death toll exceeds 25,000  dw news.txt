Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the latest conditions set by Hamas for the release of hostages held in Gaza this comes after a weekend of protests calling on the Israeli government to do more to bring the hostages home well this was the scene in Tel Aviv late Saturday where thousands of people gathered to protest against the country's leadership many are calling for new elections it's now more than 3 months since Israel launched its counter offensive in Gaza after the unprecedented crossborder attacks by Hamas on October 7th Hamas is classified as a terrorist organization by most Western countries we can now speak to journalist Samy Sul who joins us from Jerusalem so Sami Israeli Prime Minister has just issued a statement saying that he's rejecting the latest demands from the militant group Hamas over hostage releases what more can you tell us about his statement yeah so the statement is very clear he's saying that if Israel would the release the uh the prisoners that Hamas is demanding would stop the war would withdraw and take out the forces from the Gaza Strip and then that would mean that all the soldiers that have died until now in battle their death would have been in vain and that Israel will not be able to protect its borders but I must say that we hear here in Israel a officials that are saying that Israel will engage in talks uh and we're talking about talks that according to the Wall Street Journal will take place in Cairo the four countries that are behind them which is the United States H Egypt and uh and they're trying to push the Hamas and Israel to reach some agreement according to this agreement there will be 90 days it will be spread over 90 days and it will include the ceasefire and the gradual exchange of prisoners so we have to see where this will lead to and meanwhile in Gaza the health Ministry there which is run by Hamas has said that U more than 25,000 people have died in the territory since the War Began I'm interested to hear just how much coverage there is in Israeli domestic media about the situation for Palestinians in Gaza and if you can tell us what the public makes of the situation there yeah if you look at this report they also say that 75% of those who were killed are women children and elderly and more than 60,000 have been wounded well there's not the wide coverage of of this of these kinds of figures in Israel and the kind of images that you can see on networks throughout the world of what's Happening inside the Gaza Strip do not usually appear on the screens of the Israeli networks uh but I would say that by a large the Israeli public doesn't feel much sympathy towards the gazans many here say that they support Hamas they say that the public opinions have shown that both gazans and West Bankers have supported the attack on the 7th of October and this is often an opinion that you will hear in the streets that was J journalist Samy soal reporting from Jerusalem many thanks indeed for your time
