we're to the Middle East now where the devastating war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza means persistent dangers for journalists who are trying to cover the conflict recent figures from the committee to protect journalists show Palestinian journalists made up the majority of all reporters killed worldwide in the past year now since sas's October 7th Terror attacks 83 Palestinian journalists and two Israeli journalists have been killed in the conflict within God it's now almost exclusively Palestinians reporting on the war on the ground Israel has refused to let foreign journalists in to report independently there all those reporting from within Gaza are doing so under extremely difficult conditions well for more now I'm joined by Jody Ginsburg she's the CEO of the committee to protect journalist and joins me from New York J it's good to have you with us let's talk about about this conflict this conflict is just what three months old um and in terms of being dangerous to journalists how does it compare to other conflicts where journalists have tried to get to the truth this is the deadliest Conflict for journalists that the committee to protect journalists has ever documented we've been doing this work for more than 30 years more journalists died in the first 10 weeks of the Israel Gaza War than have ever died certainly since we've been doing this work in a single country over an entire year the intensity the numbers is absolutely unprecedented your organization we know in investigates the deaths of journalists in Gaza I don't have to tell you it's very difficult to to verify any information that's coming out of the Gaza Strip how do you make sure that the data you're collecting that that is accurate it is extremely difficult the sorts of things that we would normally rely on being able to speak to families being able to speak to colleagues is extremely challenging because families are being killed colleagues are being killed nevertheless we take the same approach that we would with any other situation we make sure that we have at least two sources of information for any of the journalists that we document we speak to friends we speak to families we do research online that looks at their outputs that to make sure that our information is as accurate as possible and of course it's a war information comes to light um o over time and we update our information as we get it what do you say to the allegations that are coming from Israel that some of these journalists are are are militants I mean do you believe that do you believe that they've actually been targeted by Israeli forces well we have yet to see any credible evidence that the journalists that the Israelis have said are actually militants or actually terrorists are such last year before this war started the committee to protect journalists report produced a report called deadly pattern which looked at the killings of largely Palestinian journalists by Israeli forces over the past 22 years and we found that 20 journalists have been killed and not a single case had anyone been held accountable and what we saw in fact was a pattern in which quite often Israel was accused journalists of being a terrorists of being militants but never produce any evidence and that remains the case in this war too Israel says that its Army cannot guarantee the safety of journalists um how can journalists then how can they they do their job with without risking their lives journalist in go cannot do their jobs without risking their lives nowhere in Gaza is safe journalists are doing absolutely what we would expect journalists to do covering a war they're looking at the aftermath of bombings by going to hospitals and then we see hospitals bombed or they're going to refugee camps to look at the effects of displacements those have also been bombed there isn't a place for journalists to be safe in the current environment but it's absolutely imperative that we recognize that journalists are civilians and must be treated as such so they must never be targeted Judy Ginsburg with the committee to protect journalists Judy we appreciate your time and your input tonight thank you thank
