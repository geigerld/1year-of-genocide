two hostages are back in Israel after being freed in an overnight raid in Gaza Israel says they were rescued in a special operation in the southern city of Rafa the two men were kidnapped by Hamas during the October 7th Terror attacks on Israel they were flown by helicopter for medical checkups to a hospital near Tel Aviv where they were also reunited with family members reunited with their families Louise ha and F Simon mman were rescued by Israel's military and security forces during overnight raids in Rafa after 128 days held captive by Hamas in Gaza they are currently receiving treatment in a hospital where they are both said to be in a stable condition for their families the sense of relief is mixed with concern for the hostages still being held in Gaza luckily for us as a family there were saved tonight but I must say that the job is not done we are happy today but it's not we didn't win it's just another step towards bringing all the other 134 hostages back home and it doesn't matter if it's babies women men Elder people everybody must come back as soon as possible Israeli air strikes devastated parts of Rafa overnight buildings and destroying a mosque dozens of Palestinians were killed and many more taken to hospital with serious injuries we were at home when the air strikes were going on I told my mother that I wanted to use the bathroom as she was was awake suddenly all the walls of the bathroom and all the water containers above it collapsed on me most of the roughly 1.4 million Palestinians currently in Rafa fled from other parts of Gaza they were trying to escape the intense fighting in other areas and the city was designated a safe zone for civilians by the Israeli Army but recent Israeli strikes on Rafa have elim ated any sense of security for Palestinians there and we are now joined by Colonel Peter Lerner he's a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces and joins us from uh Tel Aviv Colonel has the Israeli Army now begun a ground offensive in rafar and what goal has the IDF been ordered to achieve there good afternoon agad indeed um this morning we conducted a very unique Special Forces operation in Russ uh this is not the beginning of a ground operation in uh the southern town but indeed it is part of our pursuit to release the hospitals to bring the hostages to bring each and every one of them home um and in order to dismantle and Destroy Hamas who have established their strongholds throughout the Gaza Strip in a way that jeopardizes Safety and Security to everyone um our operations are ongoing throughout the Gaza Strip this morning in kanun Al in the north um but no this is not the beginning of the ground operation in Rafa uh we're going to talk about the ongoing operation in a moment but first I would like to ask you the the Israeli Army has thankfully freed two hostages uh today that makes three that have been freed in raids the majority of the freed hostages more than a 100 were released in swaps during a ceasefire uh doesn't that show that that's more effective um our operations have uh two clear goals um in mind first of all to release the hostages to bring them home uh to create the conditions to bring them home either through diplomacy or through operations as we conducted um in the early hours of this morning and the second goal is to dismantle and Dy destroy Hamas as a governing authority of the Gaza Strip a terrorist entity that has utilized the powers of government so of course from our perspective as we push forward an increase the pressure on Hamas we are creating the conditions for release whether it be through um negotiations and diplomacy or through the operational activity as we conducted this morning um unfortunately we have to ask ourselves or remind ourselves perhaps better we would not be in this situation of Hamas hadn't abducted 240 people uh and they are still holding this morning this afternoon 134 um people the families of these 134 people have been torn to pieces over the last four months it's time for them to come home every last one of them let's talk about the civilian population uh in Rafa more than a million people are said to be there civilians uh where should they go for shelter goad the government has instructed the IDF to create a plan of operation um in order to alleviate and evacuate civilians if we do indeed mobile mobilize and I would say if the government instruct us to do to mobilize then we will be prepared to do so as we have throughout this war evacuated people on mass um from the areas of uh combat the reality of course is one should ask ourselves is why are we conducting battle in the first place we could end this war tomorrow all it takes is to release the hostages and for Hamas to unconditionally surrender conrete steps allow me to interrupt you there what concrete steps will you be taking to avoid civilian casualties as I said once the government if the government instructs us to mobilize into the south then we will have as we have in the past conducted a very elaborate and I would say unprecedented plans of Civilian evacuation from the combat zones it's just how we've operated throughout the last four months um we know how to do it we have done it in the past uh if the government approves that operation or instructs us to mobilize we'll know how to do it now Israel's biggest Ally the US has expressed a clear opposition to an a large scale operation in Rafa um is that something you take into consideration absolutely we're very very attentive to our allies uh whether it's the us or others the the what they're saying and we are taking it into consideration of course that does not mean that our goals will not be achieved there is no alternative to bringing the hostages home and there is no reality where Hamas remains a terrorist entity terrorist government on our doorstep especially due to the fact that they keep they have promised time and time again that given the opportunity they will repeat the atrocities of the 7th of October so our only route forward is for Hamas to be um crushed to be removed from control and to get the hostages home um Hamas have and and if we learned anything from this operation in the early hours of this morning where were they holding um Lou har and and Fernando marman where were they holding them in a residential area on the second story of a building where there are civilians around when we mobilized in when we came with our special forces we breached the house we went into the complex um a gunfight broke out uh was uh conducted extensive fire from all directions from the civilian Arena against the forces so we understand exactly how Hamas is operating where they are operating for and why they have act actually no regard for human life Israeli or Palestinian the spokesman for Israel's Defense Forces Colonel Peter larner thank you very much good day now let's bring in shy Lo she's the communications adviser for the humanitarian organization Norwegian Refugee Council and joins us from Jerusalem Shina Israel carried out more air strikes in Rafa overnight and some say a ground operation has started can you give us a more insight into the situation on the ground there well as far as we know a ground operation has not yet started uh but there were these intense raids last night I spoke to one colleague this morning who said he didn't get any sleep uh obviously hearing the the in in increased intensity of the air strikes in Rafa caused Widespread Panic and fear amongst the the nearly million and a half people who are seeking shelter there um many of whom have been displaced multiple times it's just a reminder that there simply is no safe place in the Gaza Strip for Palestinian civilians that any place can be targeted Rafa uh as you probably recall was where Palestinians were told to flee uh over the last four months because it was allegedly safer uh but we've seen through the events of last night that that really there is simply no safe place in Gaza and and civilians are fearful throughout the entire Gaza Strip um are your people on the ground seeing any attempt by civilians to flee this area as of now we haven't heard about civilians fleeing but I think that's in part because there simply is no place to flee to uh Central and Northern Gaza have been uh the sites of of increased of intense fighting uh Northern Gaza has been basically reduced to Rubble there are no facilities uh or accommodations they're able to to uh host uh people fleeing for safety on top of that there's the the added risk of unexploded ordinances throughout all of Gaza but particularly in the north where there was quite heavy air strikes uh early on in the first few months of of this escalation uh and on top of that people have fled multiple times they have nothing with them nothing they have very little belongings and so uh I think our our worried about fleeing and having no safe place no shelter to sleep in uh and on top of that all Aid is coming in through the Rafa Crossing and and caram Shalom Crossings in the South and so people in need of desperately in need of assistance clean water food medicines uh want to be where the aid is which is in in southern Gaza mostly concentrated in the Rafa area now what are your colleagues and other humanitarian workers actually able to do under these conditions you know it's really Limited in terms of our ability to respond first of all we have uh nowhere near enough Aid getting in to to meet just even the basic humanitarian needs of the population there are entire areas of Gaza that are largely cut off from humanitarian assistance because it simply is unsafe uh or uh to go there or agencies have been unable to to coordinate their movements to ensure uh that their staff will be safe while trying to go and deliver deliver assistance uh the the needs continue to outpace the the ability of us to respond of course we are doing the best that we can but so long as there are ongoing hostilities it makes coordination of of Aid distributions uh very very challenging that's why the only way that we'll be able to properly uh accommodate uh all of these needs is by first and foremost a a prolonged sustained ceasefire that uh that that because we cannot be responding while bombs are falling over our heads and on top of that a massive scaling up of the amount of Aid getting into Gaza which up until now has been wholly insufficient talking about the aid getting into Gaza the UN Agency for Palestinians unra was doing the bulk of that human humanitarian Aid work in Gaza before allegations emerged that 12 of its staff as were involved in the October 7th Terror attacks on Israel many donor Nations have subsequently cut their funding are these Cuts being felt on the ground there as of now seems that they that the cuts have not been felt yet but my understanding is that unwa anticipates that they will only be able to carry on their operations through the end of this month or early March uh were Ona to to cease operations there would be a a massive Gap uh in in the ability to deliver Aid not only is unwa providing the bulk of the assistance to Palestinians uh in Gaza but they also provide logistical and Technical Support to humanitarian agencies they pick up our Aid as it comes in through the Rafa Crossing and deliver it to our warehouse they provide all humanitarian agencies with the fuel that we need to be able to to run our trucks and and distribute uh our assistance so without unera I think that there will be a massive Gap felt and the and the people who will suffer the most are of course the innocent civilians who have been suffering over the last four months shy Alo there Communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council in Jerusalem thank you much thank
