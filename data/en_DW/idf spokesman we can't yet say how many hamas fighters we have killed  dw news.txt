Israel says its troops have surrounded and reached the center of Southern gaza's largest city commanders in the Han Unis assaults say their troops are engaged in some of the most intense fighting so far Israel says its aim is to eliminate Hamas which is regarded as a terrorist group by multiple countries and the EU now hundreds of thousands of people have been told to relocate to so-called safe zones but the UN says nowhere in Gaza is safe well leftenant Colonel Jonathan conri Speak for the Israeli military the IDF and joins us from Tel Aviv welcome to DW what is the idf's objective in Han yunas hello Phil thank you for having me on the show The Objective Remains the Same we are going to dismantle Hamas and make sure that the atrocities of October the 7th never happen again and that Israeli civilians will not be butchered in their homes and burned and raped and pillaged and that the Israeli civilian will not be taken hostage and uh I didn't maybe I missed it but I didn't hear any reference in the coverage of 138 Israeli hostages that have been held for 60 days in Gaza maybe I missed it but the bottom line we are going to defeat Kamas make sure that they will not have the ability to ever attack us again and bring back our hostages and how would you say uh that is going so far we are advancing according to plan uh we have been able to achieve significant advances in Northern Gaza we are still present on the ground and fighting against Hamas strongholds in Northern Gaza in SAA in jabalia and other neighborhoods where Hamas is embedded in and underneath and as you reported we are currently also operating in southern Gaza in kanun which is a very important Hamas stronghold we are advancing but there is fierce fighting Hamas probably understand that uh this is a really crucial time for them and they are operating accordingly fighting with almost everything they have and we are of course fighting accordingly and you're fighting in one of the most densely populated areas on Earth how are you avoiding killing civilians well it is indeed complicated you're right in that and there are many civilians there and we have done and we continue to do continuous efforts in order to get civilians out of these specific areas where we're fighting and it's very important to understand that there's not fighting in all of kanun or all of Southern Gaza that there are specific neighborhoods Hamas strongholds where we are fighting and those neighborhoods ahead of time we have uh notified the civilians that they need to evacuate temporarily from those neighborhoods and we have also advised them which direction to go before conducting our oper operations and of course we continue to apply the principles of humanitarian law on armed conflict of Distinction of proportionality and we only operate when there's a clear military objective to be U achieved by military action except that we have seen that Israel has designated so-called safe zones before and told uh uh civilians to go there but we have also seen that Israel will bomb those areas as it sees fit doesn't sound safe to lots of people yes the the the the only issue with that statement is that you're not addressing what the enemy is doing we don't bomb anything at random okay but let's address what Israel is doing so address my point yes I I understand that you want to focus on that these are supposed safe zones despite you you designating them Israel will still bomb them so again that does not sound safe yes can I can I answer now can I answer of course I can't hear you Phil yeah thank you so let's first uh disambiguate where we are fighting we are fighting against an enemy that is embedded within the civilian population and uses everything civilian in order to fight against us they have fired more than 11,000 rockets at our civilians from the civilian neighborhoods including the so-called safe zones or the humanitarian zones they continue to use hospitals mosques un facilities schools and everything that is supposed to be off the battlefield for their military purposes and that is something that needs to be said every day and many times in order to understand the complex and I would say very difficult situation on the ground that the Palestinians are now suffering from now if Hamas uses a what has previously been defined as a safe Zone in order to fight and to fire Rockets or missiles at Israeli civilians or to conduct combat activities towards our troops from that area then there may be a case where we will retaliate fire but that is a very an extremely small percentage and by and large all of the designated safe zones have been maintained as such even though Hamas has used them in order to fire against us can you clarify a comment of yours that's been causing something of a stir you've been quoted as saying that Israel believes it has killed two civilians for every Hamas militant and that this is a tremendously positive ratio what did you mean by that yes that uh was wasn't the very well chosen words and they were a bit taken out of context as well but of course I stand by what I said before and and now is a good opportunity to correct that and for those who may be watching and thinking and taking things out of context is a good opportunity to set that straight to understand in urban Warfare including uh where German troops have been involved in Afghanistan and of course where NATO forces have been fighting in Iraq and in Afghanistan in Syria and other locations unfortunately sadly Whenever there is fighting in Urban Terrain densely populated Urban Terrain usually the ratio is between 1 29 to to5 one enemy combatant to 15 or nine civilians that is the applicable ratio not of Israeli forces but of Western NATO forces fighting against similar enemies perhaps in a little bit less complex areas than we are fighting because there's also the elaborate tunnels that is the backdrop of my comment which should have been rephrased differently and what I should have said was a I every civilian life lost in combat is sad and not the aim of the operation but if and I said if if the ratio is one to2 then it is exceptionally positive within the context of fighting in Urban Terrain and that of course does not indicate that we want to kill civilians we aspire to minimize that but when you compare it to other militaries who fight in Urban Terrain it would be an exceptionally uh positive ratio of course again every civan for isn't the um is there a number of Civilian deaths that Israel would consider too high in its pursuit of Hamas we're at about 16,000 Palestinians are killed now yeah so first of all when you say 16,000 I don't know what you base that on if you're basing it on Hamas figures then I you're absolutely right yes I I base it on figures from the Hamas controlled health authority if you have better figures by all means share them with us but according to the the health authority in Gaza they're at about 16,000 deaths now so I'll repeat the question is there a number of Civilian deaths that Israel would consider too high the number of civilians that we con civilian deaths that we consider too high is 1,200 and those are the Israeli civilians that were purposely in intentionally butchered raped and burned by Hamas Terrorist on the 7th of October that is the most important number from our perspective and of course we continue operations while trying to minimize civilian casualties and I think that if you look back on these 60 days of fighting we have established safe zones we have evacuated people out of combat ahead of time we continue to do that now in Greater detail than what we've done before War really based on neighborhood level which is unprecedented no other military has ever done that at this level of resolution and we aspire to have as few as possible civilian casualties in the fighting but that is not the main parameter here what the main focus of us is to defeat the enemy and to make sure that Israelis can go back to their homes they are currently 250,000 displaced Israelis that are not in their homes because of the fighting and we want them to go back to their homes and to rebuild their communities that were ravaged by Hamas do you know how many Hamas Fighters the IDF has killed and if so how have you verified that figure we are still working on the number there are unofficial estimates that unfortunately at this time I cannot yet say them I would want to but I cannot yet say them but we are talking about thousands it's not in the number of hundreds and it's not yet 10,000 but we are talking about thousands of enemy combatants that have been killed it will take time because when we count Hamas casualties we rely a lot on what they know themselves and Hamas doesn't really know itself entirely how many of its operatives are buried underground in the tunnel system that they dug and are operating from when Hamas will know and be clear internally about it I assume that we will know until then we're working on very ious assessments and that is the main reason why we have not yet made official our estimate of how many enemy combatants but I can assure you that at the end of this war there will be a long list of enemy combatants and we will be able to cross reference I ask that only because you don't know how many how many um Hamas combatants you you've killed uh we do know in approximate numbers that you have killed 16,000 uh civilians uh and many more um uh and many more and injured many more and I didn't get a clear answer to my question of how many civilian deaths and casualties is too many for Israel I don't think that you know that there have been 16,000 civilians killed I think that you know based on Hamas information that there are 16,000 casualties inaz let's please answer my question how many civilian deaths is too many for Israel Phil you can ask it five times I will give you the same answer that I told you before that is not a metric and the metric that we care about mostly is our civilians that were butchered not by mistake but intentionally on the October 7 attack that is the number that we are focused on thank you so much for joining us left tenant Colonel Jonathan conricus from the Israel Defense Forces thank you
