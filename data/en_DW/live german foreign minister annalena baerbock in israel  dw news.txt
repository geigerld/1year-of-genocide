Lebanon what are her goals on this Mission well as she herself has said basically to leave no stone unturned to ensure that the hostages uh are released there are at least eight Germans amongst the 203 hostages being held by Hamas and she said that she is in Non-Stop communication with her counterparts throughout the region and that means in a number of Arab countries as well to try to ensure that the hostages are being treated uh with humanity and also that they will be released so that's reason number one reason number two is to prevent what she referred to in her stop yesterday in Jordan as a regional conflagration and there too seeking contact with leaders across the region who perhaps also could Prevail upon Hezbollah the uh Islamic uh militia based in Lebanon and she plans to go to Lebanon after Israel today to to Prevail upon them and their Patron Iran not to get into the fry and it's quite interesting to note that although Joe Biden's talks with the Egyptian and Jordanian leaders were cancelled the German leadership also Chancellor Schultz have very close contact with Egypt with Jordan with Qatar with many countries that could exercise perhaps some influence in stopping this conflict from widening and Germany historically has seen that kind of a mediation role as part of its special duty to Israel and has in fact participated in mediating prison mediating prisoner swaps and the the uh foreign minister has just announced that she will go on now to Cairo on Saturday to a special peace Summit that has been called at very short notice by Egypt so trying hard to use those channels to stop a regional configration and then thirdly as she has said to show those in Gaza the civilians that we know of their suffering and want to help she's appointed a special Emissary for humanitarian Aid Germany has announced it will commit 50 million so all of that driving her to nonstop shuttle diplomacy we should mention that that an Elena barbach was just in the region last week right she visited Israel then as as well she's back in Tel Aviv right now we saw Chancellor Schultz also visiting uh the region he was uh in both Israel and in uh he spoke with Jordan's uh leader he was in in Egypt as well uh why is analina Bach going back again so soon well as as I said because she has said we absolutely must do everything in our power and with that she means everything to support Israel Germany has said always that Israel's existence is part of Germany's uh State rationale as it wereat in Germany meaning a highest price priority for the country of Germany and therefore there's no question that Germany's solidarity is with Israel and at the same time she is trying very hard as is the chancellor to also show compassion for the civilians in Gaza who are bearing uh terrible a terrible brunt of the suffering uh there and as she yesterday said to try to tell the stories of those suffering on both sides so she's made it a point to include in her speeches in Jordan descriptions of those she's met in Israel who have lost loved ones or perhaps have uh members of the family who've been taken hostage while in some of the Arab countries in the region she talks about uh the Israelis uh that she's met so it's it's a real Endeavor I think on her part to cultivate a Humanity that she hopes could perhaps uh stem some of this suffering so the foreign minister is showing understanding empathy expressing empathy there um it's a symbolic act to go there again so quickly and to visit all of these places and talk to them as you suggested uh but what about Germany actually playing a role as a possible mediator you mentioned this uh do you see a potential for that in this situation I don't think anybody here thinks that Germany and anybody in uh in Berlin in the government will be thinking that Germany can somehow uh stop this configration of itself all alone but there is no question that the combined efforts that we're seeing President macron also traveling to a number of different Arab countries Rishi sunak going to Saudi Arabia as well as Israel and the German leaders all of them trying very very hard to open up every form of diplomatic communication available because indeed there is a danger of a two-front war if Hezbollah does in fact uh increase its attacks in the north it's very unclear uh what role Lebanon and hisbah could play and of course it all depends very much on Iran and all of this is about trying to establish that Coalition of Arab countries uh that could possibly uh exercise some influence with his ol which uh essentially is Iran's um sword it's uh its means of proxy acting to inflame this conflict and turn it into uh a vast Regional war with International implications Melinda stay with us uh we're just waiting for analina Bok the German foreign minister to begin her press conference in Tel Aviv uh while we're waiting for that let's take a a look at uh at what uh while we're waiting for that let's take a look at German Chancellor Olaf Schultz he's been in Israel and Egypt as I mentioned too in a push to deescalate tensions in a speech to Parliament here in Berlin after returning from that visit the chancellor said Germany's place is firmly by Israel's side family members of hostages abducted pamas during its terror attack on Israel guest in the German Parliament listening to Chancellor Olaf Schultz who was just returned from the Middle East Schulz reaffirms his government's support for Israel and for efforts to get the hostages free more than 200 are being held in Gaza among them a number of German Nationals an important task for us is freeing the hostages they must be released without any conditions I want to say this very clearly to those who preach Terror many of those who were kidnapped were activists at the Forefront of seeking peace in the region I learned this from their friends and families this needs to be said here too we are working for the release of the hostages schz also spoke about the situation of civilians in the Gaza Strip they are equally victims and hostages of Hamas it's using them as human Shields which is inhumane you can't Des it any other way it sees control over them in a coup they're helpless in the face of the power and Terror of Hamas that is why it is very very important to find ways of providing humanitarian Aid SCH said that there is now a good chance that Aid will finally make it into Gaza soon but an end to the wider crisis is still nowhere in sight well while while we're waiting for German foreign minister Ananda babach to begin her news conference in Tel Aviv uh with me in the studio is DW's Melinda crane our chief political analyst uh Melinda this is an important time not just for for what for the leaders in the Middle East who are dealing with this conflict but also for mediators for countries that are aligned with uh Israel as well Germany is among those this is an important time for German leadership absolutely it is and it's also a challenge for German leadership as I mentioned uh earlier Israel's existence is uh absolutely a core core priority for Germany Germany's solidarity with Israel is uh based on the historic tragedy of course of this country having perpetrated the Holocaust and therefore having a very special relationship with Israel and that's been apparent in some of the very strong speeches that we have heard from the German leadership including the foreign minister we're about to hear her speaking once again in Israel who has really declared with passionate intent intensity this country's support for Israel and at the same time enormous concern here in Germany uh which also is home to many uh Arab and Muslim migrants about the situation in Gaza about the suffering of civilians there and concerned about um trying to Prevail upon Israel to show some form of restraint not a word that German leaders are uh necessarily using in that Clarity but again and again we're hearing increasing references now from the Chancellor from the foreign minister for Israel to carry out any operations that it is conducting in Gaza with respect for international law and international law does require proportionality in directing attacks against per perpetrators military targets terrorists but not against civilians in attempting to protect civilians in the course of military operations and German leaders are being careful to mention that obligation but it's a fine fine line there are a lot of eggshells upon which To Tread in this situation and particularly challenging I think for this country with its special relationship to Israel yeah it must be said that both Chancellor Schultz and foreign minister balk have stressed the need to respect the the rights of civilians in Gaza and they've drawn attention to the humanitarian suffering that we're witnessing in Gaza since the blockade essentially uh by Israel so there's no Aid getting into Gaza it's very very dependent on that Aid uh analena babach is is very conscious of that she announced 50 million euros in in aid for humanitarian aid for the the people of the living in the Gaza Strip uh but I have to we have to ask ourselves given the current situation is that money able to do any good yeah you know also President Biden thought that he had accomplished essentially The Establishment now of corridors for that Aid to go in and yet we're hearing the Rafa Crossing is still closed those trucks are still trying to wait there are many questions apparently about who inspects the shipments going in because Israel has said it should not include even such basic Goods as fuel which by the way would be badly needed to keep hospitals in Gaza running and the water purification plants apparently that's a critical part too we heard the UN Secretary General Antonio guish stressing the need to get the sanitation system going again the water purification system because there is no clean drinking water in Gaza we heard that also confirmed in an interview I conducted with a journalist in the Gaza Strip today the people there are living in dire conditions indeed it's one of the stories that analena barbach mentioned yesterday when she was in jordan saying that when she hears that a mother is feeding or giving her children brackish water in other words salt salty uh polluted water that it just breaks her heart and indeed that is the plight that many many people here are abundantly aware of so that 50 million in humanitarian help how can it reach those who be need it so badly undoubtedly this will be a key topic tomorrow at this peace Summit that has been called by Egypt and certainly amongst the topics that the German leadership have been speaking about with uh with Mr aisi with M with the Egyptian leadership is the question of how do we get that Crossing open but it is a two-way process and there are obstacles on both sides and I just want to remind our viewers that uh if you're just joining us here on DW news we're waiting for German foreign minister analina babach to begin a news conference in Tel Aviv the foreign minister has traveled there uh for the second time in two weeks showing her solidarity with Israel uh stressing Israel's right to defend itself while also drawing attention to the need to provide uh relief to the to the Palestinians who the Palestinian civilians who are trapped in the Gaza Strip un under a blockade with Israel continuing to launch air strikes against uh Hamas terrorist targets there so as we're waiting for this conference uh our chief political analyst Melinda crane is is in the studio with us Melinda I wanted to to ask you about again the foreign ministers trip she's visiting three countries uh is she's in Israel right now uh but there's also Jordan and Lebanon crucially Lebanon where there could be another front opening up for Israel in this this war the the militia Hezbollah uh that are based in in Lebanon with Iran support they are considered to be pretty well armed uh and Israel is is bracing for a possible attack on its northern northern border there's great deal of concern also in the German political establishment that this war could spread everyone is very tense about what is going to happen next we're we're waiting for a ground offensive a a ground operation that Israel is expected to carry out in the Gaza Strip they haven't begun that yet but they've been massing troops on the border with their powerful powerful Army um we're expecting that to be a very bloody battle indeed indeed and I think it's it it's fascinating that the foreign minister does want to go to Lebanon at this time right before I came into the studio I checked to see whether that trip is still on because in fact uh the German foreign service is warning Germans to leave Lebanon at this point so she's uh clearly still intending to go in the opposite direction the hisbah have been sending uh Rockets already across the border but so far U limited Military targeting Israel responding in kind so no evidence yet of the kind of wider attack uh that uh that certainly many people fear could occur that would open up a second front for Israel very problematic at the time when it does plan to try to uh attack uh or Revenge uh the attack by Hamas uh and at the same time concern that should Hezbollah then uh move toward uh a real uh allout attack in the north uh of Israel that Iran gets pulled in as well because of course hisbah is a proxy for Iran so that is part of the Frantic diplomacy that we are seeing the attempt to PR Prevail upon hisbah interestingly enough his bu's leader nasrala has not spoken in the entire 16 days since the attack occurred this is is interesting if you compare it to the situation in 2006 where essentially he gave an incendiary speech and that was the beginning of uh of a very very uh terrible violence that hisbah perpetrated so clearly at the moment hisbah is considering its options but we've seen the Iranian foreign minister for example traveling to Lebanon to say to issue essentially a very clear warning that Iran and hisbah are prepared to act and of course we've also seen tweets by the leadership in tan saying time is up whatever that's supposed to mean so rather cryptic an extremely extremely inflammable flammable situation here that could indeed uh turn into a massive conflict with International implications if we consider the fact that there are two US aircraft carriers now also in the region very very very concerning and therefore perhaps no wonder that we're seeing this kind of you know Sleepless uh 247 diplomacy by the foreign minister and by so many other International leaders exactly um looking at at Iran and trying to understand the calculus of Hamas in launching this horrific attack on Israel on October 7th which left at least 1,400 uh israelies dead including a number of foreign Nationals it must be said all those hostages more than 200 hostages apparently are being held uh in Hamas control territory in in the Gaza Strip probably in tunnels deep underground and what their fate will be is also hanging in the balance as well but one has to ask oneself oneself what what is the calculus that Hamas had in launching this attack what is it that they were hoping to to unleash with that because it's certainly not going to help the Palestinian cause in the short or the medium term and one has to wonder if the intention was to to provoke Israel indeed into such a response that it would unleash something much wider this is in the back of everyone's Minds it's a deep concern it's motivating the shuttle diplomacy that we're seeing this blurry of diplomacy uh into not just into Israel but into all neighboring countries as well uh could that have been the calculus and how how concerned should we be that Iran will indeed respond when in once in Israel begins its ground offensive in the Gaza STP well three things uh you know one of the first things that people looked at after the Hamas attack was the degree of of explicit involvement by Iran in this attack so far we have seen no clear evidence that Iran in some way indirectly or directly ordered the attack that it was uh complicit in this particular incident there is no doubt at all whatsoever about it its overall complicity it has been supplying Hamas and hisbah of course with weapons it is essentially Jihad we should also mention I mean there are other terrist groups inside precisely so there is no doubt about Iran's General complicity nonetheless we have not yet seen specific evidence that it in any way ordered this attack or that it told Hamas now is the time but there is thinking that for Hamas the timing had everything to do with the fact that Israel and Saudi Arabia were just about to sign another in the agreement a set of agreements known as the Abraham Accords those is has have been the uh agreements by which a variety of Arab countries have recognized Israel's existence and thereby established diplomatic relations with Israel for the first time that's UAE bahin Qatar and Saudi Arabia the biggest prize in the region was about to do the same now that clearly is not in Iran's interest and many feel that Hamas may have been looking to try to stop that and then to provoke the kind of Palestinian suffering that indeed would discredit uh Israel so greatly that they would no longer be a partner for Saudi Arabia going forward I've been reading also that uh Hamas apparently felt that it had been completely overlooked in any talks uh with in that in these Abraham Accords that you're talking about and that relations between Saudi Arabia and Hamas are are not uh are not exactly what Hamas would would perhaps like them to be anyway um stay with us Melinda we're going to we're still still waiting for that press conference to get underway in Tel Aviv with the German foreign minister um but first we're going to look at some other news uh trying to get queued up here Palestinian militants in uh we've been talking about them they will they continue to fight fire Rockets into Gaza uh into Israel from Gaza on Thursday now this happened as Israeli forces struck Targets in the Gaza Strip throughout the day including in the south of the territory where Israel had told gazin to head for their own safety one explosion there reportedly killed and and injured several people including children a father carrying his child to the Grave his was one of three children among those receiving the final rights on this Baron Pat of land prayers are h to the sound of Israeli aircraft hovering above a constant menace to the Palestinians below and a reminder of the air strike on the town of Kanan yunes that killed the civilians being buried here hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled the northern part of the Gaza Strip after Israel told them to leave for the South running out of food and desperate for shelter they have found no reprieve from Israel's Relentless bombing campaign [Music] we came from gasa City they told us to come to the South so we came to the South we found that the strikes intensified in the South we stayed in a house in front of us there were strikes behind us strikes there's no safety there's nowhere safe in gasa you have to be ready to die and to just stay in your house Israel vows to continue you targeting Hamas all over Gaza when there is a threat originating or being conducted against Israel from the south and we will strike absolutely and it will soon move its powerful Army into the strip Israel's defense minister told troops massing on its border I promise you that whoever sees gasa now from afar will'll see it from the inside good luck an Israeli ground operation will likely focus on the north at least in the initial stages with hus expected to put up Fierce resistance the batt confines of Southern Gaza may still prove a sanctuary of sorts now Haim baloa is a journalist who is now in Gaza earlier I asked him about the humanitarian situation there the Mediterranean situation is getting hard and harsh um no electricity no no power at all um no drinking water uh no internet um limited access to food um no borders no trucks coming in uh people are lying on vories in grocery shops and restaurants people can afford some stuff but still uh others are not um some people are staying in um at schools and they are providing very limited amount of food and ACC in to the limited amount that they have according to their official um uh all the services and infrastructure are down in in NAA barely we are connected on the phone it come it comes and goes no internet people are not communicating um as regular um people don't know here and the officials like how long that SCA can survive with the current situation their efforts to resume Aid deliveries to Gaza across the border with Egypt are Palestinians in Gaza expecting those Aid deliveries to resume to actually reach them well this is a question that um how and when this Aid will come um there are a lot of reports that it would come today but seems like up to now nothing came in into Gaza um with the the they are talking about 20 trucks which is very limited and this would be through the UN agencies particularly uh on and maybe R presentent we don't know yet about the mechanism and uh I don't know how how this would be distributed to Ordinary People the other people in the South or only for those refugees are staying at the ownest C is there any place in Gaza where the people there can can flee to and be safe actually not I'm I'm displaced uh myself with my family for the third time in this war um many people left their places in North and and Gaza City to the South but you know overnight here I'm in the central Goa thre and I still hear bombardments and air strikes there were many reports about air strikes in ranun which is in the South many buildings were destroyed there are many people killed in different air strikes but we can we have to say that it's more intense in Gaza and North here is is continued but still there are many people killed by or dued to the a strikes hen thank you very much for your reporting that was journalist hen Balia speaking to us from Gaza thank you well earlier I spoke with our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem I asked her why Israel has not yet launched its expected ground operation in Gaza well I think there are certainly uh strategic considerations by the Israeli Army there one still although it is expected have an element of surprise um we heard now the defense minister saying and some officials Army officials saying that you know saying to the Troops you will see Gaza from the inside soon now um this could be an indication that this will actually happen uh soon the ground Invasion but we don't know for sure uh when they will go in but there might be also other considerations here we're hearing a lot from the Israeli military correspondence here that there is a concern uh in the north with the uh border Israel's border with leanon that Hezbollah the Shiite libanese group uh militant group Hezbollah could enter the war uh we um because they have said if a ground Invasion will happen they might do so and there's a lot of concern so it could also be related to that the preparations are ongoing and we're hearing this morning there has been another evacuation order of a bigger town in the north koni that the people there should actually evacuate uh to places further south in Israel there's also a lot of concern about the hostages being held by Hamas Tanya is there any word on their face no we don't know much about uh their location um what what is happening to them uh but there has been a video that has been released uh by uh the Hamas militant Wing uh last week showing one of the hostages there in in in a you know in a different environment there she was talking to her families to her family uh so this is one of the videos that has been released the Israeli government said uh you might expect more of this but many people still don't know I mean 203 uh people are confirmed to have been taken hostages now by the military here the Israeli military but some people still don't know what happened to their families because some are still the identification Pro identification process of those who were killed in the initial attacks uh two weeks ago is still ongoing Tanya thank you DW's Tanya Kramer there in Jerusalem United Nations Secretary General Antonio gues is on his way to the Rafa border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip that's where a limited number of trucks are expected to deliver humanitarian Aid into Gaza in the coming hours it's hoped following a plan announced by the US President Joe Biden well Gaza is currently experiencing severe shortages of fuel food and medicines Israel launched air strikes of course in Gaza and sealed the territory off from supplies after Hamas militants entered Israel almost 2 weeks ago and killed at least 1,400 people the UN Chief says more than 2 million people in Gaza are at risk of dehydration and waterborne diseases civilians in Gaza desperately need core services and supplies and for that we need rapid unimpeded humanitarian access we need food water medicine and Fel now we need it at scale and we need it to be sustained earlier I spoke with kareim elari a journalist who is in Egypt's capital Cairo I asked him what Egyptian authorities are saying about when a deliveries to Gaza might resume well the talk is that it is set for today that also in the presence of the UN General Secretary gutiz um officially it's not open yet because uh there is extensive uh repair work uh especially on the Palestinian side because this area since the war was since the war broke out was bombed four times in its vicinity and the the the the street to the border crossing has extensive Dage was I hear that until now there's also until this moment a struggle in the background between the US Israel and Egypt about how much eight will be allowed in until now it's supposed to be only 20 trucks that can go to specific locations once the border is open uh but uh of course on the Egyptian side there are many many more trucks lined up talk is about that there's waiting eight of 3,000 tons right now on the other side talk for sure will be also about the foreign Nationals and possibilities for them to leave the Gaza Strip via uh this Rafa border crossing Egypt since days tries to link the two things they're saying like they can go out only if eight comes comes in and that is all still probably under discussion until now it's not sure if and when this Crossing is really opening today no we're talking about humanitarian aid for people who are living under extremely difficult conditions and civilians who are are facing serious uh health issues among other things are hungry uh why has it been so difficult kareim to get that Aid flowing back into Gaza well it is has to be done in coordination between Egypt Hamas Israel and the un uh it seems to be very very difficult from the Egyptian side they are ready to H bring the aid in the big topic for the Egyptian side is uh about crossing the border opening the border crossing and for the Palestinians to leave from there there's a big fear in Egypt about a Palestinian Exodus from Gaza Egyptian president CCE just said that the current war was not just aimed at fighting Hamas but also an attempt to push civilian inhabitants to migrate to Egypt uh that's is the big fear you have to understand there is a Palestinian and Arab trauma about a nakba the fear that Palestinians once again will be forcefully displayed displaced until now in their history whenever they escaped to another country they were never allowed back and uh I think that's is really the big issue this is also the issue in Jordan This is the issue in Egypt right now why they are so reluctant that the Palestinians can come from the Gaza Strip Kareem thank you very much for now that was journalist kareim El gawari reporting from Egypt's capital Kira you are watching DW news uh we're just waiting for a news conference to begin in Tel Aviv with the German foreign minister analena Bok we're looking at live pictures now from the V men where that news conference is expected to take place we know that analina Bach is there and the press conference was supposed to be getting underway a short while ago we are waiting on it uh we will we do plan to bring that to you live when the German foreign minister speaks it's her second trip to the region in two weeks there's been a flurry of diplomacy uh trying to stop this war between Hamas and Israel from spreading into a broader region conflict cyber Security Experts are warning that International hackers are increasingly targeting Israeli websites and infrastructure in one case the Jerusalem Post news site says it was forced offline several times in recent days groups based in Gaza Iran and Russia are among those Under Suspicion in cyber War there are no clear front lines even for experts it's difficult to determine which groups are behind recent cyber attacks on Israeli websites I think it's very important to be cautious of anything that you see um misinformation and disinformation are going to be very prevalent uh throughout all of this uh groups may claim things that uh weren't necessarily attributed by them or sorry done by them there have been reports about misinformation being spread via an Israeli rocket warning app the hacker group Anon ghost claims to have managed to insert fake notifications on the app with phrases such as death to Israel and the nuclear bomb is coming the aim of these kinds of attacks appears to be creating panic and confusion but there are also attempts to cut off civilians from potentially crucial information more than 100 Israeli websites have been downed by distributed denial of service or dos attacks hackers flood websites with requests until their servers collapse one prominent example the Jerusalem Post one of Israel's most read newspapers was downed for more than 24 hours the Hecker Collective Anonymous sedan claims to be responsible for this attack they describe themselves as an anti vestern pro-islam Hecker Collective but this claim is doubted by experts it's also doubtful if they are cooperating with Hamas I think we do need to be careful of saying directly that they have coordinated with Hamas um we don't know that we don't have that uh Insight yet um however these cyber attacks are working to their advantage to the psychological aspect of um taking down the systems of Israel um perhaps uh meddling with the alerting systems uh and allowing Rockets to get through another Hecker Collective pro-russian Kil net has even threatened to Target all Israeli government systems with distributed denial of service attacks a more concerning hacking strategy is trying to get access to it systems of critical infrastructure a Microsoft report said that in early 2023 hackers used f LinkedIn profiles to POS as software developers they try to manipulate employees into installing malware it's not clear if these attacks were successful experts fear that hackers could potentially use installed back doors to destroy critical infrastructure in the instances of malware what we've seen a lot in the Ukraine is wipers being used to wipe systems uh wherein they will uh Target a power station perhaps and install wipers uh to shut down the systems there and I've seen recently coming out from Ukraine uh that that actually has more impact than a bombing because that can shut down a whole area rather than a bombing on the system which would just shut down that one power station in case hackers get access to critical infrastructure via malware the consequences can be devastating with hackers adding more complexity to an already extreme situation citizens are likely to be the main victims we're just waiting for a press conference to get underway German foreign minister analina Bach is in Tel Aviv holding talks with the Israeli leadership she's due to speak soon we're looking now at live pictures from the venue where that news conference is expected to take place uh we're going to be bringing you that that uh address live meanwhile Israel says more than 200 people were taken by taken hostage by Hamas during the terror attacks earlier this month they include the elderly the disabled and children hostages captured in southern Israel and taken to Gaza are likely to be used as a bargaining tool their distraught families are urging the Israeli government to prioritize their safe return on a wall outside the Israeli defense Ministry in Tel Aviv and on walls across Israel the images of those taken and missing the Israeli government must Focus first of all on doing whatever is necessary in order to release the hijacked people in the October 7th attack Hamas terrorists killed indiscriminately and they kidnapped civilians Soldiers the elderly disabled and children so many children now the hostages are somewhere in the Gaza Strip or under it in the untold hundreds of kilometers of tunnels Hamas has built now there'll be lots of effort put into coordinating identifying locating where the hostages are being kept as much as possible and of course in the background there's talk of potentially hostage rescue attempts but these are very very uh dangerous options with not always a guaranteed chance of success what Hamas recognizes Scott Walker says is that Israel has consistently prioritized the safe return of their citizens Shalom case in point the 19-year-old Israeli soldier held by Hamas for 5 years Israel got him back by giving up more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners to Hamas they always want to take captives they know what captives can do one Israeli soldier gilad Shalit and that's the price that Israel is willing to pay the hostages ruthlessly taken on October 7th and likely guarded now by some of the Hamas kidnappers face a lengthy captivity and indeed the threat of death from the captors the families of those hostages are shaken and Afraid desperate for any word and hopeful that the images of their sisters brothers parents grandparents remain in the Forefront of Israel's moves against Hamas if you're just joining us here on DW news we're waiting for a news conference to be begin in Tel Aviv German foreign minister anel babach is there holding talks with the Israeli leadership uh she's expected to begin speaking to the media soon we're looking at live pictures from the venue as we wait for that news conference to get underway we'll be bringing you full coverage of what she has to say the meanwhile of course everyone is n nous about when Israel might launch its ground offensive in Gaza uh when its forces do that they will likely have to deal with a formidable network of tunnels under the territory the network is reportedly used by militant islamist Hamas and other jihadist organizations dozens or perhaps even hundreds of kilometers long the tunnels are known as the Gaza Metro let's take a closer look one of many Israeli air strikes on Gaza this one targeting gaza's tunnel Network according to the Israel Defense Forces or IDF destroying the tunnels used by the militant islamist group Hamas has long been a priority for Israel's military the network runs underneath Gaza connecting its cities running to the border with Israel and also connecting the strip with Egypt the tunnels let militants store weapons launch attacks and are believed to contain Hamas command centers gaza's tunnels are also lifelines to the outside world passageways for importing essential Goods as well as Weapons Under a long-standing Israel blockade this animated video released by Israel shows what they supposedly look like inside militant islamist Hamas has been developing the tunnel Network since they came to power in 2007 recently himos claimed the tunnel network is 500 km long Hamas and other jihadist groups use tunnel exits basically holes in the ground to launch rocket attacks on Israel the launchers are then brought back underground that makes them nearly impossible for Israel to see or Target Israel has tried bombarding the tunnels in 2014 in 2017 and 2021 to destroy the network without success but with significant civilian casualties the tunnel network is reportedly woven underneath marketplaces apartment blocks and hospitals US President Joe Biden has urged Americans to support tens of billions of dollars in funding for Israel and Ukraine saying they were fighting for democracy in a rare speech from the White House's Oval Office he stressed that backing both was vital for US National Security Biden said the world was looking to America for leadership and that the US couldn't afford to abandon its allies American leadership is what holds the world together American alliances what keep us America safe American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with to put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine if we turn our backs on Israel it's just not worth it that's why tomorrow I'm going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America's national security needs to support our critical Partners including Israel and Ukraine is a smart investment that's going to pay dividends forer American Security for Generations help us keep American troops out of Harm's Way help us build a world that is safer more peaceful more prosperous for our children and grandchildren earlier I asked DW's William glue to tell us more about Biden taking that unusual step of addressing the American people from the Oval Office it is unusual I'm trying to remember a time when the a a US president gave a major Prime Time National address about something going on and we're cutting straight back to Tel Aviv where German foreign minister anel neok is about to address the media she is on a three-nation tour of the Middle East uh she with stops in Lebanon Jordan and Israel she's currently in Tel Aviv this is her second visit to the region within two weeks an Elena babach of course uh serving as German foreign minister here we go I talked to my counterpart and Minister bans today in Israel here and I assured both of them that Germany stands firmly at the side of Israel Israel not only has the right but also the obligation to protect its population within the framework of the international law and in each talk also today when notices that the terror of Hamas the inhumane atrocities have hurt Israel severely and they are very hard to digest this inhumanity remains being a break in history the plight of the families are devastating and the world needs to know about them therefore it was very important to me to talk to family members to travel to Israel to listen to their horrible experiences and to disseminate them to the world and this is why yesterday when I was in Jordan I held a press conference there and I reported about the press conference that took place here I sat beside a father next to a spouse who just normally said goodbye to his wife and his daughters into to the weekend who traveled to their grandparents and then he got a call from a shelter full of panic in the voices of their loved ones and ever since he hadn't heard anything about them but he had to watch a video where he saw his two young children who were not yet even in primary school they were pulled onto a truck and he doesn't know where they are now these and very similar horrible Deeds show the inhumanity of the Hamas terrorists all that shows why this terrorism needs to be fought because without fighting Hamas there is no peace there is no security not in Israel but also not in region being a close friend of Israel it's also our task to use our influence so that this country in the light of Terror and mourning doesn't lose itself because that's exactly what the terrorists want to achieve and this Playbook of terrorism needs to be counteracted and therefore it's very important to think Beyond Today particularly when your heart is burning the terrorists want the do dehumanization of the conflict they want to produce new pictures of atrocity they don't care about people also not about the people living in Gaza and this is what Democratic states like Israel distinguishes from the terrorists of Hamas Israel care about people in Israel and in Gaza Palestinians and this is what I heard in Israel we're not going to give up our humanity is what I heard time and time again and this is what distinguishes democratic States from terrorists like Hamas and during my talks over the last week yesterday I was in Jordan before that I was in Egypt and I held many telephone calls talked here in Israel and also in Germany I underlined time and again even though it might seem to be squaring the circle something which seems to be impossible everybody who believes in humanity have two ideas in their minds at the same time two ideas which cannot be separated from each other on the one hand we have the underlying evil terror Terror of heras needs to be fought against otherwise there will be no peace there will be no security neither for Israel no for Palestinians but then again on the other hand to call major suffering amongst the civilian population in Gaza is not only to create fertile ground for new terrorism but it will also do away and jeopardize the steps of approachment with Arab neighbors because there is the risk of a regional configration and this is the calculus of the terrorist and this terrorist calculus must not Prevail the suffering of a Palestinian mother in Gaza who doesn't know she can get drinking water for her thirsty children will not bring back any of the abducted children back to their Israeli parents and it also would make one or any of the atrocities carried out byas would nullify them we all have seen the horrible pictures of the dead people at the hospital in Gaza hospitals need to be protected by all woring parties they must not be attacked by anybody blaming various actors on the basis of social media posts are put together very quickly and are being disseminated very quickly they are used as a tool of propaganda and the evidence provided by Israel cause very strong doubt in the theory promulgated by yamas and this is why yesterday when I was in Jordan want against this reaction to blame one side without clear evidence for the International Community it's very important to carry out a profound and thorough investigation I talked to my interlocutors onite today and I talked about the humanitarian Supply in Gaza I talked about protected areas in Gaza like civilian infrastructure house Hospital and schools the situation in Gaza is disastrous everything is missing lacking the responsibility for that has to be born by Hamas with their atrocities last weekend we have increased our aid from Germany by 50 million EUR and we can start providing Aid and supplying Aid immediately at the crossborder point of Rafa there are many aid supplies piling up there and I talk to my counterparts to do everything possible in order to open the border crossing for the flow of humanitarian Aid what's particularly urgently needed is drinking water so that Cola and other diseases cannot spread over the next couple of days the concern around the 100 hostages families children and abducted by Hamas is something that we cannot let go of we're concerned about abducted hostages German Nationals women and children amongst them the pain and suffering of family members is Without Limits it's also our own pain and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to talk very closely to the Israeli government our partners in the region and we also work together with various actors and talk to various actors in the neighboring countries and United Nations and international organizations these innocent hostages need to be released immediately these are innocent parents children grandparents we all want to prevent that the entire region plummets into chaos and this is why yesterday I traveled to Jordan This Is Why I'm going to continue traveling to Lebanon and this is why I'm very clear in my messages in these locations his baa must not pull Lebanon into this conflict like so many others I'd like to emphasize here I warn Iran I warn she shite militias in Iran and in Yemen to join the band wagon of Terror and to put fuel to the fire in spite of the Unspeakable Terror and suffering in spite of this unspeakable tension concern and nervousness that you notice across the entire region what I'm also perceiving is a small spark of hope although a very small one young people old people almost everybody uh adolescents and children that I talk to in the Reg that I met in the region over these days they all have the same wish it's the wish to live in peace and security and safety the wish of children and young people to go to school simply free of Terror free of humanitarian suffering it's the wish for Humanity you're going to travel to Cairo to a peace Summit what are your expectations regarding the peace Summit Cairo I talked about this small very small spark of hope this meeting takes place in a situation where we not only have an very high level of tension amongst all parties in the region but also where we International Partners come together in order to make our best contribution in order to prevent Regional configration and to this end a meeting of various Partners can contribute all those countries and representatives of governments who meet there over the last days have talked to each other bilaterally nonstop they had gathered on various locations and we now meet in a larger round in order to ask the question how to prevent confguration how to prevent a civilian disaster and catastrophe this is what we are going to talk about together although it's very clear that we have different angles on the situation in the course of these days at the same time there an opportunity to make it very clear that terrorism is to the benefit of nobody in this region we all need to have this shared interest to prevent uh the conflict from spreading in the region and I travel as a representatives of the German government because particularly Egypt plays an important role when it comes to uh preventing a configuration in the region it's a very important partner also with a view to providing uh Aid to the region you mentioned Iran uh how is the fundamental willingness of engaging in talk are they ready to communicate at with without a contribution and support of Iran wouldn't have been possible to be carried out at the same time during these days we have various channels of talk to Iran in order to bring it across that no further fuel must be put to the fire we need to do everything in order to keep the spreading at Bay and this is why we using our channels talk to All actors in order to prevent such a configration from happening and that was German foreign minister analena barbach wrapping up a news conference in Tel Aviv in her second trip to the and that was German foreign minister analina Bach wrapping up a uh her second well wrapping up a news conference on her second trip to the region within two weeks uh with me in the studio is our chief political analyst Melinda crane she was following uh the foreign minister speech along with me Melinda uh let's talk about what she had to say it was a a powerful address I thought she she made she made an interesting uh division between the inhumanity of hum hum humas and the humanity of Israel and she was stressing the need for Israel not to lose that Humanity in its response indeed uh and in that way she's gone a bit further than in some of her past speeches she reiterated once again the fact that Israel has not only a right but also a duty to protect its citizens and that Israel must fight must fight Hamas so that is a message that we certainly have heard from her before this this very passionate solidarity with Israel but then she said it is also important that In the Heat of the Moment that Israel does not lose itself does not lose its own Humanity and I thought when I heard her words once again of Joe Biden warning Israel saying you know after 911 we in the force of the rage and the heat of that moment and she also used the term Heat of the Moment we made some bad decisions now she didn't go that far but she did imply uh that Israel risks giving Hamas exactly what they want if there are many many images appearing of civilians suffering in Gaza that that exactly uh could be one of hamas's aims because that can drive a wedge between Israel and the Arab neighbors with which it has been trying to cultivate better relations and there too she suggested indirectly don't give Hamas that don't let them essentially stall this Raposa this this uh increasing proximity between you and your neighbors uh by by In the Heat of the Moment creating those kind of images and then she went on to issue a very clear warning once again to Iran saying and uh in answer to a question we do have channels of communication that we are using and you'll remember that the Amir of Qatar was just uh here in Berlin and spoke with Chancellor Schultz that visit had been planned before but Schultz said he had some very clear words to Qatar which of course is also in close contact with Iran so there is a very strong message there to Iran essentially to hisbah and she said once again she is planning to go to Lebanon although her own Ministry has told Germans that uh it's time to think about leaving Lebanon but she is planning to go to Lebanon to uh convey that message in person clearly stay out don't get into this conflict on the topic of Iran uh she also said that the Hamas terrorist attack against uh Israel on October 7th that killed so many people and and where so so many were abducted uh this would not have been possible without Iran's support she she said that very clearly we're hearing her also Echo words that we've heard from Chancellor Schultz before Chancellor Schultz had uh tried to impress upon Israel the need not to act in rage right to not be blinded by rage I think was the phrase that Chancellor Schultz used in in addressing that we also heard that same warning from chancell Schultz when he was visiting the region also in Tel Aviv just a couple of days ago warning Iran warning Hezbollah directly not to get involved in this another point that she was trying to make uh during her her news conference just there now was regarding the the plight of the refugees of drawing uh not the refugees but the hostages rather the plight of the hostages that have been taken more than 200 hostages uh elderly uh women and children among them some children uh not even in Pre not even in primary school yet uh there's great concern surrounding that she was obviously moved by the stories of the relatives that she had met indeed she has been telling those stories that pretty much every stop on these diplomatic trips that she's been taking trying I think to awaken um the empathy and Humanity of her interlocutors by individualizing the suffering and so she once again mentioned meeting a father a husband of families that had been taken hostage the the father having seen his two small girls loaded onto a truck and she has told similar stories uh in Israel about her encounters with Palestinians in Jordan uh just before traveling on to Israel she met with a Palestinian uh with Palestinian young people and has talked about that so indeed trying in a way to put faces onto the suffering of uh but she has made it very very clear as you say that Israel nonetheless does have a right to take action and this is a challenge uh for German leaders to try to convey what she said very eloquently that we must all hold two ideas in our minds at the same time that there is this need to protect this need to fight Terror and at the same time to preserve our own Collective humanity and that it's hard to hold that kind of ambivalence in a time of conflict and fear absolutely uh another important theme in her in her talk just there was regard was regarding the humanitarian situation the suffering in Gaza right now that the people there are enduring she Drew attention to uh some of the the deprivations that the people in Gaza are suffering right now and efforts to try to assure that those people are not going to be left in that situation uh she made it very clear that the suffering of the civilians in Gaza is not going to bring any of the hostages home uh she tried to make a very very clear point about that as well but getting humanitarian Aid into Gaza to help the civilians under these conditions is proving extremely difficult uh can Germany or anyone else uh make that happen they're doing what they what they can clearly and it's interesting to note that Germany does have some contacts in the region that at least for the moment are not open to the US Joe Biden had planned to meet with the leaders of Jordan and Egypt when he went to Israel this week and they canel those meetings after the bombing at the hospital precipitously probably not justified now that we are pretty sure this was a rocket that was fired by Islamic Jihad not by Israel but nonetheless those meetings were canceled whereas the chancellor does have an open line of communication with the Egyptian leadership and she will be traveling on tomorrow to attend this peace Summit that has been called by Egypt with other uh Arab leaders to clearly talk about how they can try to open up these humanitarian corridors that are so badly needed at the same time as we know Egypt is very concerned about opening up a corridor that could be used by Palestinians to leave Gaza and enter Egypt both because of concerns about massive migration but also because of concerns about ethnic cleansing that would essentially see Palestinians uh no longer living in Gaza so again an enormous dilemma there for all parties trying to get this Crossing open trying to get these corridors open with the clock ticking as she said there is massive danger to those civilians trapped there in the south of Gaza without water food medicine and power supplies indeed U Melinda thank you very much our our chief political analyst Melinda crane with us in the studio um that that was anal Bach of
