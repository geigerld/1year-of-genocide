health workers in Gaza have begun vaccinating more than 600,000 children against polio Aid workers are carrying out immunizations across the territory the program depends on Israel and Hamas sticking to agreed humanitarian pauses in the fighting polio spreads rapidly in unsanitary conditions and can cause paralysis and death and we can now speak to Dr Richard piporn he represents the World Health organization in the Palestinian territories and joins us now from Gaza Dr P cor the drive to vaccinate 650,000 children started yesterday how's it going yeah I think it's a daunting task and and greeting from Gaza I'm actually the office in darala and this is also the emergency Operation Center for polio so actually it's a meeting ongoing with all the key Partners Ministry of Health UNICEF wh Rob many of the ngos we do this really jointly focus is to vaccinate 640 at least 640,000 children and and get a 90% coverage and the campaign is two phes uh we the campaign started right now and four weeks we will repeat we need to cover at least 90% uh to actually stop the outbreak and the transmission in Gaza but also prevent International spread so you touched on this area specific humanitarian polies which are absolutely uh critical and we welcome that so we have now divided G in three zones so you talk about the the central the the the central zone uh where we are now uh then we are talking about a wi Target population 156,000 children then the South Target population 340,000 and then the North 150 in each Zone we have three days to vaccinate and and when needed we'll add another day so we started yesterday and first day was good I would say I there was an enormous uh yeah good vibe on on the streets we talk about 513 teams and we reached actually more than 80 almost 87,000 uh children which is 53 teams and I went to many of those fix sites and and and mobile teams many many parents with their children Etc and actually happy to come and so people excuse me for interrupting but uh people um the people of Gaza are willing to uh bring their children to get vaccinated definitely I mean there's always actually an a high vaccination Acceptance in in in Gaza and the West Bank by the way as well and and and before this crisis the routine immunization program in in Gaza had coverage as high as 90 to 95% actually higher than than than a number of European countries High income countries so there's a huge acceptance and and even today to today I went with a number of teams mobile teams uh and we went to this um along this Coastal Road where you see these endless and endless makeshifts uh shelters and camps and everywhere we went with his mobile team checking on children Etc almost all those kids were vaccinated in but again it's just the the the second day of the campaign we still have 10 days to go and there's absolutely critical that all the parties stick to this SoCal humanitarian specific paes and the families can go out that that their children can go out and that these 513 teams 2,200 health workers and and community outreach workers can do their job uh very briefly please uh what's the biggest hurdle standing in the way of reaching your goal I think the biggest hurdle would be I mean well first of all I think the the complexity of the situation and and as I said all these pieces of this puzzle they have to fit together the humanitarian PES is the most critical one I want to also add something overall when you look so we are now a little bit in a polio bubble first today we make some good step forward but the overall health situation is deeply deeply concerning and you talk about Hospital functionality less than half of the hospitals are partly functional and and less than a third of the primary health care centers are functional we see of course an environment of a Water Sanitation conditions which is horrific and it's a breeding ground for many infectious diseases including of course polio uh we we we seen an enormous amount of of hepatis a jish diarrheal diseases so the oral feal transmission Etc also links to uh polio but maybe a small array of home if he can do this kind of campaign if he can do this kind of campaign maybe much more is possible in in Gaza of course ultimately what everybody wants here is a ceasefire and and and and a start of of Peace Arrangements in a peace process Dr Richard paper from D do wh's West Bank and Gaza office thank you very much thank you
