turning now to the war in Gaza where a team from the world's Health Organization has visited the AL AXA the oxa hospital excuse me and described chaotic scenes who staff said that they were delivering supplies to the hospital and witnessed large numbers of wounded people being brought in for Urgent Treatment after an explosion wh staff filmed from inside the hospital which they said was in dire need of medical supplies the hospital hital described as gaza's most important is also dealing with critical staff shortages the organization is planning to facilitate the deployment of Emergency Medical Teams to help support overworked doctors and nurses the wh's coordinator said that evacuation orders had and fierce fighting had forced most medical staff to leave he urged protection of the hospital this hospital is currently operating with about 30% of the staff that had had just a few days ago um they are seeing in some cases hundreds of casualties every day in a small emergency department uh yesterday they said they had one doctor working overnight in this emergency department with and it's it's really a chaotic scene the hospital director just spoke to us and he said his one request is that this Hospital be protected even though many of his staff have left so that's the message from the who the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is due in Israel for talks on the war in Gaza as fears grow that the conflict could widen across the region speaking in Qatar blinkin said that it was imperative to protect civilians in Gaza Israel is battling Hamas which classified as a terrorist organization by the US Germany and many other countries Anthony blinkin on a diplomatic drive to prevent the spread of the Israel Hamas war after meetings in Qatar the the US Secretary of State warned on Sunday the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza could metastasize and threaten Security in The Wider Middle East in Doha linkoln laid out his goals and he had praise for his hosts in all of my meetings over the last two days we've discussed ongoing efforts to better protect civilians in Gaza and to get more humanitarian assistance to them and to get the remaining hostages out and home with their loved ones cter was instrumental in the negotiations that led to the simultaneous release of more than 100 hostages including American citizens uh and a pause in the fighting that during that time enabled us to double the flow of humanitarian Aid to civilians in Gaza for these displaced Palestinians caught in the crossfire of this conflict in Gaza help can't come soon enough and the US Secretary of State made his position on their status clear Palestinians civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow they cannot they must not be pressed to leave Gaza but at the funeral of two Palestinian journalists killed in an apparent Israeli air strike in the south of the Gaza Strip the prospect of Peace seems far away binkin said the killings were an unimaginable tragedy and that he was deeply sorry for the family's loss the US top diplomats Middle East tour continues on Monday with visits that include Israel and the occupied West Bank and the German foreign minister is also on a trip to the Middle East it's her fourth visit to the region since the October 7th attacks today she visited a Palestinian Village in the West Bank here's what she had to say after the meeting with people there we know by listening to different Palestinians what it means that radical settlers are forcing people away from their home but it makes a differ if you really speak to people who just lived here a few hundred meters away and now had to move with their seven children because they cannot guarantee the security of their own family anymore because radical settlers are checking also their children this is not only inhuman this is illegal illegal under Israeli law this is illegal under international law and I want to make very clear as a German foreign minister from Germany that we are standing for the right of every Palestinian people to live freely and secure in their own house and this is why we are calling on the Israel government to not look away when radical settlers are threatening Palestinian people but to take up their obligation of protecting Palestinians living here on their own territory and we are here because we want to underline that a two-state solution meaning that people can live freely and security and in dignity in Gaza and also in the west yland is of high importance in the West Bank is of high important for the future of both Israelis and Palestinians the German foreign minister speaking a short while ago Tanya Kramer is standing by with a view from Jerusalem so you know with the German foreign minister we just heard for speaking there visiting Palestinians in the West Bank remind us of the biggest issues there at the moment she specifically touched on settler violence and security yeah I think this was one of the biggest uh issues here what we've been hearing uh this morning but of course she the German foreign minister analina Bok was also holding talks with Palestinian officials uh in ramala but she made a point in visiting a village uh in the occupied West Spang a Palestinian Village that is close to Israeli settlements there and we could hear her you know talking in length about the impact of uh uh settler Violence by extremist Israeli settlers uh on Palestinians uh living there she said that it's Israel's Duty uh to protect them and that also Palestinians have a right to live in peace and security uh in uh their area she also again we heard it there criticized uh settlement building or the expansion of settlements which is seen as illegal under international law by uh most of the international uh Community now this of course comes on the backdrop of uh more incidents that have been recorded since uh uh at least the beginning of the war since October 7th the terror attacks there uh in the occupied West Bank by uh extremist settler Violence by Israeli human rights organizations and also by uned United Nations and uh that has resulted in injuries uh property damage and also displacement especially among the Hing and Veteran communities in the occupied West Bank Tanya how about the situation in Gaza because um after meeting with Israeli officials yesterday the German foreign minister also said that it was and I'm quoting here um increasingly clear that the Israeli Army must do more to protect civilians in Gaza then she called for a less intense operation How likely is the Israeli government likely to to listen to that call from Berlin well I think you have to see um you know Germany I mean she also reiterated of course that uh Germany is standing side by side uh with Israel and that Israel has the right to defend itself uh uh as since the October 7th uh attacks so uh that is of course what she said as well but she also and I think there we see a slight change also in what Germany is saying that comes along what you also hear from the United States and we've been hearing that and the US Secretary of State Antony blinkin is also in in the region that more needs to be done uh to protect Palestinian civilians and to get more Aid uh into Gaza now what impact does that have that is still to be seen uh Germany has increased its humanitarian assistance but of course Al as United States they have not called for a full ceasefire as of yet Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem thank
