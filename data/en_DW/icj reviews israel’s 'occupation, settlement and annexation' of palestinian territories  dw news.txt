now the un's top court is opening a week of hearings on the legal consequences of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories more than 50 countries are expected to give evidence at the international court of justice in the ha the hearings requested by the UN General Assembly are separate from the ongoing genocide case brought by South Africa there are currently for 144 settlements in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem all illegal under international law in addition there are more than a 100 Jewish outposts not sanctioned by the Israeli government a new Jewish neighborhood is taking shape in East Jerusalem this building site is illegal under international law the apartment being built here will become one of the many Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories East Jerusalem was annexed by Israel in 1967 but the International Community considers it a part of the West Bank Palestinians say the settlers are encroaching on the land they one day envisage as the capital of a Palestinian State the West Bank is partly controlled by the Palestinian Authority but Israel maintains full control of 2third of the territory the two groups are separated by walls and checkpoints limiting movement for Palestinians Palestinian Farmers have complained that this Patchwork of zones create unfair access to resources like water and Jewish settlers are accused of attacking crops property and people at the end of 2022 the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution asking the international court of justice to weigh in on the situation the world court is being asked to give an advisory opinion on the occupation and what consequences it has on the Palestinian people's right to self-determination it's being asked to look at the occupation annexation and settlement of Palestinian territory including measures aimed at altering demographics and discriminatory legislation the court will hear from representatives of over 50 countries let's pick this up with d correspondent Lucia Shulton who's at the hag at the moment morning Lucia what's expected to happen today yeah so the court has already started its session um it started or it will start with a little uh introdu introduction by by the court and then after this the Palestinian Representatives will be given three hours among them is also top Diplomat Riad al-maliki who will start the Palestinian presentation today uh and as I said then they're given 3 hours this is more time than all of the other states that will be heard from tomorrow on are given the rest of the states will have uh 30 minutes what is important to know that this is a very different case than the other big case that is happening here in the he which is the genocide convention case where South Africa brought Israel to the international court of justice um over an alleged breach of that said convention the genocide convention okay now the international Community already regards Israel's settlement building in the occupied territories as illegal so why does this need to be in court so this case has been brought here by the United Nation General Assembly they have asked for a so-call advisory opinion back in 2022 so before the Israel Hamas war and um it is important to note that the world Court here behind me um does give this advisory opinions when they're asked to do so as I've said have been asked in 2022 this advisory opinion is not legally binding binding it is exactly what the name is it is advisory so um the the general assembly wanted to know um on a relatively broad range of topics um we wanted to get an assessment of the situation um in the occupied Palestinian territories edit has said and it wants to get the details or the legal consequences um on the settlement occupation and annexation of the Palestinian um territory as the question has stated and it wants to know which legal consequences come from this for the United Nations itself but also for other states okay so This concerns Israel's actions on the West Bank but would this advisory uh opinion have any legal bearing on Israel's current actions in Gaza well it is uh it is relatively broad The Advisory opinion so it's also especially on the question question of EAS Jerusalem um it is not expected to have a direct effect on the situation that is happening right now in Gaza because as I said it is not legally binding nevertheless this is the world Court it has a weight and it says so itself so that means that whatever comes out with this advisory opinion it could be that other states or the United Nations act upon this and draw their conclusions out of this but it it also as it comes as a time it is also considered to give political pressure um the opinion is expected to come relatively quickly in the past it took around 6 months for an advisory opinion to be issued so it is likely to assume that this will also be the case here okay thank you uh DW correspondent Luccia Schon at the
