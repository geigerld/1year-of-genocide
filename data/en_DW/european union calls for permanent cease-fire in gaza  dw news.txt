Europe is also pushing Israel to agree on terms for a post-war future the European Parliament has adopted a resolution calling for a permanent ceasefire but the resolution contains the stipulation that Hamas designated as a terrorist group by the EU must be first dismantled and that all Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the October 7th Terror attacks on Southern Israel must be released the resolution also calls for renewed efforts to find a lasting political solution to the conflict let's get more now from Brussels DW cross bruss DW Brussels correspondant Jack perck Jack sorry for messing that intro up but how significant is this resolution by the European Parliament calling for a Gaza ceasefire yeah it's it's pretty significant symbolically but practically and legally not very significant at all uh the 312 MEPS of the 705 in in the European Parliament voted in favor there were a number of abstentions and also a number of no-shows as well so it's not like a massively overwhelming majority and like I say it doesn't legally bind the European Union it isn't an overall EU position this is not a vote by the governments of the European Union and as you mentioned the stipulations that the center right um politicians within the European Parliament insisted on which was the call for the dismantling of the Hamas terrorist organization and the release of all hostages those conditions to get the vote over the line which meant that many of them voted in favor were were what the Israelis were basically saying that they could accept this vote that they would want to permanent ceasefire we've heard that from the Israeli um mission to the European Union they've said that this vote basically Falls in line that they want to permanent ceasefire if Hamas is dismantled and if all of the hostages are released so this was a resolution of the EU Parliament but does that mean that member states are also United on this issue not really no uh that's where we're seeing real divisions the European Parliament there were obviously a number of people voting against it in the in the parament as well but the EU countries so the 27 countries of the European Union are divided we're seeing countries like Ireland and Belgium for instance who are very keen for a ceasefire have also considered backing South Africa's claim uh for the look into uh accusations of Israel of genocide by Israel in Gaza at the international court of justice that case taking place last week other countries for instance Germany are much closer in line with the Israel position of the right to self-defense all countries say that Israel has the right to defend itself but others are putting and for instance Ireland and Belgium are putting significant pressure on the European Union to put pressure on the Israelis to to bring about a ceasefire I mean you did call this resolution significant but how much influence does the EU really have with Israel right now given that we've just seen Israel publicly defying its closest and most powerful Ally the United States I don't think there's any delusions here in Brussels or in the sort of corridors of power in the European Union that the real power and the real influence um on the Israeli uh government comes from the United States but they don't want to step back from this issue because they firstly have you know strong uh ties there is a strong sentiment among EU citizens on this issue as well so they don't want to stay disengaged they don't want to look like they're disengaging in any way while they're aware probably that resolutions like this aren't really going to uh put too much influence on the Israeli government which which as I say is is really looking to its strongest supporter and strongest Ally in the United States Jack perck we leave it there but thanks so much for that context
