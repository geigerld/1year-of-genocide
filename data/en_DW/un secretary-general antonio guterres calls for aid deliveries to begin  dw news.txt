the UN Secretary General Antonio gues has visited the RFA border crossing between Egypt and Gaza he called for it to be opened so that Aid can reach Palestinians Gaza is currently experiencing severe shortages of fuel food and medicines the United Nations says more than 2 million people are at risk of dehydration and waterborne diseases now Aid is currently piling up at the rougher border crossing but it is not being allowed into to the territory United Nations has called for Aid to return to precon conflict levels of 100 trucks a day speaking at the border crossing the UN Chief said the difficult situation required extraordinary humanitarian measures unfortunately this is not a normal humanitarian operation it's an operation in a war zone and that is the reason why I have appealed for a humanitarian ceas fire not that I consider that humanitarian ceas fire is a precondition for humanitarian delivery we don't want to punish the Gaza people Twice first because of the war and second because of the lack of humanitarian aid but it is clear that humanitarian C fire would make uh things much easier and much safer for everybody okay let's cross straight to Tanya ker our correspondent in Tel Aviv Tanya tell us why has it been so difficult to open the rougher border crossing and to let the aid get through into Gaza well I think we just heard it from the UN secretary uh General himself it's a extremely complicated situation in an active war zone and there need to be all the actors that need to agree on opening uh this uh Crossing we understand that under us pressure mediated by US President Joe Biden himself as he has said um the uh border crossing together with mediating between Egypt and Israel the border crossing should open to get those trucks that have been waiting there for days into Gaza but this hasn't happened yet there were expectation that there might be some opening uh today we understand that uh in Israel from sources here there's still political considerations and implications that are hindering this but also from Egyptian sources the situation is extremely difficult uh there's still Israeli air strikes also in southern Gaza there have been air strikes in the area of the crossing they say also that roads need to be uh repaired uh before trucks can go through so it is a very complicated and volatile uh situation uh where different actors you know have to agree on on on going ahead with this the uh un Secretary General also made a very clear point of calling for a humanitarian ceasefire is that likely at all it doesn't look very likely at this point if it's already so difficult to open this border crossing uh for goods we are not even talking about opening the other part of this Crossing to open it up for people um there was some point in the past two weeks that we've been seeing that people with dual nationality or foreign National Palestinians could maybe be evacuated through uh this Crossing now this has been all closed now for the past two weeks so it's so important uh you know to get people out and get the humanitarian Aid in and for the moment um it will be very difficult also for the humanitarians you know once if this border crossing is open and the trucks come in also to distribute it it's a major challenge we understand that uh according to the Israeli army they they defined a very small area in Gaza now in the South as a safe safe Zone where people could go to take shelter because also air strikes are continuing there's also sporadic rocket fires that coming out of Gaza but people IAL to in Gaza said it's the it's the bombardment of Gaza that is so difficult to endure because people are really fearing for their lives and they can't really go from one place to the next so that will also be difficult then to deliver uh this Aid and this is certainly also a major challenge for the humanitarian organization ations but for the moment of course first of all they need to focus on getting this Aid into Gaza Tanya we're going to come back to you in just a moment we're going to take a look now a closer look at the situation on the ground in Gaza as we were just uh hearing Israeli forces struck Targets in the Gaza Strip that was happening into the early hours of Friday morning including in the south of the territory where Israel had told gazans to head for their own safety Hamas Rockets sh drop back into Israel as well overnight and all of this is happening as Palestinians wait for Relief efforts to begin to cross the border from Egypt let's take a look they are ready and waiting a percentage of these Aid trucks is supposed to be allowed through the Rafa crossing the only Crossing into Gaza not controlled by Israel 20 in all Aid trucks for Gaza there 2 and a half million people that need assistance 20 trucks is a drop in the ocean of need right now in Gaza on the other side of the Rafa Crossing there is Mayhem and despair even if Southern Gaza is where Israel told Northern gazans to go for safety's sake heavy air strikes in conun in the South meant the overflowing Nasser Hospital took in even more wounded for critical care there's no safety there's nowhere safe in gasa you have to be ready to die and to just stay in your house when there is a threat originating or being conducted against Israel from the south then we will strike absolutely Israel's Army will soon move into the Gaza Strip Israel's defense minister told the troops massing on its border I promise you that whoever sees Gaza now from afar will see it from the side good luck an Israeli ground operation will likely focus at first on the North with Hamas expected to put up Fierce resistance all of that pushing even more gazin Southward in need of food water medical supplies and back on the other side of the Rafa Crossing aid supplies stream into a nearby airport destined to join the backup waiting to get into Southern Gaza okay let's go back to our correspondent t who's in Tel Aviv at the Israeli ground operation that we were just hearing about in that report into Gaza is expected do we know why it hasn't started yet well from what we understand there are certainly strategic implications here in considerations why it hasn't started yet I mean it's expected that uh it's not an if but when it will happen uh we won't of course know when it will happen beforehand there's a certain element of surprise we understand from the army that there are certain reorganizing regrouping around the Border where there is mass deployment you know all the tanks you can see that there's a closed military area all around the Gaza Strip so uh we are waiting for this to happen in the meantime you know the massive air strike campaign is continuing also with artillery fire and from the naval forces in the Mediterranean Sea uh on Gaza but there are also other considerations because Israel is also looking towards the uh border with Lebanon uh in the in north in the North of Israel and we heard this morning again another town in the North of Israel has has been given an evacuation order kirat Shoni so that people should leave I think there's a big concern here that this might become a wider conflict that the libanese militant Shad Group hasah which is backed by Iran might uh join uh the war they have threatened that if a ground offensive uh will happen so there a lot of concern here also and that would implicate also on the Strategic decisions here of the army when to do the ground offensive antania can I ask you about the hostages uh taken by Hamas is there any word at all on the on the fate of those hostages being held well there was one video released about one uh young uh Israeli woman this week uh from uh the Hamas militant group showing her somewhere in Gaza we also heard um from the Israeli Army uh today another confirmation that over 200 hostages are now being confirmed their families have been notified because what has been going on here in the past two weeks is that a lot of families do not know what happened to their loved ones uh those who have not seen uh their relatives being taken away on those uh very Haring uh videos um but uh the Army now said that over 20 of those hostages that are confirmed to be in Gaza are children under the age of 18 uh 10 to 20 are over 60 uh most of them are alive but they're also apparently some uh that have died but their bodies were taken uh to Gaza again they also stress that between a 100 and 200 people are still missing and um we've been visiting also the place at a military base where um those buddies are being um you know where their forensic teams looking at those buddies a very gruesome identification process going on to notify the families what happened uh to their loved ones there DW correspondent tanyaa thank you so much for that
