after days of discussions the United States says it is now ready to support a new United Nations resolution for Gaza where the UN says there is a growing risk of famine the apparent diplomatic breakthrough at the security Council comes as Israel intensifies its bombardment of the Gaza Strip in both the North and the South making the delivery of Aid increasingly difficult a new UN report is warning that more than half a million people a quarter of gaza's population now face extreme hunger we'll have more on that in a moment but first let's hear from Washington's ambassador to the UN who has expressed optimism that a new Security Council vote on Gaza can now go ahead uh we have worked hard and diligently over the course of the past week uh with uh the amadis uh with others with Egypt to come up with a resolution that uh we can support and we do have that resolution now we're ready to vote on it the draft resolution is not watered down the draft resolution is a very strong resolution that is fully supported by the Arab group that provides them uh what they feel is needed to get humanitarian assistance on the ground for more I'm now joined by DW Middle East analyst Shani rosanes Shany well welcome the the US has been the main objector to this resolution thus far but now it appears it is on board what has changed well there were two main contention points the first one was about calling Israel for a ceasefire that was the initial intent in this resolution uh American uh diplomats and the president himself have been adamantly against it all through the last weeks of fighting they managed to carefully um work around that with calling for a conditions that will allow some sort of relief in the hostilities in order to bring in the aid which is the second uh most problematic uh point on what would be the mechanism of bringing Aid in this was the main uh goal of back and forth negotiations in the last day mostly between Cairo and Washington because Egypt is the main partner uh for the issue of Aid this is the border with Gaza through which most of the ID convoys come through um it seem to finally maybe found a solution that everybody can agree on Egypt Israel the Americans and of course uh um the un uh other members who are uh all voting for this resolution that point about Aid was a major part of this resolution that has been in discussion for quite some time and now we have a un report which is warning of possible famine in Gaza what does that say about the state of the humanitarian situation in the territory it's it's dire things are really really bad I mean we see the numbers uh piling up we see Gaza used to have in normal days before October 7th around 500 um trucks coming in now we're talking on a good Daye for of about 200 and that's not even taking into calculation the fact that there were weeks that there was nothing coming in um in addition there's a whole discussion of who gets access to that Aid once it's in Gaza uh many we hear complaints of people saying Hamas takes some of it without letting us in there's talks about uh the uh the the how convoluted the whole process is how hard it is to get all all the aid equally um uh transferred because it makes it to the south of the Gaza strep and so it's very hard for people in the north to have access to it there's need to be more work into bringing Aid efficiently into Gaza now Israel in the middle of all of this has vowed to essentially continue fighting until the end until Hamas is eliminated I'm quoting Benjamin Netanyahu there and Hamas says that there has to be a ceasefire before we can even talk about releasing any more hostages given that those are the positions from on both sides uh even if the UN resol ution passes in whatever form what is the hope that either side will follow it unfortunately this resolution will not be the one making the difference on the ground you know Israel is part of the un uh but is not taking too seriously um any isolation on or or International threat of of such isolation because it has American backing still and Hamas who is also acknowledged as a as a terror organization by Israel by the US by the EU many other uh countries around the world they do not play according to the international uh you know standard rule book So eventually it comes about the meeting of interest is Hamas feeling that you know taking some time off and releasing some of the hostage is going to benefit uh him and the same thing for Israel is Israel willing now to take a step back from fighting in into putting forward the hostages situation so far uh there seems to be a deadlock when it comes to this issue uh and we're not expected to see anything different in the next days uh in Gaza unfortunately DW Middle East analyst Shany rosanas thanks very much for coming to the studio and breaking that down for us you're welcome
