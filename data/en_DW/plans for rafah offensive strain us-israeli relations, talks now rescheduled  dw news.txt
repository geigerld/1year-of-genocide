now Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has decided to reschedule a highlevel delegation to Washington DC to discuss Israel's plans for a ground assault on the southern gazan city of Rafa Netanyahu earlier withdrew from the talks after the US decided not to veto a United Nations security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza more than 1 million cousins are Sheltering in Rafa which is the last remaining urban center not to have been attacked by Israeli Ground Forces Israeli air strikes on the city overnight have raised fears that a ground assault could begin the aftermath of an air strike in Rafa a now all too familiar scene Rescuers digging bodies out of rubble things were normal there's been no trouble here the strikes just come at random about 1.5 million people live here after fleeing Israeli operations in the North from Gaza City to hunis and finally to Rafa the end of the line where food and Medicine shortages threaten an imminent famine as well as disease outbreaks but it's unclear how long people can stay or how safe they'll be the marked areas on this map show where Israel has been conducting ground operations in Gaza with troops coming close to Rafa but so far Israel has only conducted air strikes here without sending in ground troops elsewhere Fierce ground fighting continues with assaults on targets around Gaza City and Han yunas ongoing Israel's allies patience is growing thin and both the US and Germany have said that a ground incursion into Rafa would be crossing a red line US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin visited the region last week to deliver that message uh it risks killing more civilians it risks uh wreaking greater Havoc with the provision of humanitarian assistance it risks further isolating Israel around the world and jeopardizing its long-term security and standing but Israel has been ignoring these calls from its closest allies it says it will fulfill its goal of destroying Hamas and that means an invasion of Rafa is necessary even at the risk of a deeper Rift between Israel and the us we can't defeat Hamas without going into Rafa I told secretary blinken I hope to do that with the support of the United States but if we need to we will do it alone Israel says it will move civilians from Rafa into humanitarian Islands elsewhere in Gaza but has released no concrete plans let's get more from DW correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem good morning Tanya I do want to talk to you about Rafa but first what are the reasons behind Benjamin Netanyahu changing his mind now about sending a security delegation to Washington to discuss a rougher offensive well I think um we can only guess at this point uh what made this turnab uh turnabout from prime minister benami Netanyahu I mean initially it was meant to be a protest about the uh un Security Council resol resolution that was not vetoed by the United States on Wednesday he said after a visit by a Republican senator that he wanted actually to send a message uh to uh Hamas but also it is discussed here um while he was uh cancelling this visit uh his defense minister y galland was already in Washington was about to leave to Washington they had also talks now about rafar so it took out a bit the weight of this decision to cancel uh this high profile visit and we're expecting you know two of his senior officials of his cabinet uh to of of this government to travel to Washington sometime soon the US declined to veto a un call for a seasar in Gaza where does that leave relations between the US and Israel well I mean depends who you ask you know some analysts here see it as a really serious crisis others Point more to a crisis between uh the two uh leaders that they're not seeing obviously eye to eye on some of the uh issues uh certainly uh what prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also acknowledged that the international pre pressure has been stepped up but what uh analysts here looking at is actually uh one is the Diplomatic level obviously but the other level is the more practical level you know would the United States would they actually slow down for example the delivery of ordinance or weapon weapons and that doesn't seem to be uh the case and of course also um we've heard from us they do support Israel's right to defend itself but they want to see a different conduct of War as we heard also in the report and what they want to talk about uh in these talks in Washington is the uh planned ground invasion of rafar they want to hear from the Israelis what are you going to do to protect civilians that are Sheltering there we always talk about Sheltering of course there are air strikes and shellings going on as well in rafar but they want to see what are they going to do uh if a ground Invasion happens to bring those people somewhat to some kind of safety crucially Tanya does this prevent Israel from launching its offensive in Rafa well I mean this is something to ask the military um the we've heard it time in time again from prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu that this ground Invasion into Rafa is absolutely necessary to um basically to win the war and he said uh there are still Hamas battalions in the city that need to needs to be that need to be destroyed so um I have been talking also to Aid workers to un officials here they're expecting this to happen but we don't know when and in in what way it will happen we'll leave it there for the time being but thanks so much for joining us today DW correspondent Tanya K in Jerusalem thanks so much let's bring in military analyst Marina Miron from Kings College London Marina in view of the latest political and Military developments do you expect Israel to launch its offensive in Rafa and if so when good day well it is very possible that Israel will actually launch its ground operation in Rafa however we don't know when it will happen because on the one hand we have the UN Security Council resolution which according to article 25 of the UN Charter is binding now the us abstained from the vote however the United States said that some um of the points of this uh new resolution it is in agreement with and the issue here is that there are a lot of civilians one and a half million civilians a humanitarian crisis in Rafa meaning that um Israeli Army should be ensuring civilian safety before starting its ground offensive and the US would then assess um this plan in order to protect civilians first before the Israel armed forces can commence their ground operation now how they will agree on this plan where the civilians will be moved can they be moved where where is space in Gaza we know that it's very difficult right now in terms of safety in terms of humanitarian Aid to civilians so there there is a likelihood that Israel will start the ground offensive in gasa in in Rafa however we don't know when it will do so given this plan and of course it doesn't want to risk losing us support now Israel says it cannot defeat Hamas without going into Rafa if it does can it defeat Hamas there or is this just the pipe dream well we have to understand that Israel has a capability with external help in terms of uh its military to defeat Hamas military the question here is how long will it take and at what cost not just in human lives but also political cost domestically and political cost internationally therefore yes everything is possible how probable it is is another question and what kind of Fallout will be um there for Netanyahu to pick up in terms of uh explaining things to the International Community explaining things to his constituent population who want the hostages released so there is a divide in the population one part wants the hostages released more than the destruction of Hamas and so all these questions need to be answered and of course what happens in Gaza after Hamas is defeated is it livable who is going to reconstruct it now what are the military challenges in a ground operation specifically in raak right now well given the fact that it's so packed with civilians uh as I said one and a half million and it's already suffering from a humanitarian crisis allegedly a lot of Hamas Fighters would be hiding amongst the population so the IDF would need to enter another phase of urban Warfare which is difficult because the enemy doesn't wear Insignia they can be using um um population as their Shields so it's very difficult to distinguish the adversary from the population so there is a risk an increased risk of collateral damage and it's a very slow operation because you you you have to have good intelligence and you're still facing a multi-dimensional threat um given the fact that there are still tunnels so you will have to go literally from building to building so it will be very slow very painful also for the morale of the soldiers conducting it and of course for the international audience seeing because there will be collateral damage the question is how high will this collateral damage be so um conducting that operation while there are so many civilians is of course difficult but how do you filter out the civilians and just leave Hamas in Rafa so is it even possible so that's another dilemma that the Israeli military will be facing if they are to conduct a ground operation before ensuring safety of at least a portion of civilians uh who are now in Rafa the military analyst Marina Miron there Kings College London thank you very much Marina thank you for having
