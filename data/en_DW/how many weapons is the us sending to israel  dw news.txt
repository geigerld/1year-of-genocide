the Pentagon has quietly ramped up weapons shipments that are headed for Israel and I say quietly because there are some transparency concerns with the Biden White House Under Pressure to disclose the extent of its deliveries to Congress air defense and artillery rocket system tanks infantry fighting Vehicles helicopters and manal systems that is just some of the US's military assistance provided to Ukraine a detailed list of weapons is released with every new military aid package for ke why is Washington not doing the same with weapons for Israel we are providing assistance to Israel through very different mechanisms than how we provide assistance to Ukraine the funding mechanisms and how we're supplying Aid it's it's two different countries two different Wars and and again you know two different areas of responsibilities the Biden Administration faces pressure to disclose the extent of us arms in Israel at least to Congress in the National Security funding requested to Congress that the White House included an exemption for Aid to Israel citing the country's urgent need the request includes the authority to wave Congressional notification requirements something Washington never requested for Ukraine this means the Israeli government would be able to purchase billions of military articles and services in complete secrecy Israel is the world's largest communative recipient of us Aid in support for Israel's security has been a Cornerstone of American foreign policy but with Israel's intense bombing of the Gaza Strip scrutiny on the role the US is playing is also increasing it is absolutely critical that Congress is able to to review to have transparency on all of the weapons that are going so that it can determine uh as it appropriates funds to taxpayer funds frankly um to continue to buy these weapons that they're used um for you know the the Urgent defense needs um but that are not used used in ways that contravene us laws policies or international law on um Waging War is accusations grow that the US government is not complying with its conventional arms transfer policy some Democrats are talking of conditioning future US military aid to Israel if that happens the pressure on President Biden to take a more critical look at America's military support for Israel will only increase intensively for I want to pull in now Clinton he's director for the United States at Eurasia group and joins me from Washington DC Clayton it's good to have you with us tonight what do you think is behind this double standard arms to Ukraine are publicly declared military assistance to Israel shrouded in secrecy first thank you for having me uh I think that the difference here has less to do with Israel and more to do with Ukraine actually uh Ukrainian Aid is extraordinary it was all supplemental funding requests Standalone bills that go beyond normal Baseline funding and it's been relatively politically sensitive Republicans both members of Congress and Republican voters have been somewhat skeptical of the need for ongoing very high levels of us Aid and as the war in Ukraine has continued on that's led to very high levels of transparency in what exactly is being sent that's more to Mifi domestic political concerns the practice of not disclosing specific military aid or amounts of armament being sent to Israel is actually a continuation of relatively long-standing US policy so I would highlight the political sensitivity around approving or even sustaining Ukraine Aid as the primary difference or the primary reason for that difference in transparency so so the lack of transparency with Aid going to Israel you're you're saying it's correct there's nothing new do we have any idea what type of weapons are being delivered to Israel we only have limited information I would I would Echo some of the concerns that you some of the notes that you highlighted earlier that you know there's a wide range of weapon systems that have been sold to Israel or been sent to Israel in in years past air defense Precision guided uh munition small diameter bombs we know that those have been sent those have been highlighted by the Pentagon I think the open question is what other things are being uh sent one area of particular concern that's been highlighted by members of Congress and by the administration itself is Small Arms uh there were some reports that the US might constrain or limit shipments of small arms that were being uh sent out to Israeli Security Forces unless there was additional oversight or Clarity offered in exactly who was ending up with those weapons so there's a wide range of things being sent but we don't have any specifics on what exactly that consists well Israel Remains the largest recipient of US military aid the Biden Administration recently requested that certain congressional oversight rules regarding weapon cells to Israel that those rules be waved do we know why it's really a matter of expedience that's the White House's argument here Congressional notification and review requirements add some amount of time it might be weeks it could in some cases be months and in certain instances has been years of review and potential delay in weapons being sent the Biden Administration included a request to wave those Provisions for Israel specifically I think to avoid the risk that any future Aid package you know once you've approved an overall amount of Aid funding you break it up into packages later on to avoid the risk that any one of those future Aid packages might be delayed um that's the best argument that you know we can kind of come up with the best reasoning we can come up with for why that was included and there is some push back um coming from both Republicans and Democrats and Congress they want to pin Aid in both of these conflicts to funding in domestic issues I'm talking about border security the border between the US and Mexico could this trigger a policy shift in your opinion um for the Govern government it absolutely could uh the negotiations around trading or marrying border security provisions in Ukraine funding and that's really the trade-off that's being made here um they're ongoing they're they're kind of at a wall right now in the Senate there is every possibility uh though I don't think it's likely yet that you could see Ukraine Aid curtailed or potentially delayed forcing some lull and Aid deliveries to Ukraine again that's that's not my base case for what I think happens right now but certain that's on the table Israel is a different slightly different scenario Republicans in the house are looking to cut spending elsewhere in the government to offset the cost of additional Israel Aid I don't imagine that that's actually going to be something that enters into into US law I would imagine that Israel Aid has a slightly clearer path or or easier path to eventual approval in Congress Clayton Allen with the Eraser group in Washington Clayton has always we appreciate your time and your analysis thank you thank you well I'm joined Now by Bradley Bowman he's a military and defense analyst and senior director of the center on Military and political power at the foundation for defense of democracies he joins me from Washington Brad it's good to see you again arms to Ukraine are publicly declared military assistance to Israel is shrouded in secrecy is that a correct description and if it is why uh thanks for the opportunity to join you I you know I wouldn't say it that way honor ly I would say that there has been radical transparency in terms of US security assistance to Ukraine for example we know that the uh the B Administration has committed about 44 billion dollars in security assistance uh to Ukraine since the February 24th 2022 Invasion we know you know we had the long list of weapons in many cases we know how many weapons I would say that's not really the norm and there are lots of reasons for that one reason might be particularly over time we've seen a minority of the Republican caucus in the House of Representatives uh kind of dragging their feet and and beginning to oppose uh support for Ukraine and so the uh the bid Administration increasingly as time has gone on has wanted to to make the case uh on how this is helping us defense industrial base and so disclosing those statistics helps reinforce that effort to try to build support with Israel um you know when the Pentagon is asked about this and recently November 28th a pentagon reporter asked briger General Pat Ryder uh for essentially the version of the question you just asked General Ryder he cited that you know there are some complexities involved with Israel that are not with Ukraine he cited foreign military sales foreign military financing pre-existing sales the US weapon stockpile that's already in Israel and and the fact that some weapons are coming from us inventories your viewers who are paying attention will say well a lot of that's true of Ukraine as well and that's true true but some is not like for example the pre-existing stockpiles of Us weapons a skeptic would push back on what general Ryder and said well you know we're we're almost two months into this with Israel you know how hard is it how long do it take and and that pushes me back to maybe that there are some political considerations here yeah politics here because the White House has been asked about this and the White House has argued that transparency full transparency would imperil Israel's operational security and that same risk does not appear to apply to Ukraine I guess for a Layman watching this the question would be well why wouldn't transparency also be a bigger a big risk for Ukraine why is it a bigger risk for Israel yeah you know the the the battlefield situations or the Strategic situations of Ukraine and Israel are different obviously I mean Iran has undertaken a multi-year effort to establish a ring of fire around Israel one of the leading concerns right now is that while Israel is busy trying to decimate the designated terrorist organization Hamas and Gaza that committed the atrocities of October 7th at any moment you could have Iran's teror proxy in Lebanon Hezbollah launch a major front in the north so when you have a situation like that do you really want to be telling your adversaries in the world exactly how many small diameter bombs have been sent to Israel for example or joint direct attack munition so I think there is a legitimate operational argument for maybe a different level of disclosure when it comes to Israel than Ukraine now you know and someone who pushed back on what I just said well you know Ukraine's not exactly a walk in the park either there there's concerns there but given the geography uh of Ukraine the Geo the realities of the battlefield uh in the two places I think there is some argument for maybe a little less disclosure when it comes to security assistance for Israel let me ask you to since you're in Washington I wanted to just press a little bit more about the the the the political dimensions of this you know that there are louder calls than we've seen ever before in the United States and on Capitol Hill for there to be a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas there's also been accusations that um the mil the Israeli military has been doing things that people perhaps do not want to have committed in their name if that is the case do you think there's a risk in Washington with just an election just a year away that if you have been a supporter of sending weapons to Israel that could become political um baggage or weight against you on Election Day do you see that being disgust or do you see that Trend I would yeah I would you know I'd respectfully press back on the premise a little bit it's undoubtedly true that some on the farle have called for the White House to curtail or condition security assist Israel and apply pressure to permanently halt combat operations in Gaza thus far uh the administration has in my view admirably resisted doing so you know you see uh you see VI the vice president's speech a day or two ago you saw uh secretary Austin's speech at the at the Reagan Forum in California where they were a little bit more they applied a little bit more public pressure um but here's the thing that I think everyone needs to know in my opinion wherever they are in the political spectrum that you know if you're concerned about going after the terrorist who committed the worst Slaughter of Jews a single day Slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust then you want Israel to have the means to precisely kill those terrorists the people that did that so they can't do it again while minimizing silian casualties and if you cut off the US provision of precision guided Munitions you're going to do exactly the opposite you're going to make it harder for them to kill these terrorist and you're G to despite the ongoing best efforts of Israel to minimize civilian casualties you're going to have more civilian deaths and so and by the way you're probably going to extend the war and thereby increase civilian suffering so this really is someone who into these issues it really is an instance where I think people with a particular agenda are pushing for something that will directly undermine their primary goals Brad Bowman as always good to talk with you good to get your insights tonight as always thank you thank
