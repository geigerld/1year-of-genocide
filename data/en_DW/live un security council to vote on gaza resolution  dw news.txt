the 9, 442nd meeting of the Security Council is called to order the provisional agenda for this meeting is the situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian question the agenda is adopted the security Council will now begin its consideration of item two of the agenda members of the council have before them document s223 773 the text of a draft resolution sub admitted by Brazil the council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it the representative of the Russian Federation has submitted amendments to the text of the draft resolution I give the floor to the representative of the Russian Federation Mr President during consultations on the 17th of October many members of the council sought to dissuade us to vote on our humanitarian depoliticized draft resolution we were asked to wait 24 hours in order to reach a consensus draft resolution we did not agree with that and we were right because ultimately after almost two days the vote is on a resolution that is slightly changed but was not discussed by the members of the council we regret that the council wasted a very precious 366 hours during which time the number of casualties increase the strike on the hospital in Gaza yesterday killed hundreds of people given this the inaction from the security Council looks appalling yesterday we did warn colleagues that we just can't waste any time now distinguished colleagues I will speak frankly the time for diplomatic metaphors is long gone everybody who did not support our humanitarian resolution with a call for a swift ceasefire must understand that they bear uh some of the responsibility for what happened the Brazil draft resolution unfortunately will not help to avoid such tragedies from occurring there is no clear call in it for a ceasefire this is a very important thing to deescalate the situation on the ground it's very important wording H it that has been replaced with humanitarian pauses and giving unhindered access to un workers but that's not the same same thing humanitarian pauses will not help to stop the Bloodshed it is only a ceasefire that will help to do this furthermore the draft sh still has a number of political elements in it that push us to one side and do not talk about the absolute unacceptability of the attacks on civilians in the Gaza Strip and also as on civilian objects the importance of this is absolutely crystal clear for everyone right now and so we have proposed two amendments to address these issues the first is a unambiguous call for a stop on uh the indiscriminate attacks against civilians in the Gaza Strip and on civilian objects including the uh attack on the Al Ali hospital that air strike and also the strong condemnation of the imposition of the blockade the second adds to the op a new point on the call for an immediate durable and fully respected humanitarian ceasefire if these are not included in the text of the document it will not help to address the tragic devastating humanitarian situation rather it will just worsen The Divide in between members of the committee and will polarize the positions of members of the International Community we would urge members of the council to vote in support of the Amendments proposed by Russia thank you I thank the representative of the Russian Federation for their statement would any other member wish to take the floor I see none members of the council have before them proposed amendment submitted by the Russian Federation to the text of the draft resolution contained in document s223 773 submitted by

immediate ceasefire and on an unequivocal condemnation of the indiscriminate attack did not get past those delegations who either abstained or voted against essentially were against the cessation of a Bloodshed in the Middle East that could be no other explanations of it of course the colleagues here saying well their justification was it was not balanced but all of these complaints are just going to be empty you've made your choice however and you are going to have to bear responsibility for it to the country's people of your countries and to the people in the region and the people who are living under this terrible deadly threat thank statement it is my understanding that the council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution contained s223 773 submitted by Brazil I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now will those in favor of the draft resolution contained in document 773 please raise their as follows 12 12 votes in favor one vote against two extensions the draft resolution has not been adopted owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the council the draft resolution no I now give the floor to those members of the council who wish to make statements after the vote I shall now uh I shall now made a statement in my capacity as the representative of dear colleagues at last Friday's closed consultations council members asked for Brazil's leadership in our capacity as presiden in October to facilitate a council response to the the escalating crisis in Israel and Palestine in particular its humanitarian aspects we heeded the call with a sense of urgency and responsibility in our view the council had to take action and to do so very quickly Council paralysis in the face of a humanitarian catastrophe is not in the interest of the International Community therefore throughout last weekend and the following days we worked very hard through extensive and collaborative engagement with council members to help build a unified position while while making a good faith effort to accommodate different sometimes opposing positions our Focus was and remains on the critical humanitarian situation on the ground political realism guided us but our sight was always set on the imperative exactly as in other very sensitive files on the council's agenda in which Brazil had a special role to play international humanitarian law and human rights law provided a clear framework for Action our proposed text unequivocally condemned all forms of violence against civilians including the henus acts of terrorism by Hamas and The Taking of hostages it called for their immediate and unconditional release it also called on all parties to strictly abide by their International legal obligations in particular those relating to the protection of civilians civilian infrastructure and humanitarian Personnel the draft resolution also stressed the urgent need for humanitarian access to civilians the text Incorporated urgent and multiple calls by the UN and many other actors for humanitarian pauses to allow for the delivery of Aid and the voluntary safe passage of civilians it encouraged the establishment of humanitarian corridors and other mechanisms to facilitate the smooth delivery of Aid the draft further reflected the ethical necessity to provide civilians in Gaza with electricity water fuel food and medical supplies the necessity to be protected from Forced relocation when the prevailing conditions on the ground do not ensure a safe and secure displacement thus faced with heinous terrorist acts against Israeli civilians with the forceful reaction to such acts and an never growing humanitarian disaster imposed on Gaza the council response we proposed was robust and balanced we are grateful to all council members who engaged with us since last Friday and demonstrated a sincere and practical commitment to multilateralism sadly very sadly the council was yet again unable to adopt a resolution on the Israeli Palestinian conflict again silence and inaction prevailed to no one's true long-term interest while we deeply regret that Collective action is made impossible in the security Council we do hope that efforts by other actors will yield positive results they must be prompt effective and substantial hundreds of thousands of civilians in Gaza cannot wait any longer actually they have waited for far too long to no avail I thank you I resume my function as president of council and I'll give the floor to the Russian Federation Mr President dear colleagues we have just been Witnesses once again of hypocrisy and the double standards of our American colleagues not standing in principle in the security Council they really did not want to have um any solution made found here so so because of this they had to just uh be very obvious as to what their intentions were before us here all today now I'm not going to waste your time on going on about this I think it's Crystal Clear what's happened but I would just like to talk about what the head of Lockheed Martin James head said yesterday talking to the American Media he said there's no point in in uh restraining Israel from any military actions what is the point in the future the future development of our military-industrial complex um which will increase by at least 2% of GDP there are conflicts which need to be resolved with arms and we are prepared to provide These Arms these weapons end of quote as we say no comment really that is the very essence of the US's policy in the region and the Pacific region we do hope that thanks to that our International Partners after today's votes will have no Illusions about that and what they're intending whatsoever thank Russian Federation and I give the floor to the representative of the United States thank you Mr President colleagues as we meet President Biden is in the region his trip is a clear demonstration of the fact that the United States is actively engaging at the highest levels to secure the release of hostages to prevent the conflict from spreading to stress the need to protect civilian lives to address the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians in Gaza and to demonstrate to the Israeli people that the United States stands with them in their time of sorrow and need we are on the ground doing the hard work of diplomacy and while we recognize Brazil's desire to move this text forward we believe we need to let that diplomacy play out especially when Secretary General guaras President Biden secretary blinkin and Regional actors are engaged in intensive Dialogue on the very issues we are deliberating on today yes resolutions are important and yes this Council must speak out but the actions we take must be informed by the facts on the ground and support direct diplomacy efforts that can save lives the council needs to get this right colleagues the United States is disappointed this resolution made no mention of Israel's rights of self-defense like every nation in the world Israel has the inherent right of self-defense as reflected in article 51 of the UN Charter following previous terrorist attacks by groups such as Al-Qaeda and Isis this Council reaffirmed that right this text should have done the same though we could not support this resolution going forward we will continue to work closely with all council members on this pressing issue just as we will continue to reiterate the need to protect civilians including members of the media humanitarian workers and un officials and when I talk about the protection of CI civilians I mean all civilians the United States is horrified and saddened by yesterday's explosion at the Ali Arab Hospital in Gaza we mourn this tragic tragic loss of life on the humanitarian front we are working with Israel its neighbors the United Nations and other partners to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza it is critical that food medicine water and fuel begin flowing into Gaza as soon as possible families the elderly and children are in our need let's be clear hamas's own actions have brought this on this severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza and Hamas has caused so much needless suffering death and destruction every member State Should condemn hamas's terrorism and cruelty and every member State should call on Hamas to cease its endless barrage of rockets against Israel this is not complicated it's not controversial this is the bare minimum colleagues at this difficult moment let us all call for the protection of civilians and unequivocally condemn Hamas let us all affirm Israel's right of self-defense and support the Urgent diplomatic efforts underway let us stand with the UN and other partners as they work to alleviate the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians in Gaza and let us all support equal measures of justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike thank you Mr President I thank the representative of the United States and I give the floor to the representative of Malta thank you president Malta voted in favor of the draft resolution tabled by Brazil Malta has also abstained on the two amendments proposed by the Russian Federation although we have no issue with the substance we saw no reason to alter a well-crafted resolution that rests on a delicate balance and that sought Council Unity on this critical matter we deeply regret that the I'm sorry I am yes I'm sorry we deeply regret that the draft resolution was not adopted and remain Gravely concerned at the highly volatile situation in Israel and Gaza excuse me not withstanding this decision the council must critically remain seized with the matter and strive to work towards constructive steps which prioritize the protection of civilians and prevent any potential Regional configur conflagration within this context Malta unequivocally condemns in the strongest possible terms the barbaric terrorist acts perpetrated by Hamas on Israeli soil and gains the people of Israel Malta emphasizes that Israel has the right to save the fence in the face of such violent and indiscriminate attacks it has the right and obligation to protect its territory and its people in line with humanitarian and international law and the principles of Distinction and proportionality we also reiterate our call on Hamas to unconditionally and safely release the hostages immediately President we deeply regret that casualties of this war have already included numerous medical humanitarian and un staff hundreds were killed in yesterday's horrific strike on the alahi Baptist Hospital in Gaza that was shelter ing thousands of this place such actions are deplorable they are a blunt breach of international law which categorically prohibits endangering civilians medical staff and humanitarian establishments this is the inevitable result of the military operations that are being conducted in Gaza one of the most densely populated places on Earth decisions to cut off electricity water supply and refuse supplies of Aid and fuel are also deeply concerning and are leading to catastrophic results the evacuation order which displaced over a million people to South Gaza has had serious humanitarian consequences such decisions are in consistent with International humanitarian law and must be rescinded Malta also stresses The crucial importance that there be a rapid unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza and urge is the immediate establishment of humanitarian corridors in this regard at this juncture the importance of preventing a regional spillover is critical it is therefore imperative for all parties to exercise maximum restraint and fully comply with the Norms of international law our efforts moving forward must be steadfast in aligning with a just and comprehensive resolution of the Middle East conflict you I thank the representative of Malta for their state statement and I now give the floor to the representative of China thank you Mr President Mr President the night before last I already gave a comprehensive account of China's views on the current situation in Palestine and Israel in the next emergency meeting I shall elaborate on China's position I shall focus on China's position on today's vote and the fact that the draft resolution failed to be adopted and our reaction is that of shock and disent the night before last the Russian resolution focused on the situation in pistan and Israel focusing on the protection of civilians and that resolution adopted received a lot support from countries however some countries have chosen to cast NE vote the reason given at the point was that they were actually uh more intended to base their positions on the resolution table by Brazil so to get more time to deliberate the colleagues from the Brazil and the colle other colleagues have agreed to that request by postponing the meeting for another to 24 hours and now it's been proposed proposed again to this point over the past 40 hours they have neither comed on nor expressed opposition to the Brazilian draft and which led us to expect that today hopefully they will vote in favor of this resolution and Council will be able to adopt the resolution favorably however the final result of the vote is nothing short of unbelievable it is also the belief of China that the Brazilian resolution still has rooms for improvement it should send a strong message asking for ceasefire and protection of civilians so as to pre prevent humanitarian catastrophe therefore China has propos proposed amendments that intended to improve the trft while at the same time agreeing with the Russian amendments and the Russian Amendment the fact that it failed to be adopted we are simp very disappointed that been the case in view of the fact that the situation in Gaza is deteriorating rapidly what happened yesterday that is the air strike on the hospital hospital and things like that resulted in s and casualties in the hundreds therefore the council has to take rapid actions China condemns strongly the a strike against hospitals and we urge Israel to effectively abide by the obligations under the international humanitarian law we call for ceasefire and protection of Civilian civilian so as to prevent and further civilian casualties the draft resolution tabled by Brazil in general reflects the constant the general view of the International Community representing the original initial steps to be taken by Council to achieve a ceas fire and they could be possibly the only possible draft that Council can reach consensus on under the current circumstances some countries early saying that the council should take a care direct action however the way they voted on the tax in question make us doubt their willingness for the council to take real actions and their willingness to find a solution to the problem in the final analysis the council should not stand on its hands the current situation in Gaza is escalating more and more civilians are paying the prices with their lives and sparing the brown of the conflict and therefore on the question of ceasefire and C of two hostilities at protection of civilians the council has to effectively shower its responsibility and they play its due role thank you I thank the representative of China for their statement and I I'll give the floor to the representative of mosambik Mr President mosambik wishes to commend Brazil and your presidency for the excellent leadership in conducting this uh work which is th but important we also thank you for providing the security Council with a very valuable text we have voted in favor of the draft resolution we deeply regret that uh the draft could not be adopted due to a veto in voting in favor mosambik wishes to express our deep concern over the outbreak and escalation of violence and deterioration of the situation in Gaza and consequence L the unfolding humanitarian crisis moreover we are deeply concerned about the human lives that are being lost on a daily basis since the conflict erupted the civilian population mainly children women and the elderly are suffering the most from the atrocities and Grave effects of this war in supporting this Resolution mosambik Associates ourself with the collective efforts of this Council aimed at ensuring the protection civilians and the respect for international human rights law inter National humanitarian law the Geneva Convention has applied to this conflict both in Gaza and in Israel it our it is our strong call that humanitarian Aid must reach the needy populations in Gaza that includes the provision of essential goods and services as well as medical supplies Mr President we are conscious of the fact that ultimately humanitarian problems need political Solutions this belief reflects our own experience originated from our protracted struggle against against colonialism racism and apartheid in the southern African region in this context we urge all the parties to immediately stop attacks refrain from further violence and engage in constructive dialogue mosambik firmly believes that Israel and Palestine can only resolve their differences through dialogue we hold the view that peace is always possible if the conflicting parties are genuinely willing to follow the path of justice tolerance we therefore wish to reiterate our appeal to the members of this Council to redouble our efforts toward a sustainable solution to Israeli Palestine conflict we believe the Palestinian people and the Israeli people have their inable right to statehood they can live together side by side in peace and security as good neighbors as a a matter of fact the charter compels the parties and indeed the entire International Community to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors I thank you Mr mosambik for their statement and I now give the floor to the represent resentative of Ghana I thank you Mr President and let me Begin by thanking your presidency and all delegations for the efforts made to have a consensual resolution that could have helped support the efforts of this Council to deescalate the rising tensions and respond to the tragic situation that we are all witnessing in the Gaza Strip and in southern Israel we deeply regret that the resolution could not pass for we have always held that the council should as far as possible speak in one voice on this important dispute whose for lines reached many distant parts of the world we have therefore from the very beginning given priority to the efforts entrusted to the presidency to lead all of us in that direction it was in this regard also that we voted in favor of the Brazilian draft resolution but deemed it important to abstain from the draft resolution proposed on Monday night and the amendments to today's resolution to preserve the broadest possible agreement that was found to guide us in a common Direction despite the high sensitivities of the Decades old Israeli Palestinian conflict and the differences and approaches we may have in resolving it what should be Paramount is our historic responsibility as a council to deliver the two-state solution and preserve the lives of the two Nations whose Destinies are bound by history and a common and shared area the council's inability to act on its responsibility today however should not break our resolve we believe that the United Council voice and action on the matter is still required and critical in stabilizing the situation and assisting the parties to enter into dialogue which is the only viable path to durable peace we should therefore continue to ask the parties to deescalate seek consensus to support mediation efforts and knock on the doors of all those that can have a moderating influence on the parties to open up the space for dialogue I thank you I thank the representative of Ghana for their statement and I now give the Japan thank you Mr President Japan voted in favor of the resolution because it can support its main ideas bearing in mind various perspectives including the humanitarian situation in Gaza Japan has unequivocally condemn the terror attacks by hammer and others and called for the immediate release of those who were kidnapped we feel strong indignation at the tremendous damage and harm to innocent civilians brought by the attack on a hospital in Gaza Gaza City on the 17th at the same time he would like to point out that Japan had asked to delay the vote on this resolution proposed by Brazil understanding that various countries including the United States have been continuing to make diplomatic efforts on the ground to improve the situation as soon as possible Japan expresses its great regret at the fact that the resolution was voted to a vote today nevertheless Japan has consistently and strongly supported and put the face in diplomatic efforts by US President Biden and other relevant countries all of us including those who refer to hypocrisy in particular should think twice if we are really faithful to Human Rights principles and if we are doing sufficient efforts to make difference on the ground in improving humanitarian situation actions are needed Japan will continue to work together with other other countries to ensure the safety of civilians and realize an early deescalation of the situation I thank you Mr President I thank the representative of Japan and I now give the floor to the representative of Switzerland mer thank you president on the 7th of October already Switzerland firmly condemned the terrorist acts the indiscriminate attacks and hostage taking perpetrated by Hamas against the Israeli people we de the deaths of thousands of civilians including hundreds of children in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory particularly Gaza Switzerland Echoes the Secretary General in condemning unequivocally the strikes particularly those who which according to United Nations figures have led to hundreds of deaths and dozens of injured yesterday in the alaki hospital Anglican Episcopal church and we express our sincere condolences to the injured and the victim victims we are concerned regarding the large scale humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the dramatic situation F by civilians almost a million people have been displaced and it is urgent for humanitarian Aid to be able to enter water electricity and medical supplies are being uh are dwindling we have all spoken around this table yesterday about the situation in the Middle East which requires United urgent action by the council deescalation protection of civilians Humane treatment for all hostages and Switzerland calls for an immediate release as well as Rapid Safe unhindered humanitarian access are all priorities the draft resolution tabled by Brazil met these priorities with a aiming for a common understanding by this Council which is why we invite voted in favor for it of it and very much regret the failure to adopt the resolution put to the vote today I wish to thank your delegation once again president for your sustained commitment it is regrettable that we have not yet been able to reach consensus on a product showing our unity in the face of this situation independently of the adoption of a resolution all the parties must uphold International humanitarian law particularly the principles of Distinction proportionality and precaution as well as human rights International humanitarian law takes account of the of legitimate secur security and Military needs all of these rules must therefore be respected with no exception president Switzerland has deployed every effort to contribute to reaching consensus on a council product in this urgent situation along these same lines we remain at the dispo your disposal to support any new initiatives which could result in action by this Council thank you I thank the representative of Switzerland for their statement and I president this morning this council is seeing its credibility put to the test given the scope of the deadly violence in Israel and Gaza and the extreme gravity of the crisis in the Middle East whose shock wave is threatening peace and Security in the whole of the region Beyond as Security Council our mandate is to Halt Wars or failing that to prevent them and to alleviate the human suffering born of Crisis this morning the security Council was not equal to this mandate the rhetoric around this table provided no sucker no help to civilians in Gaza who are falling in the face of indiscriminate strikes by missiles and Rockets and who are deprived of all means of survival once again politics and geopolitics have paralyzed this council's capacity for Action this council is not reacting in the face of horror and the screams of distress of civilians in the face of one of the most serious crisis in the Middle East and we are counting the deaths and the destruction whilst remaining powerless this Council has not provided any coherent response to provide a glimmer of hope to the children the women the hostages and the peoples of the world who were watching our deliberations for their survival and for saving them my country voted in favor of the draft resolution tabled by the Brazilian presidency and the two amendments proposed because it is crucial and Urgent to act having issued foot strong condemnations of the barbaric attacks against Israel on the 7th of October last and recognized Israel's right to legitimate defense whilst upholding the principles of proportionality and distinction against with regard to combatants and civilians we firmly believe that given the magnitude of the deadly violence which over a few days has caused thousands of death and immeasurable humanitarian distress we must call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the opening of humanitarian corridors was to alleviate the suffering of civilians our position has been clear since the first council meeting hostage taking is unacceptable and unjustifiable and indefensible and we reiterate the hostages must be released with no conditions and no blackmail we regret the fact that the council was unable to O to overcome its divisions we must certainly show greater responsibility so as to find a solution to the crisis in the Middle East who whose chronis chronic nature questions our credibility and tarnishes our reputation for gabar the two-state solution is the only credible alternative we can and must achieve this through diplomacy good faith negotiation and overcoming fears and self-interest which are distancing us from our Collective responsibility of maintaining peace and Security in the region and Beyond thank you I thank the representative of Gabon for their statement and I now give the floor to the representative of the United Kingdom thank you president and let me start by thanking you for your good faith efforts to negotiate this resolution the draft resolution on which we have just voted rightly condemns the appalling Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel on the 7th of October it ALS also makes clear that all actions need to be taken in line with International humanitarian law it stresses the importance of ensuring humanitarian access and protecting civilians and emphasizes this council's shared priority of preventing Regional escalation of the conflict we welcome and support the draft resolution's attempts to set out the council's view on these critical points but the draft resolution needed to be clearer on Israel's inherent right to self-defense in line with the UN Charter after Hamas attacks killed over 1400 people and took almost 200 people hostage the draft resolution also ignored the fact that Hamas are using innocent Palestinian civilians as human Shields they have embedded themselves in civilian communities and made the Palestinian people their victims too for these reasons the United Kingdom abstained on this resolution my prime minister has been clear that the UK stands with Israel in the face of these atrocities we support Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas take back the hostages deter further incursions and strengthen its security for the long term in so doing we will continue to call on Israel to take all feasible precautions to avoid harming Palestinian civilians and to act in line with law we will continue to work closely with Israel and our partners in the region to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza to ensure that civilians are protected and have access access to Food Water medicine and shelter and to work towards the peace and stability promised by the two-state solution I thank you president I thank the representative of the United Kingdom for their statement and I now give the floor to the Ecuador presid president we voted in favor of the draft taed by the Brazilian presidency as did many other members of Council it was the result of a constructive Collective negotiating process by all members of the council and we are convinced that the collective work and negotiation in good faith are indispensable for Effective multilateralism and these are the best way to fulfill the responsibilities placed upon us we fully believe president that the council cannot continue in silence in the face of events which are clearly a threat to International Peace security and which are already having serious humanitarian consequences the Brazilian presidency's draft includes Elements which are necessary in the face of a situation which is worsening by the minute The credibility of the council depends upon our decisions at times like this in this regard Ecuador vote abstained with regard to the Amendments since these are elements which are covered in the resolution we Reg reget the fact that again the council was unable to adopt a resolution through the use of the veto but this is not the end of our efforts we will do everything within our reach to ensure that the council can very soon pronounce itself and act with regard to this conflict president on the 24th of September 1973 the Ecuadorian councelor Antonio Lucio Paredes spoke before the general assembly and said and I quote that it is necessary for the activities the actions of the great Powers which in one way or another support the parties to the conflict in the Middle East be guided toward seeking solutions to establish constructive peace and not do not hamper possible agreement and understandings the Middle East conflict because of its explosive nature compels the United Nations to tirelessly attempt to bring an end to it close quote these words remain valid even though they were said over 50 years ago thank you very much I thank the representative of Ecuador for their the representative of of Albania thank you Mr President um we thank Brazil for their efforts the diligence in providing time and the continued engagement with all the security Council Members the text came at a very critical moment not only for the conflict between Israel and Hamas and the huge impact it having it's having on civilians but also for the reviv dangers for the region and Beyond Albania voted in favor because the text responded to core objectives on the issue and to our coherent and principled position it strongly and unequivocally condemned Hamas and its indefensible terrorist attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 it called for the immediate release of the hostages which should remain a humanitarian priority as the Secretary General called upon Hamas last Sunday they should be released immediately and unconditionally it provided for the protection of civilians in accordance with International humanitarian law and the floww of the humanitarian Aid to all those in need it also supports the regional and international efforts for a solution on the ground and Embraces a diplomatic solution to the crisis in this respect we commend the very active engagement at every level by the United States and others to finding the best Solutions on the ground while we supported the draft Albania reaffirms its position in full support of Israel and its right to self-defense like every other nation under attack which the resolution falls short to mention I Albania for their statement and I now give the floor to the representative of the United Arab Emirates Mr President it is perhaps Beyond me to put into words the abject Horrors we are witnessing in Gaza that is why the United Arab Emirates fully supported the council to take action today and we still support that the council does does take action on this situation for more than 140 years the alah Baptist Hospital has provided Medical Care and shelter for generations of gazin yesterday more than 500 Palestinians were killed in a strike that hit the hospital each passing hour of this ruinous War makes a mockery of these principles of international humanitarian law Gaza is laid to waste and nobody feels safe we call for a full independent investigation into this incident and for those who are responsible to be held accountable as we verify information about the stripe one fact Still Remains indisputable more Palestinians have died in this outbreak of violence than in any other in the history of the conflict in less than two weeks of bombardment more than 3,500 Palestinians have been killed and more than 14,000 injured will we continue to sit here and compare the casualties on both sides we support no less than a full humanitarian ceasefire we don't ask for this to be done at the expense of Israel's security but so that people may tend to their wounded bury their dead in dignity and begin putting their lives back together this ceasefire is also crucial so that vital humanitarian Aid may enter and Aid workers do their work safely Mr President Hamas is indeed responsible for sparking this latest fire that is now engulfing the streets of Arab capitals around the region we have called them out on this openly for the heus attacks on the 7th of October but make no mistake the kindling was already there fueled by Decades of violent dehumanization dispossession and dispair that is why we cannot however convenient lose sight of the context of this crisis the longest goinging occupation in the world today of a people that do not wish to be ruled and have been let down again and again and again by all of us Mr President the UAE voted for this resolution not because it is a perfect text but because it clearly states basic principles which must be upheld and which this Council is obliged to reinforce and uphold we really thank Brazil and its delegation for their efforts and we remain hopeful that in the coming days we can unite behind a resolution and that also in parallel diplomatic efforts led by the United States help lead us all off this Brink that we are edging towards as I and others said yesterday the current escalation must drive all of us but most most importantly Israelis and Palestinians to the Urgent work of achieving the two-state solution let me be clear the only alternative to that is the violence we see right now three years ago my country established diplomatic relations with Israel the Abraham Accords are grounded in a simple but enduring truth that peace and dialogue are better than violence and enmity along with our Israeli and American Partners we sought a new Middle East where coexist and cooperation deliver Prosperity security and peace for all the indiscriminate damage visited upon the people of Gaza in pursuit of Israel's security risks extinguishing that hope the region is already contending with the spillover of this crisis and the enemies of Peace are Unapologetic about their aims let us not play into their hands Mr President it has been said over the past few days that this crisis is a test for the International Community and for the UN Security Council that is true Noah aramani a young Jewish woman abducted by Hamas is in her second year of computer studies at benan University her mother is undergoing cancer treatment and she is their only child in a conversation with a journalist about the horror inflicted on this family Yakov recalled that in Gaza to families are mourning their children he described Israelis and Palestinians as two na with one father and added that we can reach true peace and I'm praying for this to happen Amen to the hostages return 22-year-old dun aburahma an architectural student in Gaza is one of the thousands of civilians today fleeing South last night she told CNN that up until recently all she had been thinking about was her graduation project now all she thinks about is how to be safe the test colleagues is whether or not we sustain that hope for peace that shines even through a parent's unspeakable anguish and a child's aspiration to just be normal like the rest of us we cannot do millions of people to misery because diplomacy is hard we must keep trying again and again and again we must recognize that by continuing to fail to respond to the Palestinians people's legitimate aspirations for a country in their Homeland we fuel this unrelenting cycle of violence and hatred let us not fail this test for the sake of Israelis for the sake of Palestinians and for the sake of All Peoples of the Middle East United Arab Emirates for their statement there are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers the meeting is I know and I was like I was thinking about something 9,443 meeting of the Security Council is called to order the provisional agenda for this meeting is the situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian adopted in accordance with rule 37 of the council's

Tor wesland Mr President members of the council the Secretary General and I have briefed this Council extensively in private over the last days on details of the horrific and unprecedented events that have been unfolding relaying our utter condemnation Shock And Regret I will not repeat my briefings here today noting that I will report on the situation next week during my regular monthly briefing my colleague Martin will brief you on the situation today I want to update you on where we are on my efforts over the last days to find a way to bring the end hostilities and spare lives of civilians I have to be very honest here and now and say that this is one of the most difficult moments facing the Israeli and Palestinian people in the last 75 days 75 years the massacre and Despicable acts of violence and Terror perpetrated by Hamas against Israel on 7 October are seed into our Collective memories whole families killed women and children abducted uh to the strip and held up until this day there is no justification or excuse of such Act of Terror and I condemn them unequivocally we are facing a devastating and clearly difficult challenge for the region and for the International Community it comes at a moment when the global institutions will need to respond to such in such act and crisis they are already overstretched we are in a war and Wars are filled with horrific scenes of violence and tragedy last night I watch in horror and in real time as I was you all did as reports of mass casualties emerged from what should be a protected site shielded from danger a place of healing hundreds of Palestinians who killed paans and those seeking shelter when alak Hospital in gasa city was struck by lethal fire the circumstances of this catastrophe and responsibility remains still needs to be clarified and we will need to be uh we will and we will need a fact based fully investigation and Broad investigation but the result of all this is very clear Mr President it is a terrible tragedy for involved I fear that we are at the brink of a deep and dangerous abys that could change the trajectory of the Israeli Palestinian conflict if not of the Middle East as a whole after More Than A Century of conflict and over half a century of occupation we the International Community have failed collectively to bring the parties to a just sustained political resolution the longstanding isues Run Run Deep and extend well beyond the conines of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory the events of the past 11 days have served to reignite Grievances and reanimate alliances across the region based on my meetings and the uh Dynamics I observe on the ground I would say the following the risk of an expansion of this conflict is real very very real and extremely dangerous Mr President since the outbreak of the current hostilities it has been my absolute priority to work to diminish the uh these existential threats with the Secretary General I have been in constant communication with a broader range of interlocutors with the parties with regional and international actors who have agencies and influence I will continue to do so today I speak to you from DOA where the authorities have assured me of their continued commitment to the Palestinian people and their humanitarian needs and the urgency to prevent any further loss of Civilian lives meetings and ongoing discussions with leaders in Egypt have focused not only on the critical uh on the question of facilitating access through rougher Crossing on humanitarian assistance but also our seared concern and efforts to reign in further Regional hostilities I will return to Cairo tomorrow to join the Secretary General to continue these political discussions in this regard we welcome president alissi Swift call for a summit of world leaders to continue these discussions I also had similar discussions with leaders in Lebanon and Jordan as well as on repeated phone calls with the P5 and other key Regional and international Partners who are ceased of an activity engaged and addressing this conflict we are all seeking a common understanding and Approach at this critical time I welcome the visits of world leaders such as German Chancellor Schulz the UK foreign minister cleverly and today uh the visit by President Biden with the parties on the ground in Jerusalem Tel Aviv and ramalan my message have remained steadfast that we must not let the dynamic of the current conflict take our eyes off what I will call the day after the day after we need to start working on now immediately we we know the way forward these days I can tell you diplomacy is very hard but here is what we need to do we need the time and space to achieve two urgent objectives Hamas immediate unconditional release of all hostages secondly and fast unrestricted access of humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza the 1 must be a collective efforts to end the hostilities and prevent any further expansion of the conflict to the region regarding West Bank and Lebanon there should be no miscalculation no provocation and no step that closes the door for our current efforts the Step Beyond must beone the path towards the political solution ultimately the only way to bring the end to the blood leting and prevent any recurrence of the pave and to PVE a way forward a long-term political solution in is needed in line with un resolutions international law and previous agreements as I've stated many times to this Council a patch work of ad hoc and temporary fixes and Perpetual management of conflict without addressing underlying issues is not sustainable that has been proven over the last 11 days what we are seeing on the ground now all too tragically proves that this is true what we must do now is to work together as one to achieve these objectives thank you I thank Mr wesland for his briefing I now give the floor to Mr Martin Griffith Martin you have the floor we can't hear can you hear me now yes yes okay sorry sorry my technical knowledge Sergio is not brilliant um thank you very much for for inviting me and I what I was saying was what an honor it is for me to be on the same Podium as t uh and I associate myself profoundly with every single word that he said which is born out of years of relevant experience including not just looking at the horrors of the last 11 days but anxiously looking ahead at the horrors to come so all credit to special coordinator T venan but I also of course join him and all members of the council in expressing my horror and despair the explosion that he described watching as so many of us did at the alaki Anglican Episcopal hospital in the northern Gaza Strip yesterday evening my heartfelt condolences of course go out to the grouping The Grieving families affected by this heart-wrenching tragedy and I also extend my sincerest wishes for a Swift and complete recovery to all those who've been injured according to the World Health Organization hospital in question was one of 20 in Northern Gaza subject to the announcement by the Israeli authorities that civilians should leave for their safety it's a terrible thought to think of that the morning after however evacuation for many had simply not been possible due to insecurity as we have been discussing in this chamber this afternoon the critical condition of many of the patients um and and indeed the lack of ambulances staff and capacity in the rest of the health system which as you know Mr President is on its knees in Gaza when that hospital was hit it was fully operational and indeed it had breached its maximum imum capacity it was therefore overflowing with patients including women and children dozens of Health Care Providers caregivers demonstrating their extraordinary frankly extraordinary courage and commitment to remain silk plus remain there to do their duties and to remain steadfast by their patient sides and they were also in the building and the hospital was also hosting numerous internally displaced people who either had nowhere else to go or Sheltering there in the expectation or at least perhaps the hope that it would provide safety and they were wrong so far reports indicate hundreds of fatalities hundreds of civilians and healthcare workers and I associate myself with tor's call for a fact-based inquiry to find out how this happened here I want to say one thing of the highest importance to all of us in the humanitarian community and those of us all of us indeed who are governed by the rules of war and international humanitarian law what happened on the 7th of October in The Invasion into Israel and The Taking of those hostages still taken and hidden away in Gaza was simply wrong against the law unconscionable unacceptable their unconditional release is an essential component of any return to the kind of normaly that Manana was describing to us uh earlier before this session started since the 7th of October 28 health workers in Gaza have reportedly been killed 23 have been injured there's no lack of Courage there's no lack of commitment in that population there have been many reports of Health Facilities sustaining extensive damage indeed the hospital itself had already been struck as you know on the 14th of October gaza's Health Services as I've been hearing here in Cairo these last day or two are being overwhelmed by the extreme Challenge of meeting the health care needs of the rising number of wounded patients all the while facing significant shortages of medical supplies water and fuel and the destruction of that hospital yesterday heaped further pressure on crumbling this failing this sad Health Care System Not only would the victims rush to shifa hospital one of the many other hospitals in Gaza on the verge of collapse but it also now deprives Gaza of a facility that cared for more than 45,000 patients a year before the hostilities so I am compelled to reiterate and this will not surprise anybody as everyone else has done on many occasions in this Council that under International law there are simple requirements there are simple rules of War which are applied to all of us whatever the provocation and God knows there has been provocation parties to arm conflict must protect civilians and civilian objects take constant care to spare them from any attack we have discussed this in almost every other conflict in this chamber around the world this one is no different international law affords specific protection to medical personnel and Facilities to ensure the wounded and sick receive the medical care they need it was no coincidence that one of the first humanitarian leaders on the scene after those events of the 7th of October was our dear friend and leader Dr Tedros of who it's imperative that the wounded and sick receive the medical care they need it is imperative that the parties respect their obligations under the inter under International humanitarian law and it is our Collective responsibility we are all involved in this we are not observers we are all involved in using all our influence to ensure that this is the case this tragedy is characteristic of the crushing impact this conflict has had on civilians and as Tor has been pointing out and Lana earlier the catastrophic consequences it will have if it continues to escalate as we fear in just 11 days since that storming of Israel by Palestinian armed groups on 7th of O October the death toll as has been mentioned has already exceeded that of the 2014 hostilities which lasted more than seven weeks the pace of death of suffering of destruction of breaches of international law cannot be exaggerated in Gaza more than 3,000 people have been killed more than 12 12 and a half thousand injured hundreds are unaccounted for under the rubble and quite frankly we do not know how many have moved from the north to the South to get out of Harm's Way the death toall also we all know this well includes humanitarians I want to pay tribute to the 15 UNR staff and ready Red Cross and red cresant Personnel that I've been meeting days families of those who have fallen we estimate that maybe up to a million people have fled their homes to other parts of Gaza but we don't really know uh many have done so in response indeed to Israel's announcement that civilians should leave Northern Gaza for safety but there is simply nowhere to go for civilians to escape the destruction and privation both of which grow by the hour as missiles continue to fly and essential supplies including F fuel food medical items water run low due to the scarcity of water anra in some locations and I want to pay a special tribute to anra but the way in which has provided a buffer against suffering in these terrible times and in unra in some locations is being forced to ration down to providing one liter of water per person per day bear in mind that the minimum by International standards should be 15 lers and they're getting one and they're the lucky ones people have been increasingly forced to consume from unsafe sources we're hearing many many more reports of that through anra and other agencies placing the population at risk of course of the outbreak of waterborne diseases and whether civilians move or stay and that must be their decision whether to move or stay whether to move again or stay where they have moved to whether they move or stay they must be protected they must not be attacked in places of Civilian infrastructures they must be protected in places of deconfliction and they must have access to the essentials of humanitarian assistance to survive which are available and in which we have all spent many many detailed hours in detailed negotiations with the parties and I'm grateful to them to all of them for the commitment that they have shown to these negotiations it means that the UN and the humanitarian partners and I specifically refer to the great leadership shown and I met their leaders today of the Egyptian red presentent and the Palestinian red Cresent must be able to relief deliver excuse me to deliver relief to civilians in need throughout Gaza without impediment in places of their choice in places where they consider safe themselves to be safe and where we can seek to ensure that safety we have humanitarian supplies we have medical teams anra has a staff of 14,000 in Gaza still bravely working under these conditions the other agencies do the red crants of course have many many many volunteers and they are all ready to assist the people most in need I'm very grateful to many member states for providing very quickly emergency funding for available for the immediate relief in Gaza including from the central emergency response fund that my office runs and the occupied territories humanitarian fund thank you thank you to all of you who stepped up so quickly what we don't have however we have a lot but what we don't have and it's the killer what we desperately need is immediate safe humanitarian access across all of Gaza and that is the burden of our discussions with key parties we urgently need a mechanism agreed by all relevant parties to allow for the regular provision of emergency needs throughout Gaza to get the level of distribution of assistance up to what it was before these terrible weeks of a 100 trucks a day providing assistance throughout Gaza to people in need we need to get back to that level of ambition for that we need additional funding agencies like onra world food program and of course for the red crants in their leadership role and without new funding unra already painfully woefully lacking in funds will not have the ability to continue to deliver Cross services but as Mr President has tour said and I'm glad he did and he made two I think very important points Gaza is not the only location of concern in this deeply troubling conflict since the start of the latest hostilities situation in the West Bank has also been deteriorating as Tor said and he should know last week was the deadliest week for Palestinians in the West Bank since the United Nations started recording fatalities in 2005 while settler violence incidents also have gone up from an average of three incidents a day to eight suffering knows no borders widespread closures throughout the West Bank are impacting the ability of communities to access essential services and there is a real risk of the situation expiring out of control but the people people of Israel Palestine the region need what we all need what this council's mandate is in existence to secure is the sanity and humanitarian to Prevail drawing on the provisions of international humanitarian law for Urgent efforts this was toward second point to arrest any further descent in this brutal calamity Lana said it very eloquently the worry that I suppose many of us have where will this lead us where will this lead us when the fighting has taken place of course we implore the parties to respect International humanitarian law and by the way I want to be very clear humanitarian ceasefire would go a long way to easing the Epic human suffering finally Mr President I know I've gone on too long I want to conclude by expressing my deepest admiration gratitude and comedy for the extraordinary people who are delivering life saving and humanitarian services in Gaza in the West Bank as they do in so many other parts of the world many of whom are displaced many have lost loved ones many of our staff in all our agencies have had that kind of suffering the dedication and bravery of ambulance Crews Health Care Professionals people working in hospitals and Clinics actually is a reminder of the fundamentals of humanity which Drive our efforts to resolve these differences to resolve them through diplomacy through dialogue through kindness through generosity and through accountability I also want to express my profound personal gratitude I have said it also already for tour but also to my colleague and his colleague our Deputy special coordinator resident and humanitarian coordinat somebody with the title as long as mine Lynn Hastings and the humanitarian Aran were demonstrating unwavering commitment to providing essential assistance and relief their Collective efforts their unstinting focus on key priorities which are based on operational needs exemplifies not just the United Nations enduring commitment to extending hope and support but exemplifies the commitment of the humanitarian community and its supporters all of whom are in this room to do the job that they have decided and resolved to choose for their lives soio Mr President thank you very much I thank Mr Griffith for his briefing I now give the floor to the members of the security Council I give the floor to the representative of the Russian Federation Mr President colleagues along with the delegations of the UAE in China we initiated today's emergency security council meeting given the tragic events in the Gaza Strip yesterday as a result of air strikes the Ali AKA hospital was destroyed in in the area of Gaza City we are deeply shocked by what occurred the angan church hospital was one of the 20 in Northern Gaza that received evacuation notices from the Israeli military however it was impossible to meet that requirement and Martin Griffith already said that given the prevailing unstable situation the critical condition of many patients and also the shortage of ambulances staff stretches and alternative accommodation for the displaced persons the air strike on the hospital according to latest reports caused over 800 deaths and injuries we are calling for an objective investigation to be carried out and for the perpetrators to be prosecuted Mr President colleagues this is the price of the inertia of members of the council many of whom have procrastinated over the past 11 days since the start of the escalation surrounding Gaza we warned you about this on Monday when a number of members of the council Guided by in inverted commers purely humanitarian considerations but actually by purely political considerations did not support the Russian draft on the ceasefire our document laid out a number of specific urgent measures designed to stop violence and civilian suffering designed to release the hostages and to prevent the impending humanitarian to prevent the impending humanitarian disaster in that part of Palestine and avoid the conflict spilling over into other countries of the region given the extremely tense situation action should have been taken very promptly this is precisely why our draft did not contain political elements or views or a mention of any party to the conflict that might have complicated reaching agreement on it despite this in full view of the International Community the UN Security Council the primary body for the maintenance of International Peace and security was not in a position to adopt a decision that could have prevented the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza the council did not send a clear robust Collective signal with a call for a swift lasting uh reasonable humanitarian ceasefire today we have seen the terrible fruit of this once again it's become clear that the position of Washington and some other Western capitals did not allow for a natural logical decision to be taken uh this given the current circumstances is an absolute Key Human itarian imperative and it is the moral duty of all responsible members of the International Community furthermore humanitarian considerations the Norms of international law and the root causes of why the Palestinian question has not been settled all things we've repeatedly and insistently stressed over recent years of course don't count for them Mr President the number of uh injured and dead in Israel was or dead and injured rather was 1,400 and 3,9 900 respectively the number of victims in Palestine was more than 2,800 and 10,800 respectively and today these figures are even higher as per un reports 450 children have died in Gaza and some 750 are still under the rubble the buildings destroyed during the air strikes more than 2 million inhabitants of Gaza still have no water food medical assistance fuel or electric electricity the only border crossing on the border with Egypt the Rafa Crossing once again is coming under missile fire and has not been opened up for civilian evacuations or the provision of humanitarian Goods de facto the military blockade of Gaza has held hostage 1,000 Russian citizens and members of their families given this very worrying situation the UN agencies The Who UNICEF the UN FBA with one voice condemned the strike on the AL Aki hospital and called for a prompt active protection of civilians and medical infrastructure yesterday at the briefing on the situation in Gaza the deputy head of Ocha Joyce misya noted that the number of victims of the current escalation in the Palestinian um Israeli conflict that has gone on for 11 days has already exceeded the number of victims uh that were killed during the hostilities in 2014 the path to that ceasefire took some s weeks this cannot fail to horrify us humanitarian workers are dying the number of people forced to leave their homes in Gaza is about 1 million people the humanitarian blockade of the Palestinian Enclave is pushing the entire population to the brink the population that de facto right before our eyes are being sacrificed Mr President we would urge the Israeli side to Prior PR itiz International humanitarian law at the center of which is the lives of Palestinian citizens and critical emergency care and medical facilities humanitarian access should be provided without delay we call for an immediate ceasefire and an opening of corridors to supply emergency humanitarian assistance to the effective areas of the Palestinian enclave and to evacuate civilians an immediate cessation of violence against civilians as well irrespective of where they live in a number of Arab and European countries there have been outbreaks of large scale unres given the ongoing Israeli missile Straits in this regard we condemn the attacks on diplomatic missions in foreign countries of foreign States Mr President all that we're talking about just now is happening with the inaction of the security C which is paralyzed by the self-serving interests of some countries and with unilateral actions which not only have ended in complete failure but also have led to a widespread escalation of violence in the Middle East region Mr President we are extremely concerned by the unprecedented scale of the humanitarian disaster in the Gaza Strip and the higher risk of the conflict spillover assuming the UN Security Council is not able to come up with an appropriate response to these challenges is we will initiate a resumed the resumed 10th emergency special session of the UN on the protection of civilians in Palestine in order to have a comprehensive discussion of the situation regarding the Palestinian Israeli conflict and ways to settle it a letter on this for the president of the ga has already been written and it will be dispatched forth with thank you I thank the representative of the Russian Federation for their statement Gabor I thank special coordinator to wesland and under Secretary General Martin Griffiths for their briefings president the air strikes which hit the Anglican Hospital in Gaza yesterday claiming hundreds of lives and numerous injured amongst amongst Palestinian civilians is the reflection of the extreme brutality and gravity of the war between Israel and Hamas Gabon firmly condemns these strikes and the responsibility for these must be established we recall also that Health units and and their personnel must be protected in all circumstances pursuant to International humanitarian law since the barbarous unjustifiable and unacceptable attacks of hamus upon Israel on the 7th of October the indiscriminate deadly violence against civilians has reached unsustainable levels my country recognizes Israel's right to legitimate defense which must be exercised whilst upholding the principles of proportionality and distinction between combatants and civilians 11 days since the outbreak outbreak of facilities War scenes of War marked by indiscriminate shelling are suffused with horror with dramatic consequences on civilians the dead and injured are now counted in the thousands atrocities against women and children and destruction are all immeasurable in addition to the cynicism of using human shields in addition to the rejection of Hostage taking of women and children we at the moment are seeing millions of people under siege in Gaza without water food gas or electricity with death as their only prospect it is time to bring an end to this deadly cycle of violence and this unbearable human distress we call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and for the opening of humanitarian corridors to assist civilian populations in need in Gaza all parties must abide by their obligations pursuant to International humanitarian law and allow for immediate unhindered humanitarian access to those in need I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the humanitarian Personnel who are carrying out their activities courageously in difficult hostile conditions at risk of their lives president the conflagration of violence between Israel and Hamas is jeopardizing peace security and stability in the region and Beyond the epicenter the International Community must exhibit greater commitment to prevent and avoid other fronts or poles of violence in the region which would make the situation still more intractable exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah in the south of Lebanon are in this regard extremely worrisome this Council must urgently act to prevent the situation from becoming bogged down above and beyond strategic interests for each member above and beyond the depth of emotions we must without delay achieve deescalation and halt the fighting we must silence the guns diplomacy dialogue and negotiation which are at the heart of the United Nations are the inescapable channels to achieve a solution which guarantees the rights and interests of the parties and for Gabon the two-state solution still has no credible alternative thank you of Gabon for their statement and I now give China [Music] thank you Mr President Mr President I wish to thank USG Griffith and special coordinator wiland for their briefings I wish to particularly commend special coordinator wesland for his tireless efforts in actively engaging with all parties for the dis deescalation of the conflict to prevent human Aran crisis together with UAE and the Russian Federation China also requested this emerging meeting the AL AK Hospital in Gaza was attacked which claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians China is shocked by this heinous act attack and strongly condemns it the protection of civilians in armed conflict is a red line under International humanitarian law civilians and civilian facilities such as hospitals and schools should not and must not be targeted in military operations the indiscriminate use of forces not acceptable and the safety of humanitarian medical workers must be guaranteed we urge Israel to effectively fulfill its International humanitarian law obligations look around in gasa right now tragedies like the one at Al Hospital are unfolding all the time as a result of the total blockade imposed by Israel the supply of water electricity and fuel in the Gaza Strip has been cut off the basic supplies such as food and Medicine a drink Ling and urgently needed tens of thousands of gazin have been forced to move South because of the emergency evacu evacuation order issued by Israel but have suffered from air strikes in the South as well from the north to the South Gaza is full of frightened children and desperate mothers under the current circumstances there's no time to lose in protecting the safety of civilians carrying out humanitarian relief and preventing a humanitarian crisis we call on Israel to lift the full blockade of Gaza resent the emergency uh evacuation order and stop the air strikes around the Rafa Crossing we welome come the international community's efforts to open humanitarian Corridor and look forward to substantive progress in the relevant Communications and arrangements as soon as possible we appreciate the important role played by Egypt and other Regional countries Mr President development over the past few days have amply demonstrated that an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire must be the overriding priority as long as the War continues more violations of international humanitarian law are inevitable without a comprehensive ceasefire any amount of humanitarian assistance will be a drop in the bucket if the current figh in Gaza is allowed to drag on the end result will not be a complete Victory military victory for any side but rather most likely will be a catastroph catastrophe that will engulf the entire region that will probably complete end the prospect for a two-side solution plunging the Palestinian and isra Israeli peoples into a vicious cycle of hatred and confrontation Arab countries have issued a strong call for an immediate and comprehensive cesy the International Community should heat this just call of Arab countries and the Palestinian people we should Unite all current Diplomat diplomatic efforts towards this goal China welcomes any initiative that is conducive to easing the humanitarian crisis and reducing the suffering of civilians and supports all efforts aimed at DIS escalating the conflict and restoring peace we hope that all parties concerned will maintain impartiality actively leveraging their influence on the parties concerned to promote common restraint and work for the session of hostilities as soon as possible under the current circumstances all diplomatic efforts should work to send unified signal first there are no winners in Wars violence or violence can only lead to more serious crisis there must be an immediate ceasefire abundant military means and return to the track of dialogue and negotiation second any violence and attacks against civilians should be rejected both the Palestinians and the Israelis have the right to be free from fear and their security should be equally protected third international humanitarian law must be followed the basic needs of the people of Gaza must be ensured the humanitarian Corridor must be opened immediately and the hostages must be released fourth the fundamental solution to the Palestinian Israeli question lies in the Imp implementation of the two-state solution based on relevant un resolutions and other International consensus to achieve a comprehensive just and Lasting settlement so that Palestine and Israel can live side by side in peace Mr President the security Council Bears the primary responsibility for maintaining International Peace and Security in the face of the continuing spread of conflicts and the increasingly imminent humanitarian disaster the security Council has no reason to remain silent and no excuse to delay further China does not agree with the claim that the security Council actions will interfere with ongoing diplomatic efforts though the draft resolutions proposed by both Russia and Brazil have not been adopted China the security Council cannot stop at this China expects all members of the security Council to face up to their responsibilities under the charter respond to the expectations of the Palestinians and the Israeli peoples and of the International Community move forward in unity and build consensus and make binding decisions on the current crisis situation decisions that will stand the test of history and conscience China has been making efforts all along we will continue to work with the International Community to play a constructive role for the ceasefire and the session of hostilities the protection of civilians and the prevention of further humanitarian crisis in order to realize a comprehensive just and Lasting solution to the question of Palestine thank you China for their statement and I now give the floor to the representative of Ghana thank you Mr President and we have listen carefully to the sobering briefing by special coordinator to wesland and USG marthew Griffiths we remain deeply concerned by the unfolding developments in the Gaza Strip in Israel at the outset while reiterating our strong condemnation of the present hostilities initiated by the Hamas militia on the 7th of October 2023 we are profoundly distressed by the attack on the Al Ali Hospital in Gaza that was also Sheltering civilians at the time it was hit we condemn the attack which adds to the growing frustration and human tragedy of this conflict and we call for a full and transparent investigation of the incident and the establishment of accountability since 7th October the world has witnessed unimaginable Horror in southern Israel and in the Gaza Strip many lives have been lost and many more will be lost if the fighting does not stop we deeply regret the high civilian cost arising out of the present hostilities and express our solidarity and sympathies to all the families who have lost loved ones to the violence in both Israel and Palestine Mr President Ghana believes that as a council and at this time our foremost responsibility alongside that of The Wider should be saving lives all lives in this regard we call on Hamas to immediately and unconditionally release all hostages and concurrently urge both sides to hold the firing of rockets and missiles we further urge Israel to restore essential services such as electricity and water supply to Gaza and permit humanitarian access of food and medicines to the vulnerable populations in Gaza we note the efforts of the United Nations and other humanitarian partners committed to operating in the unfolding difficult circumstances and Edge funding for the emerging humanitarian needs and for the and for the flash appeal in making these calls however we do not ignore the dictates of international law and the charter of this organization including relevant resolutions which affirm the right of guaranteed territorial inviability of for the states in the region including Israel as well as their right to self-defense nor deny the necessity of account ability for those most responsible for the egregious horrific and heinous incidents committed since Hamas initiated his attacks against Israel on 7th October for many member states reborn into modern statehood in the last century we cannot cease to underscore the importance of respect and adherance to the established principles of international law international humanitarian law civilians and civilians objects must be protected at all times and international law which has an international law which has been instrumental in the achievement of our respective status must be upheld by all even in Conflict to protect innocent lives to safeguard security and facilitate the aspirations for Statehood the deration of the security situation and the upward spiral of the violence poses the risk of a further spread and a danger to International Peace and security we therefore strongly urge a stop to the fighting accompanied by the the excise of Maximum restraint in good faith by all sides to enable mediation to play its role in releasing the hostages and addressing all immediate concerns including the growing humanitarian needs of the civilian population in Gaza we must all make every effort to De to reverse the downward spiral and provide a horizon of Hope for the people of the two Nations I conclude by reiterating Ghana's enduring commitment of support for achieving durable peace between Israel and Palestine we believe that reinvigorating the Middle East peace process presents the most viable path for the International Community to end the cycle of violence the vision of a region where Israel and Palestine live side by side with insecure and recognized borders should not be diminished even in this darkest of ours I thank Switzerland mer Mr President thank you thank you very much for having convened this emergency meeting I would also like to thank the under Secretary General Mr Martin griffi and special coordinator tour venis land for their very sincere descriptions of a very very Bleak situation I'd like to thank them and in particular their team for their efforts their work their courage in the most difficult of circumstances I would like to express my condolences to the families of the victims of those humanitarian workers who have died as early as the 7th of October Switzerland very strongly condemned the acts of Terror the taking perpetrated by hamers against the Israeli population we call for all that is all hostages held in Gaza to be treated humanely and released immediately and our thoughts are with them Switzerland joins the Secretary General also in unequivocally condemning yesterday's strikes in particular the one that according to the United Nations left hundreds dead and dant injured at the alaki Anglican hospital we extend our deepest victims this incident must be thoroughly investigated so that the facts can be clarified Mr President we can but repeat it over and over again the civilian population and civilian objects must be respected and protected International humanitarian law also requires that hospitals clinics and the people who are treated there as well as the medical staff who work there be protected the same applies to UNR schools which are civilian facilities of the UN at the at the same time the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate rapidly Water and Power cuts are causing a serious health crisis nearly a million gazans have had to flee their homes to take refuge in the South the Gaza Strip is under Complete Siege onr schools act as vital shelters for the 400,000 displaced persons many of them children the capacity of these schools as well of those of the hospitals has been exceeded all parties must allow the safe rapid and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian Aid we urge them to immediately observe pauses in hostilities and as the Secretary General has called for a humanitarian ceasefire Mr President as we repeat after the vote this morning all parties must exercise the most utmost restraint in the conduct of hostilities they must respect International humanitarian law in particular the principles of precaution and human rights all possible measures must be taken to avoid the impact of hostilities on the civilian population and civilians as account of legitimate security and Military necessity all its rules must be respected without exception we stress the need to investigate all violations of international law so that the perpetrators can be brought to Justice the respect for International humanitarian law can also curb a spiral of violence that could ignite the entire region Mr President Switzerland underlines the importance of the good offices of the United Nations in this crisis we'd like to thank them we welcome the secretary General's visit to Egypt and the region as under Secretary General Martin Griffith and anra commissioner General excuse me Philip lazarini said yesterday in a joint statement and I quote Humanity must Prevail in Gaza Humanity must Prevail everywhere deescalation must remain the priority as members of the security Council we must redouble our efforts to contribute to this and exert our influence on the parties
