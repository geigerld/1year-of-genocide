let's start first of all sorry for for the delay uh Mr larini was um in another meeting and I'd like to thank you all very much for being here for this press conference uh of the unra commissioner General Mr Philip Le zini doesn't need any introduction of course but I'd like to thank you very much for being here to listen to his update on the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory in Gaza and I'll give him the floor immediately for his initial remarks and then we will take a few questions and I underline the few thank you Mr lini commissioner General okay good um good morning good afternoon and first of all yes apologize for the yes okay so first of all uh apologize for the delay I had a longer member State briefing than uh expected this morning what I suggest to do now is maybe just to share one or two latest development on the ground uh but also to share with you some of the messages I have shared with the member states and also to comment on the review the Kine Kon report and maybe also a little update on the o us report um when when it comes to the situation on the ground um I mean basically our colleagues are telling us that there is a extraordinary deep anxiety prevailing right now in Gaza because the question uh everybody ask is whether yes or not there will be a military offensive and the likelihood of a military offensive will all depends uh whether or not a cire deal will be reached uh this week um just to let you know that people have not yet been asked to evacuate from Rafa but there is a sense that if there is no deal this week that this can happen at any time my colleague on the ground are also uh describing uh basically a a constant I would say a constant state of trauma among the people and basically they came with a new acronym we are not talking anymore about uh PTSD but we are more talking about the ctsd which would mean constant traumatic stress disorder prevailing in the Gaza Strip and obviously this is not too surprising uh this morning I commented also on the latest development in the north where we are engaged in a race against the clock to reverse in fact the spreading hunger and the looming famine especially in the northern part the good news is that my colleagues have reported that there is more food available in the market so increased Ava availability but it is still does not mean that the food is accessible just because there is absolutely no cash circulating in the northern part of the Gaza Strip we believe that much more needs to be done it is true that there have been more Supply entering during the month of April but this is still far from enough to reserve or to to reverse the negative Trend we have seen I have also mentioned this morning when I met the uh member states um the uh issue about the blame game you might have heard between the Israeli uh Authority mainly the Kat and the United Nation on one hand Israel saying what we are providing all the necessary food the problem is is on the side of the United Nation let me just give you few facts regarding this first this is not true this is not our reading uh look at um starting with un whenever we ask for a convoy going from the south to to the north our convoys are systematically denied so we still have no access whenever a permission is given to deliver anywhere else in the strep the process is always complicated and very uh cumbersome uh when when it comes to enter into Gaza we have this system of offloading downloading offloading downloading the trucks which makes things extraordinary uh difficult also um we have operating hours of the crossing which vary from one day to another one with limited number of hours where we can operate and most of the time the many times a week we we have also the crossing being closed because they just dumping uh D release to theis or dumping sometimes bodies who have been T who have been taken to Israel and back to the Gaza street now talking about um the um the detes I have also briefed the member State about the report we have issued about a week ago um it was the first time that in fact un has released such a report in my meeting this morning I have reminded that of course hostages are still in captivity with the Hamas and that both the Secretary General myself but other un officer keep asking for the unconditional and immediate release of the hostages but I have also shared this morning our deep concern regarding the gazin detained by the Israeli Security Forces um the report you have seen uh recently has been based on the number of testimonies collected by the agency Why by the agency because we are at the Crossing we are at Kem Shalom because we are mining the main logistical Hub at the entry of Gaza and these people basically have been released at this place and u according to the testim uh testimonies that we have collected um people have told us that they are routinely red when they were arrested they were routinely rounded up stripped to the underwear and loaded into trucks blindfolded and bonded most of the time once arrested these detes remain in communic and they are subjected to shocking inum treatment among the IM inum treatment they have described to us water boing water boarding severe victims attacked by dogs being forced to hold stress position for hours sometimes 12 hours 24 hours and being forced to wear diaper instead of accessing uh the toilet and among the detainers who have been relieved we had also a number of un staff and they have also reported to us that while on interrog ation they were asked a lot of question about their work with Ona and basically also being pressured to state that the agency is politically Affiliated in the Gaza Strip this morning I have also highlighted the fact that U as you know the agency is under a lot of strain they are call for the agency to be uh dismantled uh but the agency also has been uh targeted over the last six uh seven months um in in in in Gaza uh where both uh our staff but also our premises as well as our operation I just reminded that since the beginning of the war we have 182 staff member now who have been killed more than 160 premises which have been uh damaged uh all totally destroyed and most of these premises were Sheltering a displaced people and more than 400 people have been killed in these premises uh we have also seen that whenever we vacated premises mainly in the north of the Gaza strep uh they have been then used for military uh purposes uh we have uh also heard about the ation regarding tunnel uh underneath some of our premises and basically I was calling the member state to make sure that at the end of the war once we have a ceas fa that we have also the ne that we put in place an investig independent investigation uh to look into this blatant disregard of the United Nation in order to avoid that this becomes also in the future uh the new standard I also briefed uh this morning about where we stand on the oios report but in fact we have been briefed by Stefan durit I think on on on Friday just to reiterate what he has said we started with 12 allegation conveyed already to me then I submitted after that to O us later on oios received seven additional allegation five plus five in March and two in April out of the 19 one person has been completely cleared and is now reinstated and four people out of the 19 uh the investigation is now on hold because there is no further or additional information available for the time being when it comes to the Kine Colona report you had access already a week ago you have seen that she has stressed the fact that the agency has important and robust uh uh uh system and mechanism to deal with neutrality Brides uh that it is in fact above the average uh in uh the region but uh but obviously we can do more and there there is a number of recommendation that 50 yes uh see the body language right now that the Secretary General and myself are committed now to implement you have seen the E category she has looked into it we have published last week already four pages informing the member states about our intend and how we will follow up on this recommendation and I hope that by miday we will have a first preliminary action plan to be uh to be shared now we will have four category of recommendation one are the recommendation for which the agency has already taken step and we have just to to align them with the recommendation of the reporter we have additional recommendation which we consider a Quick Fix and can be implemented then we have recommendation which require additional resource within the organization and lastly we will have recommendation also which will require the support of member states or host country we are committed to report back on a regularly on a regular basis on where we stand with this uh recommendation um maybe just a comment on the funding of the situation um in January you remember that once the allegation have been made public up to 16 countries suspended the contribution to the agency the good news is that to as of today most of the agent uh donor countries have resumed their contribution to the agency we just have a handful of a country who still need to take a decision we know that the main contributor being the US has indicated that they will not be able to support the agency before March 25 uh but meanwhile in all member State briefing they are recommending other countries to support un and we still wait otherwise the decision of other countries including the one we are uh just just now um the good news also on the funding is that uh we have new donors uh or countries who before never contributed uh to the agency and I want also to flag uh the success in private fundraising uh in six months the agency has uh basically mobilized more than15 million us in private fundraising which is an indication also of the extraordinary Grassroots solidarity Express towards uh Palestinian and also to the agency let me just um conclude with one or two comment the first one and I was at the security Council 10 days ago and uh basically I reminded the member state that all the call for the agency to be dismantled not only in Gaza but also in East Jerusalem and in the West Bank have nothing to do with neutrality neutrality issues can be addressed uh but it is all but the objective behind it is clearly to strip the Palestinian from the refugee status and uh basically we keep hearing uh unoa is part of the problem because it perpetuates the refugee status it's as if you say that an human response in a conflict perpetuates the conflict what perpetuates the conflict is the absence of a political uh solution so I told member states that uh um that more than ever the lasting temporary agency that we have been over the last 75 years if really today there is a genuine commitment to reactivate and bring back the two-state solution on the table the agency can retrieve its temporary Nature by supporting the transition leading to the two-state solution the transition leading to a day after I think uh I I will maybe stop here and uh take question and there are many commissioner General larini and I will start with Y who is our correspondent of and also the president the new president Philip of the association of journalists here in Geneva at the okay so I'll uh I'll now go to Benjamin L uh who is our correspondent of the French speaking Swiss Radio I think you have a news for us Ben mer continue um uh pardon um Stan I have a list I've seen all your [Music] thank you very much Christian I had noted your hand is it's okay now okay so let's go to Jeremy L another French speaker indid person um for thank you very much question an important one um mer let's switch back to English Jimmy Kon Associated Press thank you uh Mr larini for coming to see us um just wanted to follow up on that a little bit um just to be clear so there's not any change in your timetable for the continued uh operations of unra through June even though you've gotten this 115 more than $15 million that hasn't changed your your timeline um for for operations just wanted to be clear on that um the second question just has to do with um you mentioned that one person had been reinstated um that means back to work I mean just could you clarify that and is it your understanding that the donors who have suspended their funding are waiting for the release of the final OS oi OS report to actually resume I mean is that the condition that they've told you thank you yes thank you uh we we we have two main uh stream within the organization we have the core budget which basically covers the salaries of the 30,000 staff of the organization which most of the time I describe as our backbone basically um and when I talk about the shortfall uh of the main contribut contributor for of $120 $180 million being the US I talk about this part of the budget the rest is related to the emergency appeal either the emergency appeal uh for the opt now which includes obviously Gaza for which we have called now 1.2 billion US do and also the appeal on the Syria crisis which covers also the humanit assistance in Lebanon and in georia Jord so the $120 million that we have raised with the private sector is primally uh money for the Gaza appeal so it's not money uh mobilized for the core budget of the organization now yes I'm confident in uh until the end of June because I know that June is now completely bridged uh I have information about July it's not completely bridged uh if you ask are you confident or not uh I would say in during the last four years I have rarely had more visibility than two or three months um I'm used now to to to to have to deal with a extraordinary unsettling uh Financial uh environment and situation so based on recent experience based on the fact that most of the donor now have come back and most of the donor clearly indicated that the review and the Kine Colona report will be the basis for their uh decision so not not AOS that I'm aware of thank you very much uh I'll go to can I just make a comment because it's important the Kine Colona report is all about the system and policies and the agency oios it's about individual Behavior and the individual Behavior does not mean that there is a systemic issue so Katherine Kona was on the systemic o on the individual okay but just to follow up on that I mean the reason that the the funding was suspended was principally in relation to these individual cases you are right but the follow-up concern after that was is there a systemic flow or not thank you very much let's go now to imoen folks our correspondent of BBC imoen hi thanks for taking my question um this is actually about this uh Floating Bridge that the um Americans are uh are building into uh into Gaza to bring Aid in uh Jamie McGoldrick the outgoing humanitarian coordinator he expressed some concerns about how that would work work I just wonder how you you assess it yes there have been number of concern expressed by UN agency about the m m operandi once the pier uh is in place and how uh the assistance will arrive will be maned will be handled uh at the pier uh we had last week the head of the security who came also uh to make an assessment we have submitted number of recommendation in order to address our concern and my understanding is that this our ongoing uh discussion and once our concern are addressed I mean this will be an an additional uh entry point uh as you know we keep also saying that the maritime Corridor or airdropping uh cannot and should not be alternative to the main entry into Gaza being the land Crossing um indeed Christian ER from the German news agency had a question thank you Mr lazarini I'm getting lost in the figures that are floating around now can you tell us how many countries have still suspended what sum of money what sum what did you expect to get in January that has been suspended and has not resumed so how much is still lacking out of a total of what thank you the countries who I mean first the United States United State has clearly indicated that they will keep the freeze the suspension until March 2025 the UK because of Congress prohibition the UK has not yet taken a decision Austria has has not yet taken a decision so this and we just heard uh the what's going on here in Switzerland so this are the three countries uh who are still suspending all the other countries have resumed now we hear that Italy has also suspended but Italy has not yet contributed to the agency or since the new government is in place so since 2023 they have not contributed to agency the figures I don't know what the UK intended to uh contribute uh you know they have been uh they were top donor few years ago they have significantly decreased when they have politically taken the decision to decrease their oversight uh budget from 0.7 to 0.5 of the GDP I don't know exactly what the intend was for this year so I have to look back to what they contributed in 2023 to have an estimate but for the us we are talking about1 180 million Us doll can we take a couple of more question okay sorry uh I was just checking because I think at certain point we will have to stop but I'll I'll give the floor to Dina bab Dina can you introduce yourself please thank you alisander I'm Dina abis I'm the representative of different Arabic media my question is about the um detainees the Palestinian detainees you said that they are facing extreme violence um what is the number of those detainees do you have any uh figures and uh did you um document in your reports any killing of detainees and any sexual violence and rape thank you thank you uh what what we have reported basically it's what I have shared with you uh before so the short answer is uh no no other uh uh um Mis mistreatment uh or torture than the one I have described um how many detes I don't know uh I can tell you how many have been released through the km Shalom uh Crossing and there have been more than thousand uh over the last few months thank you very much I'm now a little bit um she was waiting she's been waiting for a long time Louisa Balin from the global Geneva magazine we can't hear you maybe you oh now it works now it's working thank you U mer thank you very much I'll take a last question from the correspondent of Yumi shimun thank you very much my name is sat I work for Yim um I just want to follow up the the peer that the US military is currently constructing um in terms of Aid distribution will unwa be involved in this and then also secondly you said that the Israeli authorities have denied Ura to deliver Hood Aid to the north so um the last time urua was able to deliver the hood Aid was January 23rd so since then you were denied and and then also about um when was the last time you are allowed to enter Gaza because I saw the news that you are also denied to enter the Gaza thank you thank you I I plan to go to Gaza Sunday so I hope I will be allowed to go together but I don't have a final answer for the time being uh when it comes to the pier basically we have a uh you know we we we are dividing responsibility within the UN system uh un is Manning logistic at K Shalom and in Rafa and uh we have uh the the logistic cluster which is supported by wfp which will be Manning the entry point in at eret when eret becomes operational and also at the pier on behalf of the humanarian system um it is true that we did not have any convoys of un direct convoys from the south to the north having said that uh when we operate in the north uh we are we have our staff helping for the distribution uh to the people in need and uh we have also the necessary premises where the assistance can be brought in so um yeah I I have to for the person who asked um the how much funding is still suspended to the agency the estimated when we say suspended it's money we were aware which was committed and which remain suspended for the agency the total amount is 267 million uh Us doll uh the bulk of it comes from the US and I'm trying to read trying to answer your questions and come back okay just emph yeah yeah I was just reminded that uh when it comes to supply into Gaza the most efficient way and the quickest Remains the land access and this is also the safest way to bring assistance into Gaza Strip thank you very much uh commissioner general larini for this uh updates today it was really important to hear you especially after the decision of the Swiss authorities uh thanks to all for having followed this press conference and please come back soon uh to update us and good luck thank you very much thank
