Health officials in Gaza say more than a hundred people have been killed after Israeli soldiers opened fire near a crowd waiting for humanitarian Aid delivery in Gaza City Hamas widely designated as a terrorist group runs the Gaza Health Ministry and Hamas officials there say more than 700 others were injured in the incident Israeli officials say most of those killed died in a crush to get aid but they have also acknowledged that as the aid Convoy moved further north troops fired warning shots including at people's legs believing that the crowd gathered around the Convoy posed a threat here is more from an Israeli government spokesperson on the incident my understanding thus far is that uh humanitarian Aid Vehicles entered the Gaza Strip and were overwhelmed by uh people attempting to essentially loot to uh to take that Aid um from those a trucks and at some point and we can you you can surely see this in some of the videos that the IDF have distributed at some point the trucks were overwhelmed and the people driving the trucks which were Garen uh Garen civilian drivers uh plowed into um the crowds of people let's get across to DW's Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem Tanya at this point we have conflicting reports about what has happened so let's be clear about what we do and don't know at this point can you tell us first of all what we can say for sure well I mean as you said there are conflicting reports and uh you know there were devastating scenes being described by eyewitness to wire Services there um so what we know is that this eight Convoy moved uh from the uh Convoy of trucks moved from the south of the Gaza Strip to the north Northern Gaza Strip we understand it passed a uh checkpoint there on the way and then what eyewitnesses are saying uh uh is that uh once the uh eight Convoy was moving there the trucks arrived on the other side that uh a lot of people uh went there obviously and uh and that there were shots fired from the Israeli military that caused people to panic also the drivers to panic and then uh to uh turn turn around and also run people over causing a stampede so to speak this is what eyewitnesses have said and that what caus the casualties that have been uh reported by the uh Ministry of Health there in Gaza now the uh Israeli military has released uh aerial footage uh from this area this is the coastal Road uh going from the south to the north and they are saying that were actually two incidents that there was a stampede uh um in the uh in in the first place that a lot of people were actually trying to get to the aid and and were trying and this cause the panic and that also truck drivers then uh were turning around and people were run over and then there was a second incident uh where they put out in statement but also uh talking to reporters in a briefing this afternoon uh saying uh that some soldiers felt threatened and that they were responding uh with uh live fire but they also say this incident is still uh the uh review so uh basically what we have to remind ourselves is also that you know in the past as we heard from the eight organizations and from the United Nations how desperate the situation is and I think you can see that how many people were trying to congregate around these trucks trying to get uh to the goods on on these uh trucks with the eight organizations warning of this extremely dire situation because Aid is not reaching uh the northern part of Gaza and indeed you could see the crowds in that footage we were just looking at released by the IDF um Joe Biden he says the US is checking reports about what has happened but do we already know what what this might mean for efforts toward a ceasefire well there is obviously concern that this might impact those negotiation these mediation efforts that are uh going on uh uh between uh indirectly between Hamas and Israel mediated by Qatar in Egypt and also uh the US and we've been hearing the US President Joe Biden he said that the US is still trying to determine what actually happened exactly in this incident but he was also asked whether this whether he thinks this would impact those negotiations where there was some cautious optimism that you know there might be some kind of breakthrough depending on what sources you believe and he said you know that um uh I know it will probably complicated complicate uh those negotiations now of course um what we are looking at is on the one hand of course there's hope in Israel that uh Israeli hostages that are still being held in Gaza would be released in such a uh hostage deal in exchange for Palestinian prisoners there would be also potentially a longer ceasefire but also uh there's of course hope for Palestinian residents what they need so much more Aid coming in respite from uh uh uh the as well for for these few days but it's very important to stress that of course humanitarian Aid would also go in if uh you know those negotiation would be as successful at the end Tanya Kramer reporting for us from Jerusalem thank you so much as
