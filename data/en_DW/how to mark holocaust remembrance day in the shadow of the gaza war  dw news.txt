Sirens blad out across Israel today as the nation stopped to remember the 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis 2 minutes of silence as Israelis Mark the annual day of mourning for and commemoration of the victims of the Holocaust Israeli leaders also gathered for the Eternal Flame at yat vashem the world Holocaust remembrance Center among them prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and president ISAC P now this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day is being observed in the shadow of the Hamas terror attack of October 7th and the subsequent war in Gaza at a ceremony on Sunday night Netanyahu denounced what he called a volcano of anti-Semitism and took aim at Israel's International critics 80 years ago in the Holocaust the Jewish people were totally defenseless against those who sought our destruction no Nation came to our Aid today we again confront enemies bent on our destruction I say to the leaders of the world no amount of pressure no decision by any International Forum will stop is Israel from defending itself as the prime minister of Israel the one and only Jewish State I pledge here today from Jerusalem on this Holocaust Remembrance Day if Israel is forced to stand alone Israel will stand alone Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu there I'm now very pleased to welcome the Rabbi Abraham Cooper in the studio he's associate dean of the seimon visent center Jewish human rights organization he's also the chairman of the US Commission on International religious freedom which gives policy advice to the US government thank you for joining us here on this very special day uh in the studio uh now this is the first Holocaust remance day since October uh uh 7 the terror attacks then when you think back to a year ago and then look at the situ situation now what are your thoughts well as far as the Jewish people are concerned a year ago uh there tremendous divisions ideological religious political you know Jews do like to argue a lot uh October 7th just saw those divisions not only in Israel but even in the diaspora melt away because it was understood that October 7th was something different and uh in a sense it's his own existential threat when that happens the Jewish Family tends to come together on the other hand you know the Holocaust was uh if you will industrial size mass murder genocide uh and everything was done to depersonalize the contact between the murderers and the victim to cover up what had taken place October 7th in a sense was the exact opposite looking for families broadcasting it back home calling Mom and Dad in gosses saying I killed 10 Jews with my own hands so there I think a lot of the survivors of October 7th have been looking to the survivors of the Holocaust for if you will a Lifeline for guidance like how could you pick up the pieces after where do we go from here and so there is I think one other very important um issue in that is that denial has become a weapon denial of the Holocaust by the Iranians and others and denial of the reality of what happened on October 7th by Hamas and hamas's supporters around the world it's almost unbelievable but if you can deny the Holocaust you can pretty much deny anything so we just saw Netanyahu there speaking in Jerusalem so so you think he's right to draw parallels with the Holocaust there uh I think it's simply unavoidable uh I work for the Simon visol Center Mr wethal was the famous Nazi Hunter who worked very hard to not draw parallels directly between one genocide and another each on its own right stands alone but way I would say is that for the intergeneration of the Jewish Family if you will there's a a natural uh need for if you will a collective hug but in terms of uh that needs to be led by the survivors who went through the ultimate inh Humanity not just for 24 hours but sometimes for four or five years now you mentioned the word genocide which has become a really a political Hot Potato if you will this particular word um and there are people who compare the war in Gaza uh uh to a Geno genocide to to the Holocaust uh has it become necessary for these days to explain the difference well I think uh you're absolutely right the term genocide is now applied uh to horrific events that take place sometimes mass murders not all of them are genocides it doesn't uh diminished the level of suffering of individuals in so far as trying to if you will to flip the narrative which Hamas and its supporters work so hard to do uh it's I think pretty straightforward uh no one had to suffer in Gaza all Hamas had to do is lay down its weapons and that's perhaps not uh thought about or spoken about very much but when you're dealing with an enemy that itself wants to see you kill and maim as many Poss people as possible uh it it puts Israelis in in a in a tough position but at the end of the day politics Society just came from Israel uh the people themselves uh and you know it's a small country what happened there is the equivalent of probably 10 91s uh there is a GM determination to see this through people hope it'll happen quickly because they still have Hezbollah and ultimately you of the Ayatollah up there so it's a very tough and rocky road ahead and the lessons from the Holocaust of course are not only about uh death and destruction and mass murder but about perseverance and courage and humanity and hope now uh no matter what happens in in the immediate future the brutality of the attack on October 7th uh and also the high price that gazans are paying right now that anger and hate on both sides uh is it ever going to go away I can't speak for the people in Gaza I know that unfortunately getting education through unra uh has sort of kept a lot of that hatred boiling for quite a while before uh o October 7th I think from the point of view of Israelis um I think their their hatred is focused on the enemy and I think the vast majority of Israelis don't see all Palestinians as quote unquote the enemy nonetheless the numbers the polling that's taking place the endorsement of what took place on October 7th and then the denial uh which we're hearing more and more about that it it was all a concoction made up that's what raises of course the level of of anger uh uh to fever pitch among Israel but I I think that the day after will come and in the middle e least as fast as these horrific events take place the day after sometimes brings some promises of Hope right now we don't see any on the horizon but Simon weisenthal himself was once asked if he believed the Miracles and he said well I'm not a religious man uh and I like when I look at the Middle East I think objectively but in order to be an optimist in the Middle East you have to believe in miracles he's right let's change the subject and look at uh the uh Spike of anti-Semitism especially on us campuses um universities we've seen uh the pro Palestinian protesters at Colombia other universities across the US your colleague Jim Burk the CEO of the Simon Health Center had this to say I think we have a piece of Graphics there to go with it anyway I'll just read it we are witnessing the abject failure of universities to hold accountable those who have hijacked University campuses and failed to protect your students faculty staff and other supporters of Israel immediate action must be taken would you agree with that sentiment is it only a failure of the universities I think at the end of the day when some of those universities parents are paying 990,000 us a year for tuition it's a contract people go to university to uh to study um and yes it is a failure in the part of administrations and as been reported here katar has invested over $4 billion dollar in Elite American universities over the years and I think also in watching some of the University presidents being interrogated on Capitol Hill they're all reading statements drafted by lawyers we need less lawyers we need more leadership you don't have that leadership you have that kind of situation where extremists know exactly what they want to do where they want to take the canvus to have a pretty open road in a lot of locations and uh from the point of view of the Jewish Community it's a difficult but necessary wakeup call and uh hopefully cooler heads will I think also it's very important is the IRA definition of anti-semitism I can't tell you how many University administrators have told me if we only had a working definition then we would be able to train our police on campus and take the necessary action what's missing right now there's no moral GPS in most of these Elite campuses and if and affects not only the Jew Jewish people in this issue but more broadly it's just absent from the curriculum if you will uh speaking about uh the the moral compass commentators say that anti-Semitism is moving from the right where it used where we used to see it uh to the left in the US and elsewhere do you think that's happening I think it has happened uh it doesn't mean that neo-nazis suddenly are uh to they're still there but what you're seeing here is the demonization of the Jewish State and uh as far as criticizing Israel uh you won't get stronger criticism than its own knesset or among taxi drivers but when you get into diaspora the conversation suddenly shifted from where will the borders of a two-state solution proposed be to no there needs to be one state and from River to Sea Palestine etc etc a dramatic shift uh a kind of wholesale Embrace of the Hamas narrative Robbie Abraham Cooper associate dean of the Simon ween Hall Center thank you very much for joining us here on the day on this very special day
