turning now to our other top story mediators from the US Qatar and Egypt are meeting with a Hamas delegation in Cairo for talks aimed at reaching a ceasefire in Gaza Israel says it will send their delegation as well but only if it sees positive movement during the talks the talks are taking place as Israel threatens to launch an offensive on the city of Rafa to pursue Hamas militants that it holds responsible for the October 7th Terror attacks some 1 and a half million Palestinians are taking refuge in the southern city the UN and the US have warned against the operation now the truce proposal seeks to Halt fighting and exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners well since the October 7th attacks the relatives of hostages kidnapped by Hamas have been fighting to keep the focus on getting their loved ones [Applause] home for months prime minister netanyahu's government has been under men's pressure to bring the hostages back little is known about the fate of the around 130 hostages still held in Gaza the number includes both civilians and soldiers two young children among them but dozens of hostages are presumed to be dead at the end of April Hamas released videos of two hostages one of them was Keith seagull seeing my father today only makes clearer to all of us that we must reach a deal as soon as possible and bring everyone home I demand that the leaders of this country watch this video and see our father crying out for help an earlier ceasefire in November last year saw 105 hostages return home mainly women children and dual Nationals including 30 thi farmers toing a weekl long pause in fighting there were hopes that the truth would hold and all hostages would be released but both sides accused the other of breaking the terms and fighting resumed on December 1st for the families enduring months of Hope and heartbreak all eyes are on the current talks many desperately hoping for a truth that would bring back their loved ones we can cross now to correspondent Tanya kma in Jerusalem Tanya hi there tell us what is the latest on the Seas fire and hostage negotiations well there is a sense that uh you know the the the talks are at a critical stage right now and that comes maybe also because throughout the day there have been uh reports in mainly the Arab media that uh there is some kind of you know uh that the deal would be closed but of course you have to take those reports with a grain of Sal there's nothing official yet we understand that the Hamas delegation is now in CaRu again uh with the mediators from Egypt Qatar and also the United States and Israel has said or some officials here have said that they are still waiting for the official response by Hamas to that proposal that has been actually going on uh all week and such a proposal could include uh the release of uh 33 hostages against a certain number of Palestinian prisoners held in uh Israeli prisoners and that would be done within four to six weeks of a temporary ceasefire another proposal also says that could then go into a third into a second and a third phase but we have no official confirmation of uh those proposals yet and of course at the moment we just have to wait and see how close both sides actually are it's a critical phase as you say Tanya now we have seen many various attempts to reach a deal over the last six months is this time any different well there has been even more PR especially by the United States but also the sense of urgency and we're seeing tonight again it's Saturday night like in many uh month uh in the past month and we've just seen that also in the report uh tens of thousands of Israelis are out in the streets calling uh for such a deal calling also for uh elections but also for the civilian population in Gaza uh they are enduring now seven month of War they want to see uh a ceasefire now um in Israel this phase now has been described as a sort of last opportunity there's always they say there's a choice between either a deal or a ground uh uh operation uh in rafar and at this stage it's still really unclear there are some of the major sticking points uh such as what the Hamas demands concern the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip as well as a permanent end uh to the war and there has been some uh Israeli senior official that was quoted today when all these uh reports emerged saying that the deal would certainly not include uh the permanent ending uh of the war so we have to wait and see it's not done until it's done for more on this Let's cross to German Egyptian journalist Karim El goari in Cairo Karim thank you for your time as I understand Egyptian media are hinting at a breakthrough in the ceasefire talks tell us what are you hearing yeah they they are positive about what's happening right now they are meeting since this morning Saturday morning and um also there were positive signs from the Hamas delegation there's a spokesperson of Hamas Usama hamdan who said that they see positive steps that Hamas came to Cairo with a positive spirit but also saying that uh uh it still has to ripe meaning that Hamas sees still things that have to be negotiated we have also the head of the CIA William Burns since Friday in Cairo who is not in Cairo is the Israeli delegation who says that they're only coming if there's a positive answer uh from Hamas so everything seems to be opening but uh the negotiations seems to be pretty serious I think one of the main sticking points right now is that or the main contradictions let better say is that Hamas is demanding some kind of guarantees for a permanent ceasefire that this war will be over and that the Israeli forces will withdraw from the gaza's troops maybe Al also guarantees from the US which they don't have to get from the Israelis that obviously contradicts uh the Israeli War objective to destroy Hamas and also what Israel what Nan is saying that in any case there will be a rougher offensive so it's progress but it's difficult to see how they will overcome this very basic contradictions okay so thank you for outlining that that sticking point there there have been many various attempts to reach an agreement in the last six months um if if the if both sides can't come to an agreement and get over these sticking points what will it mean for the war if if the proposal is rejected well what we what we experien right now is some kind of blame game already going on in case uh this there won't be an agreement Hamas is clearly putting fingers at Israel saying it's netan who's blocking uh the ceasefire negotiations also because a ceasefire would endanger his own political Survival on the other hand for example US Secretary of State blinkin said between the people of Gaza and the ceasefire the only thing that stands in between that is today Hamas so blame Day game is going on the finger pointing is going on for the case that this negotiations will need lead to need lead to Nowhere appreciate your insights there that was German Egyptian journalist Karim El goari in Cairo thank you so much you're welcome
