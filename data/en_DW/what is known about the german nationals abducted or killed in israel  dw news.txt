now Hamas militants have abducted dozens of hostages including children and the elderly most families have had no word on their fate one of the many missing is German Israeli citizen Shani Luke her family has been trying to get help from the government here in Berlin but they feel abandoned by the German authorities this is the last picture of Shan look on social media the 22-year-old German Israeli was at this music festival in the neif desert when the terrorists struck they killed at least 260 people and kidnapped several others to Gaza including shaie in this video she's displayed by the terrorists unconscious in the back of a pickup truck her relatives recognized her so did her aunt who lives in Germany since Saturday morning we have no life you know and we are trying to do the best for this girl on Tuesday a shimmer of Hope shaie might be in a hospital in Gaza the relatives say they have received this information from an informant another clue that points in that direction is that her credit card was used in a shop next to the hospital the family has been trying to get help since Sunday they say the authorities have been of little help they feel neglected but this we are really disappointed we haven't been able to reach anyone from the foreign office for more than 48 hours they told us to fill in some forms and it would then be dealt with more quickly sh's mother in Israel appeals for help we ask no we demand that the German Government Act quickly there shouldn't be any questions about responsibility they must act quickly to get Shani out of Gaza because air strikes continue to hit the area and the ground offensive may be imminent and we believe that the only one that can help at this moment is only the the the German government that is their hope to keep sha alive and for more on this we can bring in dwa political correspondent Julia Sal uh Julia do we have uh any idea about how many Germans citizens uh have been affected uh people who might have been killed abducted how many are missing at this moment so we've heard from German foreign minister analin abok that there are thought to be hostages in Gaza that uh Hamas the terrorist organization has taken but there she didn't make any numbers German media is estimating that there are at least five German Nationals taken hostage and uh there are reports that at least Le one German National has been killed in the attack it is uh reported to be a 22-year-old student uh from Berlin but the German foreign Ministry has not confirmed uh this death there are also uh thought to be thousands of German citizens still in Israel also many of them dual Nationals uh between uh Germany and Israel and the German foreign Ministry has received uh since the weekend around 4,500 requests from German citizens to return to Germany a lot of uh flights to and from Israel have uh been stopped at the moment so the German foreign Ministry has now asked the national carrier Lanza to operate flights in and out of Israel on Thursday and Friday to evacuate German citizens it is expected that there will be four flights a day for purpose Angelia what more have we heard from the authorities here in Germany well on the case of shanie Luke she the case has not been officially addressed by uh the foreign Ministry but we have heard from her family that they uh had uh allegedly difficulties in trying to get in touch with the foreign Ministry what the German foreign minister has said is that there is a Non-Stop communication going on between German authorities and colleagues on the ground but also any actor on the ground that has direct communication open with Hamas in the attempt to try to free any hostages there what Bok also said is that with a terrorist organization like Hamas communication is anything but easy and we know that the situation in Gaza where sha Luke to uh be confirmed to be in critical condition in a hospital is particularly difficult because of the Relentless bombing going on we've heard from doctors uh on the ground we've heard reports that they're running out of Medicine medicines and that hospitals are at capacity and uh getting out of the Gaza Strip itself is very complicated so the situation in terms of trying to get the hostages out seems to be very difficult and complicated all right that is the view from Berlin there thank you to our political correspondent Julia Sal well to the US now which has confirmed at least 11 of its citizens were killed in their terror attack on Saturday President Joe Biden has condemned the attacks by Hamas and emphasized that the US stands by Israel earlier he said that Israel had the right to defend itself this was an act of sheer evil more than 1,000 civilians slaughtered not just kill slaughtered in Israel among them at least 14 American citizens killed parents butchered using their bodies to try to protect their children stomach turning reports of being babies being killed entire fam slain today Americans across the country are praying for all those families that have been ripped apart a lot of us know how it feels it leaves a black hole in your chest when you lose family feeling like you're being sucked in the anger the pain a sense of hopelessness this is what they mean by human tragedy and that of course was part of a wider speech by Joe Biden we're going to take a look back at it now with DW special correspondent Aya Ibrahim Aya hi there what are your main takeaways from what Biden had to say about the attack in Israel well the president used very emotional very descriptive language calling these attacks uh by Hamas uh uh sheer uh evil he talked about the victims the children uh the elderly that have been killed uh and the rapes as we hear there are reports that there have been uh rapes committed uh as uh well he definitely gave Israel a lot of latitude when it comes to its current military operation in the Gaza Strip uh saying reiterating again the uh American stance that Israel has the right to defend itself in the face of the unprecedented Terror attacks that it is uh facing at the same time he was sure to point out that uh as uh democracies also have to abide by the rule of law and by that of course uh he means uh you know the civilians that are in Gaza and that within that military operation their lives have to be taken into consideration as well he's perhaps eing the words that we heard yesterday from the UN Secretary General Antonio gues who gave statements on the ongoing military operation saying that even you know within uh legitimate Israeli security concerns and within that military operation that has to happen within the framework of international law and that includes you know considering uh civilian life and civilian infrastructure uh in that military operation Jared I yeah speaking of civilians there are American citizens among the hostages that Hamas is threatening to kill also broadcast the killings uh if that happened how would that affect the US position well the current US position is is that it the the Biden Administration is ready to assist Israel with all of the help that it needs for our viewers who don't know uh the United States does provide Israel with upwards of3 billion US of military aid annually and with the current unprecedented situation the Biden Administration has also pledged to provide Israel with uh more ammunition and more uh equipment um but the United States has said that up until this point there will be no us boots on the ground we do know that however that the Biden Administration will provide the Israelis with expertise in the form of uh hostage hostage negotiators but there is a lot of pressure we saw today in Tel Aviv a press conference by families of US citizens believed to be held in Gaza asking the president to do more to find their loved ones and really uh pleading with him reminding him that it is his responsibility and the responsibility of the United States to ensure their uh safe uh return but it seems that for now that help will be limited to uh working with the Israelis but so far no American boots on the ground okay a secretary of state Anthony blinkin is due to fly to Israel on Wednesday uh what kind of support is he going to bring along with him we we already know that the United States is pledging military aid I think uh Anthony blinking making that trip visiting Israel at this time while it's under constant bombardment and uh rocket rocket uh fire from Gaza is a hugely symbolic move uh it is meant to show the is people that the United States stands by them and that he is willing to make this trip even under these uh difficult circumstances many flight many uh many airlines have actually cancered their flights to Tel Aviv because to Israel because of the current security situation the United States has also moved ship carry uh ships and aircraft carriers towards the Eastern Mediterranean uh in an attempt to deter I mean this was also something that President Biden spoke about today that if to deter Regional actors not to take advantage of the current situation he said it himself whoever is thinking about I'm paraphrasing now whoever is thinking about taking advantage of this situation uh and that is like an implicit uh uh you know message to uh actors like Iran or Hezbollah in Lebanon he said don't do it just don't do it and so that uh that uh visit by Anthony blinkin will likely uh to you know is is is meant to serve and strengthen that message uh and deter also uh any actors in the region that may be thinking about taking advantage of the current security situation Jared DW special correspondent a Ibrahim in Washington Aya thanks so much for that
