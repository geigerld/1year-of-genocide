reunited with her family at an Israeli Hospital prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was also there to welcome her home footage of Hamas abducting Noah and her boyfriend in the October 7 Terror attacks was among the first to emerge three men were also freed in the operation almog mu Jan Andre coslov and schoi ziv it's Israel's biggest rescue operation of the war so far Netanyahu vowed to bring the remaining hostages home we're committed to getting the release of all the hostages and we expect Hamas to release them all but if they don't we'll do whatever it takes to get them all back home Israel released this footage which it says shows three hostages being freed the news to spark celebrations outside the hospital and was announced to beachgoers in Tel Aviv but in Gaza people are mourning the Dead the Hamas government media office says Israeli air strikes in central Gaza killed more than 200 people hundreds more are injured in the same area where the hostages were rescued hospitals are over overwhelmed a resident describes what she saw at the newsat refugee camp people were standing on the road thinking they're safe suddenly a jet struck them now they're dead children were on that

busy with venders customers and refugees Israel says it was targeting militant infrastructure the Palestinian Authority is calling for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council and as news off the rescue operation spread thousands of Israelis were out again on the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday demanding the government strike a deal to bring all the remaining hostages Home Police used water cannon to disperse the crowds families of hostages joined the weekly rally it's believed 120 people are still being held by Hamas the protesters also want early elections and the removal of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for more I'm now joined by Myra sonshine she's a senior analyst on Israel Palestine at the international crisis group an NGO focused on conflict resolution welcome to DW again uh Maria I wanted to get your reaction to the repeated mentions of Massacre we've had in this uh in what we have shown so far and also the fact that there are protests in Israel do you think Netanyahu will be criticized for a move that's widely being seen as a win for him I don't think Israelis are going to criticize the operation to free the four hostages uh I think Israelis are not focused as they have not been focused throughout this war on the Palestinian casualties but I obviously think that it's important to understand that many many Palestinians were killed and injured in this operation we don't know exactly how many we don't know how many Israel considers to be militants of those I I don't think It ultimately matters at this point the amount of Palestinians that have been killed throughout this 8-month war is far far far too high and the people who are living there in suffering is also needs to stop I do think that Israeli uh uh still after this rescue operation many of them understand that this is not how hostages are going to be freed and this is not the way that it that it should go that there has to be a hostage deal and so uh I'm I'm happy to see at least that Israelis largely this morning still believe that hostage deal is the best way and a ceas fire and a stop to the war at this point is the best way to get hostages free so that's definitely a clear indication of the domestic reaction but when you look at the international reaction and I Circle back to what uh uh Joseph Burell said do you think pressure on Netanyahu on that front will continue I think International pressure will continue and should continue on Netanyahu um but uh this in some ways gives Netanyahu a Lifeline um it you know Gans the war cabinet minister who is his political rival was supposed to leave the government today he was supposed to give a statement last night he has postpone that uh I have a feeling that he's not going to leave the government anytime soon uh that wouldn't necessarily uh destabilize the government but it would definitely give momentum um to some kind of change uh in the domestic political scene uh but but you know again it's very good news that four people have been freed But ultimately it doesn't change the dynamic it doesn't change the fact that the war has to come to an end a ceasefire has to come not just for the people of Gaza but also for because of what's happening on the on the Northern Israeli border with Lebanon because of what's happening in the West Bank I mean it's just uh you know just catastrophic everywhere and it needs to stop and speaking of that ceasefire and the demands for a hostage deal how do you think this opport ation impacts those ceasefire negotiations I think that's a really good question that nobody has a clear answer to I think Hamas obviously will understand from this that it needs to guard the hostages even better that it might feel um you know legitimacy to call an end to the hostage uh negotiations the ceasefire negotiations however you know the again the interest kind of remain the same if Hamas is interested in a in a ceasefire I think it will push as much as possible to appear to be going ahead with it but it has remained consistent that it needs to stop the war Biden has put all the cards on the table the International Community are all pushing Qatar is trying to pressure Hamas uh Netanyahu was under under extreme pressure so so That Remains the Same um the question is if you know if if people will continue to keep up the pressure specifically on Netanyahu um to to kind of basically say that the war has to stop which is something that he has refused to do because of his own uh political surv rival and interests um so it has yet to be seen if this rescue operation will change that much but I do think that it gives Israelis a false hope that somehow you know this isn't this doesn't need to stop immediately we can keep trying to get people out but then in the absence of such a hostage deil and of a ceasefire essentially do you expect more military operations like this in the future I'm sure that is really special uh units will continue to um collect a military intelligence and try their best to get people out I'm sure that's always the case uh but the bigger picture here is that Israel has not achieved its uh War goals its strategic um uh aspirations towards defeating Hamas towards getting all the hostages back it's you know and more and more military operations are not going to necessarily do that instead they're going to create more uh suffering and probably create even more generations of uh you know TR trauma on both sides sides so uh a continued War continued military operations are ultimately not going to serve the interests of either side M of Sunshine from the international crisis group thank you so much for your analysis thanks a lot DW Middle East analyst Shani ranus joins me in the studio for more shanii we saw those protest pictures while Netanyahu has seen this operation as a win there's still criticism where does he stand well that's a good question we will have to see I mean the support for the hostages I mean if there's anything that this operation yesterday have taught us about the Israelis that the the whole nation was in tears and of Joy so there's no doubt that the hostages as a cause is very prominent Israeli discourse and we've seen that yesterday also in the protest there's been more and more people coming to the streets knowing that the extraordinar of this operation is exactly what it is it just shows on the need for a different solution because it's not feasible for Israel to be releasing in such operations all 120 that are still kept in Gaza and they're very much afraid many of those families were confessing is so they're afraid for the for the safety of the well-beings knowing that Hamas must have changed operations as you know reaching conclusions following Israel's uh raid yesterday on nerat so that cause is still very much out there and it puts nanyo in a very precarious position because his base on the right sees this uh military operation as a proof that only more military pressure will help Israel but the more and more voices within Israeli consensus among the you know the public the white public are not there and this divide is where Netanyahu is now needing to decide whether he chooses the political narrow uh aspirations of his himself and his narrow right-wing base or is he going for a different move that might mean risking his political future and speaking of the impact of such a military operation we heard it being called Massacre by Joseph Bell and by several other people as well uh why was this operation so deadly well we need to keep in mind uh narat is a as a refugee camp is a very densely populated area it was already before October 7th definitely after the war has started and people had to flee from all parts of Gaza into that camp it's also considered to be a stronghold of Hamas they have lots of forces that a lot of militants and and the Israeli Army has not really systematically uh operated in that part until just the last two weeks now we know that was also part of preparing for this operation and the problem was the military forces had managed to sneak into the houses where the hostages were kept but on the way out they were already discovered and they had to find their Escape Routes and that included a lot of heavy uh fire exchange with local militants of Hamas and uh needing is Israeli forces to have back up from the air and let's keep in mind first and foremost the fact that Israel has chose to make this operation give it a go despite the fact it took place in broad daylight on a Saturday next to a very crowded uh Marketplace that means that Israel must have known this could happen nonetheless they still went along with it they want to send a clear message here first internally to the Israeli population saying we will do whatever it takes and we will put you know nothing will stop us and they also wanted to send a message to Hamas and the Palestinians because Israelis feel that you know they think um Hamas think that they have become weak that the Israeli military is not really creative enough not daring enough not really bringing any results and they wanted to tell Hamas we got you you know we we still have our Edge we have intelligence we have the ability um and that was a clear message that they sent unfortunately on the backs of so many miserable Palestinians who were you know found themselves in the most terrible conditions just um you know losing their lives in such such a tragedy uh was unfolding yeah but speaking of the clear message there's one to the Israelis there's one to Hamas but it also seems to be one to the International Community that's pressuring Israel to back off from such aggressive actions we saw the consequences the death stole that you were just talking about we also know Anthony Lincoln is heading there to talk about the ceasefire deal how does this impact that that's the key question how has uh yesterday's events in nerat how will they affect the deal the hostage deal which also is not just about the hostages it's about a ceasefire it's about normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia bringing new you know moderate forces Arab Force into the into the region a new defense pack for the region with the Americans of course still on the table and lincol is very much determined to bring it he will come to Israel it will be his eighth visit for the last8 months so pretty much every month he's there he will go to Israel to Egypt and katar of course the the mediators that have a very vital role in this whole operation and the Jordan um there will be an a humanitarian Aid uh conference that he will be participating and we see that also it's it's an important part of the American agenda to maintain the flow of Aid into Gaza the peer the American that was built not far from narat actually uh was relaunched yesterday and it also was a a source for Rumors in the social media maybe the Americans have helped the Israelis because of The Coincidence of the uh two things you know colliding the operation and the reopening of that peer the Americans reject any suggestion that they have helped Israel in the operation yesterday right DW Shan ranas thank you so much for unpacking that for us you're welcome
