the United States says that three members of its armed forces have been killed and dozens more wounded in a drone attack near a base on Jordan's border with Syria us officials say that the Drone struck near a Barracks at the base in the rupan re region it is the first time that a strike has killed American soldiers in the area since the start of the Israel Hamas War US President Joe Biden blamed iran-backed militants for the attack and has bowed to respond Iran denies any involvement resistance groups in the region do not take orders from the Islamic Republic of Iran with regard to their decision making or actions while Iran does not welcome the development of conflict in the region it does not interfere with the resistance group's decisions on how to support the Palestinian Nation or defend themselves and their people against any aggression or occupation and for more on that let's bring in Middle East analyst Daniel gerla he joins us he's editor-in chief of the magazine Zenith which focuses on the Arab and the Islamic World welcome to the program and thank you so much for joining us I mean we just heard there that statement from Iran seeming to try to distance themselves from this strike um I'd like to ask you financing aside do you think that Tyron is strategically involved in strikes like the one on US troops in Jordan what did you make of the statement well I think uh Iran is involved in structuring and motivating this uh Alliance this plethora of militias mostly Shia oriented militias in the region however I think uh these groups also work uh at their own behest and have their own timetable and uh I think that is also the the plausible deniability for the Iranians is also essential here so this is more it's a financial is a logistic it's an ideological support but um as we have seen in the past I don't not think that Iran is coordinating every individual strike it's not in the Strategic interest of the Iranians to do that um and they see how that these groups and these militias also operate independently but actually contribute to the overall uh deterrence of Iran in the region however what happened now is um the killing of three uh US service members which uh probably did not go according to plan because before these militias made actually sure that they would inflict harm and that they would uh provoke the Americans but make sure that they wouldn't cross a certain red line and the killing of US servicemen is certainly a red line that the Americans need to respond and that's uh that puts also Iran on the spot and now there are reports that iran-backed fighters in East Syria have started evacuating their posts in anticipation of a US Counter Strike do you expect Washington to launch air strikes there what sort of us response could be anticipated well you know the the the fighting the shadow war that is going on between uh the United States and its allies and these Iran back militias in the region is very complex and it's happening on M on on various fronts it happens in Syria on the Syrian Jordanian border specifically that triangle of rubban between Iraq Syria and Jordan happens in Iraq and in other places I've just returned from Baghdad and last week uh they while I was in Baghdad there was a a US strike on a uh Shia militia group southeast of Baghdad in the place called Jor sakar which killed several uh alleged militia men and uh I think this attack could be seen as a response uh to that us attack which itself was a response to an attack on the an Assad Air Base in uh in in in Iraq so this conflict escalates on various fronts in various countries and it's very difficult for the respective governments of these countries to stay out of it they don't want to be drawn into this certainly not Iraq certainly not Jordan but we have seen a number of Border incidents and it's so far it seemed like most of the most of the fighting is happening in Syria itself on Sy Syrian territory but it can happen elsewhere too as we see and it's interesting because we've seen since hamas's Terror attacks on October 7th and Israel's response in Gaza the vast majority of world leaders and diplomats have stressed the importance of preventing a wider Regional escalation as you've highlighted there would you say this has been a failure are are mistakes being made a lot of mistakes are being made but um but the fact that you want to prevent a major regional escalation uh doesn't mean that that you would not act uh in self-defense or in response to to some of those attacks so the logic is on the one hand all sides want to prevent a major regional escalation on the other hand they do Tit for Tat whenever they're being attacked they want to strike back and these like retribution strikes uh major harm can happen and this can lead to another escalation so whereas many parties in the region not all of them by the way want to avoid a regional escalation the regional escalation is happening and this is unfortunately the logic of deterrence and of Retribution that we have been seeing for a long time for America and Iran this can result in a major problem because at one point uh they would either have to engage in really meaningful diplomatic negotiations how to prevent this from happening or uh we would see this being taken to another level soon you mentioned this multiple strikes and and responses um and I'd like to know how you see the strike now in Jordan does this drone strike mean another front has now opened up in the already volatile mid Middle East or do you expect that this um could potentially be a oneoff that can be contained no the the the front already exists and not with regard to Jordan but mainly with regard to Syria and to Iraq where these militias operate uh in the case of Iraq against the will will of the government in the case of Syria with a certain like consent and support of the government uh but uh this place where the strike happens is a strategically very important place it's in the Eastern Bia like this the southern desert of Syria as I mentioned before a triangle between Iraq Jordan and Syria and the Americans had been there initially to fight uh Islamic State militants so-call dases from this area and it's become some sort of a No Man's Land because the Americans are there and of course nobody should move any closer to the base without taking the RIS R of being attacked then you have these groups that are saying they're fighting American occupation of Syrian territory um actually it's a no man's land with many refugees people that are being uh left alone with little to no humanitarian support but nobody wants to move out of this region either so uh I don't think it's a new front I think it's but it's an it's a strategically important place that one should U you know be careful to contain some really important context there Middle East expert Daniel gerlock thank you so much for that analysis and sharing your expert we appreciate it thank
