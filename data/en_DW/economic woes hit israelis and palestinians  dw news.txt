life is a struggle for Palestinian Benders in the old city of East Jerusalem the Gaza war broke out at the start of the key travel season scaring off tourists and pilgrims completely they won't be back for a long time food guide and Chef Iselin bukari only has me to show around so uh I have a bit of work but it's goingn to be more than 10% of what they used to more locals are out and about today there are no of the deadly military raids and unrest that have surged here and throughout the Israeli occupied West Bank the few little jobs that iseline can find are now less profitable and more challenging in his line of work is it difficult at the moment to um get your hands on the the produce you need because of the War uh yeah there is a shortage of vegetables uh grains uh Rices are going up he says the state aid only goes so far tourism was a key employer here along with Agriculture and construction for which more than 150,000 Palestinians from the West Bank entered Israel daily most of them have been banned since the hummus Terror attacks unemployment is soared strangling the West Bank economy sparking further turmoil and creating a supply shock for the Israeli economy many building projects have come to a standstill Israel has been looking at flying in tens of thousands of replacement workers from mainly Asian Nations there's been a rush to sign up in poorer places like parts of India despite the dangers of coming to a country at War it's also sparked a domestic debate about the morals of taking Palestinian jobs Arafat sharabati has been out of work since the October 7th attack the Palestinian Taxi driver and father of three says he doesn't want to have to be a burden on his family the situation is so difficult my children are helping me with the costs of living I have children who are married and working and supporting me at the same time he used to drive the 45 minutes between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem several times a day or to cities in the West Bank but says the heightened security there has made what used to be a 1-hour return trip unbearable so if I want to drive to the West Bank and back given the circumstances the checkpoints and the constant blockades it's likely to take an entire day for just one trip to rala so in the current situation it's not at all profitable and as we discover Arafat can't get into certain parts of East Jerusalem at all that shuts off another potential source of income the street has been closed on a daily basis you used to be able to continue on from here but the old city is permanently closed the area around alaka mosque is closed they keep everyone from entering the situation is extremely difficult it's not easy the Israeli government has been talking about extending entry restrictions to the area around the sacred mosque across the holy month of Ramadan that's causing even more tensions Palestinian figures accuse the ultra religious far-right Coalition of provoking Muslims and prolonging the war but can Israel afford an even longer and even more expensive military campaign the state is borrowing heavily it's on track to run one of its widest budget deficits this Century the ratings agency Moody's has lowered Israel's creditworthiness for the first time prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the rating will go back up as soon as we win the war and we will win the mood among the Israeli public isn't as optimistic especially among the families of hostages who've been held captive in Gaza for close to 140 days and the relatives of Fallen Soldiers of past conflicts and this one never ever so many people have died in Israel in one war and this is one government that is in charge for this and they're not taking any responsibility for what happened and it's [Music] unbelievable as the frustration grows so too the crowds at weekly political protests on habima Square in Tel Aviv but opinions are divided I'm sure that none of the people around here are aware or even care about what what actually happens in Gaza and I wish for sanctions uh uh for israels would would sanctions be the only way to actually get this war to stop I think so yeah when people when the Israelis will start to feel distressed that's might change their uh um opinions or at least their behavior why do you want to hurt the people here it's not hard enough we we have we have it good here we don't have it good here hurt hurt the government don't hurt the people why would you do that the fact that you that we actually blame netan for all this is an absurd because Israelis do not want to look at themselves they they love the fact that they can EX blame n for everything you know it's it's beautiful they CH shame on you as the protest begins to wind up some head down the road to an even bigger rally at hostage Square in support of captives families we head to Kaplan Street outside military headquarters where a much louder anti-government protest has been growing every Saturday from a handful of people to a 1,000 strong Crow Crow the battle lines are drawn between the demonstrators and police emotions are running High police are now moving in some of them on Horseback to subdue the protesters things are reaching Tipping Point here in Tel [Applause] AV they're taking away one protester after the next several arrests are made again tonight some people are fined for blocking roads or disturbing the peace this was a nation in shock just four months ago they were dealing with the trauma of October 7 they were dealing with a war against Hamas now their Fury is pointed directly at the Israeli government Netanyahu has criticized many of the protests as useless and contributing to the demands of Hamas these guys want the prime minister to resign with all the polls 80% of Israelis do not have faith in nanal we need to bring our hostages back we need to end this conflict and we need to protect our people our country our economy with elections for many many many years Israel has been shown to be a very strong startup nation everyone is looking for Israel for our Tech talent and this has not changed however however it is very clear to us that this ongoing this ongoing um situation of War cannot cannot persist and at the end of the day one of the things that alarm me is that my prime minister is not incentivized to end this some investors are pulling out of Israel credit ratings agency Moody's is worried about the political and fiscal risks forecast a negative economic Outlook I think tensions you know every workplace has in be chesh in central Israel Danny Shapiro says the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust saw him close the family business initially beer consumption went down really fast cuz you know those are one of the first things that are that that get hit so our production went down I'd say over 80% instead of laying off staff he found work for them on farms in the South near Gaza otherwise manned by Foreign laborers who'd fled we helped them pick mangoes and pineapples and fayas we donated uh work our Working Hands uh when we were done so we uh we bought part of that and we actually made a beer from it the amount of of positive responses to any initiative was really uh overwhelming and people like they they want to help so they uh so so people were buying the beer even before the beer was ready consumer confidence has returned Israelis are leaving their homes again they're shopping returning to bars and restaurants the economy could grow this year and rebound next year if the conflict is contained to Gaza I can't bear life right now witnessing what's happening on the news every day what's happening in Gaza the situation is critical and it makes one psychologically uncomfortable what I long for most is an end to this war for the poor people of Gaza they've witnessed horrific and unimaginable scenes finding Works taking a back seat for iseline as he tries to get the family he has in Gaza out we were able uh for my sister to get her out about 2 months ago from as so she's now with us in Jerusalem but uh we're trying to get the rest of family members and her husband uh and that's definitely a challenge uh how many relatives have you lost so far uh we lost uh more than seven uh relatives uh my aunt and her kids uh and her children uh her grandchildren uh which is basically was a 3 one member in one uh air strike of her family and the family of her husband what is isine is critical of the Israeli government but still has reason for hope we can see uh that what is happening here uh in this country uh and the policies is not pushing to anywhere but I feel the push of the International Community will make uh pressure for some things to happen really good seeing you again see again take care but if the war drags on economists warn of huge damage to both the Palestinian and Israeli
