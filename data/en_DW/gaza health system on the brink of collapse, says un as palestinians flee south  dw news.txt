Israel says it will allow safe passage for civilians in Northern Gaza after it urged them to leave ahead of an expected ground offensive Israeli officials said two main roads would allow people to escape safely until 400 p.m. local time this comes after Israel's military on Friday said infantry and tank units entered Gaza to track down rocket Crews destroy weapons and search for hostages it says it found and repatriated the bodies of some missing Israelis well Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas for its attacks a week ago that killed more than a thousand Israelis it is expected to carry out a major offensive in Gaza the UN is warning of a humanitarian disaster another night lit up by explosions Israel's military earlier ordered more than a million people living in the north of Gaza to move to the South they were given 24 hours to clear the area we've told people they need to evacuate we expect them to evacuate we are operating to restore Safety and Security to the people of Israel but the UN says it's impossible for everyone to follow the order moving more than 1 million people across a densely populated war zone to a place with no food water or accommodation when the entire territory is under siege is extremely dangerous and in some cases simply not possible hundreds of families head south in cars and trucks while Israeli air strikes level buildings they fear nowhere is safe caught between staying in their homes under bombardment or risking the dangerous road Journey enough suffering and killing we wake up to death under the bombs we don't know where to go where is safe with Gaza under the heaviest Israeli bombardment it has ever seen hospitals are overwhelmed Israel is unrepentant we are striking our enemies with an unprecedented power I emphasize it's just the beginning our enemies have just begun to pay the price I can't divulge what comes next but I can tell you it's just the beginning gaza's humanitarian crisis is deepening by the day as well as the air strikes Israel is blockading food and water fuel and power RS groups are calling for a secure Corridor to bring in desperately needed supplies let's get across to our correspondent Tanya Kramer on Israel's border with Gaza uh reporting live Tanya with Israel having ordered more than a million people in Northern Gaza to flee South the IDF now saying it will allow safe movement for Gins on two main roads until 400 p.m. local time uh is there a sense that a fullscale ground offensive is imminent after that window ends well this is of course a big question but I don't think they will tell us you know when they exactly move in there will still be this moment of a surprise but I mean what they're trying to do now what they've been saying since yesterday is to call on the people in Northern Gaza which includes Gaza City the heart of Gaza where over 1 million people are in this area you to move down south they said that they have these two main roads that are usually the main roads when you are in Gaza you travel from the north to the South that people should take those these are some kind of safe corridors to travel uh to the center of Gaza or to the South uh this is at the moment uh what they're telling people there to move because as uh one of um the army people there said they will hit hard and they're calling on people to move but it's very very difficult we're hearing also from the you know humanitarian side I mean it's not so easy for people just uh to move South uh in in in in in this moment yeah huge concerns from the UN and from International Aid groups there about a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza what can you tell us about the conditions inside Gaza right now well I mean I managed to talk uh to very few people it's very difficult with the communication and you know some of them are actually moving from place to place in the past days looking for a safe space I mean those people have moved now to the center but there are many many others they can't I mean if you look at elderly people or so or if you don't have a car or something you know what what do you do I mean it's it's just uh the the situation has a lot of confusion Fusion what to do I mean we're hearing from the humanitarian organizations how dire the situation is uh also you have to understand you know the electricity uh at least the the electricity that comes from Israel was cut off um that has also consequences of course then the main power plant because no fuel is coming in has cut off so there's mainly at least for the civilian population uh there are all these problems that have the hospitals of course then have problems for their generators the water pumps have problems so I mean all of this together but I think the main issue right now for people in in these areas and also in the South there have been still air strikes so is to to find some kind of safe space but there is basically no safe Zone in Gaza you're basically trapped in there and I think this is uh psychologically also it's it's a very difficult situation from what I'm hearing there uh from from people absolutely uh tell us a little bit more about military operations um on Friday we know the Israeli Army said it had conducted raids into Gaza um both battling militants there and also looking out for information about hostages what can you tell us about what the current situation is like at the border well we're here near the Gaza border and we've been to areas where you know there's a buildup of Tanks of the um uh infantry mainly here um I mean at the moment they're not moving I think they're waiting now for the next step for for their orders uh to what comes next of course you have still uh we had also rocket barges coming out in the past half an hour or so from Gaza of course there's also the Navy around Gaza and the Mediterranean uh you have the artillery from here the air strikes on Gaza so the war is going on um and of course everybody's waiting now to see what happens after this uh 4:00 deadline might it be a bit flexible uh what will happen next uh we don't know we just have to to see what the next hours here will bring and we will be keeping you posted here on DW thank you so much Tanya for your reporting that is our correspondent Tanya Kramer near the border with Gaza and I'd like to now bring in Shaya loow with the Norwegian Refugee Council warm welcome thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us I understand that your organization has people who've been working in Gaza can you tell us what they're seeing in terms of the humanitarian situation there so we have 52 Palestinian staff who are from and live and work in Gaza uh I mean the stories that they are telling us of what they are experiencing what they are seeing we have no capacity right now to even be able to to uh give a humanit provide a humanitarian response because our staff needs to focus on themselves getting to safety we've heard stories from staff about challenges after this uh order to to flee to the south in finding uh Vehicles fuel in order to make that way some of our staff are are trying to get to the southern part of Gaza just by on foot uh the situation is dire there's no electricity there except for what people can muster from either The Limited Fuel That Remains for generators or solar panels connectivity is difficult in terms of people communicating each day it seems that our ability to even do something as simple as a headcount to make sure that our staff are okay is becoming more and more difficult because the situation is so dire with Israel's total blockade uh total Siege on the Gaza Strip as your correspondent mentioned preventing fuel uh electricity food and water from entering and then of course uh the announcement from Thursday night at midnight calling on all residents of Northern Gaza to to flee to the South that must be terrifying so you have your own people working for you fleeing for their lives unable to really administer Aid to others who need it are you aware of other organizations who have been able to um help Supply Aid there right now while it's most needed I know that the UN is continuing to provide as much support as it can and other organizations that are involved in uh emergency response like Doctors Without Borders but I think most of the humanitarian sector right now we're Frozen because we we cannot ask our staff to be responding to a crisis when they themselves are are victims of that crisis and need to focus on getting their family uh to safety yeah now the Norwegian Refugee Council as Secretary General we should say um has demanded a reversal to the Israeli military's demand that more than a million civilians relocate from the north to the south of Gaza can you tell us a little bit more about what is in this demand and really more about what is at stake here uh if this is not heated I mean it's impossible for pales alans from for 1.1 million Palestinians from the north to flee to the South there are not facilities able to accommodate that number of people moving quickly Northern Gaza was really the the center of Economic and Commercial life um and where the majority of people in Gaza live and and there just aren't facilities available additionally we've heard uh reports of of Palestinians who were trying to flee to the South being killed uh while trying to escape to the South um and on top of that there are no assurances that when people do flee to the South uh that they that they will be protected that these will be safe zones that won't be targeted and so we need assurances that if people are going to be evacuated that it needs to be done in a way in which uh transport can be arranged and accommodated that doesn't cause Widespread Panic and chaos and that allows for for one the accommod ation of of the influx of people but also assurances that once hostilities end that those people are able to return to their homes thank you so much Shaya we really appreciate it that is Shaya low from the Norwegian Refugee Council thank you Israel has called up some 360,000 reservists and mass troops and tanks along the border with Gaza Gaza has been under siege in a mere constant ground and air bombardment Israel say says a senior Hamas military commander has been killed in the air strikes as we've heard Israel believed to be planning a major ground offensive although no such decision has yet been announced I'd like to turn to the Strategic implications of war as Israel appears to be readying that ground offensive in Gaza for more we can speak to marinaa [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a war studies researcher at kings's College London Marina good to see you let's let's start on the ground in terms of military strategy what does Israel need to consider as it's preparing a massive offensive against Hamas good day Claire well first of all we have seen that there have been raids in order to prepares a military operation and to neutralize as many Hamas Fighters as um the Israeli military can at the stage and they have also tried to resolve the hostage situation which of course complicates the whole Endeavor uh what is needed essentially and and this is a very complex operation because if the ground operation is to take place on on the operational and tactical level what the Israeli military will need is first of all good intelligence because as they move from the Sandy Countryside into the urban areas it will be very difficult to track down the fighters and because they are very well Ed Hamas is very well entrenched and they have been preparing for this and we have seen that past um operations have resulted in somewhat mixed outcomes so these Urban operations because Hamas is prepared for it and because there are civilians um also in these areas the Israeli military will have to know exactly which location they have to Target so it will be very slow and very bloody and very difficult to use use um military force or kinetic force discriminately in order not to create a backlash amongst the population because for every adversary that is being killed if there is population being killed as well this could essentially aside from the humanitarian and ethical considerations push the neutral Palestinian population to embrace Hamas and to become an adversary so that is the biggest problem and and that's why um Precision needs to be taking into account as well as as I said good intelligence um command and control and of course uh from the political side there needs to be an understanding how this military operation will wrap up and what will happen after that in terms of um reinstating the rule of law in the territory and whether Israel is ready to commit um a lot of political and um monetary assets to Palestine uh to to the Gaza section in order to govern there or how this is going to be resolved this is unclear yeah what do you think the wider implications are of a major war between Israel and Hamas How concerned are you about spillover or a much wider conflict well um on the one hand we have factions that are supporting Hamas such as Hezbollah and Hezbollah has already voiced that it it will not shy away from entering the war should Israel start its ground operation its incursion into Gaza so that is the first concern that the that another front on the Lebanese border might open which would be very problematic for Israel another problem is the fact that um the presence of the US and and to a lesser extent of the UK could also potentially lead to escalation so the idea was um this military presence would uh serve a as a deterrent um in order to prevent groups like hollah from joining the war that being said um the escalation can take place not just um because Hamas Hezbollah will do something but there can also be misinterpretation bad intelligence which could accidentally lead to escalation and potentially draw the us into this war and of course we have the Arab countries Saudi Arabia and Qatar we have Iran and Syria so all those Regional players will also be Pro most likely supporting um Gaza and Hamas because of the regional makeup so we are risking a very big war that goes well beyond um Gaza and we have disturbances in Syria and Iraq so it it might turn into a huge war in the Middle East yeah as you say plenty of room for error and such high stakes uh Marina thank you for taking the time to speak with us that's Marina Moran War studies researcher at Kings College London thanks for having
