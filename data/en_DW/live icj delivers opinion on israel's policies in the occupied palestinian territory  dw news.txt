seated the sitting is open the court meets today pursuant to article 67 of the statute to deliver its advisory opinion on the request submitted by the general assembly of the United Nations on the question of the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory including Jerusalem the questions on which the advisory opinion of the court has been requested are set for report is resolution 77 bar 247 adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 30 2022 by a letter dated 17 January 2023 and received by the registry on January 19th 2023 the Secretary General of the United Nations officially communicated to the court the dec the decision taken by the general assembly to submit these questions for an advisory opinion paragraph 18 of the resolution reads as follow as follows and I quote the general assembly decides in accordance with article 96 of the charter of the United Nations to request the international court of justice pursuant to article 65 of the statute of the court to render an advisor opin opinion on the following questions considering the rules and principles of international law including the charter of the United Nations International humanitarian law international human rights law relevant resolutions of the security Council the general assembly and the Human Rights Council and the advisory opinion of the court of July 9 2004 a what are the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination from its prolonged occupation settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 including measures aimed at altering the demographic composition character and status of the holy city of Jerusalem and from its adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures B how do the policies and practices of Israel referred to in paragraph 18 a affect the legal status of the occupation and what are the legal consequences that arise for all states and United Nations from this status and of quote in accordance with usual practice I shall not read out the introductory paragraphs of the opinion will set out the main elements of the procedural history or the proceedings I shall also omit or summarize some of the other paragraphs of the opinion I shall accordingly begin reading The Advisory opinion at paragraph 22 the full text of the opinion will of course be available at the close of the sitting when seized with the request for the advisor opinion the court must first consider whether it has jurisdiction to give the opinion requested and if so whether there is any reason why the court should in the exercise of its discretion decline to answer the request the court must satisfy itself in accordance with the requirement of article 96 of the charter and article 65 of its statute that the question on which it's required to give its opinion is a legal question in the present proceedings the general assembly put two questions to the court these questions relate first to the legal consequences arising from certain policies and practices of Israel as an occupying power in a situation of belligerent occupation since 1967 secondly they relate to how such policies and practices affect the legal status of the occupation in l of certain rules and principle of international law and to the legal consequences which arise from the status the court considers that these questions are legal questions in light of the above the court concludes that the request has been made in accordance with the provisions of the charter and of the statute of the court and therefore that it has jurisdiction to render the requested opinion the fact that the court has jurisdiction to give an advisory opinion does not mean that it is obliged to exercise it however only compelling reasons may lead the court to refuse to give its opinion in response to a request falling within its jurisdiction some participants in the present proceedings have argued that there are compelling reasons for the court to decline to give its opinion as to the argument that the request raised to a dispute between two parties one of which has not consented to the jurisdiction of the Court the court considers that the subject matter of the request is not only a bilateral matter between Israel and Palestine but it is of particular interest and concern to the United Nations and that giving the opinion requested does not have effect of circumventing the principle of consent to judicial settlement as to the argument that the Court's opinion would not assist the general assembly in the performance of its functions the court considers that it cannot substitute its own assessment of the need for such an opinion with that of the organ requesting it as to the argument that the opinion of the Court would have an adverse effect on the negotiation framework the court considers that it is a matter of conjecture on which the court should not speculate as to the argument that the court does not have sufficient information to enable it to give an advisor opinion the court considers that it has before it sufficient information to decide legal questions any a matter any a manner consistent with its judicial function as to the argument that the questions are formulated in a biased manner the court does not consider that the general assembly intended to restrict the Court's freedom to determine these issues the court will assertain for itself whether Israel's policies and practices are in violation of the applicable rules and principles of international law before determining the legal consequences of any such violations having examined each of these arguments in turn the court concludes that there are no compelling reasons for it to decline to give the opinion requested by the general assembly the court then records the general context of the case before turning to the scope and meaning of the questions posed by the general assembly in this regard the court notes that the questions Define the material Territorial and temporal scope of the Court's inquiry with regard to the material scope questions a identifies three types conduct which question B describes as policies and practices of Israel first the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination second Israel's prolonged occupation settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since Jerusalem third Israel's adoption of measures the specific scope of each of these policies and practices is determined later as the court examined them in turn before turning to that examination the court limits itself to observing a feature common to all of them namely that the term of question that the terms of question a assume that these policies and practices are contrary to international law by virtue of its judicial function however the course must itself determin the lawfulness of the policies and practices identified by the general assembly in the present case the court considered that question a required an assessment of the Conformity with international law of those polies and practices of Israel identified in the request the court considers that in its request the general assembly has not sought from the court a detail factual determination of Israel's policies and practices therefore in order to give an advisor opinion in this case it's not necessary for the court to make findings of fact with regard to specific incidents allegedly in violation of international law the court need only establish the main features of Israel policies and practices and on that basis assess the conf formity of these policies and practices with international law in terms of its teritorial scope question a refers to and I quote the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 unquote which encompasses the West Bank East Jerusalem and the gasa strip the court notes that the various United Nations organs and bodies frequently make specific reference to the different parts of the occupied Palestinian territory the court also does so in the present adviser opinion as appropriate however the court recalls that from a legal standpoint the occupied Palestinian territory constitutes a single territorial unit uh uh unit the unity contiguity and integrity of which is to be preserved and respected thus all references in this opinion to the occupied Palestinian territory are references to a single territorial unit the court further observes that the question mentions measures pertaining to the holy city of Jerusalem the ordinary meaning of this term is ambiguous and may be subject to multiple interpretations but the context provides useful clarification in the present case in light of this context the quote is of you that the question posed by the general assembly relating to the holy city of Jerusalem is confined to measures taken by Israel in East Jerusalem in terms of its temporal scope question a requests the court to take account of measures adopted by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory since 1967 however the court is not precluded from having regard to facts predating the occupation to the extent that this is necessary for the proper discharge of its judicial function the court notes that the request for an advisor opinion was adopted by the general assembly on 2022 and as the court to address Israel's I quote ongoing or I quote again continuing practices thus the court is of the view that the policies and practices contemplated by the request of the general assembly do not include conduct by Israel in the Gaza Strip in response to the attack carried out against it by Hamas and other armed group on October 7 2023 question B has two parts the first part request the court to assess how the policies and practic of Israel identified by the general assembly affect the legal status of the occupation the court observed that the use of the verb effect points to the possibility that such policies and practices may bring about changes to the legal status however the scope of the first part of the question depends upon the meaning of the expression legal status occupation in the overall context of question B in the present context the court is of the view that the first part of question B calls on the court to ascertain the manner in which Israel's policies and practices affect the legal status of the occupation and thereby the legality of the continued presence of Israel as an occupying power in the occupied Palestinian territory the cult observed that both question a and the second part of question B call upon it to determine the legal consequences arising respectively from Israel's policies and practices and from its continued presence as an Palestinian territory if and to the extent that the court finds that any of Israel's policies and practices or its continued presence in the occupied palestin ter Palestinian territory are contrary to international law the court indicates that it will examine the legal consequences following from such findings for Israel for other states and for the United Nations having Define the scope and meaning of the questions posed by the general assembly the court must determine the applicable law the applicability of certain rules of international law in the territory concern depends on the status of that territory under international law the court first seeks to assertain the status of the occupied Palestinian territory under international law and then determines which rules of international law are relevant for answering the questions posed to it by assembly the question posed by the general assembly are premised on the assumption that the occupied Palestinian territory is occupied by Israel in its 2004 advisor opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of a wall in the occupied Palestinian territory the court set out the circumstances under which a state of occupation is established the court observed that in the 1967 armed conflict Israel occupied the territories situated between the green line and the former eastern boundary of Palestine under the British mandate namely the West Bank and East Jerusalem the court affirmed that subsequent events had not altered the status of the territories in questions as occupied territories nor Israel's status as occupying power in its SW advisor opinion the court did not express a view as to the legal status of the Gaza Strip and the construction of the wall did not affect the Gaza Strip the Gaza Strip is an integral part of the territory that was occupied by Israel 1967 following the 1967 armed conflict Israel as the occupying power placed the Gaza Strip under its effective control control however in 2004 Israel announced this engagement plan according that plan Israel was to withdraw its military presence from the Gaza Strip and from several areas in the northern part of the West Bank by 2005 Israel had completed the withdrawal of its Army and the removal of the settlements in the Gaza Strip the court notes that the for the purpose of determining whether a territory remains occupied under international law the decisive Criterion is not whether the occupying power retained its physical military presence in the territory at all times but rather whether its Authority has been established and can be exercised based on the information before the court it considers that Israel remained capable of exercising and continued to exercise certain key elements of authority over the Gaza Strip including control of the land sea and air borders restrictions on the movement of people and goods collection of import of Import and Export taxes and Military control over the buffer zone despite the withdrawal of its military presence in 2005 this is even more so since o October 7 2023 in light of the above the code is of the view that Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip has not entirely released it of its obligations under the law of occupation Israel's obligations have remained commensurate with the degree of its effective control over the Gaza Strip the court then turn to the rules and principles that are relevant for answering the questions put to it these include the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by threat or use of force and the right of people to self-determination which are enshrined in the charter of the United Nations and also form part of customary law further International humanitarian law is of particular relevance Israel's powers and duties in the occupied inan territory are governed by the Geneva Convention relative to the protection of Civilian persons in time of War of August 12th 1949 to which I shall refer as the Fourth Geneva Convention which is applicable in the occupied Palestinian territory and by customary international law pursuing to article 154 of the Fourth Geneva Convention that convention is suppl m to the rules contained in sections 2 and three of the heg regulations respecting the laws and customs of for and on land Ann next to that Convention as the court has observed in its Juris Prudence The he regulations have become part of customary international law and they are thus binding on Israel as regards international human rights law the court observed that is Isel is party to several legal instruments containing human rights obligations including the International Convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination of 21 December 1965 to which I shall refer to as SD the international Covenant on economic social and cultur R of 16 December 1966 to which I shall refer to as the I CCR and the international Covenant on civil and political rights of 19 December 1966 to which I refer to as iccp the court records that international human rights instruments are applicable in respect to acts done by a state in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory particularly in occupied territories the court further recalls that the protection offered by Human Rights Convention does not cease in the case of armed conflict or of occupation some rights may be may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law others may be exclusively matters of human rights law yet Others May Concern both these branches of international law referring to its SW advisor opinion the court observes that Israel remains Bound by the icpr and the ICC in respect of its conduct with regard to the occupied Palestinian territory in relation to third the court knows that the convention contains no provision expressly restricting its territorial application on the contrary sever several of its Provisions impose obligations on state parties that are applicable in territories under their jurisdiction or in relation to individuals within their jurisdiction this indicat that third is also applicable to conduct of a state party which has effects Beyond its territory in the court view Israel must comply with its obligations under ser in circumstances in which it exercises its jurisdiction outside its territory as several participants in the present proceedings expressed diverging views regarding the relevance of the Accord signed in 1993 and 1995 by Israel and the Palestine Liber Liberation Organization also known as the Oslo Accords the court turns to those agreements the parties to the Osa Accord agreed to and I quote exercise their powers and responsibility pursuing to the Accords with due regard to internationally accepted norms and principles of Human Rights and the rule of law and of Court the court records that in considered in its whole opinion that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people recognized in the Oslo Accords includes the right to self determination the court observed that in interpreting the osto Accords it's necessary to take into account article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which provides that the protected population shall not be deprived of the benefits of convention and I quote by any agreement concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the occupying power and of course for all these reasons the court considers that these Accords cannot be understood to detract from Israel's obligations under the pertinent rules of international law applicable in the occupied Palestinian territory the court then assesses the Conformity of Israel's policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territory as identified in question a with its obligations under international law in particular the Court's analysis examines in turn the question of the prolonged occupation Israel's policy of settlement the annexation of the Palestinian territory occupi since 1967 and its adoption of related legislation and measures that are Ely discriminatory the court appraises whether and if so how Israel policies and practices affect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination after those other questions have been consider with regard to the question of prolonged occupation the court notes that question a concerns in part the legal consequences arising from Israel's again quote unquote prolonged occupation of the occupied Palestinian territory in this regard the court note that Israel occupation has lasted for more than 57 years in order to answer this aspect of the question the court must turn to the relationship between Israel as the occupying power and the protected population of the occupied territory which is governed by the law occupation by virtue of its status as an occupying power a States assumes a set of powers and duties with respect to the territory over which it exercis effective control in this context the occupying power Bears a duty to administer the territory for the benefit of the local population the nature and scope of these powers and Duties are always premised on the same assumption that occupation is a temporary situation to respond to military necessity and it cannot transfer title of sovereignty to the occupying power the fact that an occupation is prolonged does not in itself change the legal status under International humanitarian law although premise on the temporary character of the occupation the law of occupation does not set temporary limits that would as such alter the legal status of the occupation instead the legality of the occupying Powers presence in the occupied territory must be assessed in light of other rules in particular occupations consist exercise by a state of effective control in foreign territory in order to be permissible therefore such exercise of effective control must at all times be consistent with the rules concerning the prohibition of the threat or use of force including the prohibition of territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force as well as with the right of to self-determination therefore the fact that an occupation is prolonged may have a bearing on the justification under international law of the occupying Po's continued presence in the occupied territory it is against this background that Israel's policies and practices as well as its continuing presence in the occupied Palestinian territory must be examined the court now turned to these policies and practices beginning with Israel's settlement policy question a posed by the general assembly inquires in part about the settlement policy the court considered in this regard that the distinction that is sometimes made between settlements and outposts is immaterial for the purpose of ascertaining whether the communities in question form part of Israel's settlement policy what matters is whether they are established or maintained with Israel's support the court further notes that between 1967 and 2005 Israel settlement policy was carried out in the West Bank e Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip since the removal of Israel settlement from the Gaza trip in 2005 Israel settlement policy has continued in the West Bank and East Jerusalem the court therefore limits its analysis to Israel's ongoing settlement policy in the West Bank and East Jerusalem at the same time the court observes that Israel settlement policy carried out in the Gaza Strip until 2005 was not substantially different from the policy that continues in the West Bank and East Jerusalem today in its small advisory opinion the court found that Israel settlement policy was in breach of the sixth paragraph of article 49 of the four Geneva Convention which provide that I quote the occupying power shall not Deport or transfer part of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies end of court in the court view there is nothing in the term or the context of the provision or in the object and purpose of the drafting history of the for Geneva Convention to suggest that that provision prohibits only the forcable transfer of parts of the occupying power civilian population into occupied territory in the present case there is extensive evidence of Israel's policy of providing incentives for the relocation of Israeli individuals and businesses into the West Bank as well as for its industrial and Agricultural Development by settlers there is also evidence that Israel regularly legalizes outposts that have been established in contravention of domestic Israeli legislation and that Israel's construction of settlements is accompanied by special designed civilian infrastructure in the West Bank and East Jerusalem which integrate the settlement into the territory of Israel in light of the above the code considers that the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and East Jerusalem as well as Israel maintenance of their presence is contrary to article 49 of the for Geneva Convention the court further notes that the expansion of Israel settlement in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is based on the confiscation or acquisitioning of large areas of land observing that in the present case the public property confiscated or requisition for the development of Israeli settlements benefits the civilian population of settlers to the detriment of the local po Palestinian population the call concludes that Israel's land policies are not in Conformity with articles 46 52 and 55 five of the he regulations the core next turned to the question of the exploitation of Natural Resources it record that under the principle of customary international law contained in article 55 of the heg regulations the occupying power shall be regarded only as administrator and US frory of INF natural resources in the occupied territory including but not limited to Forest and agriculture Estates and it shall Safeguard the capital of these resources therefore the use by the occupying power of Natural Resources must not exceed what is necessary for the purposes of the occupation in this connection the court observed that the occupying power had the continuing duty to ensure that the local population has an adequate supply of food stuffs including water moreover the use of Natural Resources in the occupied territory must be sustainable and it must avoid environmental harm on the basis of the evidence before it the court considers that Israel's use of the natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territory is inconsistent with its obligations under law by diverting a large share of the natural resources to its own population including settlers Israel is in breach of its obligation to act as an administrator or USU fruct the court further considers that by severely restricting the access of Palestinian population to water that is available in the occupied Palestinian territory Israel acts inconsistently with its obligation to ensure the availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality in light of its analysis the court also in concludes that Israel's policy of exploitation of Natural Resources in the occupied Palestinian territory is inconsistent with its obligation to respect the Palestinians people's right to permanent sovereignty over natural resources turning next to the question of the extension of Israeli law to the territory the court record that under article 43 of the heg regulations the occupying power must in principle respect the law in force in the occupied territory unless absolutely prevent prevented from doing so in principle then the law of occupation does not deprive the local population civilian institutions and the occupied territory of the regulatory Authority that they may have rather it invests the occupying power a set of regulatory power on an exception bases and on specific enumerated grounds based on the evidence before it the court observed that Israel has expanded its sphere of regulation in the West Bank it's not in particular that Israel has to a large degree substituted its military law for the local law enforced in the occupied Palestinian territory at the beginning of the occupation in 1967 moreover regional and local councils of settlers have assumed de facto jurisdiction over the settlements in the West Bank in East Jerusalem domestic Israeli law has been applied since the beginning of the occupation in 1967 and Israel treats East Jerusalem as its own national territory where Israel law is applied in full and to the exclusion of any other domestic legal system where Israeli law is applied in full and to the exclusion of any other domestic use in the present case the court is not convinced that the extension of Israel's law to the West Bank and E Jerusalem is Justified under any of the grounds leted down in the second paragraph of article 64 of the for Geneva Convention furthermore the comprehensive application of Israeli law in East Jerusalem M as well as its application in relation to settlers throughout the West Bank cannot be deemed quote unquote essential for any of the purposes enumerated in the second paragraph of article 64 of the Fourth Geneva Convention for these reasons the court considers that Israel has exercised its regulatory Authority as an occupying power in a manner that is inconsistent with the rule reflected in article 43 of the heg regulations and article 64 of the Fourth Geneva Convention the court then turned to the effects of Israel settlement policy on the departure of the Palestinian people the court observed that the large scale confiscation of land and the deprivation of access to natur resources divest the local population of their basic means of sub resistance thus inducing their departure furthermore a series of measures taken by Israeli military forces has exacerbated the pressure on the Palestinian population to leave territory against their will the court recalls that under the uh first paragraph of article 49 of the Fall Geneva Convention I quote individual or Mass forceable transfers as well as deportations of protected persons from occupying territory to the territory of the occupying power or to that of any other country occupied or not are prohibited regardless of their motive end of quot in this regard the court considered that transfer may be forceable and thus prohibited under article 49 paragraph 1 not only when it is achieved through the use of physical Force but also when the people concerned have no choice but to leave further the court notes that to be permissible evacuations are conceived as a temporary measures to be reversed as soon as the imperative military reasons subside by contrast evacuations of a permanent or indefinite character breach the prohibition of forcible transfer and therefore are not covered by the exception set out in the second paragraph of article 49 the court considers that Israel's policies and practices including its forceable evictions extensive house demolitions and restrictions on residence and movement often leave little choice to members of the Palestinian population living in area C but to leave their area of res the nature of Israel's Acts including the fact that Israel frequently confiscates land following the demolition of Palestinian property for reallocation to Israeli settlements indicates that its measures are not temporary in character and therefore cannot be considered as permissible evacuations under the for Geneva Convention in the court view Israel's policies and practices are cont to the prohibition of forcible transfer of the protected population under article 49 paragraph 1 of The Fourth Geneva Israel's settlement policy has given rise to Violence by settlers and security forces against Palestinians having examined the evidence before it in light of the relevant provisions of international law the cour considered that the Violence by settlers against Palestinians Israel's failure to prevent or to punish it effectively and its excessive use of force against Palestinians contribute to the creation and maintenance of a coercive environment against Palestinians in the present case on the basis of the evidence before it the quote is of the you that Israel systematic failure to prevent or to punish attacks by settlers against the life or for bodily Integrity of Palestinians as well as Israel's excessive use of force against Palestinians is inconsistent with its obligations in light of the above the court affirms as it did in its whole advisory opinion that the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and the regime associated with them have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law the court notes with great concern report that Israel settlement policy has been expanding since the court fall advisory opinion in particular in December 2022 Israel Parliament approved the establishment of an additional Minister within the ministry of Defense vested with the governing powers in the West Bank including land designations planning and coordination of demolitions which would expedite the approval process for new settlements also the size of existing Israeli settlements expanded from November 1 2022 to October 31 2023 at a significant rate with approximately 24,300 housing units within existing Israeli settlements in the West Bank being advanced or approved including approximately 9,670 in East Jerusalem the court observed that the question posed by the general assembly refers in part to the legal consequences arising out of Israel's alleged annexation of the occupied Palestinian territory in order to respond to this aspect of the question the court must first analyze the concept of anex second the court examines Israel's policies and practices with a view to determining whether they amount to annexation finally the court discusses the lawfulness of Israel's policies and practices with regard to the concept of annexation in the present context the court understand that to mean the forceable acquisition by the occupying power of the territory that it occupies namely its integration into the territory of the occupying power annexation then presupposed the intent of the occupying power to exercise permanent control over the occupied territory the court records in this regard that under the law of occupation the control of the occupied territory by the occupying power must be temporary in character consequently conduct by the occupying power that displays an intent to exercise permanent control over the occupied territory May indicate an act annexation the assertion by the occupying power of permanent control of the occupied territory May manifest itself in a variety of ways in this connection the court notes that the distinction between the jewy and the facto annexation is occasionally made although differing in terms of the means through which the annexation is carried out both types of annexation share the same objective the assertion of permanent control over the occupied territory against this background the court must examine whether through its conduct Israel establishes its perent control over the occupied Palestinian territory in a manner that would amount to annexation the court first examines Israel policies and practices in relation to Jerusalem it note that Israel has applied its domestic law in E Jerusalem since its occupation in 1967 in 1980 isra enacted domestic legislation in the form of a basic law proclaiming a Jerusalem as part of its capital Israel has asserted that Jerusalem is part of it territory as evidenced by the notification of the Israeli government to the Secretary General of the United Nations According to which and I quote Jerusalem is not in any part occupied territory is The Sovereign capital of the state of Israel end of quote the absentee property law of 1950 has facilitated the confiscation of absentee property and its use for the expansion of Israeli settlements in and around the historical borders of the city it's reported that 230,000 person live in 14 settlements established in East Jerusalem the court considers that Israel's measures in E Jerusalem create an inhospitable environment for the population because Israel treats each Jerusalem as its own territory it regards Palestinians res ing there as foreigners and it requires that they hold a valid residence permit Israeli law has also put in place a building permit scheme the violation of which results in demolition through an expedited procedure as well as steep PES according to the Secretary General of the United Nations Israel process of land ownership registration is pursued in areas of of Israeli settlement expansion which would increase Israeli control over additional territory in a Jerusalem turning to Israel's settlement policy in the West Bank the court observed that pursuant to the basic law of 2018 the state of Israel I quote views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and shall act to encourage and promote its establishment and consol and consolidation and of course the displacement of the local population from the occupied territory which sustains Israel settlement policy also advances the integration of the territory Israel policies and practices induce the departure of the Palestinian population from parts of the occupied Palestinian territory notably from East Jerusalem and area C in the West Bank this in turn enables the further expansion of Israel's settlement policy and the ready integration of Palestinian territory into Israel the court also recal that Israel's practice of exploitation of the natural resources in the West Bank is inconsistent with the right of the Palestinian people to permanent sovereignty over natural resources Israel's extension of its domestic law to the West Bank notably to the settlements and other and over settlers as well as its assump ition of broader regularity Powers by virtue of the prolonged character of the occupation entrenches its control over territory policies practices and other measures that are such as to bring the occupied territory into the occupying Powers permanent control constitute acts annexation having examined Israel's policies and practices both in relation to East Jerusalem and to the West Bank with a view to determining whether they amount to annexation the court comes to the conclusion that Israel's policies and practices including the maintenance and expansion of settlements the construction of associated infrastructure and the wall the exploitation of Natural Resources the proclamation of Jerusalem as Israel's Capital the comprehensive application of Israeli domestic law in East Jerusalem and its extensive application in the West Bank entrench Israel's control of the occupied Palestinian territory notably of East Jerusalem and of area C of the West Bank these policies and practices are designed to maintain in place indefinitely uh to sorry to remain in place indefinitely and to create irreversible effects on the ground consequently the court considers that these policies and practices amount to annexation of large parts of the territory it is the view of the court that to seek to acquire sovereignty over an occupied territory as shown by the policies and practices adopted by Israel in East Jerusalem and the West Bank is contrary to the prohibition of the use of force international relations and its corly principle of the non-acquisition of territory by force the manner in which the annexation affects the legal status of the the continued presence of Israel is discussed later in the advisory opinion the court then examined the question of discriminatory legislation and measures recalling the wording of question a in the conclusion it reach with regard to the interpretation of the question it not that it must itself determine whether the legislation and measures identified by the request of the general assembly are discriminatory in this regard the court first considers that it has to limit its analysis to legislation and measures that are closely linked to the policies and practices discussed previously second the question covers Israel's legislation and measures only to the extent that they apply in the occupied territory third the question is confined to the potentially discriminatory character of Israel's legislation and measures having thus defined the scope of question a the code turn to the concept of discrimination it considers that common to all of the relevant provisions of international law it the concept of differential treatment between persons belonging to different groups it observed in this connection that the existence of the Palestinian people is not at issue therefore in the Court's view differential treatment of Palestinian can give R to discrimination in order to answer a the court first examines the effects that Israel's residence permit policy in East Jerusalem has on Palestinians in territory the court then turned to the restrictions by Israel on the movement of Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory finally it examines Israel practice of demolition of Palestinian properties in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem both with regard to the practice of punitive Demolition and demolitions for lack of a building permit the court n notes that in that connection that it's reported that almost 11,000 Palestinian structures have been demolished since 2009 the court concludes from the evidence presented to it and on the basis of its analysis that a broad array of legislation adopted and measures taken by Israel in its capacity as an occupying power treat Palestinians differently on grounds specified by international law the court notes that this differentiation of treatment cannot be justified with reference to reasonable and objective criteria nor to a legitimate public aim accordingly the court is of the view that the regime of comprehensive restrictions imposed by Israel on Palestinian in the occupied Palestinian territory constitute systematic discrimination based on on inter area race religion or ethnic origin in violation of Article 2 paragraph 1 and 26 of the iccpr Article 2 paragraph 2 of the iccr and Article 2 of third a number of participants have argued that Israel's policies and territory amount to segregation or aparti in breach of article three of thir article three of third provides as follows I quote States parties particularly condemn racial segregation and aparte and undertake to prevent prohibit and and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction this provision refers to two particularly severe forms ofal of racial discrimination racial segregation and aparti the court observed that Israel's legislation and measures imposed and uh serve to maintain a near complete separation in the West Bank and East Jerusalem between the settler and Palestinian communities for this reason the court considers that Israel's legislation and measures constitute a breach of article three of s having found that Israel settlement policy its acts of annexation and its measures are in breach of international law the court turned to the aspect of question a that inquires as to the effects of Israel's policies and practices on the exercise of the inan people's right to self-determination the court has already affirmed in its whole opinion the existence of the right of the self-determination in the present proceedings the court first determined the scope of this right and then examines the effects if any that Israel's policies and practices have on exercise in light of its analysis the quote is of the view that the prolonged character of Israel's unlawful policies and practices aggravates their violation of the right of the Palestinian people self-determination as a consequence of Israel's policies and practices which span decades the Palestinian people has been deprived of its right to self-determination over a long period and further prolongation of these policies and practices undermines the exercise of this right in the future for these reasons the court is of the view that Israel's unlawful policies and practices are in breach of Israel's obligation to respect the right of the self-determination the manner in in which these policies affect the legal status of the occupation and thereby the legality of the continued presence of Israel in the occupied territory is discussed later I shall now continue reading the rest of the opinion in French the court then turns to the first part of question B on which the general assembly requested its opinion and examines whether and if so the matter in which the policies and practices of Israel have affected the legal status of the occupation in light of the relevant rules and principles of international law it begins by fur further determining the scope of the first part of question B posed by the general assembly in this regard the court considers that the first part of question B posed by the general assembly is not whether the policies and practices of Israel affect the legal status of the occupation as such rather the court is of the view that the scope of the first part of the second question concerns the manner in which Israel's Israel as an occupying power in the territory this legality is to be determined under the rules and principles of General international law including those of the charter of the United Nations the court has determined that Israeli policies and practices and the manner in which they are implemented and applied on the ground have significant effects on the legal status of the of the occupation through the extension of Israeli sovereignity to certain parts of the occupied territory their gradual annexation to Israeli territory the exercise of Israeli governmental functions and the application of it its domestic laws therein as well as through the transfer of a great number of its own Nationals to those parts of the territory and impeding the exercise of the right to self-determination of the people the court is of the view that Israel's assertion of sovereignity and its annexation of certain parts of the territory constitute a violation of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force this violation has a direct impact on the legality of israeli's continued presence as an occupying power in the territory the court considers that Israel is not entitled to sovereignity over or to exercise sovereign powers in any part of the occupied Palestinian territory on account of its occupation nor can Israel's security concerns override the principle of the territory by force the court further observes that the effects of Israel's policies and practices discussed earlier and its exercise of sovereignity over certain parts of the occupied territory particularly the West Bank and East J Jerusalem constitute an obstruction to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination the effects of these policies and practices include Israel's annexation of parts of the occupied Palestinian territory the fragmentation of this territory undermining its Integrity the deprivation of the Palestinian people of the enjoyment of the natural resources of the territory and its impairment of the Palestinian people's right to pursue its economic social and cultural development the above described effects of Israel's policies and practices resulting inter Alia in the prolonged deprivation of the self-determination constitute a breach of this fundamental right this breach has a direct impact on the legality of Israel's presence as an territory the court is of the view that occupation can not be used in such a manner as to leave indefinitely the occupied Pol population in a state of suspension and uncertainty denying them the right to self-determination while integrating parts of their territory into the occupying power's own territory the court considers that the existence of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination cannot be subject to conditions on the part of the occupying power in view of its character as an inalienable right in light of the forgoing the court turns to the examination of the legality of the continued presence of Israel in violations by Israel of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force and of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination have a direct impact on the legality of the continued presence of Israel as an occupying power in the occupied Palestinian territory the sustained abuse by Israel of its position as an occupying power through annexation and an assertion of permanent territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination violates fundamental principles of international law and res renders Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory un lawful this illegality relates to the entirety of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in 1967 this is the territorial unit across which Israel has imposed policies and practices to fragment and frustrate the ability of the Palestinian people to exer exercise its right to self-determination and over large suedes of which it has extended Israeli sovereignity in violation of international law the entirety of the occupied Palestinian territory is also the territory in relation to which the Palestinian people should be able to exercise its right to self-determination the Integrity of which must be respected responding to an argument made by a few participants the court observes that the OSU Accords do not permit Israel to Annex parts of the occupied pal Palestinian territory in order to meet its security needs nor do they authorize Israel to maintain a permanent presence in the occupied Palestinian territory for such security needs the court emphasizes that the conclusion that Israel's continued territory is illegal does not release it from its obligations and responsibilities under international law particularly the law of occupation obligations and respons possibilities towards the pal Palestinian population and towards other states in respect of the exercise of its powers in relation to the territory until such time as its presence is brought to an end it is the effective control of a territory regardless of its legal status under international law which determines the basis of the responsibility of a state for its acts affecting the population of the territory or other states the court has found that Israel's policies and practices referred to in question a are in breach of law the maintenance of these policies and practices is an unlawful Act of a continuing character entailing Israel's International responsibility the court has also found in reply to the first part of question B that the continued presence of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory is illegal the court therefore addresses the legal consequences arising from Israel's question a for Israel together with those arising from the illegality of Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian ter under question B for Israel for other states and for the United Nations with regard to the Court's finding that occupied Palestinian territory is illegal the court considers that such presence constitutes a wrongful act entailing its International responsibility it is a wrongful Act of a continuing character which has been brought about by Israel's violations through its policies and practices of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force and the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people consequently Israel has an obligation to bring an end to its presence in the occupied Palestinian territory as rapidly as possible the court further observes that with respect to the policies and practices of Israel refer to in question a which were found to be unlawful Israel has an obligation to put an end to those unlawful acts in this respect Israel must immediately cease all new settlement activity Israel also has an obligation to repeal all legislation and measures creating or maintaining the unlawful situation including those which discriminate against the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territory as well as all measures aimed at modifying the demographic composition of any parts of the territory Israel also is also under an obligation to provide full reparation for the damage caused by its International wrongful acts to all natural or legal persons concerned reparation includes restitution compensation and or satisfaction restitution includes Israel's obligation to return the land and other immovable property as well as all assets seized from any natural or legal person since its occupation started in 1967 and all cultural property and assets taken from Palestinians and Palestinian instit institutions including archives and documents it also requires the evacuation of all settlers from existing settlements and the dismantling of the parts of the Wall constructed by Israel that are situated in the occupied territory as well as allowing all Palestinians displaced during the occupation to return to their original place of residence in the event that such restitution should prove to be materially impossible possible Israel has an obligation to compensate in accordance with the applicable rules of international law all natural or legal persons and populations where that may be the case having suffered any form of material damage as a result of Israel's wrongful acts under the occupation the court emphasize that the obligations flowing from Israel's internationally wrongful acts do not release it from its continuing duty to perform the international obligations which its conduct is in breach of specifically Israel remains bound to comply with its obligation to respect self-determination and its obligations under international human humanitarian law and international human rights law the court then turns to the legal consequences of Israel's internationally wrongful acts in the regards other states the court observes that the obligations violated by Israel include certain obligations erga omnus among which are the obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian self-determination and the obligation arising from the prohibition of the use of force to acquire territory as well as certain of its obligations under International humanitarian law and international human rights law with regard to the right to self-determination the court considers that while it is for the general assembly and the security Council to pronounce on the modalities required to ensure an end to Israel's illegal territory and the full realization of self-determination all states must cooperate with the United Nations to put these modalities into effect as regards the prohibition of the acus taking note of the resolutions of the security Council and general assembly the court is of the view that member states are under an obligation not to recognize any changes in the physical character or demographic composition institutional structure or status of the territory occupied by Israel on the 5th of June 1967 including Jerusalem East Jerusalem except as agreed by the parties to the conflict through negotiations and to distinguish in their dealings with Israel between the territory of the state of Israel and the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 moreover the court considers that in view of the character and importance of the rights and obligations involved all all states are under an obligation not to recognize as legal the situation arising from the unlawful presence of territory they are also under an obligation not to render Aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel's illegal presence in territory it is for all states while respecting the charter of the United Nations and international law to ensure that any impediment resulting from the illegal presence of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory to the exercise of the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end in addition all the states parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention have the obligation while respecting the charter of the United Nations at international law to ensure compliance by Israel with International humanitary law as embodied in that convention the duty of non-recognition specified earlier also applies to International organizations including the United Nations in view of the serious breaches of obligations ER omness under international law the obligation not to recognize as legal the situation arising from the unlawful Palestinian territory and the obligation to distinguish in dealings with Israel between the territory of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory apply also to the United St the United Nations finally the court is of the view that the precise modalities to bring to an end Israel's unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is a matter to be dealt with by the general assembly which requested this opinion as well as the security Council therefore it is for the you the general assembly and the security Council to consider what further action is required to put an end to the legal presence of Israel taking into account the present advisory opinion the court considers it important to stress as it did in its wall advisory opinion I quote the Urgent necessity for the United Nations as a whole to redouble its efforts to bring the Israeli Palestinian conflict which continues to pose a threat to International Peace and security to a speedy conclusion thereby establishing a just and Lasting peace in the region end of quote the court also considers that the realization of the right of the self-determination including its right to an independent and sovereign state living side by side in peace with the state of Israel within secure and recognized borders for both States as envisaged in resolutions of the security Council and general assembly would contribute to Regional stability and the security of all states in the Middle East the court emphasizes that its reply to the questions put to it by the general assembly rests on the totality of the legal grounds set forth by the court above Each of which is to be read in the light of the others taking into account the framing by the court of the material Territorial and temporal scope of the questions I'll Now read in English paragraph 285 which
