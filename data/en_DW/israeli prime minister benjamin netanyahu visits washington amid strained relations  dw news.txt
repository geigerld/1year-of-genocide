as Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Washington summed out the purpose of his trip at home in Israel and in the US critics say Netanyahu has not done enough to free the hostages held by Hamas since the 7th of October since prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Joe Biden last saw each other in September ties between their two countries have only become more tense and when the Israeli leader makes a speech to the US Congress on Wednesday experts say he hopes his message would convince more than just the gathered lawmakers he has two audiences in mind one is the American audience and he wants to to build support for Israel build support for Israel in Congress uh reinforce Israeli us ties he's also thinking about domestic audience so many Israelis are upset with how the war's gone they're upset about the hostages I think he wants to demonstrate that he hasn't destroyed us Israeli relations as some of his political critics argue what he is much less interested in is what the Biden White House thinks concerns over Israel's Rafa offensive in May prompted the us to stop certain armed shipments to Israel and a video Netanyahu released claiming that the White House was withholding even more support than it had made public put further strain on the relationship but that the Israeli leader has also yet to express full support for a us back ceasefire host deal essentially blocking a path to peace that's especially troubling to Washington he will um humiliate Biden frankly by showing up without having agreed to a ceasefire deal I think the anticipation was that by the end of July you know with this war in its ninth month that there would have been a ceasefire that there would be a plan for what happens afterwards this is not the right time if he had accepted the ceasefire months ago and begun a reconstruction process in Gaza perhaps at home the Israeli opposition also called for Netanyahu to either announce his acceptance of the hostage deal in front of Congress or not go to Washington at all but Maya Roman whose relative is still being held by Hamas in Gaza says she'll be going to the US capital to try to keep the spotlight on the remaining hostages rather than on politics there are hostage families that are coming with him and he's going to talk about uh the ordeal we've been through and all of those things are true and important for people to remember I just feel like if he talks about those things without being committed to a deal then he's doing a disservice he's basically taking our pain and using it for gain and not for um our purposes not for bringing back our loved ones Maya Roman will be in Congress to watch Nan yahu but more than a dozen Democrat lawmakers say they'll show their opposition to Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza by staying away and let's get more on this from DW correspondent Tanya krer in Jerusalem Tanya with a hostage deal still hanging in the balance and criticism back home what message will Netanyahu be bringing to the US Congress well I think the sense in Israel that his uh visit uh in Washington has become just much more complicated for Netanyahu because of the withdrawal of uh President Joe Biden from the presidential race and Netanyahu has to walk a very uh fine line here also because this visit comes as a very low point between uh the US and Israel uh relations now um it is not clear when uh the meeting that's very much looked at here aside from the speech in Congress uh on Wednesday there was supposed to be a meeting between Joe Biden and uh prime minister Benyamin nyaho at the white house because of Biden's uh covid-19 infection it's not yet clear when this will be scheduled but it will be very interesting to see the dynamic between uh the two leaders their relationship has been strained although we have to say the US support for the war in Gaza has been very strong with continuous arms supplies to Israel but both leaders have not seen eye to eye in many uh decisions and uh it's it's talked about here that Joe Biden now that he dropped out of of the race could also think about his legacy and could put or assert more pressure on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu now on the other hand we also understand netan will also look to men ties with presidential candidate Donald Trump there has been a close relationship between the two while Trump was president but this relationship has also suffered but as you say uh hanging over all of this is the question of the hostages that remain in Gaza and there's a sense here in Israel at least in the media but also people talking about it that M Netanyahu is out of touch with the public sentiment most of a majority of the public wants to see the hostages to come home although maybe uh not everybody's happy with such a deal but that's a deal that also was put forward by um Joe Biden and it hasn't really uh closed yet and there will be also protests we understand that are expected by relatives and uh uh families of the hostages that travel to Washington separately that will protest against Netanyahu there in Washington briefly Tanya this visit comes as the war continues to rage in Gaza what is the latest there well that's right we're hearing there from residents especially in Khan yunas but also other parts of Gaz Gaza especially also in Gaza City uh there is an intense uh bombardment going on and that also comes especially there in Kan yunas after the Israeli Army on Monday uh ordered people to evacuate once again from certain areas in the east of hanun but also uh reportedly part of the uh so-called humanitarian Zone that they said in that statement they would rearrange so you can imagine that people are again on the move and not knowing where to go and casualties are reported from there and also from other parts of Gaza tanyaa in Jerusalem thanks so much and as we just heard the plight of Civilian Palestinians trying to find refuge in Gaza is on ongoing as Israel's offensive continues even into areas forly declared safe once again hundreds of people forced to evacuate this time the Israeli military ordered gazin to leave an area had designated a humanitarian Zone they took what they could carry and hurried to escape we were making breakfast for our children as we had been safe for a month only to be stun by shells warning leaflets and martyrs in the streets we went out in panic you could see what people look like look at the crowd we're being displaced for the 15th [Applause] time Israel began shelling and air strikes in Han Yunis after ordering evacuations it said these areas had been used for renewed attacks by militants the Hamas run Health Ministry reported at least 70 people have been killed and more than 200 wounded all of a sudden the fighter jet struck and houses were targeted I was left passed out on the ground gaza's overwhelmed Hospital received a large number of casualties on Monday some were unable to operate because of the new offensive the situation is very difficult inside the hospital because there is no spaces for the patients there is no space in the operation theaters there is lack of medical supplies so we cannot we cannot survive our patients we cannot survive our sever patients the situation became more and more difficult more and more critical the United Nations and international relief agencies insist there is no safe place left in Gaza but these families have no other option once again they have to move to get away from the next Israeli strike
