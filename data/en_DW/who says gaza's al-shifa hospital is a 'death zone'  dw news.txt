Palestinian Medics say dozens of people have died in overnight Israeli strikes in Central and Southern Gaza reports suggest most were killed in central Gaza while a woman and child were killed in southern Han Yuna city as Israel's military operations continues the United Nations is sounding the alarm about the situation at the alshifa hospital in Gaza City the World Health Organization the who says it's working to organize the transfer of staff and hundreds of patients still there to another City the air thick with fear among those fleeing medical staff and patients from alifa hospital they say they've been ordered to leave by the Israelis a short while ago the Israeli authorities warned that who whoever is inside the hospital has to leave except for the wounded the surgeons and some of the medical staff and nursing staff as well Palestinian Health officials say it's a catastrophe they are not in the sufficient uh healthy condition to leave the hospital but they uh force them to to leave and this is again against not only Human Rights and Etc it's against humanity Israel claims that gaza's largest hospital houses a Hamas Command Center and has raided the site but it denies forcing people out the administrator of the hospital asked our forces to create an evacuation Corridor this morning for the people that can leave um that is what we've coordinated um throughout the day a team of un officials managed to spend an hour in the hospital wh staff described it as a a death zone with a mass grave on site reportedly containing 80 bodies the team says nearly 300 patients are still at the hospital many in extremely critical conditions with spinal injuries amputations or infections even if hamus has used the hospital for military purposes the hospital and indeed all Healthcare facilities are never without protection under humanitarian law shifa had been one of the few remaining refugees for people in Gaza City in recent weeks now patients and refugees must try and find somewhere else safe but as the Israeli bombardment continues those options are rapidly running out and for more all this we're going to go to DW correspondent Rebecca Ritter in Jerusalem for us Rebecca we're hearing reports that 31 premature babies have now been evacuated from that alifa Hospital in Gaza what else do you know that's right Nick we know that this has been in the planning for some time that the babies were obviously a very high priority to be evacuated from the hospital and we have had word now that 31 remaining the surviving babies it was originally 34 in the ICU or in the neonatal Ward now there are 31 and they have been evacuated further south uh there are there paperwork being done and plans for them to be moved moved into a hospital in Egypt but that hasn't uh happened yet they are being taken care for in the South so it's some uh good news for for those babies obviously and uh there are still patients inside the hospital and there is a plan to try and Evacuate the remaining between 100 and 200 patients still in the hospital and the and the remaining staff as well that will be done in conjunction with the who who were gain who gained access to the hospital for about an hour today to try to coordinate that mission it's obviously viously a very complicated mission that will be done in conjunction with the military and Rebecca if we could just sort of widen our Focus to the overall situation the Israeli Army has been telling gazans for weeks now to seek safety in the South but as we just said earlier overnight there were air strikes in Central and Southern Gaza where can people flee to now well that is obviously a huge question for the people that are Sheltering in the South they have been told to go f as we've been hearing for weeks now and many many over a million from the north have made their way to the southern part of the Gaza Strip but we know that the southern part of the Gaza Strip has also been under bombardment throughout this time the UN has said there is nowhere safe for gin to go and we also know that the military have over the weekend dropped leaflets into the khun area into areas in the South saying that people should evacuate those areas as well so exactly where they are supposed to go to we still don't know we understand that the military want to set up these safe zones but there's certainly not going to be enough room for all the people who are Sheltering down there in the South and we saw an air strike overnight killing uh at least one woman and a child uh in the South and as I say they've been ongoing since the beginning of this operation we also saw a couple of air strikes in the central part and two refugee camps in E excuse me uh refugee camps and uh we seeing large numbers of people do of people killed in those so people in Gaza really running out of Safe places to go lots of air strikes to keep track of there was one in the north on Saturday as well we've heard on a un school and going by the pictures that have been posted on on social media many gin were apparently using it as as a shelter do you have any more on that for us well Nick we're actually hearing that it was a double air strike in fact there was one on an area that was said to be a un school where H you're quite right people were Sheltering we believe that there are about 100,000 people still left in that jabalia area in that jabalia refugee camp some of people were Sheltering in that un school we told and there was an air strike there killing as many as 50 people uh on that one now Egypt has called that a war crime the Israeli military saying that they are aware of an incident in the area and that that will be investigated but uh we don't have any more information on that there was air strike also in jabalia uh at the same around about the same time killing more than 30 people uh from the same family more than half of them children so if those if those if that comes to light that becomes that gets investigated the sheer number of civilians could lean uh to the to to what Egypt has said and that it it it is in fact a war crime thanks Rebecca for that update DW correspondent Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem and for more on the overall situation let's bring in Shaina Lo she works for the Norwegian Refugee Council and is monitoring developments from Jerusalem as well Shaina gaza's Health Care system as we all know by now is in a state of collapse many if not most health workers have had to flee their workplaces how are hospitals still functioning at all you know most hospitals in Gaza have shut down at this point and the ones that are operating are operating with skeleton Crews with a shortage of supplies lack of fuel to operate generators for weeks we've been hearing stories about people being operated on amputations without anesthesia uh I heard reports today that patients in Al shifa Hospital uh had worms coming out of their wounds because of uh lack of sanitary conditions and lack of medicines to treat them uh appropriately the Gaza healthc care system is collapsing as we speak uh and has been in a state of collapse for for days if not weeks at this point uh we desperately need more supplies to be getting in we need those supplies to be able to reach hospitals and patients including in Northern Gaza and in order to be able to do that we desperately need a ceasefire so that humanitarian agencies can access all areas of Gaza and provide not just medical medical supplies and medicines but the necess fuel for hospitals to operate as well as clean water and food and and and before that happens sha you Gaza has two million a little over two million people thousands have been killed tens of thousands injured many of them are on the move with their injuries what what kind of care can they hope to receive in the here and now in the immediate future what I've been hearing from colleagues on the ground is that people are basically being treated as best as they can and then released without you know having uh the type of care that they really need a colleague of mine last week worked to get a friend of his who who had injuries to his limbs be evacuated to Egypt and I said if his if his injuries were so serious how was he out of the hospital for you to transport him to rough and he said they're basically treating people as best as they can and then releasing them we have a colleague who was injured in an air strike weeks ago who still is is recovering from her injuries facing infections due to the wounds that she has but h hospitals simply don't have the capacity to care for all of the Wounded they basically are bandaging them up the best that they can and then releasing them to the care of their families without having uh available supplies or medicines on the on the market to help continue with their treatment and one last quick question if I may Shaina we know that there's not enough fuel in Gaza what other resources are people missing people are missing everything that's necessary for survival they're missing fuel access to clean water which of course fuel would help to help to alleviate some of that because desalination plants would be able to work uh water pumps would be able to to function there are also shortages of food uh people are are running out of the basic Staples rice flour yeast cooking oil cooking gas uh everything is in short supply it's difficult even for our staff to find things on the basic Market we desperately need more Aid coming into to Gaza it shouldn't just be coming in through the Rafa Crossing Israel has an obligation as the occupying power to provide for the basic needs of the civilian population under its control and they should open the caram Shalom Crossing which is already equipped with all of the equipment and and Facilities to allow for more Aid to come in okay Shaya L from the Norwegian Refugee Council thanks so much thank you thousands of of people have rallied in Jerusalem outside the Office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in solidarity with hostages held by Hamas protesters are calling for the government to do more to gain the release of the people held hostage since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th the rally is a culmination of a trek in which tens of thousands walked from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem for 5 days now they've carried out their vigil March for friends family members and their fellow countrymen who have been taken hostage by Hamas militants their destination the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this is unacceptable I call on every NGO every government the Israeli government the Israeli Army to put aside any other interest and totally concentrate on their release of these people and in the first instance we would like to know where they are what is their condition are they being looked after since hamas's attack on Israel claimed over 1200 lives and saw the Abduction of over 200 hostages Israel has waged war in Hamas costing thousands of Palestinian lives but the demonstrators here say that the military campaign is distracting from what should be the government's goal bringing the hostages home cost what it may every day that passes their health is getting worse and worse we have no idea the Red Cross haven't seen them no one have seen them the UN people have not seen them no one knows where they are how they are doing it's a dark dark moment of humanity we want them home Healthy Home the 5-day March has yielded some results the demonstrators have gained the ear of some parts of the government members of Israel's war cabinet have agreed to meet with them without prime minister Benjamin [Music]
