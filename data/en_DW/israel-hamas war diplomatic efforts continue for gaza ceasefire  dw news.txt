I'm Phil Gail welcome to the program we begin with fresh hopes of a ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza Hamas says it is studying a new three-phase proposal put forward by International mediators following talks with the Israeli side in Paris the White House says progress is being made but Israel's prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu has ruled out any military withdrawal from Gaza or mass release of Hamas prisoners I hear comments about all sorts of deals so I want to make it clear we will not end this war without achieving all of our goals this means the elimination of Hamas the return of all our abductees and the promise that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel we will not pull the IDF from the Gaza Strip and we will not release thousands of terrorists none of this will happen what will happen absolute Victory well our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem told me more about the Diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire well we understand that uh um there is a framework that's being uh worked out there was a meeting uh in Paris on Sunday uh the heads of the CIA and the mosad and the mediators from Qatar and Egypt were meeting uh there uh this kind of frame framework as it's reported could see a temporary ceasefire um with some of the Israeli hostages that remain in Gaza are being released in exchange for uh Palestinian prisoners held in uh Israeli uh prisons but there are a lot of mixed messages uh coming out uh and you know depending on which report uh you're reading uh the gaps between the two sides Israel and Hamas are either wide or narrowing uh Hamas has said that um they want to see a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and also a full stop to the uh hostilities before there will release any hostages we understand one of the Hamas leaders isma hania who's one of those uh abroad will be traveling to Cairo to uh discuss the proposal but we also heard mixed messages from the Israeli government prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu said in a speech given in an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank that um Israel that the reports are untrue that Israel will release thousands of terrorists as he said it uh speaking uh to that particular audience he also has a lot of pressure from his far right uh uh um Coalition Partners who have said if this is a bad deal they will uh quit the government basically but there is a lot of pressure in Israel from uh the public uh they say uh the time is really running out for those hostages remaining uh in Gaza and that the government has to come to some kind of agreement to bring those hostages back home Dan Kramer in Jerusalem well meanwhile Israel's military says it has killed three members of what it described as a terrorist cell at a hospital in the occupied West Bank Israel's repeatedly targeted the city of Janine in recent months the Iran backed Islamic Jihad group said two of the men killed belong to its armed Wing Hamas confirmed the other was one of its members many countries classify Hamas as a terrorist organization Israeli forces storm a hospital disguised as Medics and Palestinian civilians this the aftermath of the shooting of three members of Palestinian armed groups the hospital's director described what happened and at 5:30 a.m. this morning the occupation Special Forces sneaked into the corridors of the hospital they sneaked into the courtyards from the northern and southern entrances they were disguised in nurse uniforms doctors and civilian clothes they sneaked into the third floor they rang the bell and the door was closed they rang the bell to enter the department Israel said the men were planning to carry out an attack and that this is another example of the cynical use of Civilian areas and hospitals shelters and human Shields by terrorist organizations alasam the military wing of Hamas claimed one of the Dead Palestinian Islamic Jihad said the other two men were members of their militant group the hospital where Tuesday's operation took place is located in the city of Janine in the occupied West Bank the facility is just over 1 kilometer from Janine refugee camp where more than 10,000 displaced Palestinians live Israel regularly carries out raids in the camp which is known to house members of groups the United Nations says more than 360 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank since a Hamas Terror attacks on October
