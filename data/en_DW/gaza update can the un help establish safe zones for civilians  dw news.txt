Israel says its troops have entered Southern gaza's largest city the military says its forces have reached the center of hunas with other soldiers surrounding it Israel commanders say their troops are engaged in some of the most intense fighting so far Israel says its aim is to eliminate Hamas hundreds of thousands of people have been told to evacuate to humanitarian zones but the UN says nowhere in Gaza is safe survivors sift through the rubble of a destroyer home struck by Israeli missiles in the early hours of the morning there were 30 people inside the house 20 of them were children we don't know what happened to us the fire hit and all of it collapsed on top of us none of us made it out completely okay everyone is hurt the United Nations says almost 1.9 million gazans have fled their homes since the War Began many wound up here in hanun now gaza's second largest city is a Battleground Israel says it is operating against Hamas strongholds in the South and both sides report that the fighting is fierce leaving civilians with nowhere to go all my senior colleagues have been very clear including the Secretary General saying there is no there is no there are no safe places in Gaza the main hospital in Han yunas is is overwhelmed the UN says delivering vital aid supplies is impossible amid the fighting and still the injured keep coming as do the bodies the devastation in Han yunas has left many Palestinians with a sense that the world has abandoned them we need someone to stand by our side we need someone to find us a solution we are devastated but despite a brief ceasefire between Israel and Hamas the renewed fighting is as intense as ever Lynn Hastings is the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories with Israel pushing its offensive further south and so many civilians there whom they expect to move again I asked if that is reasonable no and I think we've been very very clear on that there is really no safe place to go and Gaza currently the offens of inhan Unice is pushing people further to the southeast into a very very very small portion of Gaza um of course this is presenting real problems for us in terms of just logistically moving around with such a packed population in such a small area humanitarian groups have time and again criticized these so-called safe zones as not being sufficient is there some way the un uh could or should assist in setting up these safe zones yeah again we've been very clear uh to the extent that all of the executive directors of humanitarian agencies have indicated that we will not participate in the establishment of safe zones unless very very specific conditions are met the first of those of course is there actually has to be an agreement between Waring parties the un unfortunately has experience in what are called safe zones and of course our determination has been that they are in fact not safe zones in addition to there needing to be an agreement people need to be able to move in and out freely in addition the United Nations and its humanitarian Partners must be able to deliver to people who are not in the safe Zone we need to be able to deliver to communities that are hosting idps some families are hosting maybe 60 people in their own homes that's not necessarily in the safe zone so again we will not participate in the establishment of safe zones unless specific conditions are met so the zones obviously need to be safe not just for the civilians but your people too uh do tell us about the conditions right now in hunas which is coming under heavy bombardment and fighting yes so it's exactly as you say it's heavy bombardment we have reports from some of our own staff who are in these so-called deconflict boxes the government of Israel issued a map over the past couple of days indicating which areas might be hit and which not but even those people who are living trying to live in the uh zones that have been indicated to be safe are also coming under Fire and that's why everybody's moving into ever smaller uh parts of Gaza and of course I'm sure your listeners um can understand that the more people that are pushed into small small spaces without proper hygiene sanitation access to water access to food it's really just a Public Health crisis unfolding what sort of possibility is there at the moment of getting more food and Medicine into uh help those people yeah so um there's been a lot of activity obviously on social media lately and there is one hashtag that the government of Israel has put out which is basically saying hashtag uh United Nations to keep up I just want to make it very clear to everybody that the United Nations continues to Define Israel as the occupying power they have control over the sea land and air space um this makes them the occupying power this actually means that they are responsible to ensure that we can deliver um and in fact they are responsible for providing assistance to people who are in need uh so I wanted to make that very clear um as we have to the government of Israel and in addition to that that we need commercial trucks and openings to start again right now we are being asked to deliver humanitarian assistance bringing in very very large trucks with all of our Commodities through what is a pedestrian Crossing we need the commercial Crossings to be reopened nowhere in the world does the United Nations support an entire population we always work with partners that includes public sector and the commercial sectors one of those uh commercial Crossings you're talking about is in the South controlled uh by Israel in this case uh unlike the Rafa Crossing but there are also Israeli soldiers station there so I mean it sounds like an impossibility in fact today the government of Israel informed us that we would be able to use that Crossing for verification or rather I should should say they would be able to use that Crossing for verification because currently the Israelis are verifying what's inside of trucks inspecting basically what side what's inside of trucks to make sure that they um the Commodities can go in safely in line with the government of Israel or the israeli's uh security needs so now that's going to be moved up from about an hour and a half south of Gaza and we will be able to start using that Crossing as I say the Israelis will be doing their verification processes there and then we will be moving the trucks around the corner so to speak uh and through Rafa which sorry it's in Egypt sure any more breakthroughs when it comes to uh or any progress at all when it comes to delivering by sea U I know Cyprus had been in talks and had been pushing for a a corridor a humanitarian Corridor via the sea yeah so those talks are ongoing um we haven't seen anything solidified yet uh from the United Nations perspective we will continue to pursue the reopening of commercial Crossings and crossings so that we are able to bring the trucks in on a very very regular basis but I do also again just want to emphasize it's not just about getting things into Gaza it's about what's happening inside of Gaza that makes it absolutely impossible for us to properly to deliver there are not the conditions right now for the United Nations and its Partners inside of Gaza to be delivering humanitarian assistance at the scale that is needed but Lynn is that the main or only reason why these talks are going on and on and on I mean we're talking about more than 60 days of War now yeah and so that's obviously another thing humanitarian assistance is a bandaid um again we're not supposed to support the entire population what we need is a ceasefire a release of all the hostages and then ultimately a political solution that seems very very far away right now but it is up to the parties to be able to find a political solution so we can put an end to this is there any more that the International Community can do to Aid civilians uh to bring about some sort of restraint uh when it comes to not only uh uh what's going on there in Gaza and what Hamas is doing but also what Israel is doing yeah so I have highlighted of course what some of our obligations are including Israel but all member states do have an obligation they need to be able to be speaking to the Waring parties to try and come to some sort of solution um so each of us have an obligation and right now not many of those obligations are being filled right now it's a bit too early I guess to be talking about this but at some stage uh we will have to when fighting comes to to an end what sort of role do you see for the United Nations in postwar Gaza yeah there are so many opinions right now and we see various officials from the government of Israel some from the Palestinian authori some from various member states Etc so I'm not going to be able to pronounce on that one right now we'll have to see how that works Lyn Hastings the un's humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories
