the Israeli military says it has attacked dozens of Hezbollah Targets in southern Lebanon in retaliation for Rockets fired over the border Israel released this footage saying it hit esbah weapons storage and infrastructure now the Israeli defense minister says the group's leaders have paid a heavy price the operational results are highly impressive half of Hezbollah commanders in southern Lebanon were eliminated these were people in charge of the offensive operation to harm the citizens of Israel they are now either dead or hiding having abandoned Southern Lebanon to the idf's Intensive operation let's pick up on that with Rebecca ritters from our studio in Jerusalem Rebecca aah official dismisses the Israeli defense minister statement as completely worthless and says aimed only at boosting Israeli morale uh how is it being reported in Israel well it's been reported that Israel has been carrying out this offensive action in southern Lebanon now that's something that yav Galant the defense minister who you just heard from there had signaled some weeks ago that Israel would also be moving to offensive action not just defensive action now we know that there's been tit for T tit fortat rather border crossborder action since the 8th of October when Hezbollah launched its first Rockets into uh Northern Israel from Southern Lebanon after following that Hamas terror attack on October 7 but we've seen now in the last 24 hours the IDF saying it's hit some 40 targets that's the latest figure that we have infrastructure and Munitions targets largely but also y Galant saying as you just heard there that 50% of hezbollah's Southern command have also being wiped out of course impossible to verify those numbers from where I'm standing but that is what they're saying many analysts have been saying and many Israelis too saying that a direct conflict between Israel and Lebanon is more or less inevitable but those same analysts saying that it's unlikely it will happen until the the conflict that's happening in Gaza or the war that's happening in Gaza is quote over or finished uh and certainly you know after you know something looking like a ra or offensive which is certainly where everyone's eyes are focused on now uh so something in the North should say wouldn't happen until after then so it's unlikely that what we're seeing now is any kind of escalation more a continuation of the tip fortat that we have been seeing over the last months and Iraq I'd like to pick up right there with the war on Gaza it's now been more than 200 days of War at this stage is it clear what Israel's plan is well it's never really 100% clear of course we have been seeing in recent days more air strikes and another slightly larger bomb bombardments in the center and north of Gaza ey Witnesses saying it's certainly some of the heaviest that they've witnessed in recent times we've heard of evacuation orders uh for people in that Northern Region as well but of course all eyes really focused on this imminent Rafer offensive it's what analysts are saying is almost inevitable now and we've been seeing some reporting today from the access uh web web media site saying that three very senior officials are actually in Egypt to discuss a potential raer offensive there with officials now Egypt have been very against uh any kind of offensive happening in Rafa because of the you know more than 1 million people that are there Sheltering from other parts of the Gaza Strip earlier today we also heard from the Israeli military to say that they are ready we know that two battalions two Reserve battalions were called up and they've been training the military today saying that they're ready to carry out Rafa offensive but they are just waiting for the political green light so that gives some indication of where we think things are at Benjamin Netanyahu two weeks AG ago saying that there was a date set for the Rafer Invasion since then we had quite a bit of distraction with the Iran Counterattack and then the Israeli counter Counterattack now all eyes back on this what seems to be inevitable Rafer offensive analysts saying though that it may not happen immediately because there is still a need to at least move some of the more than million people that are Sheltering in Rafa so certainly look looks like that that offensive is going to be carried out but probably not in the next hours or even in the next days our correspondent Rebecca Ritter in Jerusalem thank you
