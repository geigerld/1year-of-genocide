footage has emerged from Gaza apparently showing dozens of Palestinian men detained and forced to strip by Israeli forces the men are seen sitting cross-legged or kneeling in several different locations and being transported on the back of military vehicles these pictures were filmed in Northern Gaza not far from Gaza City Israel has not confirmed who the men are but says it is interrogating individuals Israeli Army spokesman Daniel hagari said and I quote we are investigating to see who is linked to Hamas and who is not Alia I asked our correspondent Tanya krer in Jerusalem what more she knew about the images of the detainees well as you said um the Israeli Army wouldn't confirm those pictures or videos but they've been circulating uh since uh Thursday on social media showing uh um dozens of men uh uh stripped down to their underwear uh with someone their hands bound and guarded by uh soldiers these are videos and photos uh some have been deoc to the Northern Area um parts of them are to B laka which is a town in northern Gaza and uh some families and relatives have actually identified on social media at least their their uh relatives on this uh on some of the photos and we understand that one of them is a a local correspondent for a london-based Arabic newspaper they have put out a statement um uh in this regard but again the Army uh would just say that they have arrested uh hundreds of men uh interrog interrogating them as well over recent weeks separately Tanya there has also been pressure on Israel to allow more Aid into Gaza how is Israel responding to that well the pressure has been mounting not just to uh get more Aid into Gaza but also for more protection of civilians mainly by uh the United States but also the United Nations is uh saying now that it's incredibly difficult now with the uh expanding ground operations also towards the South where um many Palestines have been displaced to from the north the situation is becoming very uh dire there as well with heavy bombardment uh going on there as well we also had some rocket Fire coming out from Gaza today but um there is some talk and some reports that uh Israel might consider to use the km Shalom Crossing uh to for screening of humanitarian Aid that is usually coming in on trucks through uh the Rafa Crossing which is the crossing uh with Egypt uh Israel had closed its two Crossings one in the north that is mainly for people to go through uh in the past and the one Kum shalom in the South for goods uh but so then might be less pressure on the uh Crossing in RAF but having said that uh because of the heavy fighting reported in the South humanitarian organizations are saying they have difficulties to get the the the little Aid that is coming in or the aid that is coming in uh to these uh two people uh for example also to the central areas to the Northern areas and also in the South because it's extremely difficult uh to distribute Aid and we heard the um un's under General Secret for humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffith also saying that we do not have a humanitarian operation in southern Gaza anymore we can't call it like this anymore because there's no safe space for people and uh also no safe space to distribute the aid we leave it there for the time being tiny in Jerusalem thank you so much the tiny coastal town of Al mavali was declared a safe Zone by Israel's military after it told some 430 ,000 residents of gaza's second largest city Khan Unice to evacuate but many displaced gazans who arrived at the 10 square kilm patch of land say they found no humanitarian Aid another Palestinian school that's become a mass displacement Camp labeled in Israel's evacuation plan as a humanitarian Zone many who moved here were promised better conditions they said this place would be the safest that it would be a dump for humanitarian aid but of course that's not true at all those Sheltering at the school say they've mostly had to fend for themselves describing a complete absence of all utilities we're all right but there are no Services here there's no running water there's nothing we're sleeping outside in the cold more than 2 months into the war gazin here say they're exhausted of living in inhumane conditions and not having access to Medical Care we ask International actors to provide Aid access to electricity food water so that we can live in peace here we call on global powers to stop this war in Gaza and until then many here in al- maali are trying to survive with whatever means they have the United Nations Secretary General is pushing for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza Antonio gutterz told the UN Security Council that people in Gaza are being moved around like human pinballs he said it's impossible for Aid workers to get to people in need the council is to vote on a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas the UN Chief says International Security could be at risk there is a high risk of the total collapse of the humanitarian support system in Gaza which would have devastating consequences we anticipate that it would result in a complete breakdown of public order and increased pressure for Mass displacement into Egypt I fear the consequences could be devastating for the security of the entire region now let's bring in our correspondent Benjamin Alvarez grba in Washington DC Benjamin give us the context of this vote why is it happening now people in Gaza star into the abis that's what Secretary General Antonio gues said earlier today at this meeting of the security Council that is happening in New York he stressed that the humanitarian system and the humanitarian operations in Gaza are collapsing he also used the word saying that we are at a Breaking Point with devastating consequences and he also stressed this complete lack of assurances for us and that's something we also heard in that report and also heard from our colleague Tanya GMA there gues said that the threat for our staff is um president and he said that this would have devastating consequences if this strikes in Gaza continue just to give you a few numbers on why this vote is taking place now he said that reportedly more than 300 education facilities 88 masques 29 hospitals have been hit and more than 60% of housing in Gaza is destroyed or damaged so why is this vote it taking place now Antonio gures invoked article 99 of the UN Charter which says that the Secretary General May inform the council these 15 members of matters he believes threaten International Peace in security so this is something that gives him an important additional power since the real power of the UN is held by its 193 member nations but especially the 15 countries 15 countries that serve the security Council and that's where this vote is will expect to have an a vote on that later on today so gutes thinks International Peace and security is under threat what do the security Council Members think will the vote pass so one of the 15 uh me members of the security Council the United Arab Emirates the only Arab country has pushed for a draft resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire this is not the first time that there's a vote like this in the security Council the was in October that the US vetoed because for a resolution to be adopted you need nine out of 15 members of this Council to vote in favor and none of them none of the five permanent members to veto the resolution and that's exactly where we don't know how the US will vote we can expect that this might be just another veto and that's something that secretary blinken also said yesterday was a press conference with um foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom David Cameron and there blinkin once again stressed that it's important he said that he believes the assurances that Israel is giving but he also said that's different between what they're claiming that they want to do and how the situation on the ground actually look like and that's also something that we heard in the report there so we can imagine that the US might again veto this resolution if that's the case why hold a vote that's a very good question many are saying that gutes is showing that the UN can act that the UN can do more we don't see why it should be any different to the situation in October that was already catastrophic we see the rethoric is changing we see pressure on Israel increasing we see um also Israeli officials being pressed on what they say what they do actually and that was something really interesting also during yesterday's press conference that I just mentioned with secretary blinken and um David Cameron because a Reuters journalist press secretary blinkin um asking about um this new investigation that showed that an Israeli a tank crew fired and killed the RO journalist but secretary blink dodged the question saying that they still believe in Israel assurances of protecting journalist in the war zone we leave it there for the time being thanks so much for joining us today Benjamin Alvarez
