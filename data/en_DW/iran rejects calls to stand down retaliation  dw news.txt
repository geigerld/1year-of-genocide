Iran's foreign Ministry has called on European countries to quote stand against the war in Gaza the statement comes after Iran dismissed calls from France Germany and the UK to exercise restraint amid warnings of an imminent Iranian attack on Israel Iran blames Israel for the killing of Hamas political Chief in Teran last month the United States recent deployment of submarine and fighter jets to Israel is being seen as a warning to Iran to stand down on its threat faas jgies is with me now he's a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics with a focus on the Middle East welcome back to DW Foos now is there any reason to believe that Iran will not retaliate or limit its retaliation take is that uh Iran will most likely retaliate uh for Israel's alleged assassination of Hamas top political leader is Hanah in tahan Iranian officials have repeatedly said that they have the right under international law to respond uh to the humiliation and the assassination of Hamas political leader on their territories but my reading is that the Iranian leadership does not really want all out war with Israel they are taking their time they are trying to uh calibrate their attack in a way that does not really provide the Israeli Prime Minister with a pretext for the for escalation for further escalation so to answer your question in in in a in directly I think it will most likely be measured and try to avoid civilian casualties in Israel Iran's new president masud pesan is considered more moderate than his predecessor is there or was there hope deescalation with this new government well I mean we know that the new president the agenda his agenda is very clear he wants to focus on the economy he wants to open up Iranian Society he want to restore relations with the Western governments but remember what happened on his during his inauguration uh abas hania who was the I mean guest of honor for the Iranian leadership was killed during the inauguration um it was really great humiliation seen by the Iranian leadership so what the Iranian leadership is trying to do is to basically that's what they say to try to restore deterence try to prevent Israel convince Israel not to really um take uh further aggression and for the Iranian president it was basically a a major sabotage uh before even he uh formed his own cabinet uh but at the end of the day for your own viewers the Iranian president does not really make the final decision on foreign policy and strategic matters it's the supreme leader of Iran Ali kamani who is the commander and chief but based on what we know that the new Iranian president is trying to limit Iran's retaliation because in his talks in his phone conversations with the French President and the British prime minister uh stama he made very clear that the way to deescalate is to have a ceasefire to end the blood luting in Gaza and this is might give Iran a way out to climb down from the tree now this is what we have publicly uh been told right that that there was a rebuttle of the western nation's appeal for restraint what do we know about backdoor diplomacy efforts in in this issue well I think this is a very important question I I think uh what we know what we do not know is more important than what we know we know that the United States and Iran are communicating uh directly and indirectly they have been doing so for quite you know uh since the uh uh break out of the war in Gaza we also know that European governments whether Germany or France or Britain are really trying to also uh deescalate the crisis we know Qatar and turkey and and Egypt and Jordan are also playing a role but at the end of the day Iranian leader have made it very clear they cannot afford not to retaliate and sadly to say as a student of international relations that's what states do the idea of prestige the idea of deterence is very important but at the end of the day it's been two weeks now and the fact that Iran and Husalah lebanon's have not retaliate it so far it tells me they are trying very hard that decision will be designed to retaliate Without Really provoking and a a further escalation between Israel and the United States on the one hand and Iran and its local allies on the other hand that was far was jurus from the London School of Economics thank you so much great to get your insights thanks now Iran has called on European countries to take a stand against Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza tahan has dismissed calls from restraint amid growing fears of an imminent Iranian attack on Israel Iran blames Israel for the killing of hamas's political Chief at Ismael hania in tan last month a US battle group sent to the region is being seen as a warning to Iran well Dr Cameron Martin lectures on international relations with a focus on Iran at the University of susex in the UK welcome back to DW it's been something like two weeks since this m was killed why is Iran taking so long to take this Revenge that is proclaimed so loudly that it will take I think Iranian regime is facing a massive conundrum on the one hand it feels obliged to retaliate against Israel given that um it's been humilated uh you know Time and Again by Israeli um army and its um you know um intelligence uh institutions and so on and in order to restore its um credibility with his own uh Regional allies as well as uh to avoid being seen as Weak by the people inside Iran it it feels that it has to respond on the other hand Iranian regime uh in my view correctly assesses that um any retaliation carries the risk of a uh response a joint response by Israel and the United States and this response might include destruction of Iran's nuclear sites as well as its vital economic infrastructure so um on the one hand Iran does not want to uh retaliate in a way that it triggers such a response on the other hand any response seems to carry that risk especially in light of Israel's insistence that it would immediately respond to any attack inside Israel so I think Iran is trying to figure out how to respond without causing a major war with us and Israel um and is um probably trying to see whether uh a potential ceasefire agreement can remove that necessity from retaliation and claiming Victory by you know saying that Iran's stance has contributed to that fire which helps Hamas so you think there there is a hope then there is a possibility then that this expected retaliation will not happen because Iran is trying to push is towards this ceasefire and can claim some sort of Victory it's possible in fact Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations on Friday issued a statement saying that Iran's retaliation will be timed and carried out in a way as to not to risk uh the cire talks scheduled for this Thursday so it is possible that Iran for example ends up attacking certain sites in neighboring countries in Iraqi Kurdistan where Iran has previously claimed to have attacked Israeli related sites or even in aeran which has close relations with Israel without itself directly attacking Israel but I think this um really depends on the way in which these scheduled sisire talks unfold on Thursday and as things stand uh the prospects are not very bright because Hamas is claiming that uh Israel should agree to the May uh version of the uh proposal which they had accepted at the time and Hamas may not even uh participate in this talks on Thursday in which case Israel would have a you know um a plausible excuse that the side which U kind of prevented ceasefire to to succeed is Hamas and not Israel right and despite all these public proclamations uh whether it comes from um from uh Iran or from isra or from Hamas or whomever despite all the shouting in the media do we expect that quieter backdoor diplomacy with Iran is already happening I think diplomacy is happening but the diplomacy as far as we know from uh statements made on the western media is that uh United States messages are relate to Iran and this messages basically um you know warn Iran of a massive retaliation and the you know the cost of and the consequences of a potential attack on Israel uh so this much is for sure happening and then we had this joint statement by leaders of France Germany uh and Britain uh asking Iran to stand down to which you referred in the beginning uh Iran rejects it and believes that they have not taken any stance against Israel's bombardment and and and operation in Gaza so um beyond that that I'm not sure what else has been uh said to Iran Iran is obviously also Keen uh on seeing who wins the elections in the US and a democratic Administration is more likely to strike a deal over Iran's nuclear uh project so in that sense we'll leave it there we we'll have to leave it there but but thank you for guiding us through that so clearly uh Dr Martin Dr Cameron Martin from the University of Sussex in the UK thank you
