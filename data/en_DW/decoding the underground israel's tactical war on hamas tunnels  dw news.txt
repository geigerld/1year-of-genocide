we begin with a further escalation in Israel's military campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip Israeli defense minister yuav Galan says Israeli troops are now operating in the heart of Gaza City he has called Gaza the largest terrorist base ever built meanwhile prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned there will be no fuel deliveries until Hamas releases the more than 200 hostages it captured on October 7th here's what Netanyahu had to say the fighting in the south is advancing with a force that Hamas hasn't known Kaza city is encircled we are operating in it and deepening the pressure on Hamas every hour every day so far we have killed thousands of terrorists above the ground and under the ground there will be no entry of fuel no entry of workers and there will be no ceasefire without the release of our hostages for the latest Let's cross over to DW's special correspondent a Ibrahim in Jerusalem and what are you hearing from the Israel Defense Forces about the difficulty of their operation in and around Gaza City we know that so far 30 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the ground operation about a week ago and as the ground operation enters into its next phase we can expect this death toll uh to rise uh as well so far uh close combat Urban Warfare has been limited limited to urban areas but as you just mentioned Israeli troops are now uh inside Gaza City this is previously one of the most populated uh parts of the entire strip and also where the Israeli military believes the largest concentration of hamas's tunnel system is located right underneath uh Gaza a city so as this phase moves forward we can expect more close combat with Hamas uh militants we can expect uh more urban Warfare as Israeli troops try uh to rid the strip of uh uh of of Hamas and also uh to uh release attempt to release uh the hostages the majority of whom are still believed to be within the STP we can also expect um that with Urban Warfare civilian casualties will also Rise um the Israeli military has repeatedly asked gazans to evacuate to the South there are many reasons why about 300,000 still remain there either they're worried that there's no safe place or as they say um they are not able to evacuate um this is something that t really touches almost everyone in Israeli Society this is a country where military service is mandatory with very very few exceptions and over 300 reservists have uh been called up so it's you know it's it's the effect of this ground operation and this war is something that you see everywhere here in Israel so the war has been going on now for uh for over a month are Israelis satisfied a with the way their government is Prosecuting this War I would say there's pretty much overwhelming support for the war even though as I just mentioned it will come at a huge cost Lo people here are acutely aware of that but at the same time what they tell me is that they feel like there is no choice this is the only way this war is the only way to first of all regain their security um get rid of Hamas as the government wants to do and they feel this could also bring back the hostages there is however mounting anger at the government and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu specifically we just crossed the one month Mark since the terror attacks of o October 7th here in Jerusalem and elsewhere in the country there were vigils memorials that also turned into protests against the Prime Minister who has so far not taken responsibility for the major security lapse that was October 7th so I would say support for the war support for the war effort but at the same time mounting anger at the government and prime minister Netanyahu even though it is a Unity government that also has um opposition figures a thank you very much our special correspondent AIA Ibrahim in Jerusalem now Israel says it is entering the next stage of its war against Hamas whose Fighters are reportedly operating from a large network of tunnels Israel says militants are launching mortar attacks against Israeli soldiers and then retreating back underground it's a challenging situation for Israeli forces let's have a closer look now at the options that Israeli forces may be considering in this next phase with our military expert Frank LED Frank the tunnel system used by Hamas militants has been described as a spider web by a former hostage can you help us better imagine Frank what that looks like and how long this might have taken to build good morning Terry yes in in Gaza actually it's called the Gaza Metro as well and that describes to some extent the complexity of it it's been built been built for about 20 years ham I started constructing these in the early 2000s although some say a bit earlier and the extent is is truly vast most estimates put it it around throughout the The Enclave at around 300 miles or 500 km long although clearly some of those systems are more formidable deeper and bigger than others connecting of course with bunkers where you have command centers and what have you and the counter measures to be used against them are many but this is a very difficult challenge you'll be attacking them from the air from the land and indeed from the sea so yeah now Israel has tasked a special unit one of its special units with finding out more about the location and layout of these tunnels Frank how would they go about doing that they have no one particular method needless to say so the unit is called yahalom it's part of the engineering core but it's considered a Special Forces Unit it's extremely selective and as you can imagine very very highly skilled and they've been going for it again for for quite some time and the options available to them are probably certainly not primarily them going into tunnels and shooting people that would be their very last option and probably an option very rarely certainly very rarely used us used such troops in in Vietnam called tunnel rats and and these guys would be similar in concept but not in execution you won't be seeing them very often underground so the weapons that they have include but aren't limited to or means uh they literally smoking out tunnels so you put inert smoke in and you can see where the entrance and exits are it's very difficult to counter that and then of course once you found those you need to seal them and there are a number of ways of doing that first is through explosives simply seal the entrances and collapse the tunnels and the second well another one there were several Emulsion there's a an Emulsion system it's called a SpongeBob where you uh which can work along a certain length of length of tunnels it simply seals it up you have two compounds that come together and they expand and seal the tunnel but there other means being looked at I mentioned the sea before one very Innovative uh means that it's being considered is uh should be a bit nightmarish for Hamas is once you've cleared the tongs in other words you you know this particular a particular tunnel is clear certain of hostages show of hostages uh considering things like horizontal uh uh drilling from the sea uh and considering things like flooding so the options are many but do not generally include these guys going underground and shooting people they're much too easy to defend they' be full of booby traps and of course most importantly the tunnels are where the hostage and and bunkers of where the hostages are and then of course there's attack from the air and we've seen that already speaking of attack from the air uh Israel obviously wants to destroy both the tunnels and eliminate Hamas Fighters um from the air so-called bunker Buster bombs can be dropped we've we've seen those used in in other wars in the past are we likely to see them used in this case Frank well Terry I think we have seen them used seen some evidence that they have been used already they are there are several different kinds the primary kind is called a GBU guided bomb unit it's a Precision bomb very thin a GBU 23 I think now that's about 2 and a half tons of of explosives and uh and uh and bomb that can penetrate some say up to about 50 m and it's worth saying that hamas's tunnels are generally regarded as being that that deep and they would be used to collapse the tunnel so they can penetrate Earth at least to 50 m but also concrete and I I've been in bunkers in in in Iraq and and Lebanon anded for as a tourist in in Vietnam but a lot of these Bonkers are lined with concrete so what these boms will allow you to do is not only get deep but also penetrate the concrete uh to to a certain depth and there are even bigger bombs have been designed for Iran I very much doubt we'll see those you saw one being used in Afghanistan a few years which was popularly known as a mother of all bombs won't see that but the average or common or garden bunker bombs used since the early 90s it's roughly the same version uh we will we will be seeing those and we have seen them well of course we know that Hamas is holding more than 200 hostages probably somewhere in that tunnel system given that um how problematic is it for Israeli forces to be using those kinds of weapons that you described Frank yeah that's the top that's the top consideration on their list and when you you hear or read Israeli speak about they the vital importance of clearing any particular system which is to say understanding and being sure that hostages aren't there is utterly Paramount now the Israelis have already collapsed many of these tunnels and by the way those bombs I talked about they supplement of all kinds of artillery systems and of course the yahalom unit also comprised by the way of dogs they've got specially trained dogs but anyway coming back to the the hostages the problem is that where you can use those things but they have a a lateral spread of of about about half a mile so you put one in the bottom s in go go deep it will collapse your tunnel for for for about a kilometer um now the Israelis have discovered many tunnel systems and they do that through means from all kinds of means like again Lan CN a but one means is by it's to human intelligence that's probably the in my view anyway the most important and the Israelis have discovered tunnel maps and what have you and and those are the systems I think that have been collapsed so far but as Israeli troops get further into Gaza City the tunnel systems are going to be a real problem and and they' be extremely well they won't clear any until they sure no hostages are there this is the number one priority but from the safety of the Israeli troops perspective you've already SE seen videos of this uh where you where Hamas Fighters have shown videos allegedly sh destroying tanks they haven't those the the tanks systems will have uh prevented that but the problem is that what you do see is you see these Fighters emerging from behind from the side from in front as uh uh and this is why of course the tunnel systems is hamas's main combat weapon apart from civilians of course one final thing worth mentioning it's been described to me as common knowledge now that doesn't necessarily mean much but I you mention it in the report that the many of the headquarters are located under hospitals I'm certain that's the case uh and entries and exits in places like mosques or schools or un some say un facilities and that's the problem and that's why we've seen I think so many uh non-competent casualties so far because Israelis have to hit these systems um many of which have command centers and they are located in such places not just the hostages of course another consideration is the civilian casualties uh and and they yeah and the tunnels are of course and bunkers are placed underneath these these these installations or these places Frank thank you very much that was military analyst Frank ledwidge there speaking to us from Oxford in the UK thanks
