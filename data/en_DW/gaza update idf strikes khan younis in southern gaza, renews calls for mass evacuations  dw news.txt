forces in the Gaza Strip continue to expand ground operations we attack today with fighter jets in the entire Gaza Strip significant and very precise strikes based on intelligence in addition we are expanding the ground operation against Hamas centers of gravity everywhere in the Gaza Strip for those choosing to flee this is what awaits in this so-called safe Zone people say they are getting no help and do their best to set up makeshift shelters however and wherever how long they'll be able to seek Refuge here nobody knows what is certain though is Israel's determination to wipe out Hamas and that it's offensive inside Gaza is unlikely to stop until that mission is accomplished journalist ham belala used to live in and report from Gaza he's joining us today from Jordan it's good to see

or the school in in in in the southern area because there is no place and no um no areas to go some people go to some relatives some uh some neighbors or some friends some people rent but it's not available there um I can see it on on the social media everybody is asking if there is a place to rent or a place to go um it's very hard we are talking about a huge number of uh refugees uh going to very small area mhm if we take a look at Israel's operations in the south of Gaza now specifically the city of Han yunes do we know why efforts are being focused there in particular right now kis is part of the second phase according to the Israeli Army that is is going to be targeted um the first phase was focusing on the North Gaza City and the Northern Area despite that still some part of it like is under um uh uh ground Invasion now in in sorry in jabalia in the north and Cha East of Gaza City but the main focus on kanun Israel is saying that this is the part hunis is the biggest city in the south of Gaza STP and and it's the widest among the other cities in in in in the whole Gaza STP uh Israel says that um some Hamas figures are there um it's not clear yet um who are there but according to the statements from Israeli army or different other agencies that it's U it's part of the the battle and it's going to last for for some time now the focus in um in parts of kanun not all of it mainly the East and the north part of kanun ham Bela reporting from Aman thanks so much for your time H uh ham thank you now after weeks of bombardment by Israel only a few of gaza's hospitals are still in operation the World Health Organization has announced that it will be holding an emergency session later this week to discuss the health care situation in Gaza Aid agencies have already warned that health conditions there are dire DW reporter Muhammad Al khut sent us this report from Han Unis increasing numbers of displaced Palestinians are falling victim to deadly infections and there are fears that hepatitis diarrhea and respiratory illnesses could cause more deaths than bombs and missiles here in the south of the Gaza Strip Dina Abu TSH takes her daughter to a clinic in Han Unice my daughter is suffering from fever cough and cold we were displaced to these schools and there are many children here the children have caught infections because of overcrowding the situation is difficult for my daughter but also for other children but it's not only the health infrastructure that is overwhelmed other critical infrastructure is also lacking and there's not enough drinkable water or food many gens have resorted to eating just one meal a day prioritizing children as more families flee the conflict poor sanitation is becoming widespread across the besieged strip causing hygiene related diseases such as lice infestation and scabies making it harder for health authorities to control disease outbreaks at present there's no way of controlling the spread of infection especially with the war continuing there's a lack of water suitable for human consumption along with a shortage of energy and electricity to operate generators the overcrowding and transfer of people to shelters and the failure to provide personal Supply to limit the spread of diseases health organizations have repeatedly sounded the alarm that the situation is becoming deadlier by the day deas had to wait for hours to buy Essentials like medicine for her sick daughter about 1.8 million garans are now displaced and hopes that the situation could improve arwi dwindling for more Let's cross straight to DW correspondent Rebecca RS who joins us now from Jerusalem Rebecca can you give us the latest on uh Israeli operations in the south of the Gaza Strip well what we know Anor is that since Sunday evening we've had confirmation that this ground operation has now spread to the south of the Gaza Strip and in fact is now moving towards the entire Gaza Strip we know that the focus is on the southern city of Han yunas and tanks and armored personnel vehicle uh and and soldiers in fighting in combat uh hand-to-hand combat in those areas we know that the bombardment uh is continuing in the South also in the north which as you heard in that report is virtually a closed military zone now that northern part of the strip the strip as we've known for some time now has been completely split in two and we know that all civilians uh were asked to leave uh to head south to evacuate South which is now since the resumption of fighting on Friday where the Israeli Defense Forces or the Israeli military are are working towards and focusing on Han unas being uh the focal point we know it's a symbolic uh and the the Israeli military say also um a central fighting area for Hamas militants that it is you know for one of a better word a command center uh an area where they believe that the Hamas militants operate from and it is going to be a center uh where they're targeting but of course for the many millions of civilians who are now Sheltering or trying to find some form of safety excuse me in the south of course things uh looking very D with people running out of places to to to run from the fighting absolutely I mean you mentioned it yourself not so long ago Israel had called on people to move from the north to the south of Gaza now the south is being targeted so just clarify for us us what this means for for the civilians well I mean fear and uh danger basically we're talking about 1.8 approximately million uh displaced people who are trying to find shelter we hear harrowing stories of people sleeping on the streets they have nowhere to run and hide many have mve from evacuation point to evacuation point during this war and they are really running out of places to run and hide to we know that uh many of the places where people had been Sheltering have also been bombed including schools uh and hospital so people just finding it very difficult to to to move further south we're talking about a lot of people now corraled into a small scrap of land and uh the Israeli military continued to say that they uh that they are telling civilians uh where to go or or to evacuate to try to prevent civilian deaths but it's a relatively complicated system they've set set up a map that has these numbered squares on it they expect civilians to be able to locate where they are uh in that map in that numbered map and then they give lists uh to to to which numbers are going to be attacked at any given moment and then people are expected to move but the problem really being as I mentioned is there is where to go and many people not knowing where to move to uh and and also becoming increasingly tired from the on going bombardment and and not knowing you know where to go to feeling that they have nowhere else to run the W's Rebecca RS in Jerusalem thanks so much
