We Begin the day with the numbers needed to wage and win a war Israel says its military has enough weapons and Munitions to press ahead with an offensive in the southern Gaza City of Rafa now this comes after a warning from US President Joe Biden that Washington could cut some weapons exports to Israel if the offensive goes ahead the fear of course massive civilian casualties in Rafa or tens of thousands of people are thought to be leaving Rafa looking for Safe Haven and for most this is not the first time that they've had to do this fleeing the fighting in Rafa the kafana family is once again on the Move they're headed to canun but fear what they will find there canun area is safe but there's no life there they tell us to go to conun okay so it's a safe place but it doesn't have any water or any food or drink or Aid or anything we don't know what to do Israel had previously labeled Rafa as a safe Zone more than a million people have been Sheltering there now it's Israel's latest Battle Zone it says the city is a stronghold for Hamas militants tanks Patrol Eastern districts and air strikes are escalating with children among the victims the Israeli Army struck us with two missiles without warning this is a criminal act eight people were martyred among them were little children who had nothing to do with any of this further restrictions on Aid are making life even worse Israel has shut off the vital rougher border crossing leaving Supply warehouses virtually empty and bringing hospitals to the brink of collapse the most important element what we all need Ur is fuel fuel fuel fuel then of course also for humanitarian AIDS but also staff movement and metac so I want to stress again without fuel all the humanitarian operations including Hospital operation they come to a Hal in the South uh our estimation is that hospitals only have fuel for two to 3 days uh left the United States has repeatedly warned Israel against a fullscale offensive in Rafa and has halted some arms deliveries Israel though remains defiant and shows no signs of giving in to International pressure all right let's get some more analysis now with Marina Marone she's from the war studies department at Kings College London Mara it's good to see you again so I mean I'll start by just asking you do we know I mean has the invasion of Rafa has it begun good evening Brent well that's a great question because uh there is some unclarity in terms of what the IDF is doing it seems like it it it's having some clashes in eastern Rafa with Hamas militants however we cannot say that the full scale incursion of Rafa has already started and um some that this might be a way to push Hamas to actually agree to Israeli conditions of the deal for ceasefire so it might be something like a show of force which is of course complicating Israel's position on an international stage giving the fact that the US wants to limit its arms shipments to Israel if that operation is to take place if it goes beyond being a show of force and we're talking about a full-fledged Invasion a ground defensive against Rafa how do you foresee it progressing it will be very difficult for the IDF and I know that Israel said that it would be very Surgical and very targeted however it seems like an oxymoron in an urban environment to have a targeted operation because the idef would have to operate amongst civilians where Hamas militants most likely dressed in in in civilian clothes so it's very difficult to distinguish them from um Regular civilians on the one hand on the other hand the threat would be coming from anywhere so this is a multidirectional threat they will have to go very slowly section by section bearing in mind that there is always a possibility of collateral damage and there will be essentially collateral damage because we know the Israeli IDF is using Air Force as well as artillery so it will be a very slow and painful operation and I think the best approach for the IDF would be going sections by sections and trying to move civilians somehow out of the way but there is no good approach and I don't think they have a real plan as at this stage and and and what about the role of the United States and particularly the the warning from US President Biden that if you do go into Rafa the United States May hold back some of its weapons shipments to Israel and is that going to change Israel's abilities at all in an offensive against Rafa absolutely I think it will be very impactful because as for now Israel still has enough um munition to hold North and to conduct its limited operations around Rafa however if the US is not to supply Israel from an Israeli point of view they see it as an existential fight which could be lost because they will not have enough Munitions in order to pursue the remaining four Hamas battalions in Rafa so that could potentially the entire operation from from the Israeli perspective let's let's assume that the the weapons are there in the number needed Israel says that Rafa is home to hamas's last remaining battalions do you agree with what we've were're hearing from Israel that Rafa really would be hamas's Last Stand it is a very good question I don't know what kind of intelligence um Israel has on on the numbers that are still left but we know that the um IDF has just now closed the Crossing with Egypt so there was this assumption that Hamas was getting its weapons from uh from Egypt therefore I think it's very likely that some Hamas Fighters might have escaped as well and and and have um other occupied other locations outside of the Gaza Strip so in in theory if it's all sealed off at Le Hamas Fighters uh who are in Rafa could be eliminated by Israeli Armed Forces however we don't know if we're talking about the entirety of Hamas and we also have to understand that the cause might live on and others might take up arms in name of Hamas yeah that's that's a good point um what happens though if Israel says that it is going to um achieve its goal of completely destroying Hamas and it's going to do that but it's going to need weapons enough weapons if it says that to the United States in your professional opinion can you imagine the United States withholding weapons and letting Israel not achieve the goal of destroying Hamas well I think the United States uh is in a very difficult position and I think uh Jordan has expressed these concerns because the United States on the one hand supporting Israel and is willing uh to send weapons on the other hand um they are criticizing Israel for what is happening in Rafa and and in Gaza in humanitarian terms so I think that um especially pre-election it will be a very difficult choice in terms of how the United States might resolve this situation but I think they will have to try and exert enough pressure on Israel in order to resolve the humanitarian situation first before any military action can take place and I see us involvement in in this specific operation as well in a humanitarian role and I think that might be a way forward in order to get around this as not to endanger Israel's survival which is from Israeli perspective is what it is what it's fighting for in Gaza and without risking the lives of all those civilians who are trapped in Gaza Marina from Kings College London Marina as always we appreciate your time and your insights tonight thank you thank you for having me I'm joined Now by Laura Blumenfeld she is a Middle East analyst she served in the US state department as a senior policy adviser for that region and she joins me tonight from Washington DC lord it's good to have you back on the program with this US President Biden says that the United States will withhold more weapons Israel mounts this ground operation in Rafa I'm wondering how big is this stick I mean is this enough to make Israel back down I mean from Biden's point of view this is like a friends don't let friends drive drunk moment he's taking away the keys so to speak um for Netanyahu you know he's standing on the side of the road and saying I still got to get home and we'll do it with or without you um as you know you know he the Israelis have abandonment ISS issues Netanyahu spoke about that right to that point on Holocaust Memorial Day he he gave a speech this week where he said there were times when the Jews stood alone in the world no one came to our Aid and we will not be defenseless again so he's really driving hard Netanyahu on this period of holidays they call it the days of awe which start on Holocaust Memorial Day they take you up to uh Memorial Day for soldiers right up to Israel Independence Day so he's kind of working with that calendar to make a political point which of course has military implications yeah the military implications here Biden has said that the United States will not withhold defensive weapons like those used for Israel's Iron Dome for example could that change you know of all the bad case scenarios and believe me I'm contemplating them I don't see him pulling back on defensive weapons I mean even with the with the again remember we're talking only about a pause on offensive weapons you had Senators lining up Republican Senators you know basically saying that the president is is abandoning a key Ally and it could have implications for other allies around the world I mean the world is watching other countries if we're saying you know we're going to put a dent in this Ironclad Alliance what does it mean for other countries can you rely on America are they that dependable State and what about the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he says that Israel will stand alone if it has to can it really though stand alone I mean how far can it push this war without its most important Ally right well the IDF the Israel Defense Forces are heavily dependent on the United States for weapons um you know $3.8 billion dollar a year uh dollars a year they receive in in military assistance I I think well right here he's kind of channeling Mackie AI a little bit and he's he's just saying to himself you know you need to treat your enemies generous or destroy them all together because if you injure them only slightly they'll come back um to to to seek revenge and if you don't they won't be able to and I think he sees senoir really as a kind of fight to the Finish and maybe he's hoping I don't know in his calculation that President Biden won't even be the US president in a couple of months yeah I want going to pick up on that I mean what is at stake for Joe Biden domestically right now particularly if he holds a red line with Israel well it's a very tricky pivot for Biden because he has been the most pro-israel president um in US history and he's been accused of you know being genocide Joe and then you have the folks who who were happy with his support for Israel saying you know hey you were way to go Joe and where are you now um they're saying that he's kind of a you know he's first was talking about the two-state solution and now it's a two-face solution there are two bidens the one who gave that tremendous speech just a few days ago about the rise of anti-Semitism and then the Joe Biden who said no more offensive weapons I would argue that he's more of a father Abraham figure and he sees both Palestinians and Israelis as his children who are fighting and he he's a man of tremendous empathy and it's just hard on him to watch the images coming out of Gaza where where so many civilians are dying and he cares deeply I saw him wipe a tear from the corner of his eye when he talked about uh visiting Israel in the days in the aftermath of October 7th and seeing a picture of an Israeli mother burned to death while she was tied together with her daughter I mean this is real and I do think that a lot of this some of some he does uh he is motivated by politics but also by the personal as well yeah that's a very good point we want to remind our viewers you're a bestselling author you've written a book about revenge for for acts of violence so I want to ask you what strikes you about the way Israel is pursuing its war against tamas for the attacks of October the 7th well I think what's really interesting is you know immediately following October 7th um President Biden said you need to learn from our mistakes in Afghanistan and not not kind of follow our path um but what he seems to be advocating for now if you watched his interview on CNN he said you know we wanted to get Bin Laden and we can help you get senoir so in an interesting way the president is advocating for personal Revenge rather than military retaliation it's an interesting pivot yeah it's it's interesting point that you bring up um you were a policy adviser to the US state department on Middle East and the peace process so let me ask you do you see a path for the end of the war in Gaza and do you think the two-state solution still has any life left in it well I think it's going to take a lot of diplomatic finesse and frankly a lot of emotional intelligence this war it hasn't been a World War but all of us the whole world has been at War emotionally because of the the impact of social media um I think one way that you can get the Israelis to kind of look more toward a two-state solution is rather than framing it as an opportunity of normalization with Saudi Arabia which of course is important right now I think they do want to just clobber somebody if you framing as a fight against Iran um and you know talk about this kind of Coalition of coexistence to push back on the axis of resistance that is a point on a on the horizon I could see the Israelis aiming for right now given their emotional state and you have to take into account the Palestinian trauma as well it is unprecedented and so we need to kind of move forward delicately Laura bloomenfeld joining us tonight from Washington DC lorda we appreciate your time and your analysis tonight thank you thank you
