negotiations over a plan to end the war in Gaza are scheduled to start in Kat today the region is on edge as Israel awaits retaliation from Iran after the killing of Hamas political leader Ismael hania in tan negotiators want to use a plan put together by the Biden administration at the end of May and endorsed by the UN Security Council it calls for a six we ceasefire in Gaza Hamas would release its remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners isra would allow in unlimited Aid deliveries and its forces would withdraw from Gaza but Hamas says it's losing faith in the US as a mediator and will not attend the talks the top official in Kata for the Palestinian militant group whose October 7th terror attack sparked the war said Hamas was still willing to be briefed afterward on the discussed points we expect to be told by the mediators that Israel has accepted what is being offered and any meeting should be based on talking about implementation mechanisms and setting deadlines rather than negotiating something new otherwise Hamas finds no reason to participate our correspondent fedix Thomson joins us now from Jerusalem Felix ceasefire talks are set to continue today in Qatar but as we heard Hamas is not taking part in those talks given that what's the prospect of reaching any meaningful agreement well I think the mediators are sort of counting on progress being made with Israel uh for them then to uh be to get in contact with Hamas whose representatives are in Doha anyways um it's going to be interesting to see how this pans out here in Israel several uh media Outlets are reporting on these negotiations as the last chance of reaching a deal uh we've been hearing that before it needs to be said but at the same time it is a crucial day for the negotiations when it comes to a possible ceasefire in Gaza now the mediators uh includes the US Egypt and katar they say they only need to work out the details of implementation of the deal that's already on the table so what are the sticking points there well there are several uh issues uh in those negotiations first of all um the issue of the uh Israelis uh being held hostages in Gaza Israel would like to receive a list of the some 30 um hostages uh released uh alive which Israel demands to be released alive Hamas only wants to release such a list after an General agreement will be made there's also the issue of the so-called Philadelphia Corridor which is in principle the uh border area between uh the Gaza Strip and Egypt which has been a sort of Lifeline for uh Hamas in terms of uh getting uh both goods and army material into the Gaza Strip which Israel doesn't want to leave uh without any sort of um any sort of overview of everything that's going on there and the last point which is uh also a very important sticking point here is the issue of the return of Palestinians uh to the north of the Gaza Strip Israel would like to have some sort of a mechanism which control the returning Palestinians to make sure um no armed people make it through whereas Hamas is a bit more uh critical about that it remains to be seen whether any U any progress will be made as the negotiations go on today getting the hostages back of course is a huge priority for Israel uh what kind of pressure is the hostage situation putting on Netanyahu the Israeli leader to come to an agreement here I think we have two uh elements of this sort of pressure uh you mentioned first of all we have pressure within Israel uh the um the U Mo most of the hostages families are putting lots of public pressure on prime minister netan and the Israeli government to get a deal done it needs to be said that most of the Israeli public uh supports such a deal at the same time there's pressure from the outside as well um inter the uh mediators and uh European countries which are allies to Israel such as uh Germany um have been uh demanding such a deal um and of course above all there's the issue of the Iranian retaliation um over the killing of uh isia the Hamas leader looming above all and I think um this results are too uh to pressure system over the Israeli government and it remains to be seen whether this would bring us uh to a situation where an agreement or some sort of a frame agreement will be reached today Fenix thank you very much that was our correspondent Phenix tamsett in Jerusalem let's get some analysis now from Professor Yosi melag he's uh with the Middle East and North Africa program at the thinked tank chadam house thanks for being with us y see this deal being ctin Doha has been on the table for months already why are we suddenly seeing movement in these negotiations now what's changed good morning I think the main change is that the International Community is is losing its patience with with both sides and it wants to see it wants to see a ceasefire the release of the hostages humanitarian Aid enter into Gaza and and most importantly start looking to the day after the end of the of the war but what happened right now is because there is it connected closely linked also with an expected attack by Iran and kisala either at the same time simultaneously or separately on Israel as a result of Israel two assassination one in in in Beirut and the other in Teran of of the leader of Hamas Ismael and officially inut so I I think right now the link between reaching such an agreement with averting such an attack that can drag the entire Middle East in into a full-blown War so there is fresh momentum here uh how much negotiating power though does Hamas have left at this point given all of the defeats that it suffered so far I think mainly it's it's main C is the hostages it's holding 120 around 120 hostages we don't know how many of them are still alive and I think the pressure also mounting inside Israel to reach an agreement in the release of the hostages which the Nano government is delaying delaying and putting new condition every time there is there is the the Biden proposal that n was was behind it and drafting it and then he started delaying and the government delaying because of the pressure of the farai not to reach such an agreement they put a priority on on maintaining the war against Hamas then the release of of of the hostages I think this card is still is still a strong one in the end of Hamas but Hamas needs the end of of of the war because of the suffering of of the people in Gaza at one point this Con against the organization but also bear in mind in recent we lost many of its its leadership yeah how difficult do you think it will be to reach a meaningful deal under these circumstances extremely difficult I think we shouldn't underestimate because as it stands it doesn't seems while the the world has this sense of urgency to reach an agreement and a a war also original War ending the war in Gaza that already claimed the life of some many innocent people I think the leadership itself don't share the sense of urgency and definitely in the case of nanal he is afraid of his his government collapsing as a result of an agreement the far right in the government keep saying that it would leave in case of such of such an agreement at the same time they're provoking for instance by praying in the in in Temple mountain in Jerusalem is a sheer provocation of of the Muslim world so there are parallel conversation within Israeli politics that make it more and more difficult to reach an agreement what role is the United States playing in all of this now it's been pressuring Israel and Hamas of course to come to the negotiating table but Hamas is uh is skeptical about having the us as a mediator in this negotiation where is the US standing this now I think we have to look at the three mediator as one package it's it's the United States Egypt and catar and at the end of the day whether the Hamas trust the United States or not they understand that the main country that put pressure on the on the netan government to reach an agreement is the United States also recognize that the United States right now is different from the one that was few weeks ago when we thought that President Biden would run for a second term I think a is is fa now to express his opinions about the netan government is's highly critical of it and at the same time we see also that vice president Kamala haris who is going to run on behalf of the Democrats is she's more worried about how the progressive voters in the United States would react in the election if there is no CIS fire I think in this sense Hamas needs to accept that if it wants a c it wants a deal it goes to Washington Yosi thank you very much for that that was Yosi melar of chadam house
