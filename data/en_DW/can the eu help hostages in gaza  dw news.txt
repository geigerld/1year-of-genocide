Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out a broader ceasefire in Gaza unless the nearly 240 hostages taken by Hamas are freed the families of some of those taken uh captive were in Brussels to ask EU lawmakers to help secure the release of their loved ones aan is just 12 years old the last time he was seen alive was on the day Hamas militants broke in into his home in kibuts near Oz on October 7 he was driven into Gaza on the back of a motorcycle this is his aunt ayella she has a special bond with him because he was born on her 30th birthday he loves animals all his pictures is with animals he sees the weak I hope that he gets the strength thanks to help the weak there I know that tan is alive I know I know etan's father Ohad has also not been seen since the day of the attack in the chaos of the violence the family were separated it's believed he's also being held in Gaza this is just one family story others are here too they've come to the European Parliament to ask for help to get their loved ones released Yoni asha's wife and daughters who are 4 and 2 years old are German citizens is this passport German passport it's a piece of paper it has any value if it's just a piece of paper why does people need it the families delivered passionate pleas and the message was heard they want also the European Union the European institutions our countries to be involved in the negotiations to release them we have to be part of that European politicians U members of the commission from the council that we all have to do our part also in this process why has Europe not been doing that I think that right now is the Israeli government who is doing this uh negotiations I don't know but I think that we should ask to be also part of this for Ayala every day that passes is a day too long I can't even find the world words of what I'm feeling Ohad is my older brother is I admire him he's my best friend I miss andan [Music] he's just small boy that I can't believe that he's on these monsters hands we are in a nightmare but she still has hope it's help she's asking for and aler spoke to our correspondent Rebecca Rus in Jerusalem and I asked her about reports that talks are underway involving the potential release of several hostages in return for a temporary pause in fighting well despite that we're hearing that the talks are ongoing Israel of course not directly involved in the talks with Hamas but working through intermediaries from Qatar and Egypt they have been instrumental in the hostage releases that have happened so far unfortunately we've not seen many and of course there's hope that there will be more now this particular deal uh involves about 10 to 15 people with we believe that they are said to uh that they will release uh in return for a 48 to 72-hour ceasefire in hostilities in order to allow for the for Aid to be brought into Gaza Strip uh as you say Israel Contin continues to say that they have no intention of any ceasefire until all the hostages have been released but they are under a lot of pressure uh to to make sure that some host the hostages all of the hostages come out alive so I think if a deal were presented to them where some hostages were able to come out they they would consider it despite uh words to the contrary but at the moment we all we know is that these talks we're hearing are ongoing but getting accurate information about just where they're at is incredibly difficult Rebecca the Israeli military says that tens of thousands are now fleeing from northern Gaza because Hamas has quote lost control there what's the latest on the offensive yeah well we're seeing those pretty extraordinary images of thousands of people fleeing from the north to the South yesterday we saw around about 50,000 people making that treacherous Journey now these uh so-called safe routes uh are open for several hours during the day and they have been for a couple of days now though yesterday was the largest number that we've seen as I said about 50,000 up from around 15,000 people the day before now militarily we know that the military have for a couple of days now encircled Gaza City and they're starting to make that push into the city they've also completely cut off the north from the south uh and so they say that Hamas has lost control in the northern part of the strip they also this morning have said that they've made uh Headway and they've in fact taken over a stronghold in the jabalia refugee camp a Hamas stronghold I should say uh so you know they're pushing ahead with their military aims but these so-called safe routes these safe corridors have open for several hours each day and as you can see people trying to make the most of them though as we know even when they get to the South these areas are not safe and in fact there really is no safe place for people in
