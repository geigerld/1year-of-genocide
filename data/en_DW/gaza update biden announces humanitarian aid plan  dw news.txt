US President Joe Biden has unveiled a plan to allow humanitarian Aid deliveries into the Gaza Strip through Egypt Israel has confirmed a limited number of trucks will be allowed into the besieged territory beginning on Friday Israel has launched air strikes against Gaza and sealed off the territory from supplies since Hamas militants entered Israel two weeks ago and killed at least 1,400 people the UN says more than 3,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then kinds of trucks containing aid for Gaza stretching as far as the eye can see the truck drivers are waiting and praying to pass through Rafa border crossing Israel's announcement that it will not stop Aid entering Gaza could be the key to unlocking the borderers gates and will be sorely needed on the other side of the Border in the town of Rafa fuel is in very short supply gin have no gas or electricity to cook so they using wood burning ovens of commercial bakeries to make bread instead no electricity no gas and no fuel the situation is very hard and there's no wood I have no idea how the owner of the bakery managed to get wood it's the only place where we can bake bread we've gone back in time meanwhile on the road leading from Southern Gaza Strip to the north there are physical reminders of air strikes everywhere buildings flattened and reduced to Rubble the road leads to Gaza City and the scene of what has become a hotly disputed event the blast at alahi Arab Hospital Hamas officials say it was the result of an Israeli air strike Israel say was caused by a rocket from Palestinian militants that misfired no matter who was responsible the explosion has left gazin angry at Israel and in fear I'm afraid that they will bomb hospitals this is very far from mercy and Humanity they are the enemy this was the scene near Gaza City's Port area a three-story building destroyed in an air strike Witnesses said the blast killed 40 people from One extended family who lived here or trap them under Rubble it's a reminder of what has become daily routine for gazin the search for the dead and the lucky survivors Let's cross over two gazen now hen Bala is a journalist he joined us now on the phone from there ham what are you hearing about Aid deliveries being allowed through the rougher Crossing into Gaza well um up to now it's up to uh statements nothing uh got into Gaza there are a lot of statements from uh whether from Egyptian side or American side as well as the Israeli government statement that they wouldn't allow for Aid to come from Israel but they wouldn't stop the the um the aid that comes to uh s Gaza STP from Egypt um up to now I checked with the officials in Gaza nothing has been um uh delivered or across intoa uh STP okay so nothing is moving yet how badly are the current shortages in Gaza hitting those around you it is it is very hard and very tough uh it's getting harder day by day um there is a very limited um uh uh access to water and drinking water is is like it's um uh very very hard to get and no uh no electricity at all uh sometimes people I queing at the some places like pharmacies or grocery shops who have uh um uh solar panels to so they charge their their mobile phones or their equipment there is like long cues at the bakeries as one of the bakeries in my area like in was bombed last night or the night before actually um um um it's f is is very limited because the movement of trucks is very hard from different from City to another um we are talking about according to the official number about 1 million at least um uh has been displaced uh from their homes to different areas with the very limited access many people are staying at Ona facilities and they barely get some some some food and some help from the um the hona uh has I I wanted to ask you about that explosion at a hospital in Gaza City that's drawn Global attention uh how are gazin reacting to that ham are you still with us I believe we've lost the line to ham that was uh journalist ham baloa speaking to us in Gaza he's a journalist based there and has been providing us with reporting well we uh also have a team in Jerusalem in uh also in Tel Aviv our correspondent Rebecca ritters is in Jerusalem right now uh Rebecca President Biden US President Joe Biden says some humanitarian Aid will be delivered to Gaza through the Rafa border on Friday but explain to us why has Israel so far been so reluctant to allow Aid into Gaza well there are s reasons Terry one being that Israel is really just focused on its uh War aims of trying to completely destroy the Hamas organization its military capabilities and that has been its main focus uh the they're also using this Siege we know that very very early on I think it was the second the second or third day they announced this Siege on Gaza that they would there would be no food fuel uh electricity would be cut uh there would be no water that everything would be cut and nothing would go into Gaza and they're using that also as one of their tactics now concerns about getting Aid in have also been spoken about you know people are worried that the aid people in Israel excuse me are worried that the aid will get into the wrong hands that it will actually get to to the Hamas militants and there's concerns also uh from the Israelis that there could be things other than Aid inside those trucks perhaps weapons perhaps possibility to to rearm or to resupply some Hamas militants so those concerns have definitely been uh spoken about from the Israelis now what's changed now is that President Biden visited yesterday and he really pushed for some Aid to be allowed and the Israelis have relented Benjamin nanah who saying that he will no longer block aid from coming in but it is thought that there'll be an initial uh small tranch of trucks that will be allowed over some 20 or so there are around 200 now amassing at that raer Crossing uh wai to go in as we heard in that report but an initial uh tranch of 20 or so will go in and the process will be uh witnessed they'll be we see where the aid is going whether it's distributed correctly according to Israel and then whether or not they'll allow more to go through it's thought that that should happen uh as soon as tomorrow but time is of the essence as you heard from Ham there what are the conditions Rebecca for those Aid deliveries at least for these initial 20 trucks that are going to be allowed into Gaza apparently well incredibly difficult and that is part of the reason for the hold up part of the reason why it's not happening straight away obviously everything is being inspected in in the trucks as we're hearing but also that the conditions on the Garen side are particularly difficult that area around the rougher Crossing hasn't been spared air strikes and they're trying to work to try and fill some of the potholes some of the the damage that has been down to the road on the Garen side in order for those trucks to be able to pass now the uh Hospital blast in Gaza City that's drawn so much attention it's sparked more anger and fear in the Gaza Strip itself uh Israel claims it was not behind the blast is there any independent investigation underway Rebecca to determine what actually happened at that hospital as you can imagine Terry the conditions to allow for an independent investigation are incredibly difficult investigators are not able to access certainly not able to get into Gaza and certainly not able to get to the site so investigations are underway there are many independent investigations also journalists looking at the available data that we that we have there is video there's video of the of the the B the bombing and and and other evidence and and people are trying to independently verify that the UK uh says that it's going to carry out an independent investigation the UN and many other countries are calling for such an independent investigation but so far there's been no outcome officially from any independent investigations and and that will be ongoing Rebecca thank you very much for now DW's Rebecca ritters in
