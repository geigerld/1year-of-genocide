Israel's prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu says his country has entered the second stage of the war with Hamas after ramping up ground operations in Gaza speaking with war cabinet minister Benny Gant and defense minister yav galand Netanyahu described the conflict as Israel's second war of independence he said their goal was to destroy hamas's military capabilities and its control of the Gaza Strip Israel again warned civilians to evacuate the northern part of the besieged territory Israel's Defense Forces have continued intense bombing of the Gaza Strip ignoring international calls for a humanitarian ceasefire cell phone and internet services are gradually being restored in Gaza having been knocked out gazans taken the devastation caused by Israel's heaviest attacks yet on Gaza the bombardment flattening more homes destroying some of the last refuges for families seeking SA safety from the violence Israel says its troops are now on the ground in Gaza amid a quote new phase in its war on the islamist militant group Hamas the Israel Defense Forces told gazin to move South immediately but it's a warning many may not receive with almost all Communications to The Enclave knocked out the bombing of the Telecommunications infrastructure places the civilian population in grave danger ambulances and civil defense teams are no longer able to locate the injured or thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble and civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger and as the destruction and Gaza and intensifies those fleeing are running out of places to go I'm driving people who want to leave con yunus they're afraid of the dire situation the bombing is indiscriminate neither children nor adults are spared nor women or the elderly no one the Hamas lead Health authorities report more than 7,700 people have died so far in the attacks a devastating toll which is likely to rise as Israel's military pushes further into Gaza Rebecca ridders is in ashdod in southern Israel Rebecca you describe the sights and sounds of the beginning of this escalation yesterday what's happening there today well Anthony as we now know as was confirmed by prime minister Benin Netanyahu last night we are seeing the second phase of this war and that began on Friday evening with the the beginnings of a ground invas Israeli troops entering Gaza not just for these so-called limited raids that they've been doing in the lead up to Friday night but now something more permanent accompanied by the heaviest bombardment in the strip that we've seen so far in 3 weeks of war that was followed by last night also an incredibly heavy bombardment from where we were standing in the city of stot just a couple of kilometers from the Gaza border you can actually feel the waves from the air strike so imagining what it must be like as a civilian in Gaza in the dark with at last night no Communications waiting to see whether one of those strikes was going to hit your building it's really impossible to imagine to put yourself in those shoes uh we know that from benim Netanyahu that this is going to be uh a long operation as he was saying last night that this is going to take a long time there are a couple of scenarios that people are talking about that we're looking at and that's whether or not they will continue with this kind of uh limited ground Invasion and try and do smaller incursions into areas we know that they're trying to dismantle part of the tunnel networks and that they're obviously trying to get to as many Hamas militants to try and uh take away their military capabilities while at the same time balancing the hostage situation more than 200 Israeli hostages still in that Gaza Strip area they still don't know exactly where they are and obviously don't want to do as limit limited damage to to to the people the Israelis are there who are who are potentially in those tunnels so we've with that's one scenario or the fact that they might be Paving the way for what will be uh a bigger ground Invasion we know that there are hundreds of thousands of troops uh amassed at the border ready to go in and a lot of equipment as well and as I said Benjamin Netanyahu is saying this is going to take a very long time we see that the military have said that that without a ground invasion they can't achieve their goals so it is expected that that might happen and we're seeing calls again uh for civilians who still might be in the north to head further south to relative relatively safe safer areas Rebecca there are reports uh from afar that communication networks in Gaza are returning is that what you're hearing as well yes we've had uh confirmation from one of the providers in uh the Gaza Strip that they are Resto slowly restoring uh Communications there I haven't been able to contact anybody that uh we're in contact with so far but that has been pretty constant over the last three weeks as people try and desperately seek charging stations they going to local shops where they might have a solar panel charging station that they can use so people with very limited electricity also not being able to connect to networks but we are seeing that the power is slowly uh sorry that the telecommunication services are slowly being restored that was a real concern uh the few people that could get messages out either via satellite or perhaps with an Israeli SIM card or foreign SIM card were were um you know speaking of Intolerable conditions and not being able to communicate with friends or loved ones to find out if they're okay and also of course the much much needed Emergency Services not being able to be contacted or told where to go when air strikes were happening so that is uh a small sliver of good news this morning Rebecca ridders from ashd in southern Israel thanks so much for some analysis of the latest developments we can talk to military expert Mike Martin of King's College in London welcome to you Mike I wonder what is Israel's strategy now in what it calls the the second stage of this operation in Gaza it's very difficult to get precise information but it does appear that uh Israel rather than launching a full invasion is is having an incursion and it seems like there will be a series of incursions over the coming weeks and months where they move into an area and try and control it um and that's really I guess reflective of the fact that it's incredibly difficult to move in the Urban Terrain Hamas is very well prepared it's been there for 30 years there are extensive tunnel systems and so I think Israel has to will be looking to move into small areas at a time and then and then move forward from that Mike exactly how difficult is it going to be uh you outlined some of the the terrain there for us as this Israeli operation shifts right down onto street level in Gaza well Israel has set out a goal of completely destroying Hamas and that's basically impossible in a military sense it's an Insurgent or militant or a terrorist group call it what you like uh it's completely mixed in with the civilian population and there's all of this infrastructure there's 30 years of infrastructure that Hamas had been building above ground below ground and and as as Israel for instance destroys buildings which we've seen lots of photos of they become very easy structures to defend and so there is no military way to completely destroy Hamas the president of Iran has said that Israel has crossed what he called a red line now how serious are those words how serious of a threat is that I I think we have to take comments from the Iranian leadership as being mostly aimed at their own population Iran as your viewers will probably know have had a number of problems recently over for example the wearing of the hijab so there's quite a lot of unrest in Iran and so the war one way of viewing the war for the Iranian leadership is that it's a useful distraction from its own domestic troubl so when it talks of red lines and ramping up the pressure on Israel uh it's often aimed at its own domestic population that it's having problems with how significant Mike is the buildup of Hardware from the United States uh and their Naval their naval fleet so I think I think there's two things really uh first is it's a big signal so uh the president of turkey's been making comments over the last 24 hours so it's a signal to him not to get involved it's a signal to the Iranians not to get their proxies like Hezbollah uh too active and too involved and also what it does is it gives the Americans options so they've got two aircraft carrier groups there a number of missile firing destroyers and what you know particularly with the hostage situation or with perhaps some of the Iranian proxies again Hezbollah um it just gives the Americans options for dealing with for example rocket attacks or for perhaps launching operations to try and get some of those hostages back Mike Martin in London thank you so much thank
