now as the number of so-called safe zones shrinks in Gaza the United Nations is warning that anarchy is spreading across the strip senior UN agency officials say the lack of local law enforcement and basic supplies is pitting people against one another that's leading to rampant looting unlawful killings and shootings people in Gaza are constantly on the Move seeking safety from the bombings the elements and more and more from each other United Nations staff say nearly the entire population has been driven from their homes many displaced several times and they warn desperate living conditions have led to a breakdown in Civic order and widespread lawlessness there is looting mob Justice extortion of money family disputes random shootings fighting for space and resources and we see youths armed with sticks Manning barricades the UN says continued bombardments severe overcrowding and shortages of basic supplies are the main drivers of the chaos shelter the creation of these conditions has led to the predictable and entirely foreseeable unraveling of the fabric of society in Gaza setting people against one another in a fight for survival the un's regional director says nobody is enforcing Civic order so this is the Anarchy that we talk about and it's extremely dangerous as well and we need to pay attention here we want the police to be back on the street and to bring some order there this video released by the Israeli Army purportedly shows gunman seizing an aid truck in the Rafa area of Southern Gaza the UN says this is predictable given the circumstances and it's up to Israel to ensure the steady entry and delivery of daily Essentials this is the legal responsibility of Israel not just to facilitate Aid getting in but then to facilitate the safe distribution of that Aid none of these things have been happening for 9 months the UN wants an immediate end to the fighting to help rest public order and begin the mammoth task of rebuilding homes and lives Simon Maven is focused on the Middle East as a professor of international politics at Lancaster University in the UK welcome to DW Simon thanks so much for your time so we heard their suggestions of Anarchy in Gaza who would you say is responsible for Law and Order in Gaza right now well I don't think I think it's all L surprising that there is anarchy I mean after all this is a war zone there is Devastation there's been Devastation going on for 300 days if not even longer so I think that's the really important thing to remember that there is a specific context that play here now if we're talking about Law and Order in Gaza well I guess you would initially say that it would be the the governing body the the organization that is responsible for uh for for imposing order but that would be Hamas now Hamas is engaged in a struggle a violent struggle against Israel of course Israel is is engaging militarily in the Gaza Strip and so that makes it incredibly difficult for the daytoday organization of security those uh individuals who had been operating in the Gaza security forces have obviously been coopted into the direct struggle against Israel so it's an incredibly difficult thing that has has diverted resources away from the provision of Civic safety would you say that this was an inevitable situation the security situation that we're seeing on the ground now I I think sadly yes it was in the sense that when conflict breaks out and it breaks out in an all consum way with a a force that is hugely disproportionate on the ground and imposing their own vision of order at odds with the indigenous way of doing politics then it becomes incredibly difficult for the normal rhythms of life to continue and when you factor in the huge numbers of people that are struggling for food for shelter that are suffering from malnutrition from basic health issues um children are struggling with diarrhea with with dehydration it's 32 degrees in Gaza right now but there is no clean water there is a a real challenge for people there if we can talk about security I mean we saw in our report there the images provided by Israel of an aid truck that was allegedly commandeered by gunmen in Gaza what kind of security is there for Aid deliveries for Aid workers well that's been a bit of a tricky one in the sense that that is also Up For Debate there have been numerous uh debate and argument between the UN and the Israelis over what level of security what level of protection should and can be given to these Aid uh convoys it's incredibly important to get the aid in now the UN is saying that the the the aid has been made more challenging because of the the Israeli approach to getting uh the right level of security in on the on the grounds of the the trucks but the Israelis are saying that that this is not the case that this is Hamas and I think what that does is it points to the The Wider battle about how this is all being told this is also a battle about the narratives it's about what stories each side is is telling about what is going on and unfortunately it's the people of Gaza the 500,000 people in Gaza that are on the brink of a pretty devastating starvation that are the ones really suffering right now Simon if we can look to the Future what about in the longer term what is the future of Law and Order in Gaza I guess all of that depends on what the next steps are for Gaza if there is a ceasefire or if there is a continuation of of the status quo if the continuation of the status quo uh takes the form of pre-october 7 then we see the Israeli occupation or the Israeli blockading of Gaza so security would then be be achieved by Israel in conjunction with a local Force previously this was the Palestinian Authority and but if it's a different type of political agreement if there is a ceasefire and steps taken towards a two-state solution towards the establishment of a Palestinian State then this would be the prerogative of a of a Palestinian force or indeed an international Force but unfortunately with the no no real sign of a ceasefire in sight it's incredibly difficult to to speculate beyond that Professor Simon Maven from Lancaster University in the UK okay thank you so much for your time
