the United Nations Agency for Palestinian refugees says a probe into whether some of its employees took part in the October 7th terror attack on Israel will report its findings by next month now the agency has been rocked by allegations made by Israel that at least 13 of its employees engaged in Terrorist acts last October and that hundreds more work for militant islamist groups including Hamas in the Gaza Strip some of the agencies biggest donors including the US and Germany suspended contributions because of these claims I'll be putting these allegations to the agency's former spokesman in just a moment but first here's what's being said right now and we have discovered uh in the last few weeks that unra officials were complicit in the massacre and I think it's time that the International Community in the UN itself understand that un's mission has to end the Secretary General notes that these accusations come at a time that un the largest un organization in the region is working under extremely challenging conditions and these people living here working here unra they are poisoning poisoning the head the brain of children in Jerusalem they are poisoning them against me against Israel against Jews we have currently 19 donors that have suspended funding the agency is able to continue providing Services until the end of March but then we have no longer visibility of how the operations will continue my next guest is Christopher gunnis the former spokesperson for the United Nations relief and works agency he is now executive director the Myanmar accountability project it's good to have you with us tonight there's a lot to talk about here thank you so much Israel has issued quite an indictment against your former place of employment um what do you have to say to this well Israel has produced some information I wouldn't use even the word indictment because it's clear from those who have seen this document and to be clear the dossier has never been handed over to unra either by the Israelis or by the major donors including the German government so to be clear the dossier as it's so called and those who have seen it can confirm does not actually have evidence to link un staff members to the actual massacr so there may be circumstantial evidence but it's very clear that the description of this as a dodgy dossier in reference to the dossier that tonney Blair used to take Britain to war in Iraq is perhaps the right description of it there is no actual evidence there are accusations even the New York Times which which has been a willing accomplice to this piece of news management even the New York Times correspondent in Jerusalem has admitted that much of this information is basically an Israeli file that is unchecked it's uncorroborated Anthony blinkin himself has said that the great Security Service of the United States have been unable to confirm this information independently and yet for some reason he says he finds it compelling I mean I don't understand the logic I think that this decision was rushed I think it's disproportionate and I think it's punitive because we have to think of the people under huge stress in Gaza under what the icj has called a plausible genocide they're now potentially going to be dep sorry let me let me let me ask you did you expect this kind of accusation to come from Israel and did you expect it to come when it did well not at all um unra in May last year gave Israel a staff list of all of unra workers in the West Bank and in Gaza and Israel did not come back with any suspicions or accusations against any of the staff members that we handed over the list of and yet surprise surprise within about a day of the icj making the accusation that there's a plausible genocide case to be answered we have this piece of information coming out into the press the thing I would say though it's surprising to me because unra has a zero tolerance policy towards these um neutrality violations we work with our major donors including the German government we see this as a partnership with the German government so the failure such as it's being described is as much a failure of the German government that's worked with anra on these neutrality Frameworks as it is the staff un and let me say sorry after you I just want to say that what you're saying there you're you're you're saying that the vetting process for for all of of your team members for all of your employees that vetting process was complete and thorough that you don't have any doubts whatsoever that some people may have been able to sleep slip through unra runs the entire staff list through the security council's terrorism list and there were no matches but to be additionally careful as part of this Zero Tolerance policy that list was handed over to is in May 2023 and not a single issue was raised what more can I say and let me say this decision by the donors including Germany that gives unra 200 million euros each year is a violation of humanitarian principles of impartiality um it's also a a violation of international humanitarian law which forbids food Aid being used as a weapon of War it's a violation of the icj's interim provisional measures which made it clear that no member State should take any action that would limit humanitarian Aid and very lastly it's a violation potentially of the genocide convention which makes it an obligation of all state parties to prevent genocide so frankly Germany stands accused in my view of being complicit in a in a violation of a genocide convention and for a country like Germany with its history that is something which I think should be addressed I think there should be an investigation into whether Germany's humanitarian Aid was Ring fenced against political influence and I think that just as the donor such as Germany are pointing the finger at unra and saying well you've been politicizing your Aid what about Germany Germany is weaponizing unra and it's doing so let me say because Israeli far-right politicians are calling for anra to be dismantled to be dis to be defunded destroyed let me pick up on that I mean there are these calls for for to to be dismantled what would happen then to the civilians um in the Gaza Strip if if you're former agency if if they were not able to carry out what they're supposed to do well there are 1.2 million people on unus food distribution lists and they are facing starvation so that's why s Germany would be hell complicit um in the genocide in in the genocide because thousands of people may well starve to death the UN says 400,000 people are facing starvation imminently Germany would be complicit in that which as I say is a violation of the genocide but it's not just in Gaza Mr G let me just let me let me just let me just throw out let me just that that case is before the world court so um you know there has not been a a determination that genocide is happening there so we we don't want to throw that do that genocide as a case to answer we're not saying that anyone wants anyone to to to starve to death either my question question to you though is there is criticism coming that there may have been Hamas sympathizers within the ranks of unra um is it possible to rule that out completely as a reasonable person can you rule that out completely even the 12 people who were being accused that is 12 or 13 the figure keeps changing bad apples and they've not actually the investigation's not even over unra dismissed these people before investigation was over so you know if this if this were to be the case and it's not proven it would be a tiny tiny uh percentage of the staff this to me is proof that the zero tolerance policy is working that in somewhere as polarized as Gaza so few un staff members of C's by Israel to whom the staff list handed over last May the please there's lots to talk about I'm sure that we will have the opportunity to talk again unfortunately we're out of time we appreciate you taking the time to talk with usk tonight thank you pleasure good
