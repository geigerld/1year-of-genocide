US vice president Kamala Harris has held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House the presumptive Democratic nomy for president urged Israel's leader to agree to a truce in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages held by Hamas Harris said she had voiced her serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza to Israeli Prime Minister pamin Netanyahu Netanyahu is in Washington to shore up support for Israel's ongoing war against Hamas which came as a response to the militant islamist Terror attacks of October 7 last year here's more of what the vice president had to say it is important for the American people to remember the war in Gaza is not a binary issue however too often the conversation is binary when the reality is anything but so I ask my fellow Americans to help encourage efforts to acknowledge the complexity the nuance and the history of the region let us all condemn terrorism and violence let us all do what we can to prevent the suffering of innocent civilians and let us condemn anti-Semitism islamophobia and hate of any kind and let us work to unite our country I thank you let's get more from William glucoft Deputy editor of the parliament magazine in Brussels and DW correspondent a Ibrahim in Jerusalem good morning to you both William coming to you first what's your takeaway from Harris's comments and talks with Netanyahu the substance seemed much the same from what we've seen from the Biden Administration and really us administrations and US Politics on the Israel issue uh for a very long time but the style was different there was much more focus on the plight of Palestinian civilians on the devastation that we've seen in Gaza and the need to move forward on this crisis that it can't be a state of permanent war and just managing a conflict there needs to be an end to this conflict in one way shape or form uh the substance though is very much the same uh we're hearing you know still Ironclad commitments to Israel and the defense of Israel um so really the question just is how much does the style count how many points do you give for the style over the substance and that's something we're going to have to see uh in the weeks and months ahead and of course depending what actually happens with Kamala Harris's campaign and if she can actually pull off a win in November Aya how is the prime minister's visit playing out in Israel well as this his address in Congress was uh uh ongoing I was walking through the streets here in Jerusalem and people in cafes and corner stores were glued to the screens watching uh that speech here's the thing here in Israel regardless whether you believe in prime minister netanyahu's promise of total Victory or whether you are uh Pro a ceasefire deal as soon as possible people here are acutely aware of the importance of the United States as an ally uh for Israel and the power and the pressure that the United States and its officials can exert on uh Israeli on the Israeli government to to to to to move forward with the conduct of this war so definitely a very very closely watched uh visit uh we've heard from families of hostages who want uh American officials the president and the vice president to use their influence to try and get this deal done as the vice president uh just uh said there while there are others who want to who are a bit more uh closer to the demands of what prime minister Netanyahu uh uh of the demands that prime minister Netanyahu made in Congress namely to give more weapons uh and to according to him get the job uh uh done faster at the same time uh the Prime Minister made this visit to Washington at a time where his approval ratings are an all-time low up to 70% of Israelis According to some polls want to see him uh resign and he was really at ease and in his element giving that address in Congress getting that applaud that's not something that he gets here in Israel so he also used that um that used that visit to try to play up uh to play to his own uh uh uh audience and to his supporters here to show them that in Washington with America's uh with Israel's biggest Ally he's still someone who's very well connected and can speak uh uh to officials in a way that they will listen even give a standing ovation William you said earlier that the substance of Harris's comments were uh the similar to the policy uh from the Biden Administration but were kamla Harris to become president would her Administration have a slightly different policy on Israel well we'll have to wait and see of course if she even becomes president at all the Democrats right now are facing a really interesting inflection point in the history of US Israeli relations one is that the Arab American the Palestinian American uh community and those sympathetic to the Palestinian and Palestinian protection is actually a force to be reckoned with now after decades at a political level of them almost being silenced or sidelined and the the Israeli Lobby so strong on a bipartisan level there's almost no space for kind of any other uh viewpoints that's starting to crack a little bit and we don't know yet just how powerful they'll be we've seen some inklings of that in the Michigan primary where the uncommitted vote as a protest against Biden's support for Israel uh scored some enough points at least to you know make some waves and be a point uh of contention the so the question is which of these two powerful interest groups are going to be important and possibly decisive in the election in November for um for K Harrison if so if the the Palestinian voice can break through at a political level you're going to have to see more attention to that side of this conflict a the White House has told Netanyahu to get a ceas deal done could this visit push that deal over the line it's very difficult to tell we've been here before where we've seen the United States and other uh mediators try to push the Israeli government and Hamas for that matter to uh you know inch towards another hostage uh uh for prisoner exchange deal with some kind of cessation of hostilities uh so it's difficult to tell but certainly um the negotiations were set to start in Doha this week there was an Israeli delegation That was supposed to fly uh to Doha yesterday but according to Israeli media reports the Prime Minister prime minister Netanyahu asked them to delay their departure hoping uh because he wanted to speak to the president and the vice president uh before they could travel and start the negotiations and that's being heavily criticized here uh by families of hostages and their allies who say that the negotiation should by no means be a political uh trip for the prime minister to play during his visit in Washington and that that delegation should have already been uh on uh its way William glucoft from the parliament magazine in Brussels and DW correspondent a Abrahim in Jerusalem thank you both DW reporter Stephan Simons in Washington gave us his takeaways from what Kamala Harris had to say well let start with the obvious first that it was her and not President Biden who actually came out after a meeting with Benjamin nany the prime minister of Israel and made those remarks welcome to the United States in the presidential election year of 2024 that's number one number two she used um verbage terminology in a Clarity which we seldomly hear from the Biden Administration um and that is notable number three in my count here and that is really important I want to quote her she made sure that everybody understands that of course this Administration and including her um this throws unwavering uh support behind Israel in its right to defend itself Against Terror and War and everything else but she says it is also important how it's how it does so how it does so matters she said and that was really really impressive meaning here with the sound bite we have played before uh you have you got to me she really tries to be nuanced be actually acknowledge acknowledges the the complexity of the situation in the Middle East the complexity for Israel and the complexity resulting out of now war in Gaza since October 7th last year let's look uh Stephan a little more about the the contrast as you pointed out uh she said we cannot look away from the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza she also called for a ceasefire how much of a contrast are these words from VP Harris compared to President Biden well I have to tell you the truth I think this is what uh President Joe Biden and other Administration officials um tell Benjamin Nan or other Administration officials from Israel behind closed doors but that open now at this time this was Kamala Harris first coming out as presidential candidate on a foreign policy issue in that regard uh and that is remarkable and um you know we should take note of this however the United States and that includes the Biden Administration that includes Cala Harris and everybody else who's working in this Administration Secretary of State blinkin for example is still on the the the path of wanting a two-state solution first of all a ceasefire now a ceasefire deal which allows hostages to be released which allows gazin um residents to have a break for at least 6 weeks and then take it from there secondly and that is big picture thinking of the administration and of Kamala Harris is a two-state solution this is good old American Middle East policy which is not going to go away with Camala Harris or Joe Biden part of the big picture and what she alluded to was I asked my fellow Americans to help complexity and the nuance and history of the region it's a worthy sentiment uh but what does she want to achieve by saying this well I think honestly she is a little bit of catering to the potential voter voter block or voter segment Joe Biden may have has lost in in in the last few months by wavering around you know there is a movement which started in Michigan this is the uncommitted movement that counts now for 750,000 people who were uncommitted in putting their vote in or support for Joe Biden she wants those back and she also um tries to make sure that Americans understand that there is nothing not complicated about anything in the Middle East it's highly complex it is nuanced and politicians as well as the you and me American should be able to differentiate that's what she needs people to understand so she can make an argument that she is for absolute substantial and un wavering support for Israel on one hand and a good hard look and how Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israelis conduct this war in Gaza at the moment DW reporter Stephan Simons in Washington DC thank you so much
