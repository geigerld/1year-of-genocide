let's look northward now from Israel to Lebanon a region that has historically been a flasho we can now talk to Andrea tenente he's a spokesperson for the United Nations interim force in Lebanon better known as unifil he joins us from their headquarters in nakura in South Lebanon thanks for being with us Andrea describe for us the current situation at the border between Israel and Lebanon at the moment and I would say maybe even for the last couple of weeks even a little bit longer the situation has been tense and uh and highly volatile uh we have been having exchange of fire between along the Blue Line in this area between Lebanon and Israel there is no border between the two countries uh for the last two weeks and uh and sometimes very intense exchange of fires but I would say always very localized uh and between Lebanon Israel along the blue line no more than 5 to 10 kilomet so uh we have been monitoring at and we are present on the ground at the moment with our over 10,000 troops Israel has suggested that Hezbollah is dragging Lebanon into war do you see any evidence of that as I said the situation has been tense and very concerning because of this uh uh two weeks of exchange of fires but it's also important to um emphasize that uh that when we have our discussion with the parties uh with the Lebanese authorities with the Lebanese Army with the IDF that's one important role that the mission has to keep the dialogue ongoing to to send messages uh I don't feel that there is a real appetite for a for a larger conflict uh of course the problem Remains the error the the miscalculation but as of now it seems that as concerning as the situation is at the moment there is still some kind of hope that no one wants to escalate There's Hope but still a lot of fear and concern as you say there's talk of about the risk of this war spreading involving Lebanon and perhaps other actors in the region what would it mean not just for the region but for the rest of the world if this conflict were to spread as I said this events are very concerning because as you mentioned if the the the conflict expands and if conflicts become a wider conflict could have a huge impact and it could be a disaster uh for the not only for the the Lebanon and Israel but for the for for the region and and that's why the role not only of the UN at the moment that we are working of course day and night with our contingents on the ground with our Force Commander trying to deescalate the situation but the importance of the International Community uh involvement of the International Community to deescalate the situation and to have this mediation process very active I see everyone is very much involved and this is the only hope that we have that uh that we could get some kind of deescalation based on on Regional uh concerns but also uh mediation from from from everyone Andrea tenente spokesperson for the United Nations interim force in Lebanon thank you very much for talking with us thank
