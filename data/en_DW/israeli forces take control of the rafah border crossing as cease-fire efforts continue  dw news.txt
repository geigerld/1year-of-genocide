Israel's military has seized control of a key border crossing in Gaza it's released images of what it says are tanks rolling into Rafa in the south of the strip which is a vital crossing point for humanitarian Aid coming via Egypt the incursion has cast new doubt over whether a deal can be done over a proposed ceasefire with Hamas which is considered a terrorist organization by several countries despite that an Israeli delegation is heading to Cairo for talks after a night of celebrations Palestinians wake up to a familiar reality Israeli tanks Converge on the key raer border crossing the Israeli Army saying is taken control of the checkpoint Gaza side in the city of Rafa people are searching for bodies under the rubble following deadly Israeli strikes overnight heavy gunfire very very heavy bombardment with planes Rockets tanks machine guns never in my life have I seen this I'm almost 69 years old in my life I've never seen bombings like this on Tuesday Israel dropped lift lets over Rafa urging residents to leave parts of the city for what it calls an expanded humanitarian area the order put in many displaced Palestinians on the move again now they're saying to evacuate from Rafa where should we go hanun is ruined what is left they ruined our lives there's nothing left there's no safety and no home there's no one but our [Music] God we don't know where to go tell us where to go is Al maazi and kanun is a safe place are there tents is there water is there electricity is there food and drink is it a safe place Gaza now has no safe place we're on the move with our children and we can't find safety where are the Arab countries to see us to empathize with our [Applause] children the news of Hamas accepting the ceasefire was met with joy on the streets of Gaza on Monday evening but hours later Israel's attacks stopped the celebrations well for more now let's cross over to journalist Kareem Al guari he's in Cairo Egypt's capital Kareem what are your sources telling you about the situation in Rafa well I just viewed the material uh local cameraman sent us from the Gaza Strip from people um running away from Rafa and trying to find a place it's a really utter despair that many people are were displaced at least half a dozen times some even more they're running out of money they have no idea uh where to go and so really I would say the nerves are on edge of people there and it's of course no wonder because there was this hot and cold showers really if you think about the last 24 hours first leaflets were dropped over their houses telling them they should leave because it will become a combat zone then in the evening they were celebrating on the street because they thought the war is over after Hamas agreed to a peace propos proposal from Egypt and qat only to realize that it's going on that there will there's a was a heavy bombardment last night in Rafa and now we have Israeli tanks rolling in parts of Rafa all this is really leading to a very very desperate situation for people there now the Egyptian foreign Ministry warned today that Israel's operation in Rafa risks undermining ceasefire efforts what do we know about the truce talks that are apparently going on now in Egypt well we know the Hamas or the Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo we're still waiting for the Israeli delegation to come it's interesting because originally the Israeli side they will only set they will only send a delegation when there is a done deal uh to sign it off now they're sending a delegation to negotiate there is still a lot of open questions I think we have a three-phase uh proposal uh on the table which also includes in the second phase some kind of agreement for a permanent ceasefire and that is I guess one of the uh stumbling blocks we have right now so we have to see if this negotiations here in Kyu will lead to something I think the Israeli side goes with a double strategy keeping the pressure on Hamas by moving militarily into Gaza and at the same time negotiating here in Cairo meanwhile the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate uh the Rafa and corom Shalom Crossings are now closed relief agencies are warning that humanitarian aid for Gaza is being choked off what are you hearing about the humanitarian situation in Gaza now kareim people are panicked because not only the Kim Shalom Crossing is closed and it was open been closed in the last days but now the direct opening that was not under Israeli control from the Egyptian side the Raa Crossing is also cut off so people don't know what's going to happen we know there was by far not sufficient Aid deliveries before these two main Crossings where most of the deliveries came through were closed we know also that for commercial Goods since this B are closed prices are doubled in the last hours so again people are panicked they don't know what's going to happen next and they really really hope that this talks in Cairo will have some kind of outcome Kareem thank you very much that was journalist kareim elari in
