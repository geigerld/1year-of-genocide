a 20-hour gun battle I've been through BS but not nothing like this nothing like animals and and or Slaughters and and butchers our kids and sisters and our father and our children and our babies and everything such a cruelty Israel has responded to the attacks with massive air strikes on the Gaza Strip the Israeli government told gazans to evacuate but the territory is trapped between Israel and
