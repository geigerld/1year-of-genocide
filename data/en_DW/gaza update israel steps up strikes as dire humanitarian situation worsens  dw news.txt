there are growing signs that Israel could be on the brink of launching a fullscale ground invasion of Gaza overnight Israel carried out its biggest air strikes to date in its war against Hamas terrorists and troops also conducted more ground raids the Army says its troops are still in the field communications in Gaza have been knocked out entirely Israel's military says this footage shows overnight operations in the Gaza Strip they claimed their fighter jets hit 150 tunnels and other underground infrastructure used by Hamas killing several of the terror organizations commanders some of whom they call Key operatives in the October 7 Massacre meanwhile Israel Defense Forces have been massing tanks infantry and artillery outside the Gaza Strip after several brief missions into the territory the IDF says it's expanding ground operations in Gaza we are advancing in the stages of the war last night IDF forces entered the area of the northern Gaza Strip and widened activity on the ground infantry engineering and artillery units are taking part in this stage accompanied by massive fire expanding the operation serves all the war's aims almost half of Israelis pulled by the newspaper iiv would rather delay the ground offensive many worry that sending in troops could endanger the more than 200 hostages still believe to be held by Hamas but some supporters of the offensive say they feel Israel has no other choice reading about the operations somehow offers a bit of support and strength I truly believe though that we all continue to live in profound fear in the face of the murderers there's no sense of security because we've been deeply wounded this is a war for the Free World a war for Liberal values for our home for our children our babies our women and our grandparents it's not an easy War we understand the pain on both sides but we won't give up we will stay here despite everything the pain on both sides is sure to keep increasing as long as the fight drags on and there are no indications of it ending soon our correspondent Rebecca Ritter is in is in stol in southern Israel close to the border with Gaza Rebecca it appears some Israeli ground forces are still inside Gaza today what are officials telling you [Music] well that's what we're hearing from officials too Michael that the ground uh offensive or all the targeted raids as they're being called by the Israeli military are still ongoing the one that the the troops that went in last night are still inside the Gaza Strip as far as we're aware according to the latest updates that we have uh now I also have been hearing that the the they're trying to work out now they're still trying to make a decision about whether or not they're going to continue uh forward and and try and make this a larger ground Invasion as we've all sort of been expecting for the last few weeks um or whether they're going to pull out and keep doing these smaller raids sort of on the periphery or just inside the periphery line I should say now just over my shoulder you can see uh Gaza you can see the plumes of smoke that's the bait hon neighborhood in the northeastern part of Gaza and we've been seeing and hearing uh the the missiles and the artillery fire pounding that City we can see the plumes of smoke uh over the over Rising above the skyline it's not a very clear picture at the moment because of all the dust that kicked up by those missiles and the dust that comes from the buildings that are destroyed but you can get a a bit of an image there of what's been happening all throughout the day we know that yesterday and last night in particular was the heaviest bombardment since uh this ground since this um sorry since the War Began 3 weeks ago Rebecca uh as you mentioned that ground offensive appears to be slowly Gathering Pace Mass mobilization of troops into Gaza hasn't happened yet as you say but raids are uh how much support is there among Israelis for an escalation well you heard a little bit in that report there that perhaps uh support for a full ground invasion is losing uh is losing or the full ground invasion is actually losing support among Israelis I think most Israelis that you speak to are fairly United doesn't really matter where they stand on the political Spectrum but they're pretty United in the goals that the Israeli military and the government have set which is to try and eradicate or completely eliminate hamas's military capabilities and there seems to be a consensus behind that but how the next steps and how that's you know to be to be brought to fruition um is now I think you know among the community among the Israelis I should say uh knowing that there's those 200 plus hostages on the ground we know that the hostage families in particular have been U you know making some noise they sent a letter to the government expressing their concerns Their Fear the fact that they haven't been consulted and that they know that their loved ones are there and that their loved ones are going to be incredibly impacted also as well as of course the the more than two men in Gaz and still in the strip but these families saying that they are lobbying the government to try to prevent a full-scale ground Invasion because they're worried of of what that would mean for their loved ones uh we know that the defense minister has now agreed to meet with the families uh I believe later today and there might be some discussion there about uh try to assuage their fears but I think full support for a for a complete ground invasion is perhaps um starting to WAN slightly that is Rebecca Ritter from stalt in southern Israel many thanks Aid organizations say the communications blackout since Friday is complicating their relief efforts the World Health Organization says it's impossible for ambulances to evacuate the injured as War rages in Gaza paramedics are facing enormous challenges dozens of ambulances have been damaged in the Gaza Strip many are out of service there's an acute need for more medical supplies and surgical equipment we no longer have any body bags in the ambulances and we're facing difficulties in transporting decomposing bodies there are tens maybe hundreds of them in the houses that have been targeted according to Rescue Services hundreds of buildings have been completely destroyed due to intense bombardment Rescuers are sometimes hampered in their efforts to find trapped victims we lack heavy machinery and rely on private companies but even their equipment despite daily maintenance affected these frequent breakdowns hinder our work the humanitarian situation for more than 2 million people is already tired since Friday evening phone and internet services have been cut off leaving people even more disconnected from the outside world we should mention we currently cannot contact our sources in Gaza anymore but we got an update from the BBC's correspondent in Gaza rushi Abu ALU reporting from conun in southern Gaza very chaotic scenes in the street I have been driving through the city of kanun this morning less people but more Bic and people they don't they don't know what to do in this circumstances they can't establish communication with their friends with their families even the here in Naser Hospital in in kenun the ambulance services are facing a very difficult situation dealing with the continuous Israeli air strikes around kanun here I'd like to welcome hadil kazaz she's the regional gender coordinator for Oxfam International based in rala in the Israeli occupied West Bank uh halil we understand Communications are down in Gaza we also understand you may have family members there when did you last speak to your colleagues and your family in Gaza uh we lost all connections with Gaza yesterday at 6 PM uh yes I have all my family everyone I have in the world is lives in the Gaza St plus three 33 staff of Oxfam International and many many partners long-term Partners who we work with for a long time we lost contact with all of them we cannot reach anyone I realized to some extent I'm stating the obvious here but with increased Israeli air strikes and a Communications blackout it must be utter chaos for example when it comes to trying to get Emergency Care is there any information at all trickling out nothing uh since last night we have zero information we don't know what happened during the night we don't know the needs the emerging needs H even before that we had very little information but very uh serious uh uh information about the catastrophic situation in the Gaz STP we uh in Oxfam warned from starvation being used as a wein of War because only 2% of the gazans needs for food entered Gaza uh people were ran out of electricity fuel water medication anything even before what happened last night which we still don't know what happened last night uh the total blackout also is very worrying because for us it means that anything can happen in imunity and uh basically because uh it's like we feel that we are back to the Dark Ages really to to that point I'm so sorry to cut you off but you're making really interesting points there including the fact that people cannot get the the uh the products that they need your organization Oxfam is among many International organizations calling for ceasefire what exactly is your demand immediate ceasefire is very very important for any humanitarian actors and since we need the since we see the huge need since we need we also see what's happening in in terms of uh civilians who are uh being uh subjected to a very very difficult situations and circumstances where they cannot uh fulfill their basic needs there's the fear of dying not only from bumping and chilling but also from starvation and thirst uh then ceasefire is just a a a precondition for any humanitarian actor uh we haven't seen this in all the history of from interventions around the world and we have been in many humanitarian situations we didn't see a place where for three weeks we couldn't have access no one could secure access even to assist the needs even to uh support people with the basic life-saving uh medications not only for injured and for people who are in critical conditions but also for long-term patients for diabetic people for cancer patients for anyone who would need premature babies for the 5,500 women who are going to give birth this month alone so we are really very very worried about what's happening I'm more worried now because of the blackout heal I I hate cutting you off when you're talking about something that's so emotional but we we're literally out of time I do want to ask you very shortly the UN has alerted Gaza is on the brink of a massive health hazard are we already in the worst case scenario or things could get even worse at this point uh well with the blackout things can get much worse in in fact and uh that's why we also demand for Return of the connections not only the internet but mobile and landline connections so we can also know what's happening there yes it things unfortunately can get worse unforunately we're gonna have to end it there that is hadil kazaz from Oxfam International many thanks for your time thank you protest have erupted worldwide in support of Palestinians with demonstrations taking place in several countries thousands of pro Palestinian protesters marched to the heavily guarded US Embassy in Indonesia's Capital Jakarta to demand an end to the fighting in the Pakistani city of Karachi hundreds of protesters also rallied to condemn Israel's attacks on Gaza protesters carried banners and signs with Pro Palestinian slogans in New Zealand's Capital Wellington thousands marched to Parliament House to oppose the ongoing war and demanded a ceasefire for humanitarian [Applause]
