well while Israel's war against Hamas shows no sign of slowing many people are already asking the question what will happen when it's over most analysts agree it's far too early to say but some scenarios appear more likely than others destruction death Israel's pursuit of Hamas is leveling whole neighborhoods in Gaza causing widespread human suffering and laying waste to infrastructure this satellite imagery shows one area before and after Israel started its bombardment and later ground offensive the shooting will eventually stop Israel says that after the war there'll have to be a new security regime for Gaza experts say three scenarios are most likely the first option tightened control Israel's foreign minister has warned that gaza's territory will decrease which could mean wider so-called buffer zones before the war areas in Gaza within a kilometer of the Israeli border were nogo areas these could be expanded experts say that if the north of the The Enclave is totally destroyed it could remain uninhabitable cut off like this gazans would depend entirely on International Aid to survive option two would see the Palestinian Authority which controls the West Bank also take control of Gaza this would unite Palestinians under a single government which could also be part of any future negotiations over Palestinian sovereignty the third option would see Arab states that have relations with Israel take control along with the Palestinian Authority the US has laid down some red lines in response to options discussed by Israeli politicians and the International Community no uh forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza uh no use of Gaza as um a platform for launching um terrorism or other uh other attacks against uh against Israel um no diminution in the uh in the territory of Gaza and a commitment to Palestinian Le governance for uh for Gaza and and for the West Bank a lot of NOS the other potential broker of the United Nations has so far not presented suggestions for a solution leaving the future of Gaza uncertain and for more on that topic let's bring in Yosi melberg he's a he's with the Royal Institute of international Affairs also known as chattam house uh in London now first please please tell me about the day after what will be the priorities in rebuilding Gaza good afternoon I think obviously we need to look at what's left of Gaza after you know the massive bombardment of of Gaza the destruction there but no doubt when you have hundreds of thousands of people probably 700,000 people displac many many houses destroyed Hospitals now under threat schols so they they in the immediate afterm there will need for a massive humanitarian Aid just to ensure that people have shelter people have food sanitation H water and and and and the rest this will be in the immediate aftermath then also to ensure that people have enjoy security and then gradually moving into the rebuilding of Gaza and and ensuring that also there is governance who is who who is governing Gaza you need you need some sort of government assuming that Hamas won't be to govern and Israel won't withdraw until Hamas is is is there or possibly govern the place there need to for for alternative and then we have to look into the interim and the long term in the interim probably an international some International mechanisms that we look into into rebuilding Gaza reconstruct Gaza but also build the governance then and eventually election and uniting the the the Palestinian poity between the West Bank and Gaza under the one wood now Netanyahu says that Israel you mentioned security and he said that Israel will control the overall security of Gaza after the war do you see Israel holding on to that power for long afterwards or who do you think should step in after the war obviously what netan said is very vague what does mean overall control does it mean presence within within Gaza presence from the out outside you know all the idea of the blockade was having overall control but from the outside and keeping it contained this failed and collapsed within few hours on on on on 7th of October with disastrous consequences so if he means staying there then as as all occupation they become entrenched within the territory among 2.3 million people that will see Israel as as an occupy and hostile to it so it's very difficult to see whether it's just element of rhetoric there to ensure the Israeli population that he is doing something or there is an actually a a a plan how to ensure security for Israel Vis A Gaza I think a real plan will involve International forces there at least for the interim time until we are moving into some diplomatic effort to resolve the Israel Palestinian conflict now what about the Palestinian authorities sounds plausible doesn't it that they be given a chance to govern Gaza well eventually obviously the the the the PA can't just enter into Gaza considering how they left or were forced to live back in 2007 and on the back of Israeli tanks just enter and be implicated with with the war in Gaza and what you know the destruction left as a result of it so again that's what the need for an intering time the PA itself needs to go through a form the the issue of succession and the PA and the PLO and finding new leadership as much as Israel needs new a new leadership new leadership for Gaza building alternative political parties that would run will run in the in the next elections building the institutions themselves so this is this is the process that we should be outlined and start you know immediately when there is a a ceasefire and seeing new leadership emerging but also new leadership that can think beyond the conflict itself into a resolution a peaceful resolution now is this time as tragic as everything is right now could it provide a chance for a possible resolution of conflict I think whenever you have such deep crisis there is also great opportunity because the one thing that everyone realizes right now is the current Arrangements don't work the end even even worse conditions and by now probably on both sides there are more than 12 probably 13,000 people dead and we saw the destruction and the trauma that both societies are going through and the shock with that and of course a lot of trust if there was any trust between them it's even been damag further however if a new leadership that actually learned the right lesson that maintaining the conflict talking in this elusive status quo doesn't work and needs to go back to the root causes of the conflict self-determination for both recognition of the rights for of Jerusalem is the capital of both deal with the refugees issue allowing Economic Development dealing with settlements in in in in the West Bank all those issues that make the the Israel Palestine conf with the support of the International Community personally I think should be a strong Regional element of that but without the the United States and the European Union relinquish their responsibility because it affects their interest too y see M there with the international Affairs Think Tank chatam house thank you very much for sharing your expertise with us thank you for having
