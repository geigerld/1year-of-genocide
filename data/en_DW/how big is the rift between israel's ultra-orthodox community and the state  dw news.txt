at least five people were arrested during clashes between Ultra Orthodox Jews and Israeli police on Sunday crowds had gathered to demonstrate against last week's Israeli supreme court order to begin enlisting them for military service the ultra Orthodox Community makes up around 133% of Israel's population and had been exempt from military uh service for religious reasons the issue has been a source of tension for decades and has intensified since the start of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza thousands of ultra Orthodox Jewish men on the streets of Jerusalem they're protesting a ruling by Israel's Supreme Court that the Army must start drafting Ultra Orthodox Jews otherwise known as haredim into the military in Israel most Jewish men are required to perform 3 years of compulsory military service but powerful Ultra Orthodox parties have used their bage to win exemptions for their followers they say it's necessary for haridi men to study the Torah which they see is crucial to preserving Israel's Jewish identity they say forced conscription will destroy their Generations old way of life so we have to fight them because that we don't want to go to the Army so that's the only thing we have to do so that's what we're doing I believe that as much as we need an Army in Israel we also need the Army of people sitting learning Torah they're doing a lot and we can't have them draft we need the we need the Torah in the country scuffles later broke out between protesters and police water cannons filled with skunk centered water as well as police on foot and horseback were used to disperse the crowds the issue could topple prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's government two parties in his coalition opposed the change if they break ranks the country could be sent to Fresh elections and he could be out of a job now as well as being an acclaimed author Alfred Bodenheimer is a professor of Jewish literature and history he lives between Switzerland and Israel uh from where he joins us today welcome to DW Professor it does seem ironic that religious Scholars are now fighting to be Exempted from defending a country based on religion and surrounded by what it regards as enemies yeah I mean uh the whole thing is based on agreement that already the founder of the state David benuron has had with the Orthodox rabbis then you had a very small amount of Yeshiva students and uh since after the Holocaust um Jewish learning was reduced in High um numbers in in in Poland for example so they wanted to guarantee a certain number of people who still learning of course today you have about 133% of young men young Jewish men who uh claim to be learning Tas so H it's simply has become a huge problem and uh of course you also have problem you have programs where people can learn the Torah and at the same time also go to the armies so it's not the case that either you learn tah or you go to the Army there are Alterna so it has something IR could say yes so from from what you've said it sounds as though you see this decision by the Supreme Court as a sensible one to reflect a change in the country's circumstances I should say Yes um you see there have been discussions for decades about this issue and the problem was mainly taking over some of the obligations uh that the general population has also by the So-Cal which is the Orthodox Orthodox Community H now with the War uh where it a situation becomes dense where there is really a lack of uh people in the Army the situation hasn't become only one of a question of uh taking over obligations but simply fill the um the the holes in the Army because there are simply not enough people fighting um considering you might have more than one front uh with a war for example in Lebanon and and other uh directions where Israel is threatened so it's not simply a question of who takes over obligations it's a question H how many people in the end you will have uh really joining the Army and it's it's interesting that we saw in our report some of the demonstrators actually are carrying or putting up signs that said we will not enlist in the enemy Army can you explain to us this this this apparent view that the AL Orthodox Community sees the Israeli Army as an enemy Army of course you have different threads in the uh Orthodox community and there are those who really see themselves as not being part of the country and they see themselves as living in a foreign country and Israel they don't consider it as really their state so uh who goes out against the Torah as they see it is really their enemy because they say they would prefer another government which is not Jewish which is not conscripting then so H by conscripting the state really uh they see them they see the state as their enemy so it's really a kind of Highly disintegrated uh Community one might say Okay so the Supreme Court Israel Supreme Court has made this decision that the Army must start calling them up do you expect the Army to actually start issuing callup papers for the ultra Orthodox community and what are the penalties for refusal I think they will have to start the court is after them to do this but they will probably do it in smaller numbers uh the Army isn't also prepared just right now taking over like about uh 60 to 70,000 uh people because this is about the number of uh student students to whom this all uh occurs um there might be much smaller numbers at least in the beginning and you have to see that not all of those people who are now uh freed from army service are really sitting the whole day and learning Torah there are kind of so-called drop out yot which PE uh schools where people sit who don't learn that much but the alter Orthodox don't want to give him over to the Army because of fear of secularization assimilation and there you have a number of like 9 to 10,000 people who might easier be drafted because the argument of that they're really sitting the whole day and saving the Torah H isn't really that strong in in this uh connection to them so uh I think the Army will have to do if people don't uh go to the Army probably they won't go into prison but you will have to problems for example if you don't go all right we'll have to leave it there Professor but thank you so much for guiding us we'll have to leave it there thank you so much for guiding us through that so clearly
