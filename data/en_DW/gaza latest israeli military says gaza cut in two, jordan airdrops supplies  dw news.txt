Israel's Army says its ground troops have surrounded gaza's City and effectively divided the strip in two the Hamas Iran Gaza Health Ministry says more than 200 people have been killed following major Israeli air strikes which also caused a Communications blackout inside the territory meanwhile the leaders of major un agencies have called for an immediate ceasefire and for more humanitarian Aid the Israel Defense Forces have once again intensified operations in Northern Gaza they say they are targeting Hamas Fighters and infrastructure from the air sea and land Israel has repeatedly warned civilians to move South where it is supposed to be safer but a planned humanitarian Corridor did not materialize and those who do risk the journey say it's very dangerous we've been walking for 3 hours to get here I can't walk and my son has been pushing me all the way the situation is very difficult there's no bread no water nothing tanks in front of us and dead bodies it was very very scary especially for the kids the Israeli military has released what it says is evidence that Hamas is blocking roads to stop civilians leaving and using schools and hospitals as cover forit attacks this is part of a operation a ground operation that was conducted on the hospital then revealed a tunnel that was being used for Terror infrastructures in the Qatari hospital they launch rockets on Israel 75 M from an Hospital why they know precisely that if Israel will air strike a launch pad like that the hust Hospital would be damaged as the attacks in the north intensify Israel now says it has split the Gaza Strip into two and despite increasing International cuse for a ceasefire Israel says that won't happen until all the hostages held by Hamas are freed and until then those on the ground can only take shelter and hope to survive let's speak to DW's correspondent Rebecca Ritter reporting from Jerusalem Rebecca Israel says its military has split the Gaza Strip in two amid Israel's ground operation can you tell us what that looks like yeah that's right we had confirmation yesterday that there is now a North Gaza and a South Gaza that Israeli troops had made their way to the beach to the Shoreline basically and they were holding that line they've now also completely encircled Gaza City and it's being reported that in the next 48 hours or so so we can expect to see Israeli troops actually inside Gaza City uh out on the ground H you know with clo close combat with Hamas Fighters there now uh we've seen a really heavy bombardment overnight with some people saying it's been the the heaviest night uh in the ground operation so far uh some truly horrific uh sights coming out from the bombing particularly in Gaza hospital we know that areas around the alifa hospital have been bombed with the IDF saying continuity and yesterday you know showing what they say is evidence that Hamas are using these hospitals as headquarters we've also heard from some medical personnel though saying that there aren't armed militants uh in these hospitals and and that this is in fact false we it's very hard to independently verify anything there's no uh International journalists allowed inside there's no other organizations allowed inside Gaza so we do know that there's been an internet blackout overnight though we have been hearing that that is slowly been being restored so these calls for people to move away to evacuate uh falling on people that may not be able to even be getting the messages so really really serious situation and looking to intensify into yet another stage of this conflict indeed a very difficult situation for civilians there in Gaza the IDF has says has said it is allowing civilians to move from northern Gaza to the South using a one-way Corridor will that be a safe option for people to flee it's hard to determine though we know that civilians have been being caught up in attacks even as they've been trying to head from north to south we know that the Israeli military have been telling civilians to leave for some weeks now and they have as you say cleared up that Corridor or they've said that they've opened that uh Corridor to allow for civilians to go in that oneway route uh into the South um whether or not that going to be much relief you know we know that there are a lot of civilians who just simply aren't able to move or perhaps are unwilling and either way will be stuck inside this SE besieged area but we also know that the Israeli military has been targeting or at least bombing areas in the South even in the areas where civilians have been told to go that it is safe so you know more people I assume will be using that window the window is from 10: until 2 local time today we're in the middle of that window at the moment I can assume that some people will be using that route but whether or not it will make them any safer when they're in the South really remains to be seen Rebecca thank you very much for that update that's DW correspondent Rebeca Ritter reporting from Jerusalem now Jordan's King has revealed that the country's military dropped medical supplies into the Gaza Strip overnight in a message on the social media platform X King Abdullah announced that urgent medical Aid had been aird dropped at midnight and added that Jordan would always be there to assist Palestinians in the Gaza Strip now the Israeli military has confirmed that the operation was completed with its cooperation and uh Christian kater is the head of Doctors Without Borders or msf here in Germany uh he joins us from Berlin thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us I understand that Doctors Without Borders is continuing to operate in Gaza as best it can under extremely difficult conditions uh how much support are your staff Curr ly able to provide it is very difficult to operate in Gaza right now we have actually literally told all all our staff to to be free of their work to First Care for their families and themselves nevertheless a lot of our staff have chosen to continue to work it is uh very difficult with supplies running dramatically low all the time even though some resupplies had been um possible into Gaza we see you know a lack of fuel a lock of lack of water a lack of the basics in medication which makes medical decision- making very hard indeed um tell me a little bit more about that with such a dire need for your staff to attend to those who are critically injured are other more basic Primary Care needs being met at all what we hear from our staff is that getting food and water for themselves and the families is is very very difficult to find a safe space um to sleep um is almost impossible even in the south of Gaza just because of the mass of people but we see also that um uh in hospitals um with the lack of fuel um running generators is is impossible to most of the time and therefore uh conducting Quality Medical Care is impossible with a lot of people needing special attention uh due to fighting but also due to chronic diseases um where like high blood pressure or or um or other things newborn uh children can't be put on incubator because there's no electricity so the medical situation in Gaza um is without words now um the Hamas ran Gaza Health Ministry has said that close to half of those who've been killed are our children our minors are you seeing that that percentage also reflected in the number of patients who are being treated by Doctors Without Borders we we see a lot of patients injured to do the fighting um and among them is is is a high proportion also of of women and children um but also one has to remember that not every man uh in this context is is a fighter and um and uh and also due to um International laws even if somebody had been fighting um and is wounded uh is warrant should be warranted special protection uh that's one of the points which we definitely see it needs a pause in the fighting to allow for human maintain access to reach Gaza and for people in Gaza to reach humanitarian Aid and Medical Aid we hear from our patients that actually accessing medical facilities is uh is super difficult for security reasons well thank you so much for speaking with us on DW news we really appreciate your time that is Christian cater with Doctors Without
