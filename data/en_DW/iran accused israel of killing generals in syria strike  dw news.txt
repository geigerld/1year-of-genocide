US President joee Biden says the US commitment to Israel is Ironclad in the face of Iranian threats the security Assurance comes as the US and allies fear Iran or its proxies could launch a significant attack within days Tyran has vowed to retaliate for a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian Consulate in Syria at the start of April that killed seven members of its revolutionary guard Iran's supreme leader ayoli Ki renewed the threat on Wednesday here's how President Biden responded we also want to address the Iranian threat to launch a sign they're threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel as I told prime minister Netanyahu our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and his proxies is Ironclad let me say it again Ironclad we're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security let's talk now to military analysts Marina Moran from King know she joins us now from Munich greetings Marina let's start with President Biden's statement the way you see it what does ironclad mean and what does it entail good day well what President Biden could mean is that the support for Israel will be then unconditional and we have seen a lot of criticism coming from the US side as far as the war against Hamas is being concerned however in this scenario if Iran specifically from its own territory were to launch an attack against Israel proper than the United States would stand behind Israel and I do not exclude the possibility of deploying more aircraft carriers and US strike groups um to support Israel I don't think that the US would essentially send any of its troops um to Israel in order to support Israel but I think when it comes to military aid um the focus will be on Israel sidelining thereby Taiwan and Ukraine Iran's supreme leader vowed to retaliate for the attack on the Damascus consulate is Iran likely to do so from Iranian soil or through the so-called axis of resistance I think for Iran right now and giving Iran's past and how it responded to the assassination of KM solmani I doubt that Iran at this stage is ready to launch an attack from its own territory on Israel I think strategically it would be unwise for Iran however given that Iran has received an as a big slap they are not in a position not to respond which puts Iran here in a very difficult spot and therefore I think that the next best option is to use the axis of resistance consisting of um militias in Iraq in Syria of houis in Yemen and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon in order to attack Israel and make it more difficult for Israel to conduct its war against Hamas and Israel is already having difficulties because of international pressure to do so so I think that the attack will be asymmetric and another possibility is that it will not be an attack on Israel proper or not only there might be attack on Israeli embassies across the Middle East as well as attacks um in the Cyber realm and psychological [Music] operations that's a military analyst Marina Moran of King's College as ever many thanks Marina F Jes is Professor of international relations at the London School of Economics F Jes I suppose Biden's statement is a good place to start what's your assessment of what Ironclad means and what does that entail well he used the the term Iron clap twice so the president's statement is really a message of deterrence to Iran uh not just President Biden but even the Secretary of State uh blinkin called the Israeli defense minister and reassured uh the Israeli defense minister that the US will stand with Israel um also the US defense secretary there is even Israel we have have a news now that Israeli leaders uh have asked their American counterparts to make public statements in order to deter Iran from retaliating for the Israeli attack on the uh Iranian Consulate in Syria last week which as you said killed seven senior uh Iranian commanders um I I I my take on it is that Iran will retaliate the question is not whether Iran will do so or not the question is how uh when and what targets that Iran uh will attack in the next few hours or next few days we'll get to that in just a moment Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said today that Israel is preparing also for scenarios of challenges from other Arenas as he put it what does he mean by that well I mean I think uh what you have now is that you have the war in Gaza but the war has expanded contrary to what the American strategy the American strategy from day one from the 7th of October after Hamas attacked Israel was that it does not really want the war to expand it has expanded to red um in Iraq in Syria uh so um what what you and I we have not mentioned uh is that uh by attacking uh Iranian sovereignty uh the Iranian leadership viewed Israel's attack on the Iranian Consulate in Syria as an attack on Iranian sovereignty a direct attack on Iran it was really a provocation uh it was designed to provoke Iran to retaliate and now if Iran does not retaliate it will stand humiliated and shown by Israel to be a payot taget so the question facing the Iranian leadership is how to retaliate without provoking all out War with Israel and the United States because Iran does not really want a direct War either with Israel or with the United States as a result of that provocation as you put it Iran supreme leader has vowed to Embassy is Iran likely to do so from resistance well this is really the big question it's the $1 million question um my take is that reading uh Iranian statements and listening to what Iranian leaders have said they basically keep talking about the access of resistance Iran's Regional local networks in Lebanon in Yemen in Iraq and what have you so this might imply that Iran could use its own networks of supporters to retaliate but my take on it based on what the Americans say is that Iran is preparing for a significant attack that means Iran will directly attack Ira Israel because the Iranian supreme leader twice said that that Israel's attack on the Iranian Council culate was a direct attack on Iran itself what translate let's translate what the supreme leader Ali says that since Israel attacked Iran's sovereignty we have to retaliate directly from Iran this where the danger Li and what the Americans you started asking me what the Americans have been trying to do the Americans do not really want a regional war allout war so what the Americans are trying to do is to try to deter the Iranians and prevent a significant attack by Iran on Israel we're gonna have to end it there that's Middle East analyst FZ many many thanks to you sir thank
