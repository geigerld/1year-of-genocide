Jordan's King Abdullah has called on US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin to put pressure on Israel for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza the two held talks in the Jordanian Capital Aman on Sunday the meeting is part of a US initiated diplomatic tour aimed at calming tensions caused by the conflict blinkin also toured a food distribution center in Aman before traveling on to qat he'll visit Israel the occupied West Bank as well as Egypt and Saudi Arabia before wrapping up his week-long diplomatic push the UN is warning of a public health disaster with the delivery of vital supplies at only a trickle blinken has called for Aid to be scaled up let's bring in Tess Ingram from UNICEF the UN Children's Fund what's the use of scaling up Aid when it can't get into the people of Gaza well there's a double challenge Ben it's a a matter of getting the aid in and then and then getting it across the Gaza Strip so we need to scale up Aid we need to get it in as as quickly as possible and then we need to tackle some of the challenges that we face in getting it to the children and families who need it the most but that Aid is absolutely critical so the um call to scale it up is is both very well welcomed Tess this one spot in the Gaza Strip in the very south um is the only spot where AID is getting in the border to Egypt uh is there any hope of things getting better there's been Talk of the errors Crossing in the north being open for example yeah look we're calling for all existing um Crossings into the Gaza Strip that were were operating before the escalation in hostilities to be reopened uh one of those Crossings Kem Shalom has been um opening for for some days but but as you say there are others that could be opened and we really need access from as many possible routes that are proven in order for us to get more Aid in because at the moment we're only getting in you know 100 150 trucks a day day and before the escalation in hostilities there was 500 so the need has skyrocketed and the aid has dwindled so it's it's really a a a very tragic situation for the children and families on the ground in gazer at the moment I was going to say that aid needs to get to so many children uh who were overproportional affected in this war tell us more about the situation for them which should should make up about half of the population of Gaza so as you say they're being proportionately affected by this conflict there's you know no safe space for a child in Gaza at the moment there's bombs falling from the air and disease loing around every corner um as we just heard in your report there's no food no Safe Water no shelter and so parents and families are really just exhausted by the sheer exertion of trying to survive every day um where we're hearing accounts from families and children on the ground that they often go days without eating and when they do it's just a you know a small amount of bread um so the situation in terms of food is is incredibly difficult and we're worried in the coming weeks about a very real risk of widespread famine and for the kids who do manage to survive uh this Onslaught what what sort of future is for them how how worried are you about the long-term effects of this war on them it's a tragedy Beyond anyone's wildest imagination and I think um one of the things that we UNICEF are are trying to prepare for and get ahead of is the long-term mental health impacts obviously these children will have many of them physical scars from this conflict but others uh will have lost family they will have lost their home um and endured uh ongoing fear for for for days and for weeks throughout these hostilities so as UNICEF we're not just there delivering Aid we're also providing support services to some of these children to meet them where they're at and um help them process some of those emotions to try and reduce the long-term impact of the traum trauma that they're experiencing at the moment their situation though is dependent on diplomacy uh that's going on around the region at the moment and and so many different players but who is to blame for things not having changed I mean from day one where we're three months into this war and the situation hasn't changed it really it is um unfathomable that we're allowing this as a global Community to continue UNICEF has been calling for weeks now for an immediate and long lasting humanitarian ceasefire because we talk about Aid and the changes that need to happen to get more Aid in and that's important but a ceasefire really is the only way that we're going to be able to deliver enough Aid to meet the need get it around Gaza to the children and families that need it and ultimately for the fighting to stop because most people that we speak to in Gaza at the moment are just urging us for do to do whatever we can to end the fighting as a humanitarian Aid agency we can Advocate uh to to all parties and to all of the International Community to do what everybody can to try and um end the fighting but It ultimately needs needs to come from outside you heard it from unicef's Tess Ingram thank you very much for taking the time out today to speak to us
