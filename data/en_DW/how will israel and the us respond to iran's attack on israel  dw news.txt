an aerial assault launched by Iran against Israel overnight the Israeli Army says more than 300 missiles and drones were fired almost all the missiles were intercepted by Israel and the United States the UK and Jordan also shot down drones now Air Raid Sirens sounded across Israel and explosions were heard in Jerusalem the Iranian revolutionary guard says the assault is in retaliation for an attack on its Consulate in Syria on April 1st which killed 16 people in including several Iranian generals it is the first time Iran has launched a direct military attack on Israel despite Decades of hostilities now there has been widespread International condemnation of the Iranian attack President Joe Biden repeated the United States Ironclad support for Israel Secretary General Antonio gues criticized what he called a serious escalation by Iran the UN Security Council has called an emergency meeting Germany's foreign minister analena B also condemned the attack saying it could plunge the entire region into chaos and British prime minister Rishi sunak called The Assault Reckless and vowed to stand up for Israeli security Israeli authorities have now given the all clear meeting people no longer need to stay close to air raage shelters but our correspondent amen ISF says it was a tense and Noisy Night in Jerusalem as you can hear the sirens are going off as you can hear sirens are going off in Jerusalem you can see Iron Dome is active uh the air defense is active in the skies uh so we're going to head to a shelter now but uh a lot of Chaos in the streets a lot of screaming uh people running uh for cover let's get the very latest from our correspondent Tanya Kramer joining us now live from Jerusalem Tanya welcome tell us the latest about the situation in Israel this morning while it is quiet for now but the Army says they're remaining on high alert however the airspace has reopened uh we've been told uh so um but this comes of course for many for Israelis and Palestinians uh you know waking up after such a night this is somewhat a different reality after these direct and unprecedented attacks uh from Iran uh to uh on Israel now um are hearing more details now also coming in this morning from the Israeli military they said that over 300 rones and missiles were launched from Iran but also from other countries such as uh from libanon there were Rockets from Yemen but also some from uh Iraq um they're saying that most were intercepted uh um before they reached Israeli territory by the Air Defense Force by a coalition of strategic partners as they are as the Israeli military has said and they also said that 99% uh were uh intercepted so uh with some ballistic missiles however reaching uh and hitting uh somewhere in Israel one of them was hitting in they said the never teim Air Base in the South uh we don't have a full assessment there but they're saying it was only minor damage but also uh a child had been uh has been uh injured critically injured potentially by shner now of course after all this happened the question is now uh you know what will Israel do uh what how will they retaliate how will their response to this that is indeed the big question here Tanya what do you think Israel's next move will be are there signs that we might see a swift [Music] retaliation well this is of course the question right now there has been also a phone call between US President Joe Biden and prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu in the course of the night and there is an indication that the United States they don't want to see a wider Regional uh escalation coming uh out of that uh they have also said that uh the US helped actually Israel to take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles and that Israel should see this as a success in a way uh that they could uh um reboot all the those most at least of those missiles coming in now uh it will be in the hands now of the war cabinet to decide the next steps uh prime minister Benyamin nany and defense minister um uh YF galand and we just have to wait and see uh whether you know how they will decide whether there will be retaliation and uh you know this could affect of course most of the region here and uh many don't want to see of course wider escalation Tanya thank you so much for your reporting that is Tanya Kramer for us in Jerusalem now US President Joe Biden says he will convene the G7 countries to plan a diplomatic response to Iran's attack Biden announced the meeting after speaking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone now Biden told Netanyahu Israel demonstrated a remarkable ability to defend against unprecedented attacks sending a clear message that Israel's security cannot be threatened Biden also said the US has not seen any attacks on its own troops in the region but confirmed US forces helped Israel take down nearly all of drones of the drones and missiles launched from Iran let's get the perspective from Washington DP DC and speak to our reporter Stefan Simons Stefan Biden has cut short his weekend trip to Delaware to hold crisis talks with his National Security team we know his defense secretary uh Lloyd Austin earlier spoke to his Israeli counterpart what has the US said publicly about this attack well of course the US president as well as the entire Administration was very very quickly to stand by Israel officially and with statements this Ironclad standing by Israel quote comes from National Security Council statement which was given on Saturday now the president has reiterated that this will be a us position that when Israel is um attacked and has to defend itself uh the US will do everything it can to support Israel and so it did uh during this attack from or drone and missile attack by Iran uh the US is saying that it shut down itself 70 missile SL drones uh during this attack and helped Israel by doing so defend itself but as um said by my colleague Tanya Jerusalem the Biden Administration is very very very keen on really putting a lid on this now uh Iran apparently has uh concluded or has said the UN Mission the the Iranian Mission permanent Mission at the UN has uh early on relatively early on Saturday still uh said okay that concludes the matter for us we retaliate retaliated and the Biden Administration is now as we also reported uh in telephone calls and communication with Israeli counterparts saying now a a return to measured uh responses is necessary not a retaliation by Israel to not escalate this into a wider fullscale regional conflict so let's dig in a little bit more into into Washington's support of course support for Israel a Mainstay of of us um Foreign Affairs over decades what do you think Ironclad support promised here is going to mean in concrete terms two-prong approach uh that is militarily speaking the United States has many many assets Navy assets air defense Assets in the region Red Sea uh uh straight of Horus Eastern Mediterranean uh this is sophisticated Weaponry uh fighter jets and whatsoever um and there will be defensive support for Israel uh that doesn't mean boots on the ground US military engagement with US soldiers anywhere near or close or anywhere in the region there uh on behalf of Israel or anybody else uh but support with military assets specifically intelligence geospatial um uh radar information and intelligence etc etc uh this will come from the United States and will be continuously provided to Israel um that's what that means on the other hand it's of course diplomatic support and that is and we see already the results of this um it is reaching out to all part partners and allies of the United States not just NATO Partners uh and and friends and uh in the in in Europe it also partners and allies in the Middle East and meaning by this Arab Partners Qatar Saudi Arabia Jordan um the Egypt those countries the US is trying to make sure that um all of them are on the same page in trying to deescalate here now uh meaning to really prevent uh a fullscale regional conflict from happening thank you so much that is DW's Stefan Simons in Washington DC Israel's defense minister yav Galant has praised the Israeli forces for blocking the attack and he paid tribute to Israel's allies for their support the state of Israel has faced an attack of hundreds of missiles and drones the Israel Defense Forces have done an impressive job of blocking the offensive together with the United States and other partners we managed to defend the territory of the state of Israel the whole world saw tonight who Iran really is it's a terror state that attacks Israel from a distance of 1,500 km and tries to activate all of its proxies but the world has also seen the power of a coalition and how Israel stands alongside the Us and other countries to block this attack and in the studio I'm now joined by DW's Middle East analyst shaie rosanes shaie good to see you again how easy do you think it is going to be for Israel and the United States to agree on a clear response to this Iranian attack it seems to be another uh battle coming you know when it comes to Israel and America uh trying to find together a a response because the way the Americans see it uh Israel needs to respond according to the result which seems to be quite a you know almost a poor one um if the Iranians wanted to it seems like the way American Defense Forces are interpreting is that that this was mostly a declarative uh statement by the Iranians we have shown to the Israelis we can we are not afraid but eventually there's very little uh damage done on the ground more limited than it could have been correct um and then on the other hand when you look at Israelis they they mostly focus on the fact this is unprecedented um and that this is you know an attack on Israel's sovereignity and they uh focus on the intentions of Iran and so now it's the battle between Israel I mean the battle would be a harsh word but it's going to be back and forth on how to agree on a response is it going to be determined by the intent and um this is what Israel would want to do and then the there's the Americans we see them they're trying to bring down the escalation they want to they are very much not interested in a in a in an escalation into their the regional war and it's going to take we'll see a back and forth the next day is definitely and what does it tell you the fact that this response from Iran was more muted it sounds like than it could have been and the fact that it took two weeks after this attack on Iran's Embassy in Damascus on April 1st um to see this kind of response what does that tell you well first of all there's a very clear um chain of hierarchy and decision-making in Iran that takes time but it's also you know we we're used to seeing this shedow war between Israel and Iran this back and forth of of attacks cyber attacks and so on a lot of it uh in the shadows a lot of it not unannounced and the decision here definitely was was for the Iranians was determined you know because of the Americans uh and we've seen a lot of communication Intelligence coming uh about that it's back and forth there was a need for the Iranians to show that they are not afraid and this is also something that connects back to October 7th the biggest asset that Israel lost on October 7th is deterrence uh when the Israelis launched the attack in Damascus on October on April 1st um just two weeks ago um the Assumption was that the Iranians are not going to operate uh so severely definitely not from Iranian ground definitely not directly into Israeli soil so the fact that the Iranians have done that shows us there something in the very delicate uh balance in this war that has been Never official but very clear has been broken do you think we've reached in that sense a point of no return here that we are moving from this kind of Shadow Warfare to a direct attack on Israeli very much depends on the is response and this is exactly what the Americans are trying to do they're trying to prevent a response that will you know bring to an escalation but Israelis feel like one of their their important needs in in their long-term defense strategy is rebuilding theer and that can only be done the way they see it by being very aggressive in their responses to any uh attempt for any attack uh I don't think we will see an immediate response in Israel um this is also partially why you know the the the pace that we're seeing in this kind of conflict between Israel and Iran takes time but the last word has not been said yet shie thank you as always that's our Middle East analyst shie rosanes and we can speak now to Hans yakob Schindler a senior director of the counter extremism project thank you so much for speaking with us on DW news I'd like to start with your thoughts on what has happened here what do you make of the attack last night thank you so much for having me it was clearly a Iranian escalation which is needless um and un unfortunately really complicates things but it was an escalation again with an Iranian twist so what happened is immediately after the drones and the rockets were launched from Iranian territory Iranian State TV officially announced the launch giving the Israelis hours in the case of the drones and very long time in the case of the missiles to actually get ready to defend themselves including with the help of the Americans so clearly the Iranians wanted to show make a show force and minimizing the damage that that show force would uh meet upon Israel um in including then of course getting their un Mission here in New York and there's going to be a security council meeting later today uh evening time in Germany here in New York on this attack uh getting the UN mission of all places to announce that this could be it from our side this is our retaliation Case Closed if you choose to close the case and then having the permanent representative to say we no longer want any escalation and we only made use of our right to self-defense according to the UN Charter which of course codly negates the the point that it has to be a proportional response and 300 rockets and drones uh is not exactly a part in the eyes of theion a proportional response so if I understand you correctly it sounds like you think in this case Iran needs needed to be seen to be doing something in response do you think that Iran could have mounted a stronger attack and whether this was something it considered yeah I mean they haven't put out all the stops uh don't forget uh hisbah is in effect fact uh the extension of the Iranian regime in in Lebanon it does have a very sizable Arsenal that has the potential to actually overwhelm Israeli air defenses as we have seen in Ukraine it's not the individual Shai drones of the Iranians are the problem it's the number of Shah drones that are fired that is the problem and this number that was fired last night clearly was not sufficient to overwhelm the Israeli air defenses nor in my opinion was it designed to do so it was simply aure Force inside Iran now of course the regime celebrates this as a great success but the problem is both sides have lost deterrence here the Israelis have lost dets because it is unprecedented that the first time since the Islamic revolution that Iran attacked itself from its territory not via proxy Israel but also the Iranian really failure to hit anything literally anything in Israel um means they now just demonstrated that potentially their systems are not good enough to withstand Israel which then of course puts water on the middle of those in Israel who say look this is a good time to do a very forceful response and will'll pay a very little price because the Iranians just showed us their system are not as good as they thought they were so with deterrence compromised as you say Do you think that now after after almost more than a decade of proxy war some kind of threshold has been crossed here where we've seen a direct Iranian attack on Israeli soil um just a small correction the proxy war between Israel and Iran didn't start a decade ago it started much much longer ago from the very beginning the enmity in against Israel was part of the core ideological tenants of the Islamic Republic of Iran so it's been at a higher level in the last decade but it's always been there it's always been one of the as I said core ideological themes of the Iranian regime um what happened now is really we are in a new situation in the Middle East and there's really no good way out of this because both sides have to find a new equilibrium again and we are not yet there that it becomes clear what that new equilibrium actually would mean how concerned are you about the likelihood of escalation here how do you expect the Israelis to react I mean it's a very very very tense situation and any misstep from either one of the sides um is going to really lead to a potentially uncontrollable escalation here we already have a virtual shooting War not only with Gaza but also with the houthis and hispa for many many months since October 7 and we now have this direct attack here if the Israeli response um is attacking inside Iran and then there are also levels of escalation that the Israelis could choose they could just simply attack some of the military installations from which those rockets and drones were launched this would be a classic us response to hit those places from which you were attacked but the Israelis could also decide to First finally solve what the Israeli government has always said is the the major threat the actual strategic threat from Iran is its nuclear program and attack the the Iranian nuclear installations inside Iran which would be another major major escalation hence these unnamed us officials who are you know talking to the media here in the United States saying um Biden said to Netanyahu we will defend you and we are iron glad on your side but we will not support you in any offensive operations inside Iran now if this is what the American president has said to the Israeli Prime Minister whose country just got attacked it is a very very unprecedented statement from an American president and it really shows how deep deep the concern is in the US Administration that this now can get out of control do you think the US Administration is also concerned about spread outside the region well look I mean my personal assessment was that uh it's very likely that Iranians would respond with attacks against Israeli diplomatic and official institutions outside the region um which is something that the Iranians had done before remind you there was attack in South America in Argentina against a Embassy and a cultural center in the 1990s even in Berlin where you are right now in 1992 there was a killing of some Iranian Exile politicians in the mikonos attack there was a bombing of Israeli tourists in 2012 in b as Bulgaria so IR Iran has demonstrated that it can also attack and strike outside uh the region with the help by the way of his operatives in each one of these cases so you know there are levels of retaliation that Iran has not yet taken and what do you expect Iran's proxies in the region like Hezbollah and the houthi rebels to do here well I mean one has to different differentiate between um the proxies and the control that Iran ultimately has over these proxies now isbah is a 100% Iranian creation it was at the core of forming hisbah during the Civil War in Lebanon in the 1980s from the onset so hisbah really is an extension of the Islamic Republic other proxies especially the houthis have really been newly added to the Iranian portfolio of proxies only really after 2015 and the attack of Saudi Arabia the UAE and Arab states on the houthis in Yemen did yans see a opportunity here strengthen their relationship build up the houthis in order to essentially let their Regional rival so Arabia plead now the houthis are therefore less indebted to the Iranians than his and therefore Iran will ever always be able to tell the houthis to shoot if the Iranians ultimately can tell the houthis to stop shooting and they will that Still Remains to be seen for example we've for month now really been attempts to tal calm down the houthis um and to tell them that it's not worth continuing to harass shipping in the Red Sea and so far the Iranians even if they tried doesn't seem to be able to stop them so the escalation can also come inadvertedly by these proxies who are you know in various measures of control of Iran now as you say we've seen shipping disrupted in the Red Sea um what do you think the effect here might be on energy markets if we do continue to see an escalation in the region so far International transport has managed to avert a real crisis um um when it comes to the Red Sea of course container prices have doubled shipping Insurance have tripled uh and ships need to go now around the African continent which adds 10 days however this is not really affecting energy exports so far however the Irani just before they launched those rockets and drones actually took a Israeli owned or link ship to the Zodiac group of a offer uh the MS MSC Aries in the straight of pus of the port of Huda vua hostage essentially Like Pirates took a helicopter and basically forced the ship to enter an Iranian Harbor now if this continues the straight of hus is actually in a very large energy Supply Route not only for Saudi and UAE oil but also for LNG from Qatar which supplies in a major way both Australia and Japan and in an increasing manner the European Union including Germany because as the German government and the EU signed gas LG deals with Qatar in part to substitute the gas we no longer purchasing from Russia so any trouble in the straight of pus is of course a major immed concern for Energy prices on the globe however this is also a loose loose proposition for the Iranians because their tankers also need to leave the straight for or for moose and the US has enough military Assets in the Persian golf to make sure if other ships can't leave or enter definitely Iranian tankers also won't leave or enter the street so this is hopefully a escalation stage that the Iranians are not contemplating and take and whatever the Israel are doing and I'm curious if you could tell us what kind of diplomatic efforts we've seen from Israel's allies in Europe including Germany to try to deescalate the situation here well in the runup to this uh the American Administration really put out pulled out all the stops uh they were very clearly communicating I remind you President Biden said simply don't that the Iranians shouldn't attack Israel they asked China turkey um Germany the UK European States as well as Arab states to talk to the Iranians to tell them not to do this um none of this came to fruition now of course there is going to be the G7 meeting later today there's the security council meeting China has already warned against escalation it is certainly not in the interest of Russia to see its newly found Ally in the Ukraine war Iran significantly weakened so there is significantly forces that can tone down the side um it all really depends on what the Israeli decide decides now the Iranians are in a very uncomfortable position you always can decide to start an escalation you rarely are the one who is deciding when to stop it well thank you so much for joining us today with your insights that is Hans yakob Schindler from the counter extremism project we appreciate your time thank you so much for having me
