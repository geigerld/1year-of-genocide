operation had to be recalibrated and now
 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.589 align:start position:0%
operation had to be recalibrated and now
it<00:04:11.480><c> seems</c><00:04:11.840><c> like</c><00:04:12.079><c> the</c><00:04:12.239><c> northern</c><00:04:12.760><c> part</c><00:04:13.040><c> of</c><00:04:13.280><c> Gaza</c>

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
it seems like the northern part of Gaza

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.069 align:start position:0%

this<00:04:16.199><c> new</c><00:04:16.519><c> phase</c><00:04:17.320><c> um</c><00:04:17.720><c> even</c><00:04:18.120><c> more</c><00:04:18.560><c> destructive</c>

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
this new phase um even more destructive
 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.710 align:start position:0%
this new phase um even more destructive
than<00:04:19.280><c> the</c><00:04:19.440><c> previous</c><00:04:19.880><c> one</c><00:04:20.199><c> is</c><00:04:20.400><c> about</c><00:04:21.359><c> one</c><00:04:21.600><c> of</c>

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
than the previous one is about one of
 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.030 align:start position:0%
than the previous one is about one of
the<00:04:21.919><c> strongholds</c><00:04:22.800><c> of</c><00:04:23.280><c> um</c><00:04:23.680><c> Hamas</c><00:04:24.400><c> according</c><00:04:24.800><c> to</c>

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
the strongholds of um Hamas according to
 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.150 align:start position:0%
the strongholds of um Hamas according to
the<00:04:25.320><c> Israeli</c><00:04:25.960><c> side</c><00:04:26.840><c> which</c><00:04:26.960><c> is</c><00:04:27.160><c> Han</c><00:04:27.479><c> unun</c><00:04:28.000><c> and</c>

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
the Israeli side which is Han unun and
 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.469 align:start position:0%
the Israeli side which is Han unun and
so<00:04:28.440><c> the</c><00:04:28.639><c> operation</c><00:04:29.160><c> here</c><00:04:29.360><c> is</c><00:04:29.759><c> very</c><00:04:29.960><c> similar</c><00:04:30.320><c> to</c>

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
so the operation here is very similar to
 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.270 align:start position:0%
so the operation here is very similar to
