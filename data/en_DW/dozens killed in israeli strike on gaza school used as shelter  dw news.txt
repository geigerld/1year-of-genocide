we start with breaking news from Gaza dozens of people have been reported killed after an isra the air strike on a school that is being used as a shelter for displaced people the attack at the tabin school in Gaza City took place in the early hours of Saturday according to gaza's Civil Defense Agency as many as a 100 people are thought to have died Israeli military has confirmed the strike claiming it hit a hamus command and control center embedded within the site it says quote numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians let's bring in now correspondent Rebecca Riders who's in Jerusalem bring us up to date Rebecca well Ben this was one of a number of strikes carried out across the strip overnight certainly the deadliest with around about uh a 100 people or more than 100 we're hearing from the Garen civil defense killed in that attack we're seeing many more casualties uh we know that fire broke out as well in that compound and and many people are suffering from Burn uh wounds that that were trapped and caught up in that fire this is in fact three consecutive strikes that hit the school which was housing an unknown number of displaced Palestinians and it hit around the morning prayer time uh it certainly looks by the images and the certain the the types of casualties that we're uh hearing about on the ground that that number May well rise over time um now as you mentioned there Israel confirmed this air strike uh just before 6:00 a.m. local time they said that they had struck or precisely struck were the words that they used Hamas operatives operating um a command and control center as you just me mentioned um they also said that this was a hideout for Hamas commanders and that they had been planning attacks on uh IDF units from there they said that they had taken numerous steps to avoid civilian casualties but that's certainly counter to the images that and and reports that we're hearing from the ground many uh reports of civilians including women and children being taken to a nearby hospital for uh with very very severe wounds so it's difficult to see uh when when we talk about precise and precision uh just how that was uh indeed carried out and the numbers coming in this hour what sort of reaction is coming in yeah um you we've heard from Hamas they have condemned the attack the Islamic Jihad have also condemned the attack and also fata who rules in the in the West Bank they have also come out in condemnation and we've also uh heard from Egypt who have now uh come out to say that that this you know direct hitting of civilians will certainly uh not bode well for the ceasefire negotiations which are due to resume on Thursday Israel has said that it will send a delegation and of we haven't heard from Hamas yet as to whether they will take part in these uh talks though that being made very very difficult by the fact that Yaya Sina is now the the you know supreme leader of Hamas both the political and Military wings but he is of course many many stories underground as we believe or as is being reported in the Hamas tunnel Network so making negotiations with that with Hamas very very difficult of course Egypt now saying that you know strikes like this that you know apparently Target civilians that's not the words that's what the Israeli military say but certainly how it's being viewed by many others is that these sort of strikes that that you know that they say Target civilians is going to really hamper those negotiations the latest on the war in Gaza and those talks which we all hope will get underway this week Rebecca Riders thank you
