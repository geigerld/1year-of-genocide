well there was more impassioned debate today at an emergency session of the UN General Assembly in New York when all was said and done a resolution calling for a humanitarian truce was passed now that truce or that um resolution is not binding it was drafted by the un's 22 Nation Arab group who point to the failure of the security Council earlier this week to take action Israel has rejected the resolution so too the United States whose Ambassador was blown in her objections it is outrageous that this resolution fails to name the perpetrators of the October 7th terrorist attack Hamas Hamas it is outrageous another key word missing in this resolution is hostage these are omissions of evil and they give cover to and they Empower hamas's brutality and no member State no member State should allow that to happen well since October 7th the United States has quickly refocused its attention onto the Middle East both diplomatically and militarily on Friday us war planes struck Targets in eastern Syria that the Pentagon said were linked to Iran's revolutionary guard us defense secretary Lloyd Austin gave more details saying these Precision self-defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against us Personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian backed militia groups that began on October 17th the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself its personnel and its interests Bradley Bowman is a senior director of the center on Military and political power at the foundation for defense of democracies he joins me from Washington BR it's good to see you again there's a lot to talk about to me what's your reaction to these us strikes on Iran proxy Targets in Syria what message is Washington sending to tyan I think the Biden Administration was trying to uh reinforce and eroding American deterrence I mean we have seen more than 19 attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria in the last 10 days and I think this Administration was at serious risk of leaving the impression that uh Iran and its Terror proxies could attack our forces in a costree way so why would they not continue and so I think this was an effort uh clearly they said so explicitly to send a message to Tran that there would be costs and there would be a response and that this Administration is prepared to defend US forces and US interests but there's already reports that we've seen subsequent attacks following these more of Iran's proxies attacking our forces so it remains to be seen whether this attack was enough the strikes followed what the White House called a direct warning from President Joe Biden to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah aliani I mean how big of a deal is that you know it's good that the president Express those warnings and secretary defense Austin reiterated them but I don't think the Islamic Republic of Iran is particularly impressed by uh communic and statements out of Washington I think they're going to better understand the language of force unfortunately uh and this this attack was a good step in that direction but there were reports from people on the ground nearby that uh there were a lot of personnel leaving these sites uh before the attacks came in I I I said in the Washington Post earlier this week that Syria was probably the right place to respond it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out and so probably what we ended up hitting here what we know we hit were weapons and ammunition storage sites probably with few folks in them and we also know that these weapons from these sites were used to attack US forces so here's a question I hope Congress is asking how long did this Administration know about these sites and how long did they know that weapons and Munitions from these sites were being attacked or used to attack our troops and how long did they wait to to to hit them I I think that's a serious question that I hope Congress will be asking yeah weapons made in the USA um this string of attacks in Iraq and in Syria um what role are US troops playing right now in these countries right the primary purpose of the 900 or so US troops in Syria and the 2,500 or so troops in Iraq is to keep the Isis califate defeated by working by with and through other people so Iran and Russia and the Assad regime want US forces out of Syria for a variety of reasons but that would be a disaster it would increase the chances that we would re see a Resurgence in the Isis caliphate what is the US position on Israel's ground offensive especially with us hostages in the mix I mean is Washington trying to to to slow it down I mean we've heard words to that effect coming from the White House the public position of the White House appears to be that they support is isel's right to defend itself after the worst single day attack on Jews since the Holocaust and they're also eager to get all the hostages back and there appears to be private conversations about some permitting some sort of window to permit that to happen but we also know that Hamas would like to string this out forever and avoid avoid the day of justice for what they did on October 7th what about the the the possibility of urban Warfare going into Gaza I mean that that has to be um a night nightmare for for any commander for any general I mean is that what the Israeli military has before it right now yes former US uh Commander General David Petraeus with experience in Iraq and Afghanistan has called uh the mission set in front of the Israel Defense Forces quote fishlyn there because of uh hamas's use of uh human Shields because of uh the we they've had many many months if not years to prepare they know the territory better than Israelis we should expect booby traps snipers improvised explosive devices this will not be quick and will not be easy depending on the scope of Israeli objectives and before we let you go if we look at the the big picture here to what extent has the United States been disengaging from the Middle East and do you think that that disengagement is over now I think the United States has been trying to reduce its military posture in the Middle East for a long time there's bipartisan consensus here that China is the number one threat and we need to strengthen our capabilities in the Indo Pacific but completely withdrawing from the Middle East something that never happened and will not happen would be a mistake because it'll allow small problems to become bigger ultimately requiring us to send more US troops back to the Middle East unfortunately what happens in the Middle East doesn't stay there and core American interests are at stake and I think these recent events are a reminder to Washington of that fact and Brett let me ask you we we've got time for one more question there are reports of the United States um trying to get the Israelis to hold off on this ground Invasion to give the us time to get um better air defense technology sent to the region what have you been hearing the US announced a few days ago that we were sending fad terminal high altitude area defense uh batteries uh uh battery singular to the Middle East and Patriot battalions uh those are fundamental because I would Point your viewers to January 2020 attack by Iran where they used ballistic missiles on two bases in Northern Iraq and more than a hundred Americans had traumatic brain injuries and that was because there was no ballistic missile defenses uh in the area and I think Washington wants to avoid a repeat of that horrible event Brad bman as always we cover a lot of material when we have you on the show we appreciate appreci it thank you thank
