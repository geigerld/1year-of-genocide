well as Israel considers its response to Iran's attack and continues to fight its war against tamas in Gaza there are fears over where these Regional tensions could head it's a complex part of the world with many rivals vying for influence Israel's neighbor Jordan and Regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia both appeared to help defend Israel from Iran's missiles to the surprise of many that was both countries are involved in a complicated Balancing Act making it difficult to predict how they might behave in the future when the drones and missiles from Iran came flying towards Israel many of them passed through Jordan's airspace not only did the Arab Kingdom help shoot them down it also opened its airspace to Israeli and US planes seeking to intercept them Aman insists that was strictly to protect its own citizens but Jordan's King Abdullah has to balance competing interests Jordan is pro Western and likes to keep in step with its allies especially the United States plus Jordan shares a long border with Israel and wants peaceful relations Aman often Works behind the scenes with the Israeli authorities but Israel's war in Gaza has outraged many jordanians one fifth of the population is of Palestinian descent including King abdullah's own wife the government has viously condemned the war but the Kingdom's received defense of Israel in the face of Iranian missiles has angered many Jordan's powerful neighbor Saudi Arabia also faces a difficult Balancing Act the Sunni Kingdom views Shiite Iran as its biggest Regional rival but last year it reestablished relations with Tran both the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates have sought to improve ties with Iran and Israel prior to Israel's intervention in Gaza Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman looked poised to sign a deal with the us where the kingdom might have recognized Israel in return for security guarantees from Washington but after 6 months of war in Gaza and tens of thousands of Palestinians dead that's off the table for now still Arab officials say both the Saudis and the Emirates shared intelligence with the Americans warning that Iran was planning an attack on Israel that probably allowed for a more successful defensive response by Israel and its allies the challenge for Arab leaders is to keep the US on side while not endangering their delicate relationship with Iran or being seen by their own people as supporting Israel at the expense of Palestinians in Gaza and for a closer look we can now bring in or alawi he's the director of the alod Center for political studies and independent Think Tank based in Aman in Jordan Mr alavi welcome to DW now Jordan and Saudi Arabia were involved in thwarting Iran's attack on Israel some Israeli media are now talking about a new military alliance against Iran is that what this is I don't think so and let us return back to the year 2021 when Biden first visit to the region being a president of the United States he tried to make Network regional network uh yeah between some Arab countries and Israel anti- missiles and the drones Network bringing together The Radars networks in several countries this network was very active recently and it bring a very rapid alert about the Iranian attack to Israel but to move forward to a military alliance between Israel and some Arab State I think it is still too far for different reason the war that Israeli continued in Gaza for more than 6 months now second the lack of confidence with the United State and its leading role in the region and the newa approachment between the regional powers that was emerged in the last 3 four years especially between Saudi Arabia and Iran Emirates Iran this will make it difficult for those countries to balance their stance but I think I'm quite sure it is not easy to go for an offensive military alliance between Israel and those uh countries so what precisely do you think it was that led especially uh Jordan and and Saudi Arabia to intervene yeah I think from the Jordanian perspective it was all about defending the country's sovereignity in in the one hand in the other hand Jordan will not be happy to see Iran involved deeply in this struggle because this will POS a serious challenge for Jordan Jordan and Iran maintain a very problematic relationship especially in the last few years based on the role of the Iranian proxies in the Northern and Eastern borders uh the smuggling of we and drugs and some statement by Iraqi militias and Iranian officials who who threaten Jordan in a way or another that why I think but that doesn't bring Jordan in the same bases with Israel because Jordan also consider what's going on in Gaza and West Bank as an existential threat for its M yeah uh stability security national identity this is really in the top of the discussion in the public debate in Jordan especially in the last seven months Jordan fear from the forced migration of Palestinian forced the transfer of Palestinian Jordan is very much feared from this statement by Israeli far right politicians who consider Jordan as Eastern Palestine and consider Jordan is the Palestinian State uh these are also an exist existential threats for the country Jordan is a trapped between if I may say and I Cote here some officials between two major treble makers uh in our area Israel and tan yeah it's a it's a um uncomfortable position to be in and what sort of conversations do you expect to be taking place behind closed doors in the Arab world right now not only in Jordan as Israel molds its options and considers how to respond to Iran's attack over the weekend not to allow Netanyahu divert the attention from Gaza to somewhere else this is a top priority not allow Netanyahu uh to force Palestinian to De or to deport them especially from Gaza to prevent by all means RAF battle that is planned by the Israelis to avoid this Regional turmoil and sliding to a regional widespread War this is a serious threat for those countries each countries has its own calculus and they want really to avoid such a horrible scenario for the whole region nobody will be a winning in such a widespread confrontation on the regional level therefore to calm down the situation is the top priority now now and to pressure Israel by American Allies and European allies not to go far in their retaliation because what we are quite sure about it if Israel attack Iran again because you should know that Israel started this this conflict with Iran by attacking the is Iranian Embassy in Damascus if the Israeli also retaliate to the Iranian attack the Iranian will retaliate again and this will be a vious of violence and I think the countries in the middle which is Arab countries mainly will pay a very heavy price this is the top priority to avoid such crazy scenario yeah um we just have to uh be specific here Israel has of course not claimed responsibility for the attack on the Diplomatic compound uh in in Syria that was or aranta of the alud center for political studies and Jordan thank you so much for all those insights thank you and for some analysis I'd like to welcome aido Steinberg with the German Institute for international and security Affairs we've just heard there in our report this challenge for Arab countries to stay on the side of the West even when that means uh supporting Israel how much do you think that this latest Iranian attack has complicated The Balancing Act I I don't think that ISL attack has complicated The Balancing Act um simply because uh the Arab Nations neighboring Israel uh have a lot more problems with is with the Israeli uh attacks in in Gaza with the Israeli War in Gaza against Hamas then with an is is with military action against Iran they all do agree uh with Israel that Iran is the greatest uh threat to Regional security and that is part of and that is part of the reason why Jordan and Saudi Arabia and possibly the United Arab Emirates cooperated with Israel and the United States uh in fending off this uh this Iranian attack last weekend do we know the extent to which they were involved in fending off this latest Iranian attack well they did play A Minor minor role uh but it was uh important especially we we have SE seen that Jordan uh even even shut down some of these some of the drones flying over Jordanian territory the role of Saudi Arabia might have been uh might have been even more important because Saudi Arabia opened up its airspace to American and possibly even uh even Israeli fighter jets um since 2022 some of these nations do have an agreement with Israel and the United States although partly unofficial about air defense and that's uh and the reason is very simple um Saudi Arabia the UAE Jordan and even Egypt to some extent they fear this growing strength um of uh of the Iranian missile program so even with that fear very much front and present when you look at a figure like say Jordan's uh King Abdullah you've mentioned also the strong public support within Jordan and these countries for the plight of the Palestinians concerns about what is happening in Gaza when you look at Jordan how does he go about maintaining these ties with Israel and the West um while also uh putting at ease the minds of the public about what's happening in Gaza yeah there is a major difference between uh between Jordan and countries like Saudi Arabia or the UAE although the populations in all these countries are adamantly on the side of the Palestinians and partly on the side of Hamas as well Saudi Arabia and the UAE are stable countries in full control uh of the situation in the country Jordan always has to fear a major mobilization of the Palestinian population uh in in the Kingdom but I think that might be one reason why this situ situation in Jordan has improved a little bit after the after the Iranian attacks simply because uh fighting fighting against Iran or at least positioning the the kingdom against Iran has more support uh in the in the country then siding with uh with Israel although only implicitly in its fight against Hamas so let's turn to the big question about what an Israeli response might look like what would a best case scenario be for the Arab countries or or a worst case in terms of what Israel decides to do I think uh that uh that some Arab countries especially Saudi Arabia would welcome a limited Iranian response they all want um Iran to be reigned in uh if not by the United States then by Israel they all fear Iran Iran a lot more than uh than than Israel at the same time they are very much worried about Regional escalation uh Saudi Arabia has once been under attack of of Iranian drones in 2019 and the then changed its re Regional policies totally Saudi Arabia has virtually tried to steer a non-aligned force in in in the last two years for the time being they would love like uh they would like the response to be of a kind that avoids a larger Regional War but in the long run uh They Are all uh extremely anti anti Iranian and they are aware uh that Iran has to be reigned in uh especially in its uh in its Ambitions to become a nuclear power well thank you so much for joining us with your analysis today that is g Steinberg from the German Institute for international and security Affairs we very much appreciate your time thank you we want to talk more about the role of Arab nations in this conflict with Hans yakob Shindler he's a former Diplomat and currently senior director of the counter extremism project which is a global policy Think Tank welcome back to DW sir we just saw in our report how countries like Jordan Saudi Arabia and the UAE helped Israel to fend off Iran attack on the weekend how unexpected was this thank you so much for having me this is really a moment where Israel can build a very strong Coalition against Iran in the last couple of years what we have seen is really Iran expanding its influence via proxies throughout the region isbah is much bigger than it used to be the houthis are definitely far more active than they used to be Iraq is essentially having a problem with a domination from tan Syria and the Assad regime are in the hands really at the behest of tan because together with the Russians they help to save the country and it has of course found a new found Regional power Russia as its Ally so Iran has really been able to position itself in the region pushing back against Western and Israeli support so it is now a chance because a expanded Iranian influence is not in the interest of uh I neither one of the other Arab states neither UAE nor Saudi Arabia or Egypt or Jordan would like to see a Middle East dominated by Iran so this is really a chance um that Jordan really defended uh itself and Israel wasn't all that much of a surprise because Jordan has the longest the second longest peace treaty after Egypt with Israel the real surprise uh was Saudi Arabia to a certain extent but discreetly over the last couple of months the whenever the houthis tried to shoot rockets and missiles not only at commercial shipping but when it tried to shoot those into Israel um Saudi Arabia has been very helpful uh not only in providing radar data but also shooting down some of those ones right and you're saying Israel is using the opportunity in your the beginning of your answer to to build a strong Coalition against Iran uh some people are calling this a new Arab isra AIS uh would you agree with this description by some observers I mean we're not quite yeah that so there is a coalition to defend against Iranian missiles already in place um but what I'm saying is this is a chance for Israel to build that Coalition um but it will of course also depend to a certain extent on what the Israeli reaction is going to be I don't think from an Israeli perspective there is any other choice to respond but you have seen the new nous War cabinet meetings over hours and hours deliberating what are the options what can be done what would be an appropriate response that to a certain extent we establish this deterence uh that Iran is not going to attack Israel now continuously uh um in the next couple of months but also doesn't exacerbate the situation to the extent that we are sliding into a regional war and as you say everyone is waiting to see how Israel exactly does respond do you think these Arab Nations would help Israel again if it were to strike back against Iran and provoke another counter Counterattack by tyan I mean helping Israel in an offensive operation I think this is a lot to ask even the US government seems to have made clear um that they are not going to be supportive of an Israeli air strike on Iran itself that doesn't extend to Israeli air strikes on hisa which is also a clear threat uh to Israel already in motion because you know more than 880,000 Israelis have not been living in the North of Israel since October and the Arsenal of hisbah is very vast the time to uh warn Israelis when isbah fires missile is much shorter than it was from Iran and hisbah acts at the beest of Iran so this is one of the options and with this option I don't think any of the Arab states would have an issue and looking at what happened in 20 6 where Israel attacked hisbah in a situation where hisbah had taken hostages and killed them um and diminished really its infrastructure in Lebanon um Iran's reaction was simply harsh words and then they rebuild hispa afterwards but I would assume that if the hisbah infrastructure especially its missile Arsenal is significantly degraded by Israel neither the Arab states would have a problem with it nor would Iran necessarily react to this and of course if there's another air strike of Iran on Israel I would assume that the likelihood is very very high that Arab states are going to again come to the aid of Israel I just wanted to ask you finally what you think this all means for the future of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza look we are now at a very complex situation really it's three different issues that isra has to sort out at the same time of course primarily there is still the issue that Hamas is in Gaza and as soon as Israeli troops had withdrawn from Kanan Yunis Hamas operatives uh were there immediately afterwards trying to you know put their version of Law and Order again in place so Hamas is not defeated in Gaza at this point this needs to be done Hamas cannot be allowed after a PO light terror attack to survive as a terror concern in the Gaza Strip not in the in of Israel but not in the interest of everyone else I just remind everyone we did arrest Hamas terrorists at the end of the year here in Germany and in the Netherlands that try to attack Germany and European targets um second problem of course is the ongoing shooting war with isbah partially on the beest of Iran partially on its own beest this is a real threat to to Israel on a daily basis and the third is the Strategic threat that Iran poses so not only the threat of an Iranian aerial attack again at the proportions that we have seen down the line at the next opportunity that they get but also they looming their looming nuclear program that was Hans yakob Shindler with a counter extremism project thank you very much for your insights and your time we really appreciate it thank you so muchad co-authored postrevolutionary Iran a political handbook it's also dean of the College of Arts sciences and education at Missouri University of Science and Technology welcome to DW I'd like to pick up on a couple of thoughts you tweeted recently about this conflict you said Iran's unexpectedly forceful attack shows the limits of American deterence so two things to pick out of that was this attack unexpected or forceful given that Iran telegraphed the attack in advance and used drones that took hours to arrive and two the limits of American deterence is an interesting idea I'd like you to expand on so let's start with the unexpectedness of Iran's attack sure so my sense is that you know uh when the Israelis attacked the Iranian Consulate in in Syria it was a provocative act perhaps you know intended to lure Iran into you know an attack of this sort because you know they realize that the Iranians need to save face code UN code and and I think you know what we saw was uh it in a way a daring but rather ineffective attack by by the Iranians that was uh communicated to to the neighboring Estates you know turkey and others that passed along the information and of course you know the amount of hours that it needed for those drones and missiles to reach the Israelis enable them to be able to uh do do a great job of protecting themselves and shooting down you know Iran's incoming uh drones and missiles uh so I think you know the Iranians felt obligated you know for for domestic reasons perhaps but also as a way of showing you know reestablishing their deterrence engage in this logic and perhaps now so forceful but ineffective let's pick up on the other part of that tweet then the the the limits of American deterence right so president uh Biden uh famously told the Iranians don't right don't attack but that wasn't sufficient uh to deter the Iranians from attacking uh you know Israel for the reasons I mentioned that they felt they had to do this thing that it also shows that you know a a state like Israel really still does need the deterrent factor of the United States to be able to both protect itself and deal with some of its Nemesis in the region in your series of tweets you also said that unless significantly challenged Iran's influence in Middle Eastern Affairs has escalated so tell us why and whether you think this might be something that Israel will factor into its response so I think you know Iran is viewed uh by many states in the Middle East as a rather intimidating neighbor right due to its size its you know military powers and and and so forth but it's also a state that doesn't really have reliable friends uh if you notice the type of uh actors that came and defended Iran's attack on Israel where the likes of Syria you know the Taliban and Iran's own proxy groups uh and it seems that almost everybody else uh was basically upset U intimidated by this thing and worried about the outcomes for example as you were reporting in the in your uh report right now uh you the Jordan Ian and and the Saudis have very good reasons a you know in terms of violation of their sovereignty and Aeros space Etc but also because they they realize that they want to be on the good sides of the United States and Israel in the long term a and just deal contain a threat such as Iran as as a neighboring state okay so we have this forceful but effective but ineffective attack launched by Iran against Israel as you would see and we have an Iran undeterred by the fact that America is standing behind Israel's shoulder so we're in this this this game of bluff and Double Bluff now where Israel says what do I do next where Iran has said if you do that we will slap you down so who calls who Bluff next right my my sense is that the same type of logic that perhaps forced the Iranians to Launch the attack on Israel is now forcing the Netanyahu government to a stand tall you know because you know for for a prime minister who is also uh you know under a lot of uh uh you know criticism domestically in Israel for the handling of the Gaza War etc etc you know he feels like you know he cannot be the Prime Minister that does not respond to Iran's attack with with the uh you know returning the punch however the question and and I think that's going to happen but the really the the main question at this point in my view is what would Iran do next certainly the Iranians are not you know capable of militarily standing up to Israel or prevents you know at attack but it doesn't mean that they are out of milit non-military options okay for example what if Iran really raises the anti by walking out of npt the nonproliferation treaty okay options beyond the me military we'll leave it there that's very interesting mad buedi co-author of post-revolutionary Iran a political handbook thank you so much thanks for
