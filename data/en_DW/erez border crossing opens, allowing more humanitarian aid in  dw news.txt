Israel's military has told DW it is opening the arz border crossing to allow more humanitarian Aid to enter through Northern Gaza the first shipment of aade to use the IRS Crossing is expected to arrive directly from Jordan Israel opened the rfak border crossing with Egypt in November and the Kem Shalom Crossing on the southern border with Israel in December the Us and other countries have also been airdropping Aid and the US is the process of building a floating Aid Pier off gaza's Mediterranean Coast DW's Tanya Kramer is near the aace Crossing in gaza's north and sent us this update a little earlier sending here not far away from the arys crossing that's uh one of the crossings that have been closed since uh October 7th since the attacks um this Crossing goes into Northern Gaza mainly it's not very far away from Gaza City now many countries have been pressuring uh Israel to allow in more Aid especially into Northern Gaza and the United Nations have said the situation there is a man-made crisis now the opening of this Crossing would allow trucks for Aid and for commercial Goods a shorter journey through dangerous territory while the war and of course air bombardment is ongoing they could come directly from the Port of ashot or also uh from Jordan through the land Crossings here but it remains to be seen how much Aid will come through this Crossing how much Aid will be allowed in Shina Lo is the communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council in Jerusalem and she explained why the crossing needs to be open well I think what we've heard from thus far as far as I know only food Aid is is being uh is entering through eras but of course the people in Northern Gaza need all sorts of of additional Aid shelter items hygiene kits um bedding clothes uh material fuel materials to to uh desalinized and and sanitize water all of these things need to be coming in we have been calling for months now for additional Crossings to be opening but it's not just about getting the crossings open it's ensuring that the aid that's needed is reaching Palestinians in the quantities that will actually make a difference and help to to stem the the and stop the humanitarian crisis that has been ongoing for the last seven months now practically speaking how long will it take for a delivered through ARS to reach the people who needed well that's unclear it depends on a variety of things like I said it's not just about opening The Crossings but it's about having the ability to safely deliver Aid wherever Palestinians are and so that means uh ensuring that that the notification system is working so that humanitarians can can access eras and also access the places that they need in order to to carry out distributions it means that we need the materials things as simple as trucks to to be able to go and fuel to be able to carry out those distributions uh what's desperately needed is is a not just a handful of trucks which we've seen very slight increases in the number of trucks entering over the last couple of weeks but we need a massive surge a flood of humanitarian assistance thousands of truck loads of of goods each and every day entering Gaza now let's talk about uh the south of the Gaza Strip Israel has struck Targets in Rafa again today what do you know about the situation there the situation in Rafa remains dire there are over a million Palestinians still Sheltering in Rafa uh an Israeli a planned or or expected Israeli ground offensive into Rafa would be catastrophic there simply is no safe place in in Gaza for Palestinians to flee to there aren't services available for people Water Sanitation hygiene Services uh housing and shelters to to accommodate an influx of people the situation remains dire as people are searching for for everything from shelter to food to water uh in order to to keep their family uh alive Sho there Communications adviser Jerusalem thank Youk you the Israeli military's confirmation comes during US Secretary of State Anthony blinken's visit he is meeting with Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu work continues on a ceasefire in Gaza as well as a deal to release the hostages that are still being held by Hamas and the flow of Aid into the war torn region it is blink's seventh diplomatic visit to the Middle East since Israel's military response to the Hamas Terror attacks in October last year for more let's uh bring inw correspondent Rebecca rtis who joins us from Jerusalem Rebecca what can you tell us about this meeting between blinkin and Netanyahu well these meetings tend to be closed door there was no press conference following the meeting but stuff that we are starting to here come out of it Gard is that Netanyahu told Lincoln that he wouldn't accept any ceasefire deal where Hamas maintain the demand for a permanent ceasefire uh he said that that is something that he wouldn't agree to and if they stuck by that demand then the deal would be off and the Israeli military would march on into Rafa that southern city uh now blink reiterated the US position he said that the US do not think that that is the best way forward that they do not agree that a ground offensive in Rafa is necessary and that it would be better handled by more targeted attacks blink certainly here to push for a ceasefire deal that's certainly one of the things that is really topping his agenda in this whole Middle East Tour that he's making as you mentioned the 7th since October 7 um you know you know the ceasefire was the predominant thing that we're hearing coming out of the meeting that the two men discussed blinkin also praised Israel for allowing more humanitarian Aid to come through but he said more still needs to be done I mean it's probably no coincidence that this arz Crossing is due to open today on the day that Bzz blink visits given the pressure that the US has put on for Gaza sorry for Israel to get more Aid into Gaza now blink has also met with the families uh of the hostages what did he have to say to them well that's also another really standard thing as I said seventh visit and each time that blink has come he's met with families of the hostages and you can imagine the kinds of things that he's telling them offering them any kind of Hope or wisdom that he can saying that the US is fully uh supporting and behind and putting pressure on for a ceasefire deal that he he hopes that every single one of their loved ones will return home he in fact said that they us won't rest until every man woman soldier civilian young or old is returned and back with their families but one man who who does have family in uh in Gaza said that Lincoln was very honest when he spoke to them he spoke to Media afterwards and said that uh that blinkin said he was very honest saying that they have little power to put pressure on a ceasefire deals so you know very limited with what he can tell these families but certainly trying to offer them some hope thew correspondent Rebecca R is there reporting from Jerusalem thank you Rebecca
