and as Israel's military winds down its operation in the north of the Gaza Strip some of the thousands of Palestinians displaced from areas like jabalia are heading back only to find there is little left of the place they used to call home Israel's war against Hamas has wiped out much of this neighborhood for those who've returned it's now a battle for survival and everyone must pitch in to to help gather the most basic of needs we've had a hard time since the beginning of the war all the basic necessities are gone there is a lack of everything there is no flour fuel sugar and almost no water we do nothing but fetch water all day hyam says his family Cook just once a day to conserve their Limited supplies and as all around them the threat of famine and disease grows thoughts turn the devastating impact of this war and the many no longer here all of my cousins are dead my wife's family is dead 36 people died in one swoop none of my children get any sleep we lie and say that what they hear are birds or that's it's a knock on the door even if Rockets or mortars are falling we try to reassure them but that's not easy to do when surrounded by the scars of conflict this is where I used to sleep now it's impossible to sleep the cold is killing us when we got back home I saw that my room toys and bed had burned down I don't have anything left and it's not just the buildings that lie in Ruins hope for the future is also crumbling as fundamental differences remain over a postwar future for Palestinians and Gaza and for more on this let's bring in Shaya Lo from the Norwegian Refugee Council which operates in Gaza she's joining us from Jerusalem actually you know we just saw in our report a family uh that decided to go back to the north of the Gaza Strip is it safe to do that you know it's it it most likely isn't safe to go because even if hostilities have subsided or ceased in Northern Gaza there's the risk of unexploded ordinances reports have been that as many as nine out of 10 bombs have not exploded so when you have families returning to Northern Gaza before uh un or humanitarian agencies have been able to go through and Ensure that a an area is safe you run the risk that people returning home who who managed to survive over the last uh 15 weeks could could end up returning home and finding that they're unexploded ordinances in their homes and and facing uh consequences such as uh those those bombs being triggered and and killing or Ming uh those seeking seeking safety and seeking shelter and another danger experts are warning of is uh hunger and and famine which they say could kill more people than the actual War and the falling bombs what's being done to to prevent that this is something that we've been concerned about for for many many weeks uh even even before the spread of disease as we've seen happen the UN has already reported over 8,000 cases of hepatitis A that have been reported due to people being in unsanitary conditions um uh really what we need to see is a massive scaling up of Aid and assistance going into Gaza in order to save off starvation ensure that people are getting uh the food that they desperately need the clean water that they desperately need uh the medicines and medical supplies that they desperately need unfortunately what we've seen is that Israel has prevented some of those essential uh Aid items including water de de uh desalinization uh Mach uh and and uh chlorine tablets to purify water uh from entering Gaza and so this is something that's going to perpetuate this Health crisis and so what we desperately need is the lifting of these uh obstructive obstructions and and restrictions from allowing all necessary Aid to enter Gaza and and and just briefly if I may why is Israel blocking the aid you know I think that'd be a great question to ask Israeli authorities uh there are claims that some of this Aid could be dual use but in terms of medicines uh clean water these are things that are necessary for the civilian population to survive Israel as the occupying power in Gaza since 1967 has an obligation to provide for the basic needs for survival of the occupied people what we've seen is that they have not been abiding by that obligation and they haven't been allowing third States and and uh and and independent noos uh International NOS from entering and providing that assistance if they're unwilling to do so okay Shaya from the Norwegian Refugee Council thank you so
