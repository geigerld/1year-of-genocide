Israel has rejected an order from the international court of justice in the ha to immediately stop its military offensive in the southern gazen city of Rafa the court described the humanitarian situation there as disastrous but stopped short of ordering a full ceasefire Israel insists its operations inside Gaza is in line with international law far from the front lines of the war in Gaza Israel's military campaign suffered a major legal blow Israel must immediately hold its military offense and any other action in the Rafa Governor which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part the latest icj ruling unequivocal about the need for Israel to protect Palestinians and do more to provide vital Aid the decision welcomed by South Africa which brought the case and has accused Israel of committing genocide this order is groundbreaking as it is the first time that explicit mention is made for Israel to Halt its military action in any area of Gaza this time specifically in Rafa Israel rejects accusations of genocide and the latest icj ruling War cabinet minister Benny gun said the fight to return its hostages would continue including in Rafa the icj also ordered the unconditional release of hostages being held by Hamas while the court has no way of enforcing the ruling it poses a major challenge for Israel's allies we have to choose between our support of international institution and the rule of law or our support to Israel and both things is going to be quite difficult to make comp the ruling is the Second Judicial blow to Israel this week the international criminal court has applied for arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister and defense minister over alleged war crimes both decisions adding to Global criticism of Israel's war DW correspondent Rebecca ritters joins us now from Jerusalem uh again Rebecca the Israeli government has been ordered to stop any sign it will well it's certainly been quite a week Michael um I think the answer to that question the short answer is no that's certainly not what we're seeing on the ground in a foreign Ministry statement after that ruling was handed down uh we we the statement said Israel has has not and will not conduct military actions in Rafa which may inflict on Palestinian population conditions that could bring about physical destruction so in almost denial of the accusations there coming from the court or from the rulings there prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu also rejected the allegations of genocide saying these things are simply outrageous we heard from the opposition y Leed also condemning uh this ruling from the icj so really across the board uh Benny gun the cist Benny gun who is a member of that war cabinet was more as you heard in that report actually was more uh even clear about the actions he said that that Israel would continue its just and necessary War to bring home its hostages betel smotrich the Finance Minister on the far right of Benjamin netanyahu's Coalition called the court anti-semitic so this is some of the the sentiment that we're hearing from Israel and certainly uh looks on the ground what we're hearing is that the fighting continues tanks continue to push in to rougher and eyewitnesses speak of uh huge bombardments and smoke rising over the area what's the reaction been from the Israeli public to the ruling well that all depends on who you're talking to a large portion of the Israeli public agree with much of the sentiment that we've been hearing across the board from the government they think it is unjust they think the world is against uh Israel and they feel you know the war is still relatively or more than relatively it is still largely popular here people do believe that it is the only way that they can get back the hostage a large proportion of society I should say believe that they also believe that the Hamas threat needs to be eliminated so uh certainly you know large portions of Israeli Society standing with that sort of Israeli government and Israeli opposition uh position that the icj ruling is unjust though of course there are members within Israeli Society saying that yeah this is absolutely outrageous and things should stop so you really have an opinion across the board but the majority is still standing on the side of the wall Rebecca as you well know eight agencies are warning of dire consequences for Palestinians in Gaza if the Rafa border crossing isn't reopened has there been any progress there well not so much with Rafa but there has been some other limited progress Rafa Crossing as we know has been closed since this incursion began now the Israelis say that they would be willing to maintain that it's open but the it's in fact the Egyptian side that don't want to as they say be complicit with um the incursion or with the control of rougher Crossing with the Israeli control of it so they have maintained its closure but there's they've struck a deal with the US just last night uh President Biden of the US spoke to president Cissy of Egypt and they uh coordinated and agreed that aid from Egypt that has been sitting at that raer Crossing you know some of it rotting waiting to cross over and also fuel Rafa is the only Crossing where fuel is able to cross now it will be diverted to that Kum shalom Crossing and some Aid will start to be able to go through there we've seen very limited amounts of Aid going through since the incursion began and we know that some 600 trucks a day are needed to avert the humanitarian catastrophe that's unfolding there our Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem thanks Rebecca and now we turn to Yanina Dill who is Professor of Global Security at the University of Oxford and joins us from Berlin she specializes on the role of Law and morality in international relations specifically in war welcome Yanina can you distill this for our viewers the icj the un's top court has ordered Israel to stop its military operations in Rafa and yet it has no power to enforce the ruling so what are the implications for Israel this is really a remarkable step in the kind of Genesis of this case because from the start really South Africa argued that in order to protect the Palestinians protect their rights under the genocide convention the court to interfere in how Israel conducts this military operation order a ceasefire and the court rejected this up until now it is very important to note that the court didn't actually order a ceasefire it also didn't order Israel to Halt all its military operations in Rafa but it very very clearly characterized the current military offensive that Israel is conducting there as posing a risk of group destruction to the Palestinian people and for that reason it needs to be halted the court is is quite clear on that matter and that's a quite direct interference in how Israel conducts this war and it's also a much more direct link that the court establishes between how Israel conducts this war and the risk of genocide um and the rights of the Palestinian people to be protected from it explain to us how the judges might have arrived at this decision so this is the third time they ordered provisional measures and formally speaking they need to diagnose a change in the situation on the ground to order additional measures and this time the Rafa offensive loomed really large um last time it was really the humanitarian situation the looming famine which gets mentioned again this time but it is really the Rafa offensive that led the judges to the decision to order additional measures and specifically they say they're not they were not convinced by Israel's submission which argued that Israel could protect the civilian population in Rafa in line with its obligation under international law and conduct this offensive operation there instead the court says amplifies the evidence of um un experts and un bodies and really almost any neutral Observer who has over the last weeks raised the alarm basically saying that it's incompatible this offensive operation with the basic protection of the civilian population and as you mentioned the court says it's exceptionally grave it calls the situation disastrous as you may well know it was reported that uh Israeli bombs fell on the Gaza Strip just this morning including Rafa com Common Sense might suggest that tells us all we need to know about how Israel will react what does it tell you and is the ruling likely to change anything going forward so we have um come to expect the reactions from the Netanyahu government right there's always a mixture of Bluster um in terms of like the court can't tell us what to do but also there's always an attempt to spin these orders and this time the attempt was to say well the court actually didn't tell us to Halt our military offensive it just said that any military offensive that in principle poses a risk of group destruction to Palestinians would have to be halted now this is not a plausible reading or interpretation of this court order but I do take some heart from this attempt to spin the order because it does suggest that Israel understands that this order has weight compliance doesn't really depend on anything happening in Israel right now it really only depends primarily or only on how Western allies of Israel react to it particularly the United States um I only see a chance that this or um order will make a difference for how Israel conducts the war if the Biden Administration Gets behind it and conditions any further support on compliance that is Yanina Dill professor at the University of Oxford and an expert on war and morality we thank you for your time and perspective
