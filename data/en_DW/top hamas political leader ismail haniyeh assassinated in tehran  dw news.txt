we lead off with some breaking news Hamas political leader Ismael hania has been assassinated in tan Hamas said in social media post that hania and his bodyguard had been killed at their residence in the country no one immediately claimed responsibility for the assassination but suspicion immediately fell on Israel which had vowed to kill Hanah and other leaders of Hamas over the terrorist groups October 7th attacks on Israel reporter Alona marova is following this breaking news Alona what do we know about this attack so far so what we have so far are two separate statements one is from Iran's revolutionary guards and the other one is from Hamas so I'll quote the first one Iran's revolutionary Gods say that the residence of isma Kia the head of the political office of Hamas Islamic resistance was hit in Teran and as a result of this incident him and one of his bodyguards were killed then we also have Hamas they confirm this attack and they blame Israel right away they call it a zenist attack and I'm quoting here they also worn of grave escalation and they also call this attack a cowardly act that will not go unpunished so talking about Israel of course as you said we haven't gotten any confirmation yet and we shouldn't expect it in really short time usually they don't confirm it right away so and Israel has been trying to actually Target hania for a while after the October 7th terror attack and apparently we we still need to wait the for the confirmation but according to Iran's revolutionary guards and to Hamas itself uh he was successfully targeted targeted and I also want to remind you that K was in Iran for the inauguration of the Iran's new president and he was targeted there in his residence all right Alona marova with our news team thank you very much thank you and for more on this we're joined by Benham Ben tblu he is a senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracies and he joins us from Washington Benham welcome back to the show explain this to us how significant is hania's death well it's great to be with you again this is a huge political setback for the runback terror group known as Hamas uh hania as you know was in tan where the patron uh of that group actually resides siia had met with Iran's supreme leader and Iran's ninth president the newest President massud pesan right after being sworn in uh mere hours before you couldn't have a starter contrast he was hobnobbing with senior political religious and military officials from the Islamic Republic seated next to members of the uh constellation of Terror and proxy forces that tan calls the axes of resistance chanting death to America and death to Israel and then hours later this news as you had just reported uh is breaking I think if you had to contrast this with the other reported assassination uh that we had spoken about earlier today a Lebanese high-ranking military official in the suburbs of beut that one is designed to throw a terror group off balance by robbing them of a certain capability by targeting a person that has a particular military aptitude this is designed to send a strong political message and things could go 5050 right now with the rest of the Gaz of War as well as the foreign patri in Iran because this attack did happen on their soil should we assume then that Israel is behind this assassination we know that they've targeted top Hamas leaders they've made no secret about that I do believe in this case it's it's quite possible to connect the dots I'm not sure if the uh Israelis will ever come out and potentially confirm uh this story they may have a political rationale to do so a bit later on but a the reporting timeline right now is quite tight and B they don't always confirm uh these things but as you mentioned there is a certain trend line here but even if we zoom out uh there's a different picture and there's a picture not created by analysts or anything else there's a picture uh related by a Former Intelligence minister in Iran Mr Unice if I'm not mistaken where he talked about how punctured uh the state Security Services war and I believe he even said uh that no Iranian official should sleep soundly at night ever since he said that and this was many years ago well before covid um you've seen a whole series of things go go bump in the night assassinations um of people even in uniform on Iranian territory targets uh kinetic and cyber against Iranian military nuclear facilities so this seems to be the latest in keeping with that Trend and many poter a finger during all of those assassination attempts and Espionage and cyber and sabotage operations had a foreign intelligence service with this capability and intent and when you put all of these together Israel is most likely the actor behind it you said this assassination uh sends a statement what will it actually mean for Hamas and its organization well uh in the Gaza Strip in particular uh it could mean two things one it could lead to the expending of the military capabilities and assets and kind of the coming out uh from using some of the human Shields and and embedment and and embedment within some of the refugee populations uh in the go strip and an expending of the military forces and assets they have or it could lead to Greater uh external involvement to bad Hamas uh if indeed the AXS of resistance sees uh that that piece is about to be taken off the chess board and the Israelis double down trying to press their advantage again things could go quite literally 5050 right now it could lead to a major uptick uh that pushes the israelies back or could lead these relies or provide these relies the opportunity to take the advantage and militarily double down because this was a politically stunning move uh quite like what happened in January 2020 uh in Iraq when the US killed Iran's Chief terrorist and head of the ks force uh Major General kasum sumani are there successors waiting in the wings for hania and are they likely to be more militant less militant what are we likely to see it's unclear but listen this is the Middle East things can always get much worse not better uh but I will say this there is again a sharp contrast in the logic of going after a political leader of a terrorist organization uh versus someone with a certain localized capability the intent if one is looking uh to cut off the head of the snake here is not to Rob them uh of a certain War fighting capability it's that stunning kind of political effect that is usually followed up by something else so again all eyes should be on the region right now uh not uh to assess political secession and what may happen with a potentially different Secretary General of Hamas in particular what may happen in Doha uh where that group uh does have its political headquarters but really what will happen on the ground in the Israel Gaza War as well as in all the other kind of connected fronts uh for example a couple of hours ago for the first time ever there was a report that uh Iran back Shia militias in Iraq had fired for the first time ever since October 7 a ballistic missile uh towards Israel so there could be an intensification of the campaign uh outside of Israel uh against that country in the aftermath of this news can you tell us a little bit more about Hana and how his role differed from maybe the military structure that was still within Gaza I tend to believe that you some of the cleavages or stem charts that exist in Western analytical and academic circles about a political Wing versus a military Wing is is a bit more projection and us foisting a a different distinction without a difference onto some of these group structures um I know for example that you know hania's uh distance uh from you could say the battlefield does not mean he would be any less involved or does not mean he would be any less involved or not have any kind of knowledge uh in operations particularly operations that ended up becoming uh the October 7 terrorist attack this person oversaw the structure uh the funding uh the channel the pulling away of money uh and assets and resources uh to make Hamas what exactly it is which is this resilient uh terror group uh in the Gaza Strip and what about Iran itself this happening uh on the Eve or on the uh just in the immediate aftermath of the inauguration of its president what does it mean for this country what kind of statement does it send about them and as you've already touched on their security capabilities um I think in a post April 13 April 14 World and and that was really a world in which the Islamic Republic which has fought many of its covert and Shadow and proxy wars um from a distance and and and without kind of an over kinetic uh element with Israel now there's always a non-zero chance after the regime fired drones cruise missiles and ballistic missiles directly to Israel there's always the chance that it could step out of the Shadows again and the analytical question has been what could be the trigger to get them to step out of the Shadows if I had to guess this wouldn't be it again it's very different to go after a whole series of irgc commanders in Syria and spill Iranian blood and have that be a different threshold for the use of force than to go after uh one element of Iran's acts of resistance on Iranian soil but nonetheless because this act did happen on Iranian soil their likely is going to be a significant Iranian element in the response whether that's just quarantine to rhetorical uh or more financial and material support to its proxies that remains to be seen but the fact that the irgc and many SE semiofficial news outlets were so quick uh to confirm this news uh tells you that the regime is in in the business right now waiting through what has happened and is probably thinking through a respon all right that's Benham Ben tobl with democracies thank you very much thank you and we go over now to DW correspondent Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem Rebecca good morning this news is still quite fresh are there any reactions there so far yeah this is incredibly fresh very much a developing breaking story stepen so we have had to to to date no reactions from the Israelis and as you heard from the guest who was just speaking there it's very possible in fact quite probable that we won't hear from Israel unlike with the retaliatory strike we saw earlier last night earlier on Tuesday evening in beay rout kiding um a key Hezbollah Commander we will where we had you know almost instant confirmation from uh the Israeli military that they participated in that attack it's very likely that we will not hear from Israel on this particular strike though it it is certainly looking all accounts from what we're hearing and from what we've been hearing from Hamas and Iran uh that it is likely uh that Israel was responsible for this attack though we may never get that confirmation from Israel and this is certainly uh going to be a shock if not a surprise if you can separate those two things is hania was certainly uh very much on The Wanted list on Israel's Wanted list and Israel promised they would go after the leaders of Hamas in the aftermath of the vicious attack on October 7th and they uh if confirmed that's certainly what they have been doing here now we have had some reaction from Hamas uh the terror group has confirmed that Ismael Han was killed in Iram blaming uh blaming Israel for that attack and a spokesman for the group has said this was a cowardly act that will not uh be in vain it's something that they uh were prepared to they said we're waging an open War to liberate Jerusalem and we were ready or we are ready to pay uh an incredibly high price so uh obviously this news is going to be shocking for those across the region but it may not come as a huge surprise isma Han was also uh named by the IC uh uh is um uh the head prosecutor there uh requesting an arrest warrant for isal hania along with Yaya Sina and Muhammad daf to other leaders now Israel claiming that they did in fact eliminate Muhammad da in an attack uh a few weeks ago that has still not been 100% confirmed but Israel saying that is more than likely that he was killed in that attack and now we're seeing another leader um is hania uh also targeted so uh the only person left on that ICC list list is Haya sinoa who is believed to still be alive in Gaza now of course this is ratcheting up an already uh tense uh time in the region uh we are hearing from all accounts we haven't had final confirmation but it does appear that unlike what we were hearing with the attack that just happened earlier this evening in Beirut where Israel uh was thought to have warned the United States before carrying out that attack it certainly appears that this attack happened uh without any for uh prior warning to the United States now one thing that this is of course going to affect is the hostage negotiations is M Haner played a key role he was a key interlocutor in those negotiations for uh the Hamas side he often traveled as a a delegation as part of a Hamas delegation uh to conduct those talks now obviously that is going to his death is going to play a significant role in those ongoing negotiations DW correspondent Rebecca Ritter's in Jerusalem thank you very much
