now Iran's president-elect has met with a deputy leader of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in tran massud peshan seen here on the right is taking office at a time of soaring tensions in the Middle East Israel blames Hezbollah for a rocket strike that killed 12 children in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights over the weekend hezbollah's Chief Ally is Iran which the US and Israel say is fueling conflict in the region Israel and hisbah have been exchanging missiles and Rocket fire for months with fears of a wider regional conflict mounting after the latest attack on a Drew Village in the Israeli occupied Golan height which killed 12 young responsibility Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly framed the as a fight between Israel and Iran which backs Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza Netanyahu brought up Iran during his recent address to the US Congress we meet today at a Crossroads of History our world is in upheaval in the Middle East Iran's access of Terror confronts America Israel and our Arab friends in addition to Hamas and Hezbollah Iran also backs the houthis in Yemen which have launched a series of attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aiden the stated aim to weaken Israel and undermine American influence in the region to a proud Irish ameran Zionist following the October 7th Hamas Terror attacks fighting has intensified the conflict has opened up fronts in Iraq and Syria where Iran has encouraged its militias to attack US military bases the power of the resistance is becoming more evident every day the Zionist enemy with all the help from America and some treacherous governments has failed to immobilize or overcome the resistance forces 10 months into the war hisbah and Israel have carefully calibrated their attacks to prevent an escalation but the latest strike on a sports field in Israel controlled territory is once again fueling fears that these isolated incidents could turn into a regional conflict between Israel and its neighbors near and far Ricardo alcaro is with the Institute of international Affairs in Rome welcome to DW now with tensions growing between Hezbollah and Israel what message is the newly elected Iranian president trying to convey by meeting officials from Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad on the day of his inauguration a message of continuity I mean pesan comes from the reformist camp of uh Iranian politics but he becomes president in a very very difficult uh moment uh the regional predicament of Iran is volatile it's dangerous and Iran has been sticking to its main allies in the region since Israel started its devastating retaliation against hamas's attack on October the 7 2023 so there is no way pesin can start its uh presidency without showing allegiance to the network of allies that have been for the past several decades or at least two decades being one of the main pillars of Iran's Regional and security policy the newly elected Iranian uh president pesh Kanan reportedly told the French president in a telephone call that any Israel attack on Lebanon will have serious consequences for Israel do you think we could see another Iranian attack on Israel anytime soon there is there is certainly a possibility uh although I don't think it is very much likely there certain conditions uh must be met in order for Iran to determine that he has the incentive to risk the potential retaliation that it would incur if it were to attack against Israel and those conditions are the following either uh is Israel attacks Iran directly on its territory second Israel attacks Iranian diplomatic facilities as it dided uh in April which triggered Iran's uh direct response against Israel or third and this is the one that worries me the most Israel engages in an allout war with Hezbollah and Hezbollah is by far Iran's most important Ally in the region and Iran would not be tolerating the possibility of esbah being destroyed so at one point Iran would would feel the need to intervene and support of esbah if isbah were put in a very difficult spot by an Israeli Onslaught if we could just talk about that scenario three a little bit more Hezbollah of course depends on Iranian support how much does Iran control hezbollah's decision in this situation look I think that if isbah wants to do something something that the Iranian leadership is adamantly and absolutely opposed to Hezbollah would have a hard time doing that but this is really a French situation uh it's not very likely that this is the way how Iran and esbah would sort out the differences the decision making Pro processes that Iran and esbah have established over the course of two of two decades and actually more than two decades is very much persuasion of ented dialogue based and it's not like Iran commands and asbah follows so um it's not really a matter of control it's a matter of can they get to some sort of strong consensus between the two about what the red lines are that Israel has to cross in order for esbah to engage in an allout War international relations analyst Ricardo alcara Ricardo thank you so much for your time and for your analysis thank you for having me and let's get more from makram Raba he's an assistant professor of history at the American University of Beirut welcome Mr Raba how great would you say is the concern in Lebanon that a war with Israel might be on the horizon well actually the people of Lebanon are in the midst of War but what they are actually waiting for at the moment is a so-called punitive strike which Netanyahu and Israel has Ved to to do against hisbah for targeting the soccer pitch in the julan and the killing of the 13 children so basically everyone is anxious because no one knows including hisbah what will be the extent of the strike and at the same time no one knows how will hisbah retaliate but as is everyone has telegrammed in a way that they don't want a fulls scale escalation or a total war not because they want to avoid war but at least in the mindset of Netanyahu he cannot fight uh two fronts at the same time andah and Iran simply want a way out and they are trying to negotiate this with the Biden Administration but thus far they has failed miserably uh to convince the International Community to force a kind of a cease fire is a response from Hezbollah to any potential Israeli strike dependent on the nature of that Israeli strike well hisbah simply cares about the Optics and this is why it all depends on what type of strike the Israelis will take we have been hearing from the Israeli side something which is similar to the Huda scenario and they have used this term in particular so they want something theatrical something that would be sending a message to the International Community and to hisbah and Iran in particular however ironically sir there's nothing to destroy in Lebanon anymore hisbah has done this on behalf of the Israelis at the same time we don't know if hisbah has the ability or its calculated response to any Israeli strike would not spill over and cause a kind of a regional War Hezbollah depends on Iranian support but how much does Iran control hezbollah's decisions in this current situation well Hezbollah again is a is a Iranian proxy and while Hezbollah might have some sort of individual Agency on how to fight the decision to fight comes from Iran and tahan and here we don't want to say that they are ordered but they are part and parcel and organically connected to the Iran ruary guard and the Secretary General of hisbah Hassan n carries a kind of weight and he virtually and figuratively sits on tahan's war council so he is allowed to lead the confrontation here however the the overwhelming talking points or the general direction of the conflict has been set by tan and newly elected Iranian president masud pesan reportedly told the French President Emanuel macron in a telephone call I think it was that any Israeli attack on Lebanon will have caught serious consequences for Israel does that mean we could potentially see another Iranian attack on Israel well I think the Israelis want would like a kind of this theatrical light show which the Iranians did after their Embassy was targeted because as you are well aware sir this has caused the International Community to come to the aid of Israel so if the Iranians continue uh to do this so-called Shadow Boxing and try to uh uh threaten threaten Israel's existence and send these Rockets across many of the Arab countries this would be actually beneficial for Netanyahu and his talking points as well as to the Hawks in his cabinet so I think the Iranian president who claims to be a reformer doesn't really call the shots in Iran the people who do are the are the guards and and at the moment no one is listening to any sort of logic calls for peace everyone wants war or they want to actually be able to capitalize on the blood of the innocent across across the border that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is of course closely linked to the war in Gaza Hezbollah has said it will stop its attacks on Israel as soon as there is a ceasefire in Gaza do you believe that well hisbah might want to do this because simply even when they opened the so-called front in the south of Lebanon to support the Palestinians they had failed miserably nothing has changed and the people of Gaza are dying at the same rate as before however this idea of unifying the fronts between Lebanon and Israel this is something that Netanyahu and the Israeli military has chosen not to accept meaning that after the end of the war in Gazza the military establishment will have to rethink what it will do in Lebanon and thus this idea that the end of the war inza will simply translate in the end of the war in Lebanon is totally unfound we'll leave it there for the moment but thanks so much for joining us today Mak Raba from the American University of Beirut thanks so much
