now top EU officials have joined a growing chorus of condemnation after an Israeli air strike on a School Compound killed dozens in Gaza City the eu's top Diplomat Joseph borell expressed his horror at the attack which gazan officials say killed more than 90 people Sheltering in the school Egypt and Qatar are demanding an urgent investigation the US has said it is quote deeply concerned about the strike Israel has repeatedly claimed that Hamas uses schools as cover in the wake of the October 7th Terror attacks tabin School reduced to ruins after an Israeli air strike in Gaza according to an official from gaza's Hamas run government around 6,000 displaced people were seeking shelter in the compound at the time Witnesses say the school came under attack while people were offering Dawn prayers Israel as usual didn't give a warning it strikes regardless of whether they're children women young or older adults these were peaceful people in the mosque people were praying washing some were sleeping upstairs including children women and older people the Missile hit them without any warning first one missile then another one we recovered them as body parts the Israeli military has confirmed the strike saying it hit a Hamas command and control center embedded within the site it says numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians many of the casualties were rushed to Gaza City's Al Ali hospital they dropped a missile on them while they were just preing God the strike comes at a time when mediators Egypt Qatar and Saudi Arabia are pushing to resume ceasefire talks but Egypt's foreign Ministry says that quote the deliberate killing of Gaza civilians shows Israel has no intention of ending the war Alexandra Saia is a is head of humanitarian policy and advocacy at the organization save the children I asked her what she has heard from her contacts in Gaza my colleagues this morning told me that there are still bodies trapped under the rubble of this destroyed School families have been picking up pieces of their dismembered families family members in plastic bags there are reports of more than a hundred people killed um but it's difficult to verify these numbers because families are essentially picking up body parts this is the deadliest attack that we've seen likely since October on a school um but we are seeing Israeli attacks on schools almost every single week um in recent months um and it's important to note that the filies that were Sheltering in the school were there because they have nowhere else to go um so many buildings homes in Gaza have been destroyed parts of Gaza are uninhabitable and this is the only place that families had to to try to seek Refuge um it's just absolutely horrific and unfortunately what we're seeing is a normalization of something that should never be normal with schools a a regular Target is there any safe space left in Gaza there is no safe space in Gaza there's nowhere safe for people to go I mean even you know save the children has um an office um in in Middle Gaza and even there a few meters away from our office we were we there were air strikes and so there's no safe space in Gaza there's no safe space for children there's no safe space for Aid workers you know this is the conflict that has seen the most number of Aid workers killed on record um so these attacks are happening where children are are are Sheltering where families are Sheltering and where AID organizations are providing Services n Gaza is is in Ruins um nearly everybody has been displaced at least once since the start of the war many of them of course children are we looking at a Lost Generation here we I mean children what what we hear from their parents is that the the children have no hope for the future it's not only that we're seeing children killed every day but they're being maimed they're losing their Li lims due to the use of explosive weapons in densely populated areas and when they um lose their limbs there's no physio therapy for them there's no um medical care that's able to rehab help them rehabilitate um and on top of that the infrastructure that children rely on uh to prosper in the future have been destroyed a record number of schools have been destroyed hospitals have been destroyed they've been deprived of essential supplies uh to provide medical assistance we are still seeing Aid including medical supplies obstructed from coming in and obstructed from from being uh distributed across Gaza to people in need and so it what we hear every single day is that parents say their children have no hope for the future especially when there is absolutely no sign that things are slowing down well thank you for joining us on DW news that is Alexandra say from save the children we appreciate your time today let's speak to DW's correspondent Tanya Kramer joining us now from Jerusalem Tanya we've just seen some of the footage of the aftermath of the air strikes there what has Israel said about this well Israel's military maintains that it was a a place where Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives were using basically uh as their Command Center the school and mosque compound where people were forced to shelter many people have been displaced so many times and they're Sheltering in those schools now a statement this morning already said that the IDF the military had struck with position guided missiles um it also climed we heard this also repeatedly in other strikes Hamas for operating within uh civilian shelters uh basically uh taking people as human Shields and the military spokes person also questioned the numbers that were given out by the uh uh health authorities in Gaza about the number of casualties now having said that this is not the first strike that we are seeing the un's human rights office released a statement today and said they have recorded over 20 strikes on schools in in the last month alone since July 4th and uh they also have said you know uh while it is of course would be a grave violation if uh according to International humanitarian law if armed groups use these schools also Israel has an obligation to International humanitarian law and they have to look at questions like proportionality and uh taking uh precautions so what we're hearing from eyewitnesses there on the ground uh there are these casualties there are many injured they have Burns uh many have lost limbs and this comes of course on the backrop of a very difficult situation in gaza's hospitals that have difficulties to deal with s such mass casualty uh events T today Egypt said that Israel's quote deliberate killing of unarmed Palestinians shows that it lacks a political will to end the war in Gaza what impact do you think this strike will have on ceasefire talks we are expecting a new round this Thursday well I'm not so sure what difference this strike will make as as we've seen other strikes uh on schools uh in recent uh weeks uh but of course it underlines the need for a ceas and we've heard these condemnations especially also here in the region from Egypt from Jordan from the United Arab Emirates but also from the EU but of course for people in Gaza these are mainly words it doesn't really change the situation uh for them so last week we heard from the mediators from Qatar from Egypt uh also from the United States that they have rescheduled talks uh or scheduled talks for next Thursday we also got a confirmation from uh the Israeli side from the prime minister's office that they will send a delegation but we're also hearing from prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu that the war will only end when Hamas is removed from power we also hear from sources within Hamas that they're also studying a proposal but it's very difficult at this point to understand where those talks stand uh you know whether they have any chance of success also given the situation in the region where the region is waiting for some sort of or possible retaliation by hasbullah or Iran uh against Israel but it's all connected of course uh what is going on in Gaza so it's very hard to understand uh where those talks will be going well thank you so much for bringing us up to speed there that is Tanya Kramer our correspondent reporting today from Jerusalem
