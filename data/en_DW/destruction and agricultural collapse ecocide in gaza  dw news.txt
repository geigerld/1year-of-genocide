this is what gaza's Farms used to look like thriving Olive Groves Strawberry Fields and Green Houses bursting with tomatoes much of that is now gone the Israel Hamas war in Gaza has destroyed gaza's ability to produce their own food once the war is finally over will they ever be able to sustainably grow food again 1 billion US Dollars uh destruction and and the agricultural uh uh sectors it was really shocking to me we are facing the huge problem of the water there are many ways to assess the costs of Israel's war in Gaza one is what activists and researchers call an ecosite it's the destruction of the Flora and the found it's a deliberate Act of equaide the deliberate Act of the destruction of an environment so much so that it cannot be inhabited today most of the world Associates Gaza with images like this but people who know the territory well remember it very differently Gaza is not the Gaza that we know now the territory was once largely self-sufficient in producing vegetables fruit Dairy Meat and Fish no need to import any of this the the best the best fruit of bell peer I saw it was in Rafa agronomist nasar quad from the a organization anira has worked with Farmers across the Palestinian territories for many years the the best uh strawberries you'll find them in the North in uh in be and it's well known uh for uh uh strawberries in the years before the current War the Gaza Strip grew so much produce that they could export some of it mostly strawberries tomatoes and cucumbers to the West Bank in Israel Gaza farmer farmers are very smart very Innovative they are insisting they never surrender because they love their [Music] land 10 months into the war abundant harvests have given way to destruction and a dire humanitarian crisis Regional authorities in the Gaza Strip say that the Israeli military blew up over 30 water wells in July alone the water shortage impacts use for drinking personal hygiene cooking and washing but it also impacts crops both in the short and long term you know agriculture without water is nothing there is there is an a heavy destruction of of the water infrastructure Mahmud El Saka joined the NGO Confederation Oxfam in 2015 he currently oversees the organization's food security and livelihood support in Gaza the irrigation networks the carer lines and also the demolitions of of the land and even the water wells for agriculture even destroyed the un's food and agriculture organization says the invasion of the Israeli military has brought agricultural activities almost to a complete halt many gazen farmers especially those in the North had to flee their homes and Farms following Israeli evacuation orders they were telling us that they've heard their Farms have been destroyed they've heard that kind of like there's nothing left of their Greenhouse or their farm San maafi is a researcher with forensic architecture a london-based University Research group that investigates State and corporate violence their recent research has identified more than 2,000 agricultural sites that have been destroyed since October 2023 that's when Israel began its current military offensive vowing to eradicate Hamas following the group's terror attack on Israel forensic architecture has documented what happened to this family run Farm in Northern Gaza which used to grow olives pomegranates and citrus fruits all the trees are taken out all the crops are taken out um the the surface of the Earth has been raised um New Roads have been put in place new Earthworks have been put in place effectively the area has become a kind of a um a a kind of like a military base you know bulldozers come and they excavate everything uh if Fields Orchards green houses and Destroy whatever uh in front of uh uh them this is one thing the other the other thing is the bombing what I saw is a really rapid development of the damage to the land it was really shocking to me he Yin is a satellite imagery analyst and assistant professor at Ken State University his work is visualizing evidence of the destruction of gaza's tree crops as the war continued our analysis um found that until early July 2024 more than half the agriculture fields in Gaza were destroyed satellite data is one valuable source of evidence to map landscape changes like damage or destruction another is on the ground information such qualitative findings are the foundation of forensic architect ur's research looking at a site only from distance using satellite is not enough often with our work we have um an Insight from the ground that confirms what what we see on a satellite is actually taking place echoside is a term preferred by some research and activists who understand Israel's destruction of gaza's agricultural sector and livelihood to be deliberate we put this allegation to the Israeli military they say that all of their operations aim to dismantle hamas's military capabilities and that the militant group often operates from agricultural land but forensic architecture also says Israel's destruction of Gaz and agricultural Farms is not new and even predates the war by several years I think um it was um around 2018 that we were asked by farmers in um a to investigate the destruction of their crops we were told by the farmers that um uh these crop dusters Israeli crop dusters are flying very close to the Border maybe even you know they couldn't tell exactly what side of the Border it is they're flying very close to the border and they're spraying herbicide and the herbicidal particles are coming and covering their Fields the Israeli Ministry of Defense confirmed that aerial herbicides were sprayed along the width of the perimeter of Gaza we realize they're happening twice a year right before the Harvest Time the majority of the crops in Gaza they are tree crops like Olive like a pistachio you know fruit trees as well and it take years to grow so if the war and tomorrow let's say it will still take years or maybe forever to recover of the agriculture sectors tree crops like the Olive Tree need at least 3 years before they bear their first fruit field crops like tomatoes are easier to grow but require an average of 2 to 3 l of fresh water per day the Legacy and tradition of cultivating fresh produce remains a point of Pride for many gazin who manage thriving pet es even amid the rubble one of these Farmers is 24-year-old Yousef Abu rabi who is trying to revive his family's destroyed Farm in a north of the strip what will it take to restore gaza's once thriving agricultural landscape and will it ever recover we need to have a full access for the different inputs equipments tools for the agricultural sectors they can uh build Gaza if if there is an international will and there is international support if the borders are open and uh and the orts are allowed in and I don't know if we can um repair what has been lost but I want to also say that Palestinians um are a PE like are people of resistance um that they know their land best and if there is anyone who can repair this land that's them
