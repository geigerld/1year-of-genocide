the international Criminal Court's top prosecutor is seeking arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister as well as three Hamas leaders Karim Khan says the men all bear responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the war in Gaza and the October 7th Terror attacks in Israel Yahya sinir is hamas's leader in Gaza he's one of the men targeted by the ICC arrest warrant request so is this ish Han the qar based political leader of Hamas the third is hamas's military strategist Muhammad DF the icc's top prosecutor says he has reasonable grounds to believe the three are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed on and after October the 7th murder as a crime against humanity and as a war crime The Taking of hostages as a war crime rape and other acts of sexual violence during captivity as crimes against humanity and as war crimes torture during captivity is a crime against humanity and is a war crime Khan is also requesting an International arrest warrant for Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister yuav Galant 7 months into the war he thinks the two who bear direct responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza including using starvation as a weapon of war and intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population Israel like all states has the right to defend its population it has every right to ensure the return of hostages that have been criminally and callously taken those rights ever do not absolve Israel of its obligations to comply with International humanitarian law NYU rejects the accusations as prime minister of Israel I reject with all my soul the comparison made by the prosecutor in the he between Democratic Israel and the mass murderers of Hamas this is a complete Distortion of reality Israel is not a member of the ICC and doesn't recognize its jurisdiction but if warrants are issued which may take months those named could face arrest if they travel to one of the Court's 124 member states which include most of Europe but not the United States we're joined Now by Chile Ebu uji who served as president of the international criminal court from 2018 to 2021 welcome to DW Mr oi I want to start by asking you that does the fact that these warrants are being sought already mean that there is sufficient evidence that must be what the um prosecutor sees the prosecutor must present to the uh three judges of the pre-trial division uh evidence that shows that there is reasonable grounds to believe that the people are being sought in the arrest waren um committed International crimes or responsible for international crimes so must he would not be moving forward if he didn't believe have evidence he believed to be strong enough to sustain such a move it's up to the judges to decide whether or not they agree with him of course but then so in your experience do you think these warrants are likely to be granted then I cannot second guess that I mean it would mean prejudging question the um what I can tell you however is that um in my experience um both as a prosecutor before being a judge a prosecutor Rwanda genocide tribunal special court for seran and so on and as an academic teaching this um many people have been tried and convicted for less than what we've seen in the media so far well we know that Israel and and the US have called this move outrageous we heard in that report that it equates a country defending itself with the terrorist organization but as you just pointed out that others have had warrant for less than what you've seen so far but what do you what's your reaction to that assertion that it's not a fair comparison that's not how you look at it you this is a political statement the legal statement is do we have a law and what does thatan laws say when you look at what that law says and then you compare it with the evidence then you make you come to a legal conclusion you don't um telling calling somebody terrorist or not doesn't it's neither here nor there in that legal calculation even uh Democratic states some leaders of Democratic states have been known to do things that they should not do um Hamas yes carried out a horrid attack attack on the on the 7th of October in which 1,200 people um died the killed uh so far the um idea of operation has resulted in the deaths of more than 34,000 people that mathematics um there already tells you that there is something wrong that needs to be looked into well we also know that crimes against humanity is a very serious accusation especially against a Serving Leader and we also know that the ICC has already faced criticism for not issuing similar warrant against leaders like serrian President Bashar Al Assad or Iran supreme leader Ali K do you think that undermines the icc's credibility not at all that again there are things to be looking at here the um in the situation in um relating to Israel has to do with paltin being a neighboring state and Palestine being a state party to the Rome statute and the Rome statute gives the IC jurisdiction over crimes committed on the territory of a state party you don't have the same with um Syria you don't have the same with Iran of course if you have the same with Syria or Iran you'll be seeing the same name configuration the closest comparison you may look at maybe Myanmar for instance Myanmar not a state party to the Rome statute but Bangladesh is a state party to the Rome statute but when ringas were driven out of Myanmar into uh Bangladesh because Bangladesh is a state party to the Rome statute that was a basis for the court to exercise jurisdiction over the matter so that's the closest comp comparison not um Syria not Iran if you have neighboring states who decide to join um the Rome St neighbors of Syria or Iran and then the effects of that war seen on the territory of those States then you can be saying well what about that that's a really interesting clarification that you just made there but I want to Circle back to what you said about the political statements before we go uh we've seen that different leaders react based on who is being charged we saw that the reaction to the ICC warrant against Russian President Putin for example was widely applauded we're seeing criticism here do you feel like that hobbles the reach and that that hobbles the actions of the ICC well the that cannot be a blame on the ICC at all the the the the blame for that will be on those who will make that kind of calculation decide on the political basis um what indictment they support and what not you cannot blame the international criminal court for that for what politics States choose to play oh yes uh I I just mean to say not so much to blame the IC but to ask does that limit its ability to function as it's meant to of course it does definitely so when you have States who play politics with the rule of law yes it does constrain the ability of the rule of FL now um when I write and talk about this thing there's somebody whose views we must always take into account in 1945 April 1945 two days or so before he was appointed as the chief prosecutor of the United States for nurenberg Mr Justice um Robert H Jackson gave a speech to the American Society of international law in which he said look we cannot have a rule of law that operates on the basis of our National interest for basis of what we wanted to do for us International rule of flaw for it to have meaning and effect in protecting the world and humanity and even the Americans he said needs to applied even-handedly impartially regardless of who um you're looking at as your allies or as your enemies some fascinating insights there thank you so much for laying that out so clearly for us Chile e uji a former president of the international criminal court thank you I'm joined Now by Jeffrey nce he was a prosecutor at the international criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia he was lead prosecutor at the trial of sodan mosovich he joins me tonight from Canterbury England Mr Nice it's good to see you again is the ICC Prosecutor's request is it a done deal I mean will the arrest warrants in your opinion will they be issued well of course I can't answer that question because I'm not the judge and I have haven't seen all the evidence but Mr khah has indicated that he's set himself a higher than normal standard whether the judges will apply that or not uh in order to be satisfied that the evidence could lead to a conviction he's also I know taken independent advice from a body of experts acting pro bono and sort of behind the scenes to check on whether he may have made any mistake so it's pretty likely that the evid he's presented will be strong whether it's strong in respect of all five or some of them we can't decide but I think it's quite likely that just simply from what he tells us about the way he's done his work yeah that you may get some of these arrest warrants issued yes you you say that this these are the higher standards for this case what do you understand um under higher standards well as he explained in the indiv he gave with Christian amanpur um he didn't rest on the reasonable grounds to believe level he relied on a reasonable Prospect of conviction level which is a bit higher now all these standards are easy to State and hard to test but what he's saying is okay here's the standard of the court and I've made my standard a bit higher than that so and that's a sort of responsible approach to take in an issue as sensitive as this we heard from US President Joe Biden this evening he said that this announcement was outrageous and he said that we are dealing here with um false equivalencies that you should not even try to compare Hamas with the government or the of Israel I mean does he have a point there did the prosecutor did he have to make this announcement today did he have to announce that that he was seeking an arrest warrant for Israeli leaders in the same breath that he said he's seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leaders why do it together well he certain he didn't have to he could have done it on different days on the other hand if if he'd only decided to do it on different days for political appearance reasons that would have been pretty unsatisfactory as well I don't know what happened inside the office that led them to look at the situation and to decide that these five requests for warrants could be made um but I don't see that there's any question of his trying to assert moral equivalence he simply said here's the law here's the people on each side who for the time being I'm going to ask warant should be issued so Biden's response is you know political response as is the following bit of the statement I think from blinken where they say that no efforts have been made to allow or no sufficient efforts have been made to allow Israel to deal with these matters themselves overall I think that it's unwise both America and Great Britain if it does it and Germany if it does it to start speaking against what the prosecutor has done we all have to remember that the reason things like this happen is because we have incompetent politicians who make terrible mistakes whether they're the politicians in Israel Gaza Hamas whatever you like or the politicians who've been sitting around them for the last century and 20 years seeing the creation of the state of Israel and doing whatever they've done not to succeed Ed in heading off this huge foreseeable tragedy so we got lousy politicians or bad politicians you may think and it doesn't really sit very comfortably in their mouths when they didn't stop this happening by creation for example of a one-state solution for Israel and Palestine or for a two-state solution when they let it drift for so many years doesn't sits very easily in their mouths now to complain when an independent body composed of uh professional people who've got no interest in selling their integrity for some political objective whose only interest will be in getting the job done well doesn't sit easily in the comfortable in the mouths of uh supporting parties such as the United States be off hand in condemnation of What's Done Mr let me pick up on that you know you say that the prosecuting attorney that they they're using higher than higher standards than they normally would and that they are handling this case with the utmost care then certainly the decision to announce that they're seeking arrest warrants for these leaders Hamas and Israeli leaders announcing that together there has there had to be a reason there had to be a decision to do that and to have it seen together for public consumption do you agree no I don't even understand your question because it's you who've got to justify the question why should decisions on a different day I'm saying that nothing is up to chance nothing is up to chance I think that the prosecutor knew exactly what he was doing and I'm trying to ask you what why do you think he did what he did today by grouping them together I don't know but if you put yourself in his position and he looks at the evidence in the round all of it favorable unfavorable Hamas Israel and he sets his team to work and his team come back and say well here's the evidence that looks like it's this these two and these three against whom there's enough evidence and then probably they had a review and then they have a discussion with their independent panel of experts and they come to the conclusion that this three and this two should be indicted it would be a bit of political window dressing of the worst kind to choose to go for one first and the other second and which one should go first I I'm afraid I don't follow your question but by all means go ask Mr Khan um if he wants to answer you I don't know whether he will but ask him well why did you not do it on different days and see what he says well well I can't ask him tonight but I'm glad that I had you to ask um another brilliant legal mind Mr Jeffrey nce always good talking with you we appreciate your time and your analysis tonight thank you you're welcome all right I want to go now to our correspondent a Ibrahim she's in Jerusalem covering this story for us I so talk to me about the reaction that we're getting out of Israel we just heard the the Prime Minister there the tradeit he has now uh commented and this came after a series of reaction reactions from senior Israeli political uh figures in addition to the Prime Minister uh calling uh this move by the ICC prosecutor disgraceful he has also accused the prosecution of anti-Semitism which is an accusation that has come out of political leadership time and again throughout the this war against multiple International bodies whenever Israel finds itself uh in a position to be in a position where it's accused of things like uh uh war crimes or even when it's subject to heavy uh criticism um in addition to the Prime Minister we've also heard from the president uh who is seen as sort of the spokesperson for the spirit of the nation if you will uh we've heard from the Israeli foreign minister Israel cats all condemning uh uh this move or this um this move by the ICC prosecutors seeking the arrest of Netanyahu and Galant we've also heard from Israeli opposition on this who have been very critical of the Prime Minister and his government and the conduct of the war but in this issue they sort of uh voice the same concerns as the Prime Minister we've heard from y y Leed the uh leader of the opposition who completely rejected uh this idea this notion that Israeli uh leader ership and Hamas leadership can even be mentioned in the same breath because of course the prosecutor while he didn't make a direct comparison between them he did uh he is seeking arrest warrants for both Hamas and Israeli leadership in the same statement and Israel does not recognize the jurisdiction of the international criminal court so what impact is this going to have if any right now the prosecution is uh seeking an arrest warrant so there's no arrest warrant yet so effectively this doesn't really uh hinder or limit the movement of the Prime Minister or his defense uh Minister but if we were to arrive at a situation where there is indeed an arrest warrant this would limit the movement of these two uh senior Israeli uh politicians if they were to find themselves in a country that does recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC that country would be uh obligated to facilitate their arrest and their transfer uh to uh the ha but this is uh you know one of the late latest the latest of me of a series of diplomatic blows to Israel on the global stage um you know in reaction to how it has uh chosen to conduct uh this war DW Z Ibrahim with the Ladi tonight from Jerusalem Aya thank you
