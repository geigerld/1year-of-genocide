elsewhere the UN Security Council is set to vote in a few hours on a resolution demanding a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas which is labeled as a terrorist organization in many countries the Algeria sponsored plan representing several Arab Nations calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire as well as the release of all hostages the US has said that it will veto that resolution and has instead proposed its own it calls for a temporary ceasefire linked to the release of hostages it is yet unclear if the US resolution will be put to a vote as well for more contacts let's bring in DW correspondent Aman SF who has the view right now from Jerusalem so I mean why two resolutions what's what's different between them well there's actually a lot less difference than you might think it essentially boils down to the wording on the time frame for the ceasefire so whereas the Algerian ceasefire resolution calls for an immediate ceasefire uh the UN resolution calls for a ceasefire and the release of hostages when practicable both call for the release of hostages of course but that is because the US is worried that the ongoing negotiations between Israel and Hamas for a ceasefire deal that would uh be uh linked to the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas they're worried that that would fall apart uh if a resolution passed that called for an immediate uh ceasefire now those talks have been going on for a couple of weeks led by the US and the United Arab Emirates and they have basically Fallen apart after Israel withdrew saying that uh the Hamas demands were delusional so the US really wants to keep up pressure on both sides to get a ceasefire deal um what's interesting here though is that the wording in the uh this UN resolution which could be proposed uh after the Algerian resolution is vetoed uh the wording there is much stronger than we've seen in past us resolutions which has often been very watered down this is the first uh resolution the US proposed that is actually using the word ceasefire so that shows you how far the Biden Administration has come in being critical of Israel's war on Gaza and Amy and the uan the US has been very vocal in its criticism of Israel's planned operations in Rafa has Israel taken on on board that criticism publicly uh they've been very defiant and there is no sign that they actually uh questioning whether or not they should go ahead with this ground assault in Rafa uh the delay might after the announcement of the ground assault and rafle there's been quite a bit of delay and no uh time frame given by Israeli military yet that might suggest that they are taking into account some things that their closest allies are saying about how this would be a disaster for security in the region and a humanitarian disaster but they still haven't put forward any plan uh to save the lives of civilians there's 1.3 million and gazin uh who are up against the Egyptian border there in Rafa it's the last uh City in Gaza Strip that still has functioning infrastructure so it's very unclear where people are supposed to go but Israel has said that if uh they don't see the release of all Israeli hostages by March 10th that's the beginning of Ramadan then they will go ahead with this ground assault talk with us about the pressure that the Israeli government is under to ensure the safe release of the remaining hostages there are many families in Israel who go out once a week at least uh in Tel Aviv Jerusalem and other places demanding the uh that the government the Netanyahu government does a lot more to release these hostages don't forget that a hostage deal basically is the only way to release Mass hostages uh through nonviolent means essentially the last deal they saw about a 100 hostages released by Hamas coming home to their families and a lot of the families that still have people uh who are being held by Hamas in Gaza they want to see their relatives freed Israel has basically uh stalled on any talks to release hostages um and have asked they they basically want to use military means and that angers a lot of families in Israel Aman essf in Jerusalem thank
