last month the un's top court ordered Israel to take provisional measures to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza since then there have been growing calls in some countries to stop weapons exports to Israel the UN has said countries supplying arms to Israel could be complicit in violations of international law for almost 5 months Israeli troops have battled Palestinian militants across the Gaza Strip the war has taken a heavy toll on civilians in the territory leading to International accusations that Israel's not doing enough to prevent civilian harm and high-profile calls for arms exports to Israel to stop how many times have you heard the most prominent leaders and foreign minister around the world saying too many people are being killed President Biden said this is too much on the top it's not proportional well if you believe that too many people are being killed maybe you should provide less arms Israel is one of the world's leading arms producers but it's also dependent on imports from abroad especially from the US and Germany according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 67% of Israel's Imports of major weapons came from the US from 2013 to 2022 28% from Germany and 5% from Italy the US does not publish details on its military aid to Israel but media Reports say it has supplied tens of thousands of weapons since the October 7th terrorist attack including bunker busting bombs and precision guided Munitions in 2022 Germany approved the sale of 32.3 million EUR worth of Defense equipment to Israel that figure Rose tenfold in 2023 to 326.50 million e most of the permits were granted after October 7th and included portable anti-tank weapons and ammunition I make concerns that supplying weapons for the war in Gaza May violate International humanitarian law Italy and Spain say they have halted all arms exports to Israel and in mid-February a court in the Netherlands ordered the Dutch government to block exports of F35 fighter jet parts to Israel following a case brought by human rights groups Israel has rejected calls for an arms embargo saying it's fighting the war in Gaza in self-defense and in accordance with international law well let's get more on that topic from Marina Miran she's a defense analyst with the war studies department at King's College London Marina how Reliant is Israel on foreign arms good morning Gard what we have to understand in the Israeli case that it has always been reliant on external specifically the US support uh the United States has been supporting Israel economically and militarily since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 meaning that um the US has spent about 300 billion in the entire period providing Israel with arms and economic help however arms have been a major part of it therefore any withdrawal from this help from this aid from the United States especially would mean that Israel will lose its defensive capacity and the United States has pledged to ensure that Israel can defend itself and this is of course in the foreign policy interests in the region for the United States now the US is far less transparent about the arms it sends to Israel than for example what Ukraine gets why is that well one reason for that could be a security reason because Israel is getting very Advanced high technology whereas Ukraine is getting older technology that is not critical to US National Security therefore those contracts um might not be as transparent however in some cases we do get to know what Israel gets because Israel is always the first to get their hands on a more advanced military technology amongst other Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia who are also purchasing military equipment from the United States so the lack of transparency in this domain might um increase the chances that the adversaries of Israel cannot prepare in advance for a specific type of weapon and the other reason might be political especially given the fact that Israel has been criticized even prior to the um October 7th attacks um when it comes to the use of military force so there is a political component of that as well let's uh talk about where Hamas is getting its weapons it says it's still firing rockets at Israeli targets where are these Rockets coming from stockpiles or are the supply routs still functioning well there are different sources for Hamas to get their weapons from and there are reports of course that Hezbollah has been supporting Hamas when it comes to getting their weapons um there are smuggling routs and um presumably the tunnel Network and the connection to Egypt is still functioning so that Hamas can get their weapons now since the conflict has started it has become more difficult however what we have to remember as well that an important source of weapons for Hamas is the Israeli military itself the New York Times has reported that Hamas managed to plunder certain Israeli military bases and uh Hamas can also use unexploded ordinance in Gaza in order to build their own missiles and Rockets and this is a concerning Factor given how much Israel is firing into Gaza and the fact that 10% of the ordinance fired fails to explode Mar they have Kings College London thank you very much thank you for for having
