the Israeli Army has stepped up its operations in Northern Gaza pounding the area with air strikes and encircling Gaza City Israel Defense Forces are expected to enter the city soon they have been preparing for urban Warfare with the islamis militant group Hamas which is likely to lead to a sharp rise in casualties the Israeli troops have already severed Gaza City from the south of the territory for more I'm now joined by DW correspondent Ben fulan who is in Jerusalem Ben it is one month now since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel murdered more than 1,400 people and abducted more than 230 people to Gaza how are Israelis remembering today uh it's a going to be a a day of mixed feelings a full day of remembrance with flags flying at half master right now I'm just a stone throw away from the gates to East Jerusalem to the old city where there will be uh vigils held by Palestinians and Israelis uh together to remember all those who've died so far during this conflict but I'm right in front of one of the uh vigils where people have been lighting candles just moments ago uh and you can see the posters of those who were kidnapped uh but as I say there are also this is going to be a day of feelings there are also going to be protests protests outside the entrance to the knesset the parliament people are also angry about the government's response also the government's uh performance leading up until this time the uh surveillance records of the government and uh the fact that there were security lapses and that this happened at all security lapses to say the least uh Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has expressed openness at least in theory to Tactical pauses can you tell us anything more about that well uh the general mood here is also for no ceasefire and Mr Netanyahu has made that extremely clear this talk of there being a temporary truce or a humanitarian pause uh is really only talk at the moment uh there have been demands from uh Arab leaders for this uh but until all hostages are returned uh this is not going to be on the table as far as Mr Netanyahu goes in an interview uh with the US uh News Network ABC Netanyahu made significant comments about Gaza let's listen in those who don't want to uh continue the way of Hamas it certainly is not I think Israel will for an indefinite period will have the overall uh security respons ibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have it when we don't have that security responsibility what we have is the eruption of uh Hamas Terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine Ben Netanyahu there saying the country will take responsibility over the Gaza Strip after destroying Hamas what exactly does he mean this is the most interesting development we've had in days as far as uh the political side of this debate goes and it's the first time we've heard any sort of mention from Netanyahu about a plan the day after the day after the war that is because there's been a lot of criticism uh as to uh netanyahu's response sending in these forces now in full force but without a plan for what's going to happen afterwards the Palestinian Authority which is in a very weak position right now has been suggested by US Secretary of State blinken to uh be revived revitalized and to Take Over Control of the Gaza Strip there are a lot of doubts about whether or not it can do that the other suggestion has been uh a group of countries and international agencies to provide governance and security for the Gaza Strip but as you heard there it sounds like Benjamin Netanyahu wants to do that that is DW's Ben fulan reporting from Jerusalem many thanks Ben I'd like to now welcome Frank ledwidge a senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmouth University and a former UK Military Intelligence officer Frank uh Israeli troops have encircled Gaza City and are preparing to push into the city center do we have any idea how many Hamas Fighters they're expecting to confront there well good morning Michael I think we don't have an idea of that but I'm absolutely certain that there is probably fairly fairly accurate assess assessment on the part of the Intelligence Officers of the 36th division of the Israeli Army the most powerful armored unit they have uh who are about to enter so I can't really speculate on that the overall context is that there are 20 or 30,000 within Gaza The Enclave itself but there's no way of telling how many in Gaza City I would suspect there are going to be a fairly High number as I will want to make a stand the Israeli uh projection is that this particular phase of the operation for Gaza City will take months not weeks it is in fact existential for uh Hamas so I take your point um Israel's made it repeatedly clear their goal is the destruction of Hamas in particular its leadership and their headquarters in Gaza City does the IDF believe Hamas leaders are in fact still there they say that they have over the last four weeks or so probably the last two weeks really killed in the region of 30 senior commanders that's Brigade commanders that's commanders of about 3 or 400 and Battalion commanders 100 or so the numbers are different than Western armies which would indicate that they do uh believe that some of the leadership is there now one of the functions of cordoning off that the northern Gaza area into the northern sector of operations is to seal off Hamas leadership and of course personnel who are already there and kill them or capture them I suppose in some cases and I have no doubt at all that the assumption is that there there is significant elements of Hamas leadership there of course the overall leadership is in Qatar although there are operational commanders Dave for example who are still certainly in Gaza now the Israeli Army is advancing into the city with the 36th division we understand some of the best trained Personnel in the IDF what more can you tell us about this division it's one of the older units in the Israeli Army it's a what the Americans would call a stored unit with battle oners going way back into the 50s and and late 40s I think but I think it's important to Bear one thing in mind Orly many things really but one thing particularly is the power of this of this unit so to put things in context it has combat power comparable combat power not numbers here so the numbers probably between 10 and 20,000 plus support and Logistics SS but the combat power is similar to that of the British army so that one division there eight or nine reserve and regular divisions in the Israeli Army divided into brigades but the 36th division has combat power equivalent to the British army so when you see those pictures of these all inspiring shock and or barges not only from the artillery that's what you're seeing you're seeing the power of a large modern well equipped Army and its most powerful division about to go into action like I say just to stress by Western European standards it's an extremely powerful unit very well equipped Frank I'm curious uh if the Israeli Army succeeds in taking over Gaza City what does it mean for the progress of this war is it essentially over or will they face something like what the American forces confronted after toppling Baghdad a smattering but persistent resistance of Guerilla forces hiding among the local population I have no doubt whatsoever that they will and this fed into the decision by Netanyahu I think over the last or expressed over the last day to for Israel to take control of this because there's no appetite whatsoever on the part of the Arab countries who talk a great game but do very little with respect to Security in that particular region and even less I think with the British the French and the Americans who I think have had quite enough of occupying hostile areas in the Middle East so essentially left only the Israelis and of course the Israelis will be facing undoubtedly as you put it dister Guerilla action when and if well when they they they take this area the question for me and I don't know the answer to this is what as you said what will they do then will they then start grinding South will they start incrementally going South to put a huge pressure of course on the population and resources we don't know the answer to that yet but for now the question is how long will this take the answer is this phase months reminds me of what former Secretary of State Coen pal said he said you break it you own it when he was talking about Iraq of course that is a Frank ledwich senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmouth University and a former UK Military Intelligence officer many thanks as always Frank thank you Michael let's now bring in Shaya low a communication adviser with the Norwegian Refugee Council based in Jerusalem Shaina the UN chief Antonio gues says nowhere is safe in Gaza very few would know this better than your own team on the ground there what are they telling you so we have a staff of 54 trapped inside of Gaza most of our staff has fled from the north to the center and south of Gaza but as as you said no safe no place is safe uh just this morning I spoke to my colleague Yousef who's in KH Unis who told me that there was an air strike on a building very close to where he was sleeping uh around 6:00 a.m. this morning uh day after day we are hearing from our colleagues that who even those who have fled that the south is not safe uh we've had colleagues lose family members in the South including one of our colleagues Amal whose seven-year-old son khed was killed in an air strike on Rafa a couple of weeks ago uh and and what we're hearing in addition is not just is it not safe in the South but similar to the north people now are struggling to find basic necessities uh food clean water um uh even waiting in line five six hours a day just to get half a portion of bread um the Palestinian uh red crescent uh says that Aid deliveries into Gaza are much lower now than before the war I'm afraid it's a question we'll keep asking until there's significant change on the ground but how dire is humanitarian situation today each day it seems to be getting worse and worse just two days ago I spoke to a couple of my colleagues who told me that they hadn't been able to find any water that day and were res resorting to drinking Cola because they had no Alternatives um we are struggling Even in our Aid distribution that we're working on to find water and procure water to distribute to those who have been internally displaced day after day we're hearing that it's getting to be even more of a struggle to find these basic Goods um and until there's a a huge ramping up of the assistance going into Gaza people in in throughout all of Gaza are going to continue to suffer the important thing also to note is while we need a huge increase in the amount of Aid going in I think we had 90 true trucks yesterday which still fell short of the 100 trucks minimum that the UN has said is needed uh in Gaza is we need uh fuel to be order to in order to be able to distribute that Aid throughout all of Gaza and reaching the few 100,000 people who remain in Northern Gaza and we also need a ceasefire in order to assure that that humanitarians can go and distribute that Aid and people seeking assistance can go and access that Aid safely and without concerns that they will be uh killed killed while seeking out Aid understood your organization is one of many asking for ceasefire one month after the conflict started what are your hopes you know it feels hopeless day after day but we need to keep pushing the International Community to demand a ceasefire Palestinians in Gaza cannot take it any longer each day our colleagues tell us is the worst day of their lives and the next day turns out to be harder than the previous one uh a ceasefire cannot come soon enough we need an end to this madness we need an end to these hostilities we need an end to the killing and displacement uh really I cannot stress how much we are praying and hoping for a ceasefire uh despite the fact that we're hearing uh resistance coming from Israeli authorities our thanks uh to Shaina low from the Norwegian Refugee Council for your time and your perspective thank you well the European union says it is stepping up its delivery of Aid to Gaza so for more on this let's bring in DW correspondent Rosie burchard who is standing by for us at an airport in Belgium ausen Brugge airport where a plane with Aid is preparing to depart good morning to you ra Rosie good to see you so tell us what Aid is actually being sent yeah good morning from aad near the Belgian coast and behind me that plane is getting filled up with humanitarian Aid mostly what I've been told is it's nutritional supplements so food to get to people and also Health supplies so medicines equipment for hospitals which we're told is really there's a dire need for it now that plane will be bound for Egypt where it will be taken the stocks will be taken by the Egyptian red crescent and then into Gaza now the EU says it's had has over the past month essentially quadrupled its humanitarian Aid aid for Palestinians and we've heard from the EU commissioner this morning here at this airport saying that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire I asked him if he had a message for people there and he said he wanted to let them know that the EU has not forgotten about them and we'll stand by their side right well getting Aid uh shipped is naturally a good start Rosie but how effectively is this reaching people in Gaza well I spoke to a representative of the Red Cross here and he put summed it up really clearly he said well no a is any use if it's stuck in a truck and so far the figures that we've been given here this morning are that several hundred trucks of Aid have been able to enter Gaza through that Rafa crossing over the past few weeks but that was described to me by this humanitarian worker as simply a drop in the ocean and we also had a persistent call a ref A Renewed call from the eu's humanitarian Aid Chief saying there needs to be more humanitarian access there is not enough there's not enough ways for them to get Aid in so the fact that moid is being sent obviously the EU wants to send that message of support but also they say they're continuing to press they say all parties to try and let more to get more access to so that more Aid can actually make it to those people in that dire need as described here by EU officials now the United Nations has insisted on a ceasefire where does the European Union stand on that well the European Union is divided you might have heard me say this on many other topics but really on this one EU countries are have been battling over this really negotiating down to every single detail of every single word officially the EU the European Council so that's the member states have called for humanitarian pauses and corridors for humanitarian needs so essentially pauses in fighting to let Aid in now the commissioner here this morning who represents the European commission so that's the executive arm of the European Union said it doesn't matter which word you use whether it's a pause whether it's a corridor whether it's a ceasefire but of course for a divided group of member states words really do matter and the EU is still pretty much at odds over this even if they have managed to negotiate some statements so far now there have also been what was first described as a kind of muddled response there was an announcement weeks ago just in the direct aftermath of the attacks there would be a suspension of certain development payments that was then backtracked on so somewhat muddled response so far but certainly officials here this morning trying to send one message of support today say the people in Gaza thanks Rosie DW correspondent Rosie burchard at H Belgium's aand Brugge
