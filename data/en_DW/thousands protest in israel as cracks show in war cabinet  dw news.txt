cracks have begun to show in Israel's war cabinet over the future of the Gaza Strip Former Defense Minister Benny Gans is threatening to resign from the cabinet unless the government comes up with a concrete plan for a post-war Gaza he had joined ASA show of unity after Hamas launched the October 7th terrorist attack Now Guns has set a three-week deadline ramping up the pressure on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile fighting between Israel and Hamas is intensifying Northern Gaza is seeing some of the fiercest battles of the war so far months after Israel declared the end of operations in the area while in the South hundreds of thousands flee fighting in Rafa many of them not for the first time heavy clashes Rock the southern gazen city of Rafa as Israel pushes ahead with its assault against Hamas the you know United Nations says 800,000 people more than a third of gaza's population have been displaced from the area despite having nowhere to go the northern part of the strip is also Under Fire in jabalia Israeli tanks roll through the devastated streets the Army says it's conducting quote precise operations against terrorists and infrastructure inside Israel thousands joined the weekly anti-government protests in Tel Aviv they want the Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu to resign and new elections to be called this uh government is taking our country to places that uh I don't I don't want to see my country go to I see corruption I see lack of Hope I see lack of vision u i see mediocracy and even below that and we won't change meanwhile in Jerusalem new cracks are emerging in netanyahu's Coalition Centrist Benny Gant seen by some as a moderating voice in an otherwise Ultra conservative government gave the rest of the cabinet an ultimate him while Israeli soldiers are displaying incredible bravery on the front some of the people who sent them to battle are acting with cowardice the war cabinet must write down and ratify an action plan that will lead to the realization of six strategic objectives of national importance by the 8th of June if Benjamin Netanyahu chooses to follow the zots and lead the nation into an abyss I will resign from the government if Gant does resign it would not force an election the Coalition still has a majority but there are fears a moderate voice would be lost at a time when it's needed the most so what effect will this renewed heavy fighting have on the current Israeli government strategy and policy our Middle East analyst shanni rosanes is here to talk about it good to see you shannie um there has been a rather dramatic statement by War cabinet minister Benny guns what's he had to say yes well um he joined the the government um shortly after October 7th to strengthen the government as an emergency Unity government he is a former General in the Israeli Army he's considered to be a Centrist politician and what he's saying tonight to Netanyahu is basically he's setting an ultimatum he's saying you uh the country has been hijacked by the most extreme parts of the right uh Coalition we need to do a complete re rehal of our strategy uh he's demanding several uh things but the two most important ones are are um demilitarizing Gaza uh in in in the Civil way sort of like making sure that the Israel military can only operate when needed but that the daily conduct of what's happening in Gaza whoever takes care of Gaza and the gazan population need would not be Israel but rather a joint uh Alliance that is headed and led by the Americans and he also talks about Israel publicly announcing and making active steps in order to get into this um normalization pact with um Saudi Arabia something the Americans have been promoting for the last months that will bring you know American Saudi um Alliance together with Israel and along with that also a lot of many other moderate Sunni countries in hopes to sort of reshape the balance of power in the Middle East against Iran um so these are some of his ultimatums tonight and we are seeing basically in this statement that all that we've been hearing quietly whispered by Anonymous sources in the last months is actually out in the open a very open Rift a very open um uh disagreement between the most leading uh figures in the Israeli government these days okay so there's a lot packed in there that the gauntlet has been laid down an ultimatum as you say what then has Benjamin Netanyahu had to say in response well he immediately pushes it back he says well you know ultimatum should not be set to me but rather to Hamas and and and gans's words will bring the feat to Israel his attitude will not help us win um and and Gans is trying to push back against that we see a lot of this back and forth and interestingly enough you would wonder well Netanyahu is a prime minister he could just you know if he wanted he could fire Benny gun right now why is he not doing it or why is Benny Gans not actively saying immediately I'm withdrawing from the government and so what we're seeing here this political dance for both sides are trying to put the blame on the other because there's an understanding that the minute that Benny Gans and his party are out of the Coalition nanyu still technically has the numbers but he doesn't have the public uh legitimacy and that might be the the first brick uh in the domino effect of of mass uh um protests in Israel that might actually shake up nany's uh political stability for the first time in real uh in real circumstances possible for him uh first time since October that's worth asking the obvious question where does this leave the war cabinet where does this leave the government right now it's a very good question there's no doubt that when it comes to uh handling the war and making decisions you think of the families of the hostages they look at this and they're completely in despair because they don't feel like anybody has their interest in his you know top of his agenda and of course that's not a good position for Israel to be and I'm sure it's very satisfying for Hamas to see this we will see Jack Sullivan the American national security um adviser coming to Israel tomorrow from uh Riad from Saudi Arabia still trying to make maybe uh something out of this mess and and try to get Israel to move into some sort of a uh strategic U you know Horizon uh it's a task that the Americans have been trying to get n to agree on for couple of months already maybe now with this public um you know uh outing of uh Minister Gans something will change up in Israel the leadership really interesting moment our Middle East analyst Shan ranes thanks so much you're welcome we can now speak with Ahmed bam with the Norwegian Refugee Council that's an NGO carrying out humanitarian work in gasa he joins us from Aman good to have you with us so Ahmed as we just saw in that report there are different visions of a future for Gaza that are now causing deep Rifts inside the Israeli government how if at all do you think this could change the situation on the ground uh I mean judging by what is happening not very much it seems that Israel is pressing ahead with its uh ground operations there are you know obviously reports of of troops massing around that area uh at the same time like you've just reported there's uh of course intense escalation in in the Northern parts so our team's on the ground the Norwegian Refugee Council has been pushed all the way to the west of rafah and that's a bad sign a sign that you know things are getting worse and worse over you know the hours not really days or weeks and particularly with the numbers now 700,000 people we are hearing have been displaced over the last 10 days so things don't look anything but Grim on the ground and people you know have been left you know to battle really battle for their survival but uh hearing that uh a heavyweight in the cabinet Benny guns giving uh Benjamin Netanyahu and his government basically an ultimatum to come up with a solution for a postwar Gaza do you think this could weaken or strengthen Israel in this current situation also fight both in the North and the South of Gaza I mean of course I mean we've been we've been hearing you know without getting into too much Politics as a as a representative of a humanitarian organization we see things from a humanitarian point of view and and I can tell you that the politics that has been played out in recent weeks and months I mean of course their disagreement within the Israeli cabinet at the same time the the dis agreement with Israel's allies really led by the United States have continued while the the operations on the ground have not stopped so there is kind of you know um there's a kind of di diplomacy that is being played in the in the background and at the same time there Agreements are being played in the in in the background we don't see much impact of that on on the ground as in you know the impact that we want to see the positive change that we want to see which is uh you know a ceasefire if anything what is happening in the political corridors is only you know negatively reflecting on the situation on the ground which means that probably we are never you know uh close to a ceasefire agreement with you know given these you know disagreements in on the Israeli side so we hope that you know anything that you know uh when it comes to politics and when it comes to uh Israel's relationships with the us we hope that pressure comes from from these countries from Israel's allies which we look for you know uh for a change a a political solution is uh definitely needed meanwhile some 800,000 people have left rougher over the last two weeks and many of them have been displaced before just briefly where are they going in every direction really it's it's it's a race to the West as it stands closer to the beach area which is not made for a human life really uh closer to hunas where you know there's so much destruction and our teams have reported ex you know the increase in prices in things like tents and water and rent so people are are fleeing in that direction and you know with with the intensification of the ground operation things are getting worse and worse all right Ahmed saam from the Norwegian Refugee Council joining us from Aman Ahmed thank you so much
