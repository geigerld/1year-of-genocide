now Israel is home to a mixed population which includes about 20% ethnic Arabs many of whom identify as Palestinians and they often face discrimination with tensions in the region once again flaring one group of activists in Israel is trying to promote solidarity across ethnic lines DW's AI Ibrahim reports from hia a site to behold this room contains right now Palestinians and Jews who actually in the darkest most polarizing most difficult moment in the history of the two peoples right now is choosing to like actually work together they want to send a message they feel cannot be repeated enough we cannot survive if we will be against each other we cannot survive if if someone will try to you know um Kick the other out in this country millions of Palestinians will remain here and millions of Jewish people will remain here and that's a fact this meeting at AOS and hia is organized by standing together a Grassroots peace movement made up of Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel activists tell me such togetherness has been rare since the October 7th Hamas attacks and that often demonstrations of solidarity in either direction are met with rejection we have friends we have neighbors we have peers we have colleagues who are Jewish who got deeply impacted by this and and we we were devastated um but by that act uh but even that was not something that was fully accepted by a lot of the Jewish public oh you're hurting for us now but so you can't say you can't identify as Palestinian and also in Gaza there are children um which is something very controversial right now to say in Israel we do suffer from um calls for violence from being called being a traitor from inment against us Jewish people that are working towards peace that are working to build solidarity um among Jews and Palestinians the fact that we are even unable to fully experience and grief our people um is is like the it's like the the epitome of our psychosis and our like experience as Palestinians and Israel like I'm literally unable to fully grief my people while also like like you're like on a mission to convince people you're human like people here believe deepening divisions in Israeli Society make it all the more important to meet and to show empathy with one another so they put that empathy quite literally center stage in defiance of local right-wing groups which tried to get the event cancelled it's happening under tight security it's more than just talk though volunteers visit places where Muslims and Jews work together like this hospital near haa they handed out thank you cards to staff written in Arabic and Hebrew Tamara assadi is a Palestinian Israeli teacher who works at a predominantly Jewish school it is important for me to be a role model for my students for my country and everyone around me I choose to be here because I'm convinced that we have to improve our relationship we have to protect it we have to look at each other as human beings the visit is happening one month after the October 7th terror attack and uh it's very difficult day for all of us but it's so important to Mark to remark the fact that we are together in the staff here and many other places we are doing very very naturally together togetherness naturally togetherness they've also set up a hotline offering legal support for Palestinian Israelis who've lost jobs or suffered discrimination since October 7th standing together members have even taken the name literally and formed human chains around businesses to protect them from from hate attacks what about Jewish people like yourself back at the assembly I ask Alan Lee green if he feels their movement speaks for the majority in Israeli Society no but do all the society the majority of society have the interest of the direction we want to go I think the answer is yes so that means our job uh the mission the responsibility we took Upon Our shoulders is to organize this majority into uh a political majority and it's going to be a very long way they know there's more work to do after the speeches attendees break up into small groups they brainstorm more practical ways they might spread their message and to convince more of their fellow Israelis to see each other the way they do let's speak to a Ibrahim who followed that report uh joining me now from Jerusalem Aya at the end of your report there we saw Jewish and Palestinian Israelis brainstorming together to find to find ways to stand together and spread their message what did they come up with well what they've established is what they call the Jewish uh Arab solidarity guards so for example there was they told me about a homeless place in hia you know a long standing establishment has been there for about 40 years it's Palestinian owned and on the door of that establishment there was a verse there's a verse in the Quran had always been there uh Palestinians and Jews visit that uh restaurant uh often after the October 7th attacks uh some right-wing groups claimed that that verse of the Quran was somehow um you know sympathizing with Hamas or inciting attacks against Jewish people and that establishment came under uh attack and so what the group did is put together a a human chain around that restaurant to protect the owner and what when they do these uh these human chain uh acts these these this guard which is an unarmed guard they're just standing there to protect uh a uh you know establishments that have long been part of their mixed communities they always do this together these groups are always a mix between Jewish Israeli activists and Arab or Palestinian activists depending on how they identify themselves now we saw in your report that this group's meeting took place under tight security can you tell us more about what kind of challenges uh Palestinian Israelis are facing in the current climate right I mean let's just take a step back and you know who are these Palestinian Israelis that we're talking about this is the largest ethnic minority in uh Israel these are full Israeli citizens they can vote they can run for office uh they're just like their Jewish uh uh counterparts in many ways except they do sometimes face discrimination within uh uh Society so they are Israeli citizens but at the same time they are part of the larger Palestinian Nation if you will so they may have relatives or friends with Palestinians in the diaspora but they also may have friends or family in Gaza or in the West Bank and so when you have a situation like this like the horrible attack of October 7th and the war that then uh ensued in Gaza they're in between these two identities if you will they're part of Israeli Society so they have friends that are Jewish they have friends that have been atted by the terror attacks and they also have friends people that they can relate to in Palestinian uh territories and so they're often looked at at least that's what the activists that I've spoken to tell me with a sort of suspicion that they don't have their loyalties in uh with Israel but they do as far as I could tell and as far as what the people that I've spoken to uh tell me and so often times if they express solidarity with civilians in Gaza not Hamas civilians in Gaza they are accused of supporting a terror organization which they say of course uh they do not and there have been some cases in Israeli Society unfortunately since the October 7th attack where students are subject to disciplinary hearings and uh people are you know fired from their jobs or having difficulty at work for sympathizing with the Palestinian uh side of their identity publicly on social media and that's created a lot of fear among Israel's Palestinian um Arab uh Community I mean we had quite a bit of difficulty getting Palestinian Israeli voices on camera but luckily we did have a few as you saw that report and something that they told me activists both Jewish and Palestinian is that they wish that the media would look more about what life is actually like between these two communities within Israel that there's a specific very um you know one-sided idea in the media about what's going on in this country and of course there's war there's suffering but there's also a coexistence between these two uh uh groups that has been going on for generation and that they they felt that that was also worth uh highlighting and that's part that's at least what we tried to show in that report there are a lot of difficulties of course a lot of challenges discrimination it's a conflict Zone but the reality on the ground every day is a little bit more gray than that I would say well thank you very much for your reporting that's DW's a Ibrahim in
