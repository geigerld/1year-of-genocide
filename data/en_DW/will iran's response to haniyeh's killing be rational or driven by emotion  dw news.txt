now Iran says that Israel will pay for the assassination of hamas's top political leader isma hania he was killed in an air strike in tyan thousands gathered in the Iranian capital for a funeral honoring the leader of the Palestinian party in militant group Hamas hania was also the chief negotiator in talks aimed at reaching a ceasefire with Israel Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah hman spoke at the ceremony Iran holds Israel responsible for the killing and said they will make Israel regret the move well Israel says it can now confirm that it killed hamas's military leader mohmad Muhammad di in an air strike in Gaza last month the Israeli military says dive was killed on the 13th of July in a strike on the outskirts of hunis Dave uh di is considered one of the planners of the October attacks against Israel last year Israel's military had been hunting the extremely secretive 57-year-old for decades DW's Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem told us more well Muhammad Dave was the head of the military Wing the alasan brigades in Gaza he uh has was heading up that uh the alasan brigades for some decades couple of decades and with with the organization ation for around about 30 years he's long been on Israel's Wanted list and in fact in May kareim Khan the chief prosecutor for the international criminal court put him on a list of Hamas leaders that uh he was applying to have arrest warrants handed out to isma Khan being another person who was on that list as well as Yahya sinoa the leader of Hamas in Gaza uh as I said he was long on The Wanted list of Israel and Israel made several attempts at his life uh he was unsuccessful he remained elusive until uh as we're now learning on July 13th when he was targeted alongside another senior Hamas figure Rafa salame leader of Hamas forces in Han unun uh now it was confirmed on the day that salame had been killed but they the Israeli military weren't 100% certain uh that Dave also was killed in that air strike they they thought that it was Pro possible probable but that they didn't have the intelligence they are now saying they do have the intelligence to confirm that he was taken out in that air strike but it should be said that uh some 90 other people in Gaza were also uh killed in that strike because it was in an area in hanun near uh you know this area where people had gone uh to shelter um so Hamas has denied or before find before today they certainly were denying that Dave was killed in that attack but we haven't heard from them uh in the aftermath of this this latest development assuming Dave is dead how big of a blow would this be to hamas's capabilities in Gaza oh it's certainly a very big symbolic and strategic blow to Hamas Dave was a a very key figure and he certainly played an important role on the ground uh in Gaza he you know was was certainly thought to have coordinated many attacks against Israelis and was seen as a mastermind behind the October 7 attacks he was very close with the Hamas leader Yaya Sina in Gaza and he was you know had this almost heroic status as I said he was a very elusive figure there were only three known photographs of the man and so you know he had a kind of a a Godlike uh symbolism around him and so it will be a very strategic and symbolic loss for Hamas he had built up a lot of expertise over the years he was instrumental in uh building the the underground tunnel Network and of course also the the bomb making program that Hamas have you know the their capabilities when it comes to to making bombs so he certainly is going to be uh a big loss to uh the network but you know these figures are not Irreplaceable and we've seen that in the past that that key figures uh have been able to be replaced and Hamas is as many say an ideology and this armed struggle will not be over just because uh muhamad Dave has been killed so a blow to hamas's capabilities nonetheless uh how was all this playing out then for Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu well these assassinations are certainly being seen in Israel and they're certainly being sold by Benjamin Netanyahu and the government as winds uh you we we heard Benjamin Netanyahu speak about it in his address to the nation yesterday saying these military gains uh you know would not have been possible if he had bowed to public pressure uh and taken a hostage deal or taken some kind of ceasefire Arrangement that he was sticking to his plan that he's been saying all along only the war will end when total Victory uh is made when he's able to to completely dismantle Hamas as an organization and and as an organization that can have any military strength against Israel that is something that they will you know certainly trying to sell that the assassination of these key leaders although we have to remember that they haven't claimed responsibility for the assassination of the political leader isma hania though it is widely regarded that that that was also uh at the hands of Israel they definitely being sold as a wi but we'll just have to see what the next steps are the retaliation from Iran and its proxies just where Benjamin Netanyahu will be standing in the weeks to come Rebecca thanks for that update our correspondent Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem well the motivation for killing ishma hania the Hamas leader may stem from the group's October 7th Terror attacks and in Israel but the animosity towards hania stretches back much further as we see in this report Ismael hania greets Iran's new president in what would be one of his last meetings just hours after attending the president's inauguration he and his bodyguard were killed in a strike on his residents in tan hania was the political face of Hamas the militant islamist group that carried out the October 7th Terror attacks on Israel Han had not lived in Gaza for several years but ran Hamas from qat where he lived in Exile he became the Palestinian prime minister in 2006 and continued to rise through hamas's ranks eventually becoming its political Chief in 2017 hamas's Gaza leader Yahya sinoa is believed to have been The Mastermind of the October 7th attacks while hania represented Hamas internationally and moved around the region for diplomatic meetings he was a key player in negotiations to stop the fighting in Gaza some fear his killing will be a major setback to achieving peace in the region hania's death came just hours after Israel said it killed senior Hezbollah commander fuad shukur in Beirut the attack also killed at least one woman and two children and wounded dozens Israel says it targeted shukur in retaliation for a rocket attack on a soccer field in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children and teenagers Israel blamed Hezbollah and warned the militant group it would pay a heavy price shukur had been one of hezbollah's leading military figure since it was established by Iran's revolutionary guard more than four decades ago after the Israel Hamas war broke out on October 7th shukur was accused by Israel of being behind many of the Drone and missile attacks that Hezbollah launched against Israel shukur is the most senior Hezbollah Commander to be killed since 2016 when Mustafa badredine the group's military commander in Syria died in an explosion in Damascus global leaders fear the deaths of two senior leaders of Israel's greatest enemies when tensions were already at Boiling Point could now prompt an allout Regional War let's bring in Abby melad here he's a geopolitical intelligence analyst and adviser on Arab Affairs to the former prime minister ahud welcome to the program ABI given the assassination of the Hamas leader in tyan How concerned should Israelis be about retaliation from Iran thank you for having me yes we should be very concerned it's very likely there is going to be a retaliation um Iran has different tools and means to carry out such retaliation so it will be very reasonable to expect it I want to ask you about Hezbollah in a moment I know you've been very has been studying them a lot but first let me ask you as a Former Intelligence officer what your thoughts are on why isma Hana might have been targeted in tyan well there are a couple of reasons first Han was the head of Hamas political Bureau he was though he was portrayed in Western media as a kind of like more of the moderate guy he was not a moderate at all he was a bitter Enemy of the State of Israel he was also in charge of the among other things among other people the planning of the October 7 massacre in Israel Israel has a policy roughly speaking going back almost 50 years ago following the uh the massacre of Israel is Sport some athletes in Munich in Germany uh that Israel basically has a policy that says such people that are involved in such thing of killing Israel is are basically becoming a legitimate Target for eliminations as for itself elimination of people individual is not for itself a strategic objective and most of the times it doesn't really serve strategically sometimes it has more of symbolical um meaning operational tactic meaning not beyond that but sometimes when you take out figures like for example Han it goes beyond beyond that level now let's talk about Hezbollah in neighboring Lebanon you know the group well what are you hearing about hezbollah's likely military reaction to the killing of its military leader earlier well I would say that the hisbah on the one hand of course are very incentivized and motivated to retaliate and probably will they do have however some sort of a dilemma The Dilemma is how to retaliate in a way that on the one hand will convey a message that actually uh rehabilitate their uh smashed or damaged DET turn's capacities or image following these two assassinations that happen in a gap of couple of hours how to do it in a way that will restore that on the one hand but on the other hand with not ins would not spark a a dynamic that could result in an whole out War because the basic assessment or evaluation is that neither of the sides in the end of the day has real interest in such a whole out War but one once you are igniting such a process you don't really have the ability to fully control that and therefore there is a risk that it will result in a dynamic that leading in the end of the day to something you don't want to be to start with so this is the Dilemma of Iran and hisbah and they will right now there is no doubt that they are basically Consulting for a this way what will be the right way for hisbah to retaliate I will emphasize that in the end of the day the final decision about the the features the um the characteristic of such a retaliation will be decided in Iran uh taking into consideration different possible ramifications of that well everyone of course is wondering what will happen next uh retaliation is seems to be factored into most people's calculations but Hezbollah is in Lebanon right next door to Israel in the north across the border is a military response from them more concerning to Israel than retaliation by Iran which is over 1,000 kmers away in any case the retaliation is very concerning we have to remember we are looking at Iran and its proxies the Hezbollah the yois the Iraqi Shiite militias they all massively armed by the best of the weapons the Iranians can offer them and they offer them which includes missiles and cruise missiles and attacking drones we are familiar with all those things and those things are causing a significant damage we just remember the Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia a couple of years ago that basically um smashed to some period of time a part of the Iranian oil industry so they can cause Israel a very very significant damage regardless in the end of the day of the distance obviously as you mentioned accurately hisbah is closer to Israel we are talking about shorter range and and other aspects but in the end of the day the damage could be caused by attacking Israel's strategic infrastructure ports and and other National infrastructure that damage could be enormously significant so from every possible perspective there is a good reason for Israel to be concerned and to be prepared so given all that what can you tell us about the factors that are influencing decisions involving Israel's military at this point well I think that the over Maring guiding line has to do with the with a perspective that I would say is more geostrategic regionally speaking look we are looking at something that has been brewing for many years and what we see today or for a long period of time is actually part of a long-term sophisticated Iranian master plan to eliminate the state of Israel in not through the use of nonconventional weapon but through the use of conventional weapon and to that extent the Iranian regime has a very very effective tool in its service and these are the different militias across the Middle East that the Iranian regime funds and arms and provide the military know how and so on hisbah and Hamas and Islamic J Shi Iraqi militias the htis and so on and so on and this whole master plan of the Mula regime in the end of the day is supposed to be simultaneously activated from different Arenas to basically eliminate Israel in a massive um military Blow from all directions up up until that moment as part of the Iranian regime a major component of this program is to exhaust Israel through a long-term process and this is exactly what was Hamas and Islamic Jihad role for the last couple of decades Israel has been dealing with Hamas and Islamic Jihad for the last 40 years and this is part of this long-term Iranian master plan so what we saw is an ongoing clearly process of exhausting Israel through this mil rounds carried out by the Iranian proxies targeting deliberately knowingly and intentionally Israel soft belly which are the civilians and the whole purpose of that is basically to bring Israel down to its knees to the point where the massive final blow would basically eliminate Israel right now what we see in this region is the reshuffle of the game cards Israel basically sends the message in the last couple of hours the 24 hours Israel sent a message that says we are now changing the ground rules and and we now decide what's going to be the pace and the trajectory basically Israel says like we are not willing any longer to take this story of exhaustion now it's time for decision and one of the potential possible outcome of that very dramatic shift I would say is the possibility that indeed the region will find itself in an allout ER War as an outcome of that of that shift but this is something that didn't happen because of the last 24 hours in the end of the day we are looking at a long-term process the aggression of the Iranian regime was for too long ignored H by the Western policy makers they basically were kicking this can down the road but in the end of the day it was inevitable because if you don't deal with a bully when he's little you going to deal with the bully when he's big and stronger and this is exactly what we see today and this is exactly when we hear today about a major concern globally about the possibility of a whole out war in the region which is very possible AI thank you very much for your insights that was AI melad geopolitical intelligence analyst with these Hamas leader assassinated in tan emotions in Iran and elsewhere are running high in the region so will emotions dictate what happens next or will cooler heads prevail I put that question to Middle East analyst gido steinber from the German Institute for international and security Affairs no I do expect that emotions in tan and in bayroot will have an influence on on decision making especially the fact that hania was killed in the heart of the Iranian Capital um on the occasion of the swearing in of President pesan will probably Force um the Iranian leadership um to take some counter measures possibly together with Hezbollah in Lebanon well Israel does now have a new more moderate president he was just sworn in on Tuesday does that matter in this situation does he does he have a say in what happens next no the the president sits on the National Security Council in tan but he doesn't have major influence uh the people who will decide was what is happening next are uh first and foremost the supreme leader Ali and his most senior military and intelligence advisers pesan is probably a voice that is heard uh in among these people but he's only among minor voice so we should expect uh the the military uh includ including Armen who was very uh close to the military in in Iran um to take the decision how do you see this playing out G what are you expecting in the coming days and weeks well I do expect uh some military attacks military terrorist attacks on the part of Iran and or hisbah on on Israel um many observers now talk about a direct Iranian attack on Israel with cruise missiles ballistic missiles and drones just like the one that we have seen uh on the 13th of April I'm not that convinced that Iran will choose this option simply uh because uh the last the last action was not not a major success I'm uh more worried about attacks Again by cruise missiles drones and ballistic missiles from Lebanon if if his baa now decides to escalate its attack attacks perhaps start an attack on Military targets a little bit further down south close to hia for example uh then we might see a major Israeli counter reaction and the beginning of a war I think we should expect more to come in the next weeks
