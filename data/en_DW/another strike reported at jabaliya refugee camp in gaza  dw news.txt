Israeli air strikes have hit gaza's biggest refugee camp uh for the second day in a row according to the territory's Hamas run government this news agency footage shows the aftermath of a new strike Israel has not said whether it did carry out this attack but has admitted to bombing the camp a day earlier claiming that a senior Hamas Commander was targeted and killed Palestinian officials say 50 people were killed and more than a 100 wounded in that strike Peter Lerner speaks for the Israel Defense Forces I asked him about this latest strike on the jabalia refugee camp did Israel strike the jabalia refugee camp again today we are striking Hamas wherever they hiding Hamas have effectively turned jabalia into a fortified position and we conducted strikes against it yesterday in two different locations and indeed there is a possibility that we are continuing to strike against Hamas wherever there hiding you've confirmed yesterday's attack but you won't say that you uh that Israel um carried out today's attack why is that Phil we have to be certain what types of activities we are conducting we've already seen um at least one instance where Palestinian Islamic Jihad launched a rocket and it hit uh the hospital Al hospital um uh parking lot uh in this this case I would rather be than sorry and so we have to be confirmed once we can confirm what what was struck and indeed if the target was indeed hit then we'll make an announcement as we did yesterday so just to be clear um at this stage you don't know whether Israel struck the jabalia refugee camp again at at this time I can't confirm that but but there is a distinct possibility that it was us rather than jumping to conclusions I suggest we have a bit more patience it's Peter larner from the Israel Defense Forces well some foreign passport holders have now been allowed to leave Gaza a first group of critically injured Garin has already arrived on the Egyptian side of the Rafa border crossing it's unclear how long the crossing will remain open people in Gaza have waited for weeks for this gate to open towards Egypt and now it has within an hour these ambulances were rushing through according to the UN thousands of civilians have been injured in Gaza since Israel began its war on terror group Hamas many of them critically wounded are in urgent need of Medical Care Egyptian authorities say 81 gazin were allowed to go across based on a deal struck between Egypt Israel and Hamas and mediated by Qatar on on the other side Egypt has set up a field hospital to treat injured Palestinians and thousands of doctors have registered to help at the same time Volunteers in Egypt are trying to get more Aid into Gaza today 60 trucks have passed yesterday another 60 the priority is for medicine to pass we've seen children undergoing surgeries without anesthesia these border crossings take time as vehicles and documents are checked to ensure safety that adds to people's anxiety to get across for no one knows how long the Rua Crossing will remain open for those standing in Gaza it's the only way out of War well our correspondent Rebecca rits is in the Israeli uh town of stero near the Garen border I asked her about efforts to evacuate the injured and foreign Nationals across the ruer cross uh they are going well we hear but they are slow at the same time it's a complicated process but it for the first time uh since this War Began we've we're starting to see uh evacuees be able to cross that border we know that at least some ambulances have crossed already carrying what is expected to be a total of 88 sick and injured people across the border this morning there was also a List released of some 4 to 500 foreign Nationals or Jewel passport holders and some Palestinians who worked for foreign NOS now they are also supposed to be crossing over today and we've heard reports that some of them have and it is expected that hopefully all of those 4 to 500 people will be able to cross over today we know that there is a a bigger list of around about 7,000 Jewel Nationals or other people who work for NOS that are on various lists and we've been hearing for from sources within the British government that they expect around 500 to 1,000 to be able to be let out potentially uh each day in a kind of slow tranch system we have to see how that will progress and exactly when we've heard that um German the German uh Embassy has also uh instructed its uh Jewel Nationals to start heading to the Border they weren't initially on that list that was released this morning nor were us or UK Nationals um other countries were Australia Norway Japan and as I said some people who work for NOS so we'll have to see who and how and when the next list will be published and when those people will be able to cross over but it's very positive sign we're that we're certainly that we're seeing the sick and injured be able to cross to better medical tension across the border okay thanks for that uh let's talk about this second attack on the jabalia refugee camp um what are you hearing about that at this stage information still trickling out it's incredibly hard to report on what's Happening inside Gaza as you can imagine this is about as close as we can get we're a couple of kilometers away from the border we've been here since the beginning we've been here multiple times coming back and forth to this area because this is about as close as we can get we from here we can see some of the air strikes happening in the northern part of the Gaza Strip in the area known as B hanon um and we can of course hear a lot of the artillery fire and uh and other um Warfare that happening there and even some uh gunfire happening so to say that there is some close combat fights going on on the ground on the other side of the border now in terms of the jabalia camp we know that it was struck we've seen the pictures you saw them in that report the huge crater that was created U more than 50 people reportedly killed in that strike and we do believe that it has been struck today I spoke to somebody in Gaza who confirmed that though we have no number no numbers and fatalities but we do know that the jbala camp is at one of the targets that the ID F uh the Israeli military I should say are targeting they believe that it's being used as a Hamas Command Center and HQ and that there's a huge network of tunnels underneath which is another source of their target okay thank you for that Rebecca Rebecca aritus and uh in Israel well we can speak to a journalist aen baloa who's in Gaza and joins us on the line welcome back hajm and what are you hearing about this latest strike on the jabalia refugee camp we have information according to the civil defense and Ministry of Health that that the Israeli uh strike took place um today afternoon and that caused damage of a huge place in overpopulated and refugee camp it's the biggest refugee camp in Gaza St uh at least 50 people were killed and hundreds were injured um um according to the civil defense they are not able to evacuate all um the the people under the rubble because they have very limited equipment and there are many calls of of strikes and and and damages across the G threat so they are doing whatever they can and whatever they evacuate in in help and uh with other local who living area trying to get out um whether the the injured or the killed people you describe this as an Israeli strike Israel haven't confirmed that this was them yet um clearly it sounds like there's no doubt in Gaza that it was well I mean I don't know yeah I I don't know if it was confir I mean yesterday Israel there was another strike a big one 200 people at least were killed and two other 200 others were were were injured last night and or and Israel confirmed it I don't know if Israel confirm this one or not I I haven't seen this but uh if from the damage that happened and and the similar in in different places um it it could tell at least the ban say it's Israel right um some people have been allowed out of Gaza today but Aid into the territory has been sporadic what is the latest there well according to the latest number that 72 uh paans wanted Palestinians with their escorts left um from the Palestinian side to the Egyptian side through ambulances they are um um um people out of alist where was sent to the Egyptian side which is which is checked with the Israeli authorities as well um 81 were were were approved but 72 left because the rest according to the minist of Health um already died or had surgeries in Gaza hospitals um along with that um up to the latest number 355 um dual Nationals or Palestinians were working with some International NOS um left um according to the list we are talking about 450 something that they are uh plan to leave uh today all right thanks for that haam haam belala in Gaza thank you now journalist Hugh miles is covering events from Cairo he uh he was uh here on DW and asked whether it's likely that more foreign and dual Nationals would be allowed to leave well uh nobody knows how many uh passport dual national passport holders there are in Gaza but there are certainly many many uh countries uh who have got um their their dual National citizens in in Gaza and they they've been trying since the start of the war to get them out uh and um Anthony blinken the US Secretary of State has has said that this is a top priority for him and he's working on it every day and now we understand that there's going to be a limited number maybe 500 are going to be um allowed out so this would be a um a big step forward and and um uh Egypt has been um involved in this process as well together with the UN two miles in at
