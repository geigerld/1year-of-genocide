military analyst Michael Clark from King's College London welcome back to DW uh let's start in Al maazi where Israel's Army tried to kill a Hamas top Commander but ended up causing dozens of Civilian casualties instead how do things like that happen with an army that is so well equipped because it's not the army that is doing it it's the Israeli Air Force and the it can happen because it's what the Israelis intend if they are going after people like Muhammad di they they thought that he was that they had him that they knew exactly where he was and they still think that they probably got him but they can't confirm it and if you look at the way the Israelis approach these operations when it comes to the top commanders like Muhammad de like Issa who you mentioned in the in the report like Yaya Sina who is the the the man above di when it comes to people like that they will take they will accept any number any number of Palestinian casualties if they can get those particular top commanders so they sent five missiles onto the area where they thought they had good information that DF was maybe they got in maybe they didn't but from their point of view when they go for a really top Commander the number of of Civilian casualties is simply irrelevant when they go for people who are not top commanders they do consider how many deaths are regarded as reasonable and you and I would still say that's a very high number but the the number that they consider reasonable is unlimited going after somebody like di right Israel has said repeatedly that its endgame is to eradicate Hamas and that it won't end the war until it's achieve that aim yeah is that possible to eliminate Hamas completely no and they in fact they they don't now say they're trying to eliminate Hamas you look carefully at what Netanyahu said began by saying we have to eliminate Hamas full stop take them off the map Al together then he said we have to eliminate Hamas um as an organization which is not quite the same as eliminating Hamas and then he said now he says we must eliminate Hamas as a military threat to Israel that's a bit different again so the Israelis are already three steps down from the place they started at and they're not going to achieve even that because although they talk about the number of Hamas terrorists they've killed they they thought were 25,000 there at the beginning of this operation they think that they have killed at least 15,000 but nobody can give you a figure as to how many more terrorists they have created for every 22y old Hamas terrorist they kill you can guarantee there's a 15y old brother and three or four 12y old cousins who have have sworn Vengeance against Israel for the rest of their lives so the idea that the israelies can eliminate Hamas as a military organization um is plausible but they can't eliminate it as a military threat as long as they are creating at least as many terrorists as they kill that's the problem they've got and at the moment they only have about two brigades in the hold of the Gaza Strip they've withdrawn most of their troops they hold Rafer they hold the Philadelphia Corridor at the South that runs along the southern border with Egypt and they hold the netsim corridor um in the the North and the shua Camp that's the so there's only three areas and the area of Rafa that they actually control the rest of the place is now open for Hamas to come back which is what they're doing and and a brief word about those moderated aims that you you talked us through is that a reflection of the difficulty of this war or is that just what they should have been saying right at the start and they they started off having high flown aims because that's what you do at the start of a war yes I mean the the Netanyahu government didn't think through with any credibility or Clarity what they were really trying to achieve and they gave the IDF the Israeli Defense Forces a quite impossible job to do and they wouldn't specify what they were supposed to to do as in when they cleared Hamas people out of the North and then the center and then Gaza City then Kan yunas and so the IDF have been making this up as they go along it's a it's a a strategic failure from start to finish and it leaves the IDF basically Chas faing its tail inside Gaza while the situation doesn't get doesn't get worse but it doesn't get any better for Israel but it gets considerably worse for the people of that's very clear thank you for talking us through that military analyst from Kings college at London Michael Clark
