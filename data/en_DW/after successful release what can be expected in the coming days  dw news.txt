the first group of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip have now been freed the International Red Cross confirmed Hamas released 24 hostages among them are Israelis who have been freed in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners this swap is part of a deal broker by Kat also among the freed captives are a group of Thai Nationals but their release is separate from the deal between Israel and Hamas and for the very latest Let's cross to our correspondent tanyao who's following the story for us from the hsim air base that base in southern Israel is where hostages are being received after their release from captivity now uh Tanya isra the Israeli Army says the hostages are in Israel what's the situation where you are are they there well the Israel military said that they received the hostages that they were under undergoing a First Medical check and that they were on their way depending on their condition some of them might be taken directly to hospitals uh but it was the plan at least to bring them here to the hatar air base where a whole team a medical team psychologists as well uh is planning to uh receive them where they go further medical checks uh you know they've been now uh held captive for over seven uh weeks uh in you know during a war as well uh many of them you know they might not know the full extent of what happened on October 7 also you know what happened to their their relatives uh others might have seen uh one of their relatives killed uh during the terror attacks on October 7 now uh also um this evening now the the names and also some first pictures have been released now of those hostages in the bus we know it's children it's elderly women and the the mothers uh of the the children the names have been released now and I think there's a s of relief among many here in Israel that they're now in Israel you know people know now uh who they are and we also heard uh from prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu saying you know that he's basically um saying we've completed now the first stage um of this uh uh of those hostages uh coming back home and he also said that you know the country is uh you know in a state of mixed em tions from Joy pain sadness and determination because there are so many others that need to be brought back and of course we know that a part of this agreement is that in the next days we will see similar um uh scenarios as we've seen today if all goes well of course everything is very fragile it's a volatile situation everything could change but that in the coming four days at least more of the hostages should be released uh uh up to 50 hostages that's part of the agreement potentially uh more in exchange for uh uh the Palestinian prisoners that are exchange and also more humanitarian Aid uh are coming into uh the Gaza Strip uh now in exchange Palestinian prisoners uh were reportedly also released what do you know about that yeah we just got confirmation uh that those 39 uh Palestinian uh prisoners uh were released now uh this is you know coming after the release of the first Israeli hostages and also the international hostages that were released um so they have been released to the occupied West Bank and also to East Jerusalem some of them uh were you know also from East Jerusalem so uh families and relatives had been waiting for them as well and so these were 39 of those uh of about 50 that are expected to be released also uh in the coming days which uh this is also part of this uh agreement uh that had been broken by Qatar uh with the help of Egypt the US between Hamas and Israel now we're seeing uh live pictures here from the West Bank where people have gathered uh to greet the uh Palestinian prisoners that have been released by Israel uh Thai Nationals Tanya were also released East today what more can you tell us about that yeah this has been a deal that had been brokered aside from uh this uh other uh agreement um and we understand that from Kat confirmed that 10 uh Thai citizens were released and one citizen uh from the Philippines now they were also taken captive uh during the terror attacks on October 7 uh many uh uh of uh the Thai citizens are working in Israel they work in agriculture uh some work in you know in elderly care and there were also in these uh um kibuts in the kibuts or in the localities in the South when this terror attack happened uh and uh some of them were also killed some were taken captive and some remain as well in Gaza as well as many of the other hostages the 200 over 230 hostages uh uh that are still in Gaza being held and that I still also need to be brought back home now T how is the truce holding up well so far um as I said it's a very volatile situation it's uh a very fragile uh truth but so far it has been holding up there have been no uh violations of course this can change at any minute but for the moment it seems that both sides are committed uh to keep this truce moving and uh you know to go ahead uh with uh uh the agreement as it was you as we've heard in the occupied West Bank a group of 39 Palestinian inmates are being freed as part of that temporary truce large crowds gathered near the Israeli offer prison to greet them those released include only women and miners the Red Cross representatives were at the scene to collect the group Israeli forces fired teargas at the crowd in an attempt to push them back from the prison and with me in the studio is now rw's Melinda crane Melinda uh can we conclude at this stage that this release of the hostages and this truce um is a success so far so good it's still early days as Tanya mentioned uh this is uh a complex agreement with a lot of different moving Parts but day one appears to have gone according to plan there was some exchange of fire or at least one way fire shortly after 7 when the ceasefire began this morning but in fact after that things did calm down ceasefire appears to be holding Aid appears to be entering the Gaza Strip badly badly needed Aid uh as you know used to be that hundreds of trucks would enter every day uh in the last six weeks that hasn't been the case but today if all did go as planned there should have been uh some uh up to 200 trucks including food and cooking fuel fuel and cooking oil both badly needed both have been in short supply because author were concerned uh the Israeli authorities concerned that uh fuel could fall into the hands of Hamas and then of course the prisoner exchange and hostage exchange going according to plan so three more days to go but so far so good now let's talk about Benjamin Netanyahu his popularity rums are at Rock Bottom uh Israelis are very angry with him can the deal and the release of hostages today can that sort of help his career help keep him afloat possibly it will stabilize uh some of his support um I don't think it will bring back a lot of those who are angry at him there are a number uh of Israelis who believe that it was because of his uh political Focus namely on getting agreements with neighboring Arab countries but essentially sidelining the whole Palestinian issue that it's because of that that uh the situation in Gaza became so untenable and resulted in the attacks of October 7th so those who take that Viewpoint I think won't be convinced by the fact that finally uh some hostages have been released in fact Netanyahu dragged his feet for quite a while on the release uh and he is certainly dragging his feet on any form or idea of a political two-state solution uh of allowing the palestin Authority for example to uh take over in Gaza um essentially no words so far on what's going to happen when the military operation ends so those who are critical of him I think it won't win them back it may stabilize some support for some time among others but many many observers believe that his days are numbered and that with the military operation comes to an end uh his Reign may also come to an end now uh there's a large International Dimension to this whole uh conflict uh today the Prime Minister of Belgium and Spain held a press conference at Egypt's baak Crossing what do you make of this very problematic the timing the location they were on a two-day trip they apparently uh on the first day spoke uh directly to uh members of the Israeli government and then they uh culminated their trip here in on this day at the Rafa Crossing which is uh surprising uh Choice uh of of location and the words used by the Spanish prime minister were quite incendiary certainly from Israel's point of view he said Israel has not complied with international law that it needs to do so that there needs to be a human humanitarian ceasefire without time limit and uh essentially said that if if um the world Community doesn't go ahead recogn izing uh Palestine as a state that Spain uh or that if the EU does not do so that Spain would go ahead on its own so uh quite uh strong words from him and not surprising that the Israeli government is now asked the Spanish uh uh ambassador to pay a visit that's so they were summoned yeah uh so that's exactly pretty strong diplomatically speaking not yes um so what happens on day five I mean this truce is supposed to last four days what happens on day five and your mention of international concern and pressure is very pertinent to that because there will be a lot of pressure on day five to extend the ceasefire and Hamas May well play the card that is open to it under the agreement to release 10 more hostages and buy one more day and then 10 more and buy another day it would like to keep these ponds for a while these hostages but it may try to walk a tight rope there in order to gain leverage regroup uh reposition hostages even possibly over the term of the ceasefire um and that will only see pressure increase internationally and uh certainly it's not only Benjamin netanyahu's who's under pressure Joe Biden is under pressure also at home a very large share of Democrats don't like his uh profound solidarity with Israel many young uh voters in America 70% are not happy with Biden's foreign policy and he himself faces a dilemma because he doesn't want to see this escalate with every day that the military operation continues the chance of escalation with Iran with Lebanon with Syria and others increases so at the same time Joe Biden would like to Tamp that down and he has nonetheless said Hamas cannot rule in Gaza any longer he has a dilemma on his hands also on day five Melinda crane thank you very much for this analysis we going to speak to Mo Crystal he was a crisis negotiator for various Israeli governments between 1994 and 2001 today he is the CEO of Nest that's a consulting company that provides negotiations and crisis management uh training welcome uh to DW news miti I assume you follow developments as closely as we are here in this studio from what we've seen so far is everything going according to to plan in your book yes uh the first dispatch uh is going according to the plan as we speak the um 13 Israeli hostages and 12 ties uh hostages uh cross the or are in the cross the rough a crossing point are are in Israel are in Egypt and they are going to be transferred to uh uh Israel uh very very uh very shortly now as someone who has been involved in hostage release negotiations how big is the risk that something goes wrong somewhere in between well the risk is very high the risk is very high because so many uh components so many elements are involved uh it's Hamas leadership is Hamas terrorists on the ground uh the Red Cross the Egyptians all the elements needs to be closely coordinated and we have to bear in mind that we're dealing with a a brutal Terror organization here which not necessarily control all um all its people so uh the risks that deal uh will will for some reason uh there will be some elements which will not comply with with the agreement the risk is very high uh given that that the uh the first uh dispatch the first group of people was um now already in Israel it's it's a good sign I do hope that the next two rounds of of the deal the two next phases will be implemented as such it's it's important to stress that it is in the interest of Hamas to uh release this 50 people because they gain um more and more uh days of Cal days Days of ceasefire and uh it allows them to reorganize and uh strengthen their line of defense uh hoping that uh this CIS file will be lead to International pressure on Israel uh to actually end the operation uh there that that's the game plan of Hamas therefore they do have an interest to maintain the um you know a quiet execution of the release of the hostages now this First Agreement the release of 50 hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners is successfully implemented in the next few days do you expect the more hostages to be released more quickly in the future well the deal itself this what we call humanitarian deal uh kids uh babies um mothers elderly women Holocaust Survivors this deal has some incentive mechanism if Hamas will be able to add additional kids babies women uh to the deal Hamas will gain extra days of of seiz fire therefore it is in the interest of Hamas to com to continue and to get possession of those hostages which are not in their immediate uh uh control because on this uh barbaric Terror event of October seven also Islamic Jihad the Palestinian Islamic Jihad as well as other gangs Warlords took hostages brutally and uh it's a challenge for Hamas now to get them and uh exchange them in the current deal now let's talk about the Palestinian prisoners uh that Israel agreed to release in exchange for the hostages who decides which prison prison are put on that list and according to what criteria well the agreement articulates General criteria which is mainly uh female terrorists and um young people uh not minor uh who committed uh what we call the terror light Terror were convicted for lighter offenses lighter could be by the way a stubbing attempt uh of of Jews of innocent uh Israelis which didn't uh materialize to death that that is what we considered uh light Terror uh offenses uh the criteria will were agreed and the names are uh in the decision Sol decision of of Israel at this part of the deal so we are just now seeing a live pictures there I don't know whether you can actually see them there's a number of ambulance Vans lined up there ambulances which crossed of course the Egyptians uh who are in charge of the execution of of the deal uh they have a significant role in implementation of course they make a a tremendous show uh I'm not sure to what extent it is in the benefit of the hostages uh definitely the kids uh uh the young people who were held for 48 days in the in Hamas tunnels but you can see in the picture that the elderly women are actually uh waving you know it's it's uh I'm I speaking to you honestly try to be very uh I would say Prof professional in cm but see these Holocaust Survivors going through through what they went and still waving happily this is the strength this is the Israeli spirit this is the Israeli resilience this is the national call which actually supported the Israeli government to negotiate with this Terror regime because it's the moral obligation to free hostages almost at any at any cost at any price the crisis negotiated Monty Crystal there thank you very much for sharing your expertise with us thank
