Egyptian officials say mediators have made progress in talks aimed at a truce in Gaza representatives from the US Egypt Israel and Qatar are meeting in Cairo as international calls grow for Israel to put off a planned assault on the southern city of Rua more than 1 million civilians are crammed into Rua many fled there from Israeli attacks in other parts of the Gaza Strip Israel meanwhile says Rafa is the last Bastion of Hamas the militant group that committed the October the 7th Terror attacks Aid agencies are saying the people in Rafa would have nowhere to go if an Israeli ground attack took place on Monday US President Joe Biden said Washington was working on a deal to release Israeli hostages and bring what he called immediate and sustained calm to Gaza for at least 6 weeks partnership between the United States and our allies now according to gaza's health Ministry which is run by Hamas more than 28,000 Palestinians have died in the violence so far and currently for the living there are no good options their few remaining possessions are packed the road to an uncertain future lies ahead this is the reality for hundreds of thousands of gazen refugees in their desperate search for safety we hope the war ends and ends quickly we're tired fleeing from one city to another we're so tired I swear to God people are tired I'm hoping the world stands with us and looks at us with a kind and merciful eye we're tired but always crying mon shelling destruction death starvation thirst there's no food some 1.3 million Gins had found respite from the fighting here in Rafa following Israel's orders but Israel's plant offensive in the city threatens what little safety Rafa can provide there are few options available to the people living in Rafa they could travel North to Central Gaza Al maasi or k Yunis but heavy fighting as much of those areas in Ruins leaving civilians like these faced with a desperate Choice there simply is no place to flee two uh Central and Northern Gaza have been uh the sites of of increased of intense fighting uh Northern Gaza has been basically reduced to Rubble there are no facilities uh or accommodations there able to to uh host uh people fleeing for safety on top of that there's the the added risk of unexploded ordinances throughout all of Gaza but particularly in the north where there was quite heavy air strikes uh early on in the first few months of of this escalation uh and on top of that people have fled multiple times they have nothing with them nothing they have very little belongings the United States the European Union and the United Nations have urged the IDF to do more to protect civilians caught up in the fighting but as Rafa comes under increasing fire it remains unclear if anywhere is safe for the people of Gaza Nowa bin Mubarak Alani is leurer in the field of international relations and defense he's also a former director of Defense intelligence operations in Qatar I asked him to tell us where the truth talks stand right now well from the reports what we can say uh Ana is that the talks are progressing positively uh and hopefully we can see results soon unfortunately however there is actions on the other direction happening from the IDF that may threaten any uh advance in those talks especially in regards to Rafa okay what are some of the the major gaps that still need to be bridged right now in these uh negotiations well obviously the uh escalatory um uh scene right now from a military standpoint has to be um addressed the current situation Rafa is untable uh it is uh right now the last uh uh place where refugees have some sort of calm uh relative obviously it's been shattered right now with the bombings and the fear of a land incursion just may threaten all of that so that situation right now in Rafa looms uh over all negotiations that one might expect obviously Israel is facing a huge ational criticism even from its main Ally the US is the fact that the CIA Chief is now also at the negotiating table is that key to making Israel accept a deal well this is not the first time for the uh director of Central Intelligence to be part of the negotiation this has been a standing situation where the director of Central Intelligence was always part of the negotiation however the rhetoric from the US's side has ramped up uh last week we saw uh from the National Security Council in the White House directives for any country receiving military aid to adhere to humanitarian international law that is a new advance in in a persuasion if you will if not pressure for the Israelis to back down from further escalation militarily so I think that is where we're going and the Americans have done a lot they could do more obviously uh but we're coming to a head right now where there are two escalatory situations happening from the air and probably the second from the ground soon that may threaten that delicate balance we have right now in the 11th Hour of negotiations Hammer officials are clear they say any major attack on Rafa will lead to an end of any further negotiations do you see any signs that Israel is listening is taking this warning seriously well to be honest uh the European Union not only Hamas but the European Union uh Great Britain the United States Qatar and Egypt and most of Israel's Partners allies and obviously the negotiators have advised Israel and warned Israel to not Advance into Rafa the Israelis have not shown any signal that they're backing down now they may do that but they haven't signaled as much the current kinetic operations are advancing the devastation is continuing unfortunately and with this new escalation today of killing journalists and wounding journalists uh today two journalists were wounded from alzer in the past 48 Hours four journalists were killed doesn't send a good message that the Israelis are not planning to move forward with the invasion of Rafa unfortunately however the us and the EU still has still have pressure points we've seen it in the past and hopefully it will continue to con you know convey the the idea that both War and Peace cannot exist at the same time all right we'll have to leave it there NAA bin Mubarak Al Tani thank you so much for your time and your analysis there thank you very much an the situation in Rafa was on the agenda today in Berlin where Germany's foreign minister analina Bok met her Palestinian counter Bri Mal for talks here's what she had to say we've seen hundreds of thousands of people lose their homes in the past months of course they need shelter they went to the South where there were already several refugee camps that's why we made it clear that the over 1 million people in the area can't just disappear into thin air they need safe corridors to get to safety like they did in the beginning and that is our responsibility I've made it as clear as possible there cannot just be safe places in corridors in theory they have to exist in reality our chief political correspondent nah haza elicited that response from the German foreign minister tell us more about the meeting Nina well it's not the first time of course that analina babok and Riad al-maliki have met um analina babok has been to the region four times since the 7th of October when Hamas the terrorist organization launched this brutal attack on Israel so uh Riad Al Maliki thanked her for her efforts in trying to exercise essentially a bit of pressure on both sides so that this conflict ends and Alena Bach's message is always there is suffering on all sides so she does mention that there are still um more than a 100 hostages that are being kept by Hamas and that Israel does have the right to defend itself against that sort of terrorism but at the same time she says nobody can Overlook the suffering that is going on in Gaza and today at this meeting she reiterated again Israel does have the right to defend itself but it does not have the right to expel anybody from essentially what is Palestinian territory and both uh foreign ministers expressed their big concern over an escalation of the situation in Rafa which is why they stress so much that there need to be safe corridors for the people who have fled to the south of Gaza exactly because there was this big military operation in the north of Gaza we all know that there is no option for the Palestinians to flee further south Egypt is not willing to take refugees in from the Gaza Strip so U there need to be safe corridors and an Alena babok is going to tell the Israeli counterparts she's going to be meeting again later on this week that they need to make sure that a humanitarian disaster is avoided you mentioned the day after uh this conflict and also bok's trip to uh upcoming trip to Israel again did the meeting touch on what the future could look like for Gaza absolutely there are lots of negotiations happening um behind closed doors at the moment Qatar is an important player Egypt is an important player of the United States but also Germany which is still one of Israel's closest allies and yet um analina bbok stressed that there are certain conditions that Israel also needs to fulfill um Riyad al- Maliki also said that reforms of the Palestinian Authority of which he's the head are vital so that the Palestinian population essentially has a legitimate represent ation again we mustn't forget that of course Arad Al Maliki doesn't represent Hamas he represents the um the Palestinian Authority that is based in ramala so um there needs to be a proper representation of the Palestinian people he said that that is very much in his interest because they all say this conflict cannot be solved militarily what is needed is a political solution and that essentially um a two-state solution is the only way for forward and that these preparations need to happen at the same time Riad Al Maliki was being very clear he wants Germany to put pressure on Israel so that Israel also sees uh the right of the Palestinian people to have their own State interesting insights there from our chief political corespondent nah
