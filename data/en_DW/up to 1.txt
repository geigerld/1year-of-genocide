Israel has ordered Palestinians to evacuate from more areas around the second largest city in the Gaza Strip hunis it says it's intensifying its military campaign on Southern Gaza to Target Hamas which has been designated a terrorist organization by multiple countries many of gaza's residents fled to the south of the territory after being ordered to leave the north families and friends gather outside the al- Ali Baptist Hospital in Gaza City to pray for the victims of this latest round of Israeli air strikes a mother Grieves for her young daughter the bodies were pulled from the rubble in scenes that have become all too familiar for many in Northern Gaza it was here that Israel concentrated most of its Firepower until now Israel's military is stepping up its offenses in southern Gaza on Sunday it issued a new evacuation order telling people to leave areas in and around the city of car Unis in the South more than 1.8 million displaced gazin are being squeezed into an increasingly smaller space the daily bombings and the lack of access to basic immunities are taking a toll scenes like these reflect the devastating impact the war is having on this generation of Palestinian children leaving those who do survive deeply traumatized since this morning we received large numbers of martys the majority of them were children more than 15 children between 2 and 9 years old these innocent children are being bombed and they are in front of you and you can see them the war is about to enter its third month and there's little hope the fighting will end anytime soon and for more on this Let's cross to DW correspondent Rebecca ritters who's joining us from Jerusalem Rebecca I want to get to the plight of the Palestinians uh gazin that we just saw very moving images of but first off how we got here the talks broke down between hamus and Israel that introduced aen hostilities um with the release of scor of prisoners they've broken down do we know why and if they could start again somehow well it's really difficult to say whether or not these talks will start again there's obviously a lot of Hope and and and effort being made uh on all sides and and from International actors as well to try to get those talks up and running again whether or not they will of course remains to be seen Nick we know that the shaky talks after the ceasefire even broke a couple of days ago were continuing and they found finally stalled yesterday uh with the prime minister's office here Benjamin netanyahu's office withdrawing his mosad negotiators the Israeli intelligence service negotiators and withdrawing them from Doha where they were meeting with qari uh and Egyptian officials to try to come to some arrangement to resume even a temporary ceasefire to allow for the release of more hostages and more Aid going in they completely broke down we've got Israel blaming Hamas for not delivering on their promise of of issuing lists with more women and children but the fact of the matter is We There are analysts saying even that Hamas may not know where all of the prisoners are we know that Hamas were not the only group to take prisoners we know that some civilians were also holding hostages I should say and we also know that some other militant groups also took Israelis into their gazen territory so part of the ceasefire was to allow for Hamas to be able to locate some of those hostages whether or not not they were able to do so isn't known and the fact that they couldn't produce those lists perhaps suggests that they may not have been able to locate all uh those remaining women and children we just don't know we know that the US are pretty firm they're trying to get the talks to continue and we know that Qatari officials and Egyptian officials also trying to push for those talks to uh to start again but whether or not they will uh as I said you know is is anyone's guess we know that the talks even before this ceasefire deal was agreed were very up and down uh looking very shaky at times until an agreement was finally reached so there is a lot of Hope and a lot of chance that they could resume but at this stage uh they are in fact at the moment completely dead in the water and Rebecca just briefly if I may get back to this situation for the people who have fled to Southern Gaza uh for their own safety how safe are they now with the resumption of Israel attacks well we've of course been talking about the dire situ sitation in Gaza for many weeks we've been seeing uh the the almost constant bombardment of course apart from the the temporary ceas fire these people going from the north to the South and now it looks and and Israel is saying that it's readying itself for a ground operation in the South dropping leaflets in the city of hunas in the South urging people to move yet further south near the rougher Crossing uh but of course people not really knowing where they can go everybody's saying that there isn't anywhere safe for these people people we're also seeing that Israel is setting up a plan to divide Gaza up into these zones these numbered zones they're as part of this leaflet drop uh also including QR codes with numbers on them so that people can know which zone to get into we've got humanitarian organizations saying people hardly have access to electricity to Communications how are they supposed to work out what zone they're in and I even heard read one humanitarian saying that this is sort of like some ma board game that these people are being have to work out whether you know if they're in zone 35 whether that's going to be bombed today or tomorrow and and to try and and vacate that area so a very very precarious dangerous and dire situation for the civilians in the South Nick as one can imagine DW correspondent Rebecca ritters from Jerusalem there and joining us now from a man in Jordan is unicef's head of communications and advocacy in the Middle East Omar Omar uh thank you for joining us C can you tell us what you are hearing from Gaza on the latest air strikes and how they're affecting people the situation is horrific um Gaza returned to be one of the most dangerous places for children in in on Earth as of today you know it is a Pity to see and tragic to see that the number that there are more children are continue to be killed to be injured our teams are on the ground and they are seeing the horrific impact that is having on the infrastructure but more so on children um scores of children are being taken to hospitals they are injured um there are scores of thousands on thousands of children are being killed or have been killed you know the estim were like around 400 children killed and injured every day and with the current intensity of the hostilities this is pretty much as well tragically that the death toll could be equal to what has been in the in the before the current moves in the in the fighting and in parallel we see that the Arian situation continues to be extremely dire you know with the lack of access to food to health to nutrition um one million uh children in Gaza are food insecured most of them are like huddled in very overcrowded places and they are subjected to the elements and to all the lack of essential basic services that put their lives at emminent risk let me ask you a question about that when there was a ceasefire some humanitarian Aid was able to get through those talks are now stalled military oper operations have resumed does this mean no more relief supplies there are some relief supplies going in but it's not enough by any standard you know if you look at the situation in Gaza today two million people more than two million people are in need of humanitarian assistance half of those are children so to be able to sustain the needs you know of the huge needs you know you would need UNS you need we would need sustained and impeded access in terms of supplies going into Gaza and as well the security conditions to allow a safe distribution of these supplies to the people across the Gaza Strip to the children wherever they are these are really critical situations this is the current the current Crossing ra Crossing is the only Lifeline for the children and their families in Gaza so any interruptions or reduction in the aid going in this will put definitely their lives at imminent imminent risk of death let me ask you since your UNICEF about the children what do they need now and what will they need in the future I mean psychologically after all they've gone through what the way the children in Gaza need right now ceasefire there is nothing else but cease fire that can that ensure that they are they live and not to be killed and not to be injured and not to be exposed to lack of food drinking uh a brick the contaminated water that gives them diarrhea and and other water Bor born diseases you know um this what the children of Gazza need right now ceasefire and I think this is the responsibility if every single uh Nation every single leader at these critical times should continue to be killed to make sure to put all the efforts that a ceasefire is reached immediately sustained ceasefire at the same time of course the needs are massive in in in terms of everything we are talking about about water we are talking about food we are talking about nutrition about health but above all as well you have spoken about trauma all the children today in Gaza they are traumatized of what they have been exposed to for of the Relentless bming and and the the the footage and the horrific scenes that they were exposed to from having their children sorry have seeing their their parents killed or their siblings or you know being themselves exposed you know to the to the to the to the bombings and taking to hospitals you know the scenes that we are seeing are are horrific and and nothing could stop that but an immediate cease fire to to spare the children of Gaz that the the the atrocities that are being committed understood thank you Amar Amar with UNICEF in amand Jordan thank you staying in the region international criminal court Chief prosecutor kareim Khan met with Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas in the West Bank on Saturday while in ramala KH also met with activists and Palestinians released from Israeli prisons earlier he visited Israel and met with some of the released hostages as well as with families of those still held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip Ken said previously the ICC was investigating suspected war crimes committed by both sides in the recent escalation and for more on this we're joined Now by Yuval sassan he's an attorney who works with the families of the hostages and who accompanied Karim Khan on his trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories uh Mr San thanks for for joining us can you tell me what did the prosecutor of the IC achieve uh from what you're hearing in meeting with President Mahmud Abbas who after all doesn't rep represent Hamas thank you for having me I I don't know exactly what happened in his meeting with mmud abas because that meeting took place one day after his visit here with us in Israel I can tell you one thing that the we saw during his trip here in Israel together with us where we took him through the communities the run the devastated communities in the South we visited the B kibot then afterwards the Fara kibot as well as the Nova site and later on he got a chance to meet with the families of hostages told them their stories some of them are hostages that were already released so many of them have not been released yet and many of the people are themselves victims of the October 7th atrocities we also had a chance of visiting together with him at the Schneider Children Hospital meeting there with the manager of the hospital so I don't know what Mr bu told him but I know that Mr Khan got the chance here in Israel to meet with the people to hear firsthand the stories to see the sites because he visited the community to hear the noises to smell the smells because unfortunately even two months afterwards death is still the controlling scent when you visit these communities sure well burning forgive me help me understand the legal uh Gears of all this he's a war crimes prosecutor he's hearing stories he's Gathering evidence uh I would suppose to to building a case how would the families like to see this place out in terms of international law do you think so so just clarifying he was not here for collecting evidence he was here in order to get the first impression and at at the request of the families but obviously he didn't come here to share his sympathy he came here as a prosecutor in order to decide whether to open such an investigation and go to the evidence collection stage and I think that what he saw here should convince him to open such an investigation now there's no question legally about his jurisdiction to try theas you mentioned before abas it's the same president of the Palestinian State as they call it as they Proclaim it and as the international PR court has accepted it Mahmud abas has joined the international criminal court as such he has given it jurisdiction over all the citizens of the so-call bahim Palestinian State and as such the citizens of Gaza Strip which include all Hamas perpetrators whether they live in Gaza or leave elsewhere are under the jurisdiction of the international PR of court and just briefly if I may do you think that an indictment by the ICC would change the thought process of the members of Hamas who are holding hostages I mean how does this work in terms of the politics of of laws is anything going to change because what the iccc does or doesn't do uh uh I'll I'll answer because this is the question that obviously we're all asking ourselves I think that first of all we need to send a message because the international pent court is is legacies following World War II and the near andb trials and its legacies that we act today and not in retrospective so any indictment filed by the international PR court has a meaning has mean in terms of Justice also towards the families of the October 7th atrocity second issue is obviously the people that are five floors before below Gaza the terrorists that are hiding there now because the IDF is acting and act not only they're hiding from the ID they're hiding behind their own population be behind their own people they they're less concerned with that but there are so many laders aers and aors that sit in hotels in as I'm as I'm told five star hotels in a ious countries they should be concerned they have a lot of assets they're billionaires billionaires on the suffering of own people and billionaires on the suffering I'm afraid that's all we have time for this time but thank you jual San who works with the families of the hostages in Israel thank
