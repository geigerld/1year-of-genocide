Israel is calling the death toll after Saturday's terrorist attack staggering it is now known that Hamas militants killed at least 12200 people and that most were civilians the new number has come to light as the military discovers more bodies Israel has intensified its air strikes on Gaza in retaliation Palestinian officials say at least 900 people there have been killed and thousands more wounded Israel is also m troops on the border and is widely expected to start a ground offensive into Gaza soon DW's Rebecca ritters reports from the Israeli town of zuro close to the Gaza Strip This is the stot police station or what's left of it and it's the scene of one of the biggest battles during this ordeal Hamas militants were H up inside and the Israeli military were caught up in a 20-hour gun battle local residents left terrified and and angry horrifying because we saw them running around here everywhere we were pretty much innocent and we didn't have anything to do in this entire situation no weapons to you know protect ourselves nothing to actually do in this situation I've been through BS but not nothing like this nothing like animals and and who slaughtered and and butchers our kids and sisters and our fathers and our children and our babies and everything such a qued Israel is responding to the attacks with massive air strikes on the Gaza Strip the Israeli government has told gazans to evacuate but the territory is trapped between Israel Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea most residents have nowhere to go to escape the bombs one woman said her brother died while trying to follow Israel's instructions to relocate we'd fled to escape death there were continuous air strikes the Israelis told us to come down to Kan yunas but we only found death there if we stay home we die if we go in the streets we die my beloved brother fled from one place to another my beloved brother may your soul rest in peace the Skies over Gaza are filled with rockets and missiles flying in both directions incoming and outgoing fire in the Israeli town of ashalon north of the Gaza Strip Hamas Rockets continue to cause destruction Israel has called up hundreds of thousands of reservists As It prepares the next stage of its retaliation at least one government Minister has joined the troops to avenge what he calls Israel's 911 this is not going to be another Circle we're going to chase and hunt each and every militant of Hamas we're going to change Chase and Hunt their leaders and we will fight until the end against them and we will be victorious not just for us but for the sake of the Civilized World a ground offensive by Israeli forces looks likely prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his country to prepare for a long and difficult war that he says will reshape the Middle East and joining us from Tel Aviv is Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan conriquez from the Israeli Army uh Lieutenant Lieutenant Colonel thank you so much for your time uh Israel is massing forces on gaza's Border there is of course speculation that a a ground offensive into Gaza is imminent is that something being considered or planned as things stand now yes good night thank you for having me on your show Israel is fighting for and defending itself on three fronts the southern front in Gaza which you have spoken about is still active and there are still attacks by terrorists trying to get into Israeli communities they are met by Israeli soldiers who are ready to engage and have ended all of these engagements with killed terrorists in the latest hours both in Ashkelon and in another community in the South Rockets have been fired at Israel from Syria we do not yet know if it was Iranian proxies kisah or the Syrian Armed Forces um but we retaliated fire towards those who fired and currently the situation there is stable in the north along our northern border balah and other Iranian proxy Terror organization has fired anti-tank missiles and other terrorists have tried to infiltrate across the border all of those events have since been taken care of and currently there is no fighting there but we are deployed in significant strength and numbers Vigilant and ready to respond to any aggression from those areas so in the we have for for spelling all that out my my question is is is a ground offensive into Gaza something that is being planned or considered yes I was just about to get to that so in the South we have U deployed or we have called up 300,000 reservists from infantry armor artillery combat engineers and uh combat intelligence units they are now around the Gaza Strip getting ready to execute their missions preparing getting their gear and everything in order the assignment that is that the IDF has been given by by the Israeli Min the Israeli government is to take away all of Hamas military activities so that at the end of this war Hamas does not have any military capacity to kill terrorize or hurt Israeli civilians can I can I take your answer to mean that you are not ruling out a ground offensive into Gaza you'd be correct in assessing that all options are on the table and as I said our troops are preparing in order to implement the mission to execute the mission that we have been given by the Israeli government we are at war against a bloodthirsty Terror organization that is as brutal ruthless and inhumane as Isis was in its worst days and I think that there is unfortunately ample evidence of that when you see the images coming out of the kibuts the communities along the Gaza Strip of 40 5050 and hundreds of Israeli bodies that are scattered across those communities including women children and the elderly the only conclusion that you can make once you see that footage is that we are dealing with monsters that have no regard for human life and crossed the border only in order to kill and take hostage Israeli civilians sir You' just mentioned these hostages and I do want to ask you about that how does this uh very very complicated Mission uh complicate these efforts in terms of getting to the hostages held by Hamas militants because on the one hand there is uh there are strikes from the Israeli military onto Gaza but on the other hand you you you want to rescue the hostages that are uh being held in Gaza could you could you spell this out a bit more clearly for us the complicated uh the mission that's ahead of you I think you touched upon the complexity quite well the situation is that there are dozens of Israelis in Gaza most of them are civilians I'm talking about women children disabled people elderly people and even babies or toddlers there's even a holocaust Survivor that we assess is being held by Hamas uh we know of uh hostages that are also with dual nationality there are Americans Germans French Brits Brazilians and ukrainians and from additional countries that are being held by Hamas so this situation this extremely complex situation is not an Israeli problem only an Israeli problem but we are talking about many countries that have their Nationals at the uh Mercy or lack of mercy of Hamas you are right that the complexity here is immense but our focus is the Strategic focus of denying balah the sorry Hamas the ability to have any military capacity against Israel and that is what our aerial campaign is focused on and that is what the next stages of our military operation will be focused on but it is an unprecedented issue we have never before been tasked with dealing with such a complex sensitive and frankly uh heartwrenching dilemma that we have before us today but we will address it and at the end of this war we will prevail sir ju just finally could you spell out for us please what are the measures that the Israeli military is taking to minimize both civil civilian casualties in terms of hostages but also uh Palestinians in Gaza as Israel responds to this attack yes the Gaza Strip is a small and dense Place more than 2 million people live there most of them are not Hamas supporters they live there under oppression of Hamas and Hamas being coward terrorists are hiding behind the civilians and using them as human Shields and Hamas has purposely positioned all of their infrastructure all of their military hardware their positions their Rockets their bunkers and every places that Hamas is they have positioned that behind the civilians and they are using them as human Shields we are trying the best we can to strike only military targets and we act upon precise intelligence and we try to deliver very precise ordinance only at places where we know that Hamas uses them for military purposes it's important for me to explain that if while you're showing footage of what looks like civilian houses being struck from the air and collapsing for the untrained eye the problem with Hamas is that they don't put signs on buildings where they have offices and research and development and command and control there's no sign that says this is a Hamas facility they hide be be amongst the civilians and therefore it's very important to understand that we are striking houses and Facilities that look civilian but they're not because they are used by terrorists in order to fight against us and that's why they are legitimate military targets but I want to say and emphasize and shortly we are committed to the law of armed conflict we do not want to strike civilians and we will try not to affect civilians as we carry on with this war against Hamas in Gaza Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan conriquez from the Israeli Defense Forces thank you so much for joining us thank you for having me good night and I'm now joined by the DW Middle East analyst shanie rosanes good to have you in the studio shanie um we know that the death hole's risen what more do we know about the situation on the ground today are there still Hamas militants in Israel yes there are um and the problem is the Israelis don't know how many and where exactly the assumption is that there several of them several groups of them hiding somewhere along Israel once the Border was crossed and they made it to Israel and that keeps everybody on edge that's what we seeing Israel a lot of AG agitation a lot of alertness also in the northern border where we see little inclusions uh coming from uh the Shiite group kisala in the north so everything is very very tense and if you look at Gaza then of course there there's a lot of suffering those bombardments constant bombardments from the air by Israeli uh Air Force so this is where we stand today Shan it's all but certain that Israel is preparing a ground offensive is there any indication as to when the this offensive will be launched and and and what it might look like well um we hear a lot of talks about this is going to be unprecedented this is going to be something that we've never we the Palestinians the region have never seen before um Israel is very much aware of the fact that Hamas is anticipating this uh ground operation and it's trying to reinvent the playbook in Gaza it's we know what we used to see in Gaza it's quite hard to predict what we're going to see there's one thing clear that we're seeing from all uh decision makers in Israel they will stop at nothing they have uh the shock is such that they they sound they sound very militant with very little care for humanitarian or any other you know uh considerations and to that point it's it's pretty clear that the stated goal here is to eradicate Hamas sha in the event that that were to happen and it really looks likely that that will there's going to be this vacuum in Gaza what does Israel intend to do then will we see Israel take full control of the territory that's part of we're still not sure of we don't know there are no clear aims to this war um to this operation we don't know if Israel is only trying to dismantle hamas's military capabilities or Take Over hamas's Control over over the territory in total and that would mean re recapturing Gaza and reoccupying it which I think very few people in Israel are interested in um what's not obviously not spoken out loud at least are any political diplomatic solutions that will bring in other allies from the region um and that I think will have to inevitably be on the table but it's still not there uh yet uh the US President Joe Biden he's spoken out on the issue we also know that he is in constant engagement uh with the Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin n what do you know about those discussions and and what did you make of what he had to say when right from the start it was important for Biden to clear to clearly indicate that he's standing behind Israel and he has also um sent a lot of Military Support to to the Middle East the biggest fear looming is Iran and Iran's involvement you know we we know that Iran is in the back channels the one behind to some extent what we're seeing in Gaza definitely what we will might be seeing in the north with hasbalah and that's the biggest fear that Netanyahu and and Biden are are sharing and they want to keep Iran at Bay um we also know that uh from uh reports that Biden has seen the photos of the victims of the wreckage of the horror um Left Behind of the of the victims who were really uh left in un unbelievably terrible State and he was very touched by it and this is also partially fueling his uh personal anger as someone who seen himself as a friend of Israel for many years sh we'll leave it there for now than uh DW Middle East analyst sha rosan is there and we want to get some more analysis on this and for that I want to bring in military analyst uh Frank Le he is in Oxford in the United Kingdom good to see you Frank rank I I want to talk about the ground offensive that we're anticipating in a short moment but let's begin um with this we understand that it it it is likely that there are still some Hamas militants in Israel what do you make of that well as shaie said there are almost certainly considerable numbers I would suggest the Israelis have killed they say about 1,500 uh Hamas terrorists and uh they don't know the numbers of of uh of the incursion itself I have no doubt at all that there are dozens at least and of course there may well be sleeper cells as well which would be part of the overall Hamas plan so there's no wonder as shiny says the Israelis are on pins about this yeah um Frank we see Israel stepping up its air strikes uh bombing buildings in Gaza would these strikes be part of the preparation for uh this ground offensive this anticipated ground offensive yes Christine the what's going happening now is preparation of the battlefield as the military term goes and the Israelis are warning sector by sector in Gaza to leave and they're carrying through their their strikes systematically so this is all part of probably a uh well certainly part of a Target list or they're going through a Target list prepared over a period of years because they've been planning for something like this they never wanted to execute it but they've been planning for it they know the ground and now that plan is being executed and and what will that execution actually look like what will we see when the Israeli Army launches uh that ground offensive it's difficult to say tactically there only a limited number of Ingress and out out to Ingress routs in which will be heavily defended by by Hamas they know which way the Israeli is going to come in when they come in in force we're likely to see some surprises what form they take I don't know uh the form it will take will be an infantry assault tanks are useful in certain areas of Gaza but overall the Israeli armored Core I suspect will be staying back because Hamas has very effective anti-tank capabilities in the shape of uh Russian supplied or rather Russian made missiles so this is going to be an infantry battle and it's going to be horrific it's a three-dimensional battle anyway it's a heavily urbanized area the Israelis are going to be worried about uh uh forces from underneath from the tunnels from behind from in front of course and from above uniquely Christine from the Israeli perspective or rather for the first time Israeli soldiers are going to have to be looking up because Hamas has quite a well-developed uh now drone Force which it's been putting together over the last decade or so and that will remove the Israeli unique advantage of surveillance interesting point you make there I want to look at the the capabilities on on the Hamas side um given the resources that they deployed um in Saturday's attacks does Hamas have the numbers to resist an Israeli military ground incursion I'm talking boots on the ground here well Christine the uh the force they deployed on on over the weekend and recently amounts to between probably 1500 and 2500 most assessments of hamas's uh Manpower put it between 15 and 20,000 that's just Hamas so yes they have the numbers whether they'll be able to resist the Israelis is another thing but the important thing to remember here is both sides have been planning this for years and years and Hamas may have the edge on this because for now anyway because they have proved themselves over the last few months to be highly Dynamic so they're going to be waiting for the Israelis and that's something of course needless to say the Israelis are going to be fully aware of we've got an irresistible Force meeting an immovable object one side will have to give I suspect it'll be Hamas But to answer your point yes they've got the boots the numbers to to cause Israel serious damage okay Frank we'll leave it there thank you military analyst Frank lri thank you thank
