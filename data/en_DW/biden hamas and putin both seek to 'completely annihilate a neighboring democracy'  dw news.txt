US President Joe Biden has urged Americans to support tens of billions of dollars in funding for Israel and Ukraine saying they were fighting for democracy in a rare speech from the White House's Oval Office he stressed that backing both was vital for US National Security completely annihilated Biden said the world was looking to America for leadership and that the US couldn't afford to abandon its allies Now American leadership is what holds the world together American Alliance is what keep us America safe American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with to put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine if we turn our backs on Israel it's just not worth it that's why tomorrow I'm going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America's national security needs to support our critical Partners including Israel and Ukraine is a smart investment that's going to pay dividends for American Security for Generations help us keep American troops out of Harm's Way help us build a world that is safer more peaceful more prosperous for our children and grandchildren spring in DW's William glucoft here William an unusual step for Biden delivering an address from the Oval Office it is unusual I'm trying to remember a time when the a a US president gave a major Prime Time National address about something on far away especially a war that the US actually isn't officially directly involved in right no boots on the ground no American lives at risk but this actually kind of signals a shift uh in in what US power means in the world these days right it's not so much military power anymore of course the United States still has a massive military outspends and out arms itself more than any other country in the world um but American power these days is money is it the financial system its ability to back its allies with huge amounts of financial support and that's kind of what this speech is now so we're seeing the shift actually from American military power to American Financial and and and money power and uh it its support for sort of wars in its interests even though it's not directly involved Talking Money Biden has said he will request more funding billions for both Ukraine and Israel what are the chances of that funding getting Congressional approval William well famous last word and I'll never make predictions live on air about what may or may not happen in politics specifically us politics given what's going on right now that said I'm sure at the end of the day something will pass there is still bipartisan support for Ukraine although it is waning a bit and there is strong strong strong uh unwavering decades long support uh on both sides of the aisle for Israel so given that something will happen but what is it going to take to get there how much it's going to be what cons sessions might have to be made in terms of security on the border with Mexico other Republican uh pet projects so to speak that's going to be the big question those negotiations uh and of course Congress right now is paralyzed can't actually give the money that Biden wants even if they wanted to because there's of course no speaker in the house the Congress is completely bogged down in its own internal uh mess trying to get leadership going so that they can move forward on a legislative agenda so it's going to take a while remember mid November is when the money the current money Runs Out could see another government shut down the US president is also urging Israel not to be in his words blinded by rage uh is that Biden asking Israel to show restraint in its looming ground offensive in the Gaza Strip William it certainly sounds like that right Biden is walking a fine line saying of course Israel has the right to defend itself of course it has the right to respond to hamas's attack but there is still international law to comply with there is still a a horrible situation in Gaza that Israel is largely responsible for in terms of the humanitarian side of things um and he did make note about America's own 911 experience the major mistakes that the US made uh in terms of its policy decisions and undermining its own values when it comes to torture and the kinds of surveillance that it it employed after uh in what it saw as its security needs uh so it's trying to caution Israel don't do what we did um try to make smarter decisions think cooly and rationally even in the incredibly tragic time for them William thanks for your analysis that was DW's William
