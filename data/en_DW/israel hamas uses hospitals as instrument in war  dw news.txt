as fighting continues near hospitals in the Gaza Strip US President Joe Biden has warned that the biggest gazen Hospital must be protected he's called on Israel to take less intrusive action at alifa Israel alleges Hamas militants are using medical centers as command bases Witnesses say Israeli tanks have surrounded alifa where doctors say they've been without water or electricity for days filmed just a few days ago this video apparently shot inside gaza's alifa Hospital gives a sense of just how many people have been crowded inside the World Health Organization says this is no longer a functioning hospital it says there's no more fuel for generators vital life-saving equipment is no longer working and according to medical staff at the facility dozens of newborns have now been removed from incubators and place together on beds in the open so they are literally in a very bad situation where you slowly kill them unless someone interferes to adjust or to improve their situation but these are very critical kind of cases where you have to be uh very sensitive in dealing with them you have to take care of each of them in a very special way but currently they are all in open space they are with each others with no infection control measures Israel's ground offensive has been moving ever closer to the gates of alifa Hospital in recent days with the US president joining the growing international calls for restraint well uh you know I have not been reluctant in expressing my concerns what's going on um and is my hope and expectation that uh there will be uh less intrusive action relative to the hospital the hospital must be protected Israel's military has accused Hamas of using hospitals to hide command centers and weapons and it's now released footage of what it says is a children's hospital in Gaza the tunnel is Led down more than 20 M down the robot found a door a door that is bulletproof it's a it's explosives proof alleging Hamas had held hostages in rooms beneath the hospital we now we are now in the area of the basement of the hospital along with a cash of weapons and explosives inside the hospital I want you to understand this kind of gear is a gear for a major fight these are explosives these are vest vest with explosives yeah it's a body vest for terrorists to explode on forces among hospitals among patients hospitals are given special protection during times of War but Israel argues that Hammer's use of medical facilities as cover overrides any legal safeguards as it intensifies its ground offensive inside the Gaza Strip I'm joined Now by Andreas Creek from the school of security studies at Kings College London what's your assessment of this video released by the Israeli military's Chief in which he tries to show how m is using hospitals as an instrument of War well I mean it's it's a known fact that Hamas is hiding among the civilian population and has also used um you know dual use infrastructure which is civilian infrastructure for their operations but we also need to be very very careful about Israel's use of information we're in a war over narratives uh the IDF has made repeated and has released repeated uh pieces of Miss and disinformation if we look at that that video in particular we have to exercise a lot of scrutiny Israel is a party to this conflict they have a motivation to take a particular stance in this to make themselves look better than they actually are they unfortunately in this war have shown that veracity is not necessarily one of their main ways of doing it if of presenting information if you look at the shaft in particular we don't know if that's a shaft that goes to a tunnel we don't know if that's a maintenance shaft some of the releases of videos last week that were released by the IDF in afterwards were shown to be actually just M shafts that were actually not tunnels that were going into anywhere into Hamas infrastructure so we don't know that then the video is doed so in a lot of occasions we've seen cut Cuts made so we don't know where this tunnel is leading apparently we are then underneath we're shown under in a in into a basement that's underneath the hospital we don't really know where this is um also the evidence that's being presented here is very very dubious is certainly not conclusive we're seeing diapers and we're seeing bottles that's quite clear that people Civ were staying there but that's true because civilians were hiding in hospitals and had to hide in hospitals for the last couple of weeks during the bombardment so that's no evidence for anything then we've seen a r or a calendar on the wall in Arabic where all we see is n is is is basically the days of the week in Arabic and that's being presented as evidence that this is Hideout for Hamas again not not is makes it very very uh uh dubious and in many ways undermines The credibility of what the IDF is trying to present here and this very important that we that we keep a clear eye out we've seen videos being doctored by the ADF we've seen these kind of staged uh uh conversations that allegedly were supposed to show Hamas Fighters um that were intercepted it turned out they were scripted so we have to be very careful in the way that we're looking at that evidence so to speak and and obviously yes we're seeing that some of the arms were were basically put there we don't know if the arms were actually found there or if they were dumped there so the the video in itself has to be uh you kind of dealt with it s s it has to be you know scrutinized in the same way that we would scrutinize Russian information or or Hamas information uh scrutinize this next one for me then the Israeli military's also released a video taken from the air in which it says a hamus fighter is using a rocket launcher outside Al's Hospital yes I've seen that video as well I think that that is you know being geolocated I think that it seems to be um uh the right location at the right time um and it's you know an active war zone I don't think it's it's surprising that Hamas in an active war zone is operating all over uh the the the territory and all over the infrastructure this is obviously a war crime Hamas is hiding as I said initially are hiding among the civilian population but that's still doesn't mean that Israel has been absolved of its um uh kind of uh you know its duty to differentiate between civilians and um and and Fighters here so you can't just bomb a hospital just because you're being shot at from that hospital unfortunately that's not how international law works and we also should bear in mind that these so-called human Shields are passive human Shields there's a difference between active and passive human Shields passive human Shields are those people who are not known that they are human Shields they're being abused by Hamas as human Shields and that means that the attacker in this case the IDF has to really exercise a lot of caution when they're going in there and I think that's what the US president means it means don't use area effect weapons don't use artillery don't use air uh air dropped ordinance against these targets but move in with infantry and even that will be messy because obviously Hamas is operating from among the civilian population lastly Andreas can you also just tell me is it accepted consensus in the intelligence community that hamus does high command facilities under civilan infrastructure now you need to understand that the entire Gaza Strip not just Gaza City but the entire Gaza Strip is a an is an infrastructure of hundreds of kilometers of tunnels and bunkers and command centers all over what is essentially a fairly densely populated area and some of these command structures will be you know inevitably under civilian infrastructure some of them will be underneath or near hospitals so that video that was released by the IDF yesterday suggests though that that bunker was some 100 meters away or 200 met away from the hospital um so it's difficult to say that they're actually hiding it underneath the hospital but certainly Clos to a hospital and and that that's deliberate Hamas doesn't you know that's kind of what an Insurgency force would do to kind of hide themselves among civilians to make sure they can't be struck um so you know it still doesn't absolve Israel from the duty to to basic differentiate between civilians and combatants and make sure that collateral damage is absolutely minimized and the IDF has unfortunately not done this because they've always relied on the one argument of saying Hamas is hiding among the civilians and the burden of uh of of protecting civilians is then being shifted to Hamas which is not true the burden of protecting civilians is both on Hamas and the IDF Andreas Creek security analyst thank you very much for chiming in on DW news thank you well Alona sinenko works with the international Committee of the Red Cross she told me more about the situation in hospitals in southern Gaza even in the south of Gaza in the hospital where our surgical team is working now uh the situation is ex extremely difficult uh they stay away for several hours every night unable to sleep because of the explosions that take place uh nearby um they are also running short on the essential supplies like anesthetics like dressing material as they receive uh people with horrendous wounds a lot of burn patients and unfortunately many of them are children with tens of thousands of people continuing to flee from the north to the South are you equipped uh to help all of these people this is extremely dire situation and today the amount of the humanitarian assistance that we are managing to bring into Gaza is simply not sufficient to face the massive crisis uh that is unfolding we now have uh more than 100,000 displaced people in extremely crowded conditions in the south of Gaza and many of them are also in the hosital hospital where they think they are safer than everywhere else and uh these people have nothing there's a lack of food lack of water so uh the short answer is no we are not equipped we need more humanitarian assistance how many trucks of Aid are you managing to get through the Gaza uh into the Gaza Strip at the moment we have managed uh in the past month to bring uh over or something like 25 trucks of uh humanitarian assistance and this is far from being sufficient because if you come uh situation before this current escalation there were roughly 500 trucks per day uh reaching the strip so what we're bringing is uh extremely small compared to the level of needs so just 25 trucks in over a month now um Israel claims that Hama is using Gaza hospitals to hide their command centers we were just showing some footage from uh the Defense Forces before have your colleagues on the ground seen anything that would prove these claims we are a humanitarian actor we're not an intelligence organization to be able to prove or this uh or right or wrong any claims made by any party in this conflict what we are seeing is is the uh in deep humanitarian crisis unfolding and uh our job is to advocate for the respect of the international humanitarian law and also to remind all the parties that uh we must not forget the humanitarian imperative that there are women children the elderly and that civilians in the north of Gaza and in the Gaza City they are protected by the international humanitarian law I Ino with the international Committee of the Red Cross thank you very much for your time thank
