Israel says its fighter jets have struck several houthi military Targets in Yemen in retaliation for a drone attack on Tel Aviv on Friday the strikes took place in Yemen's Red Sea port city of Hoda according to yemeni television controlled by houi rebels several people were killed and the Jets targeted civilian oil and Diesel storage facilities the strikes come after a drone attack by Yemen's houi Rebels uh on Friday as mentioned which killed one person and injured four or others Let's cross over to our correspondent Tanya krer in Jerusalem Tanya what more do we know well as you just said we had the confirmation uh by the Israeli military the uh IDF uh saying that they struck the Huda port in Yemen an IDF official uh told us said they struck uh infrastructure belonging to the houthis they described them as military infrastructure uh infrastructure of dual use and energy uh uh infrastructure it was according to the military an a mission led by the Israeli Air Force and they went there alone uh very far away uh from Israel uh carried out also in a broad daylight now Israel's allies uh we were told are were informed ahead and this is also uh kind of unusual because houthis uh have been attacking uh you know shipping in the Red Sea before and that's usually a UK US Le Mission there but there also have been in the past month attacks on Israel's southern city uh a lot with drones over 220 projectiles have been fired in the past month since the beginning of the war at Israel now these strikes were approved by a security cabinet that was kind of unusual that it met today on Saturday a Shabbat uh during Shabbat but for Israel this is a change of equation what happened on Friday basically this drone attack uh in the city center of Tel Aviv also an Israeli citizen was killed a man in his 50s uh and several were injured and so we've been hearing now the time from officials here that the time for restraint is over how dangerous are these moves from both sides are we seeing an escalation well I think we don't know yet how this will uh develop uh further there certainly a lot of concern and there have been warnings that this could uh you know lead to more responses again now from the houthis or across the region now it risk to open another active front and as I said there have been attacks on the southern city of aot but not uh as we've seen on Friday uh on Tel Aviv so far the military has said the home front guidelines for uh Israelis here in the country have not changed but of course also that that could change any minute Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem thank you
