Israeli forces have intensified their attacks in the Gaza Strip killing dozens of civilians Israel's military campaign against Hamas is gradually shifting to the south of the strip where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled Hamas is an islamist militant group considered a terrorist organization by the EU and the US a warning this report contains graphic images a frantic search for survivors in the aftermath of an a strike on an apartment in Rafa in gaza's South an injured baby girl is among those pulled from the wreckage her Rescuers race her to hospital where other injured children are [Applause] arriving we escaped from northern Gaza and are staying at my sister's house we came here to Rafa and then they hit the neighbor's house which collapsed onto us we came from the north because they said we'd be safe here I wish we'd been marted there hadn't left hadn't come here more than 80% of Garin are estimated to have been forced from their homes now Israel's strikes are intensifying in packed areas where many were told they'd be safe Israel has confirmed it was responsible for a Christmas Eve strike on maazi refugee camp it said it quote regretted the harm caused to uninvolved civilians for the bombing which killed dozens while many Israelis support the war efforts there are growing calls for an end to the Bloodshed with hundreds of Arabs and Israelis rallying together in Tel Aviv this br is about H Arab people and Jewish people standing together and we live here together in this country and I believe that we have to live here together and I do believe that we can live peacefully together Israelis Palestinians U Muslims Jews and Christians this is everybody's the only solution is to recognize that both people are entitled to a life of Freedom the death toll from the fighting in Gaza has now pass 21,000 people most of them women and children according to the Hamas run Health authorities DW's Tanya Kramer joins me now from Jerusalem Tanya since the beginning of this war Israel has been telling gazans to move to the south of the strip suggesting they could find safety there but the South doesn't appear any safer than the rest of the territory well absolutely and we've been seeing this now the campaign of course Israel is striking across the Gaza Strip in the north and in the South and also a lot of people who might think of going back to the north they would not be able to find most likely their homes intact many people have been displaced multiple times according to the United Nations about an estimated 1 .9 million people out of the population of 2.2 million people have been several times now being displaced and Israel is intensifying its uh air strikes and ground operation in the South as well people have been called on to evacuate the center and the South mainly D Al balak and also Khan Yunis and the United Nations have said that in the past days another 100,000 people have arrived in rafar which is uh the most southern town in the Gaza a strip that's on the border uh with Egypt uh this place is already it's usually a small Border Town uh totally overcrowded humanitarian organizations have said they have difficulties in bringing in the age to people within Gaza basically Distributing it because of the intensified fighting and it also puts more pressure on Egypt now we understand Egypt has put out a new proposal for talks on uh a ceasefire as well as the release of hostages but it's unclear where this stands the situation also for the civilians now of course in Gaza with the cold winter weather is uh is more than dire what can you tell us about public opinion towards this war among Israelis do they still supported Tanya the way they did at the beginning well I think there is still a large support uh for uh the fight or the the war on Hamas there is you know in the mainstream here also in the media um this is the main support we are seeing there some other voices uh some smaller anti-war protests but they are not the main voices I think the main issue for many uh uh Israelis is to bring uh the uh Israeli hostages that remain in Gaza to bring them home they believe to be 129 hostages uh still uh in Gaza but there's also more criticism coming to the surface that has always been there against how uh the government is uh conducting this war how they conduct basically the uh hostage negotiations if there are any and especially this criticism is leveled at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu his popularity has plummeted uh but still the war is going on but some of the reent Paul said a lot of people a large majority of Israelis would like to see elections once this war is over but again the war is continuing and a lot of things can happen until this war ends T thank you very much that was our correspon Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem it's been nearly three months now since hamas's terrorist attack on Israel which killed more than 1100 people and sparked Israel's invasion of Gaza as the people of Gaza face a worsening humanitarian crisis what has Israel's military accomplished in this time and what still lies ahead DW's William glucoft explains Israel's military Chief of Staff said this week that his country's operation in Gaza will last many more months Israel's stated goal is to wipe out Hamas as an armed threat but many analysts and policy makers including in Israel doubt that is possible through military force alone the IDF has itself acknowledged the difficulty doing so but are carrying out the orders it's been given and let's have a quick look at what those orders are now since Israel first moved into Gaza with its Ground Forces at the end of October it's mostly focused on the northern part of the Gaza Strip cutting it off through the middle now there's still fighting going on there but Israeli forces seem satisfied enough with their level of control that they want to push into Central and Southern Gaza the biggest operation may become Han Yunis it's a major urban area now one possible Target could be yayat sinoa he's the leader of Hamas in Gaza whom Israel thinks is there his death or capture would be a symbolic Victory but will probably change little on the ground now as the IDF pushes deeper into Gaza more civilians will likely fall victim to Israeli attacks around 1 million people fled from the North to the South to avoid fighting that is what Israel instructed them to do with civilian deaths increasing by the day and Gaza sealed off from all sides people have few other places to go Israeli officials have said they will not go back to a pre- October 7th security situation and they floated this idea of a militarized buffer zone between Israel and Gaza they say that would prevent Hamas fighters from getting anywhere close to Israel proper ever again but that would also mean some kind of reoccupation of Palestinian territory on the ground which is something allies like the United States are against now Israel has plenty of Firepower for this fight but no guarantee that it can Crush Hamas or get its remaining roughly 130 hostages back alive no matter how long Israel's military operation lasts ultimately the question is a political one that Armed Force can't answer on its own finding a final status between Israel and the
