now the main UN agency set up to assist Palestinian refugees unra is facing a cash crisis unra has said it will run out of money in the coming days after major donor Nations suspended their funding the freeze came after Israel said that several unra workers were involved in the October 7 Terror attacks by Hamas now the agency's future is at stake leaving long-term humanitarian aid for Gaza in doubt a lifelong for gazin or hamas's partner in Terror this is a question dogging the un's Palestinian Aid agency and donor countries seem to have answered it for themselves by holding back funds that puts more than a million people at severe risk for decades the agency has been a primary source of food and medicine for gin unra was founded in 1949 to help Palestinians who fled or or were expelled from their homes when Israel was founded it originally had a 3-year mandate but has been renewed ever since since there has been no political solution to the conflict the agency's operations have been especially vital for gazin since Israel's 2007 blockade of the territory it also serves Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank Syria Lebanon and Jordan but many in Israel take a different View this is Jerusalem's Deputy Mayor calling get out get out at a small farri protest people this demonstration want the agency to leave the region entirely Israel has claimed that 12 unra workers helped plan the October 7 Terror attacks and that many agency workers are affiliated with Hamas or other Terror groups in Gaza prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says SE sees no future for the agency the Civil administration of Gaza won't be able to be carried out by those who support or fund Terror this means too that we will have to replace onra the UN has pushed back firing the 12 workers in question and saying they don't represent the agency that we are doing everything possible to make sure that un is an organization that not only is effective necessary but it is also able to defend itself against infiltrations that can put into question its neutrality a US intelligence assessment of Israel's claims said some of the accusations were credible though they could not be independently verified but also cast out on claims of wider links to militant groups it's unclear if the report will change the stance of donor countries or what could take unrra's place if Aid dries up it will be ordinary Gins who suffer let's get more on this now from Jonathan fer he's a spokesman for unra currently in Aman Jordan and joins us from there Jonathan uh unra says it's at Breaking Point as a result of major donors holding back payments its operations could be severely disrupted from March onwards what concrete effect will that have on the situation in Gaza well thank you very much for for having me on today um the immediate effects in Gaza of course uh I simply going to compound the nature of the the catastrophe that we're already seeing uh we're dealing with an aid operation for two million people in Gaza we're feeding 1.1 million people and we're Sheltering over 1 million so if you take the funding away from the aid operations in Gaza then that um is going to accelerate the nature of the humanitarian crisis we're already seeing risks of epidemics um we're seeing pockets of famine notably in the north which has been inaccessible for Aid operations since the end of January so that's the picture in Gaza now what's the agency doing to give assurances it's carrying out due diligence and has strengthened its oversight regarding neutrality first of all I want to stress um when we're talking about accusations against 12 members of staff and onra has has has been absolutely categorical in our condemnation of the 7th of October attacks on Israel um but 12 out of 30,000 people working in um for unra across the region that's 0.04% so that's one point uh we should not tarnish an entire agency uh based on on the accusations against um 12 uh individuals um but what we are doing and this was concretely stressed in the in in the previous report um was we have two things one is an independent investigation being run by the un's top investigative Authority that's the office of internal oversight Services um and then it's separate to that and in fact this was announced before these accusations against the 12 staff emerged we also have an independent review of unra going on um to verify the robustness of our um investigative and sanctioning procedures when there are breaches of neutrality because we always take allegations seriously as an agency and we always have done now some Israeli officials say that Palestinians see unra less as an aid provider but more as a a key validator of their Palestinian identity in a never- ending war against Israel uh what's your response to that well we've been in existence for 75 years but that's not on us um onor was created in response to a refugee crisis which was the Palestine Refugee crisis it was created by the United Nations in the very early days of the UN um the fact that we're still here all these years later is um basically symbolic of a of a political failure by the International Community to solve uh one of the most protracted Refugee crisis in in modern history um we are a humanitarian organization we're not a political organization um but it's not about validating um a cause we we are a humanitarian organization and I should stress also that there are un resolutions which um which do do underscore the fact that refugees Palestine refugees like any other refugees have a right to adjust and Lasting solution to their plight now the former unra Chief Matias schal says uh that cooperation with Hamas at a certain level uh was unavailable can you understand that it's hard for many people to accept that an aid agency might be working with an authority that represents a terror organization look the the the UN Works around the world in complex environments in some of those environments uh they may be under the control of de facto authorities or armed groups but the point is uh as humanitarian organizations we have to work with what we have um we don't have political contacts um with with Hamas as an organization but what kind of contct ground do you have then well practical in the sense of being able to to actually function on the ground um this is this is not just something that we that happens in Gaza this is something where any any un entity um any un Aid agency is in operation that could be anywhere around the world but it's to ensure that Aid actually gets to the people who need it um and we we are quite exceptional in that we do uh deal with the aid operations from a to zed so we have a direct delivery policy so there's not middlemen or anything like that involved so the the the Practical um aspects of this are very light touch in terms of contact Jonathan Fowler there spokesman for unra thank you very much thank you Matias schala is a senior un advisor based in Addis Ababa he's also a former director of unwa in Gaza welcome to DW so when is the organization projected to run out of money and what will that look like in my understanding we are a couple of weeks away so in the course of March from onra running out of money for Gaza itself this would have devastating consequences our colleagues on the ground are telling us that at least half a million people are facing severe um hunger famine and unra is by far the biggest agency that can help prevent that unra as you know is also working in four other places Syria Lebanon Jordan and the West Bank and if it runs out of money essential services like education schools and Primary Health Care would stop there too and it can be in no one's interest that children for example cannot go to school so help us understand where the organization then is financially has all financial aid stopped or are you just looking at a substantial I say just are you looking at a substantial reduction in income my understanding is that initial payments were made this year which have kept the organization going up to now and the major donors have said that they will wait with further payments until the allegations are clarified through the invest vestigation so again in my understanding indeed the situation is extremely critical and in the course of March if further payments are not made it may have to stop its essential services so given those Israeli allegations about a supposed Hamas infiltration of unua how does the organization uh satisfy donor countries their funds and Aid are not being misused well up to 7 October I think donors were convinced that we had robust management monitoring and disciplinary measures in place during my time in Gaza of almost four years I I sacked eight employees one of whom we were able to prove that he was an active member of of the alasan brigades of amas the others were other issues so I in my experience with the donors and I believe it's the same for my successors uh in Gaza and elsewhere was that Donas trusted our systems that we had put up to deal with attempts by Hamas to influence the organization and there are also Israeli accusations that Palestinians see unua less as an aid provider and more as a sort of reinforcement of the Palestinian uh struggle how would you respond to those claims well I I think there is indeed a Palestinian struggle which has little to do with UNS self the Palestinian struggle is one for self-determination and to get a state a country a place they can call home like you and I like Israelis themselves so unra was established with a time limit in fact it was 70 years plus ago set up for three years to provide services until the promised Palestinian state would be established and nothing has changed there unra is not a political organization to to find a just solution unra is providing Services until the United Nations the general assembly the member states find a solution that is accepted by all sides including the Palestinians and and since October 7 has happened we've seen repeated allegations uh from uh uh Israel that um things like uh petrol uh diesel um uh food goes missing that is provided by unua goes to Hamas now in your experience of having dealt with this does that happen and how do you go about rooting it out listen in in my time there was no deviation of Aid to M Hamas we had robust systems in place including systems that involved the Israelis we could bring nothing into Gaza uh through Israel that was not approved by them and that required detailed negotiation on whether for example the volume the amount of cement we were trying to bring in was the right amount to build a school and you know people could come ambassadors visited us including the German ambassador they could see for themselves that the aid provided was translated either into buildings like schools or health centers or into the payment of salaries for almost 9,000 teachers teaching in our at my time 278 schools so in my time and I believe it's been the same since there has been no deviation of Aid we have to of course understand right now there is a terrible war and unra has lost control over many of its installations because of the war the Israelis asked them to move to the south of the Gaza Strip so of course the robust monitoring systems are severely undermined in this situation of active conflict okay thank you for talking us through that so clearly Matias schala senior un advisor and former unor director in Gaza thank you again thank you well it's not just Palestinians in Gaza who fear being cut off if unra runs out of funds the agency also provides assistance in host countries like Lebanon which is home to more than a quarter of a million refugees our correspondent Muhammad chetra reports from [Music] Beirut this is what life looks like in the chatila refugee camp of beut it is one of 12 Palestine refugee camps across Lebanon they all depend on one organization to survive unwa NOA is 82 she suffers from hypertension and diabetes un's Clinic is the only Health Care Facility she can afford it has been providing her medicine for the past 12 years so the new of un's unprecedented cash crisis is troubling her how will I get the medicine death would be better for me I have no support but court another crucial service provided by unwa garbage collection the camp will sink in trash in less than 24 hours if unwa does not collect the garbage one official tells us good morning for children unoa schools offer options in an environment full of danger without unra schools our children will end up on the streets or in coffee shops probably armed they would use drugs especially since drug dealers are all over the place and it would be much easier to recruit these children off the streets the future of those cool children depends on un so does the health of those at the clinic it is not just that unoa also pays rent and provides Essentials like water and electricity it is effectively the state in places like this without the services that unoa currently provides a quarter million Palestinians across Lebanon would be utterly destitute and increasingly desperate I can't describe how people will react if unra stops there will be riots and violent protests it's not going to be easy unwa is struggling to keep keep a lid on feelings of frustration they're very very worried there's fear there's anxiety and it Fosters and deepens a sense of hopelessness that's already present so we're now starting to see refugees show up in our offices and yelling at our staff in in great frustration and and despair and uh threatening to to come back unwa has no mandate to secure Palestinian refugees return to what used to be their homes but most Palestinians refuse to separate its Service delivery from the right for return the two issues are deeply intertwined in the minds of the refugees dissolving unra would end the Palestinian cause and the right for return but also an end to all the social educational and medical services that it provides in crisis hit Lebanon and near the beginning of the month of Ramadan refugees needs for unwa services is more critical than
