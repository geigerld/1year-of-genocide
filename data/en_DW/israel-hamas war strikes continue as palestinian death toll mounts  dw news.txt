talks in Qatar around renewing the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have stalled Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered his negotiators to return home Hamas which has been designated a terrorist organization by multiple countries has told the media it will not release more hostages until all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel are released Israel stepping up air strikes on Southern Gaza where it told Palestinian civilians to flee to during the first phase of the war the truce is over and the bombardments have resumed despite international calls for a renewed ceasefire Israeli forces are pushing ahead with their mission to destroy Hamas Israel says these air strikes were targeted at Hamas underground infrastructure a command center and a military compound but the UN has warned of a catastrophic humanitarian situation ation in Gaza with hospitals once again struggling to cope a lasting ceasefire must be implemented the alternative is Unthinkable for people who are as a Palestinian said to me already living in a nightmare in action at its core is an approval of the killing of children but here we are the bomb started just a few seconds after the ceasefire according to gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry casualty among Palestinians have mounted since the end of the truce the UN health agency says less than half of gaza's hospitals are even partially functional and the bed capacity is just a fraction of what is needed around 80% of gazans are now displaced the UN says and at the moment there's no sign of the truce restarting our correspondent Rebecca rers joins us from Tel Aviv welcome Rebecca uh let's start with that with withrawal of Israeli negotiators from Qatar what's going on yeah well hopes uh that this truth this temporary ceasefire might be able to be resumed quickly were dashed when the Israeli Prime Minister's office actually withdrew the Mossa the Israeli intelligence agency negotiators who were in Doha to speak with Qatari and Egyptian officials and we know that Qatar and Egypt have played a very big role in the negotiations particularly with this latest a large the negotiations that they played a really big role that the Israeli Prime Minister's office did pull those Israeli negotiators back so those H hopes now dash but of course these talks have and down throughout uh the last eight or so weeks so there is of course still hope that they may be able to begin again but for the moment looks like a resumption of the ceasefire of the truth uh won't go ahead with the Israelis saying that Hamas didn't uh stand by the agreement that they didn't release all the women and children that they said they were going to of course that uh ceasefire uh came to an end rather abruptly both sides blaming the other for the end of that ceasefire but of course still hope remains and certainly where I'm standing here tonight pH hope remains among the remaining hostages well as all the people that have come out here uh for those people and the hostages still in Gaza that those talks will soon resume and and those people behind you Rebecca that that was a protest I understand uh demanding the release of more hostages is there much public pressure for another truce to allow more hostages to be freed well there's certainly a lot of public pressure to uh they for the for the rest the remaining hostages to be released that's exactly what the people hear behind me and there are many thousands of people here tonight Phil uh the main event is now coming to an end we're slowly starting to see people dissipate it's it was very uh it was a pretty big pretty big event this evening and people here really calling for those hostages to be released now whether or not they want another temporary truce or a temporary ceasefire really depends on who you speak to I certainly spoke to people tonight who said that you know war is not the answer that we call for a political solution to this situation that we want desperately these people to come home to be brought back to Israel but that the continuation of the the ground operation and the bombing uh isn't the way to go but that isn't the majority opinion I would say certainly more people I spoke to this evening and certainly uh what we see in media and we speak to people across the country there's a lot of support for both the ground operation and the bombardment uh of the Gaza Strip among Israelis uh I would say that the majority of people support the aims of completely uh demolishing Hamas that is what Israel is say that they're trying trying to achieve to make sure that Hamas is no longer uh an entity that is able to cause Terror or cause Havoc uh within Israel and that's certainly something that the majority of Israelis support and many of the people that I spoke to here tonight they say that in the beginning uh they were calling for a ceasefire that they wanted a ceasefire to allow uh of course for the hostages to come out and they didn't necessarily agree with a ground operation but that their opinions have changed that they said that the call for calls for ceas didn't produce any results what produced results and what produced the hostage releases was in fact the continued bombardment and the ground operation hey thanks for that Rebecca Rebecca rits in Tel Aviv the truth is over the fighting has already resumed and hope for many in Gaza is gone there's nothing left to fear our houses are gone our property is gone our money is gone sons have been martyred some died and some left disabled in the hospital what's left to cry for and then they tell us we'll get Aid where is it the war has seen entire Palestinian families wiped out many have been displaced multiple times like those in this makeshift camp near a hospital and conun they say no place is safe with Israeli bombs dropping everywhere so some are ignoring Israel's calls for them to move further south and they're staying put in the first shelling they told us to evacuate to the South because it's safe now they tell us to go further south this is nonsense we're not going anywhere we'll remain here and they can do whatever they please Israel says it has struck 400 Hamas Targets in 24 hours including what it says were a command center and military compound but it denies claims that there are no safe places to evacuate to in Gaza we've shared uh these areas with the international uh Community with the UN with other humanitarian organizations cuz we we urge that in those temporary safer zones that there be a maximum effort to supply to the people who have relocated there with uh uh uh food with shelter with medicine with u field hospitals and so forth the UN is warning of a catastrophic humanitarian situation without a ceasefire hospitals are again struggling to cope less than half are even partially functional but at the moment there is no sign of the truce restarting as Israel has pulled its negotiator out of the Qatar ceire talks so how are people in Gaza trying to keep safe I asked hajan Bela who's a journalist in Jordan who used to report from Gaza and is in touch with many on the Strip that's the big problem and the Bigg question for the Ordinary People in Gaza the civilians they were asked to evacuate east of un to the west or to the RAF city um some of the people in Gaza in jabalia or in shijia were asked to uh uh to um to move to other places in the city but U there were air strikes in different places like in kanun in East ofun and they were moved to the city of kanun in the west and today there were intense intense air strikes all the day in the west part of ofun in RAF there was um a lot of air strikes as well so people all all the time wondering where to go like just moments ago I was chatting with a friend who's from and he was asking me where should I go if there is a a safe place or less dangerous place that I should go I said like I don't know I mean you should I don't know if if there is a safe place and this is what the people asking about all the time and so what sort of warnings are people in Gaza getting from the Israeli military actually the Israeli military is using different platforms whether they are uh sharing these informations on social media platforms which is very limited access to the people because the internet is very limited in Gaza it's PE it's sorry it's poor uh uh network connection and limited people are able to access to the internet um other tool is like they are calling people with recorded messages sometimes it's not going through um some people hear it and they drop leaflets uh on different areas um but the people hear about it from here and there and a lot of rumors sometimes are spreading um there was a map was shared Yesterday by Israeli Army online I mean how defi the the the the the the areas of Gaza stb to different blocks or different um um uh zones um but it's not easy for the people to understand where to go or how to go that's journalist ha baloa speaking to me
