a truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza will start on Friday morning local time the first contingent of hostages will be released by Hamas later in the afternoon the Qatari foreign Ministry said the ceasefire will cover the North and the South of Gaza he also said humanitarian Aid would start flowing into Gaza as soon as the truce Begins the fighting is expected to stop at 7 in the morning and the first hostages are expected to be released from 400 p.m. onwards initially 13 people will be freed all of them women and children qatar's foreign Ministry spokesman outlined how the release of the hostages would proceed so the first uh release will be of 13 uh individuals of uh you know men and sorry women and uh and children uh some of them are elderly women some of them are women and others of course are are children as we stated uh they will be released at approximately 4 p.m. I must say as as you might expect it's not you know exact science to decide on the on the time itself it would have a lot of moving Parts on on the ground but approximately 4 P.M and uh that will be happening every day within a specific uh window of uh of time where the situation will be much safer for them to uh to move about uh they will be as I said handed over to the red uh cross and I won't get into the details of how they they are dealt with after that but the idea is to make the transfer as safe as possible for all uh parties we have and DW's Ben fulan in Tel Aviv told us more about the deal well this is huge news for the families gathered down here of what they've now called hostage Square just across uh from the military headquarters in central Tel Aviv uh we've heard that the ceasefire would begin at 7:00 a.m. local time uh then uh a number of hours later about 400 p.m there would be the release of 13 hostages uh Israel has made it clear until now that this would happen in batches um it was demanding at least 10 hostages at a time um and according to Palestinian sources today as well uh if that is adhered to we could see this extended to uh more hostages uh and could see up to anything like a 100 hostages released by the end of the month that's all speculation right now but we have finally got that concrete time of the ceasefire which would allow not only the removal of the hostages from Gaza but also humanitarian Aid into Gaza there are have been many sticking points with Hamas uh but it sounds like we do now have an agreement now um earlier uh there was speculation that 50 hostages would be released now the number dropped to 13 what was the local reaction there well basically as I said the idea is that it would be done in batches so so uh not all 50 all at the one time that was never uh agreed upon uh what was being looked at was at least 10 hostages at a time uh this is Major relief uh for the families who are now being told or will be told in the next hours uh who is being released exactly they haven't known until now but there is a list that has been done up according to K I have uh one of the family members here uh a brother of one of the hostages to talk to to to talk to about uh the situation it's a very very tricky situation uh Eli David your 23-year-old brother I believe is being held hostage at the moment could you tell us a bit about him yes of course he's a musician he plays the guitar he's very talented we like to play and sing together um that's our family activity um he works as a shift manager he's just a young man starting his life uh shift manager in a cafe you know just saving money for his future travels he were he he was supposed to uh fly to Thailand next week with his friends and right now he is being held down there and he will probably be held long time unfortunately Only Women and Children coming out at the moment um how much of that how much of a disappointment is that for you the feelings are uh mixed because on the one hand we are so happy to um this nightmare to end for some families and also the children there and the babies just tearing up my heart to think about them and my brother is stronger um so he could last longer there H although he is again he is a son of someone and he is a brother to someone and on the other hand um I also think that maybe there's there's hope we can uh bargain with the devil and I'm hope that H I'm hoping that it's really it really will work and we will have a proof that um people can be uh going out from there one of the sticking points with Hamas has been allowing in the red crescent to attend to the rest of the hostages was staying behind um that must also be causing Agony for you I guess you don't know what sort of uh condition your brothers in that's right I mean for 48 days we know nothing about him really nothing um Hamas wouldn't allowed anyone to get near the hostages and we as families demand that if the Red Cross is getting and um being given access to um to give a a a medical Aid um inside Gaza Street we demand uh to um to the hostages that they will be seen by them also so uh that there will be no double standard love to leave it there Eli thank you very much and all the best to you and your brother and your family thank you so much so uh families keep Gathering here tomorrow there'll be I'm sure an even bigger crowd when we hear about this ceasefire and the results of any Handover of hostages um on Saturday there's also expected to be a huge rally here some 50,000 Israelis here coming to demand all hostages be released Ben fulan there reporting from Tel Aviv thank you very much ben Gan Basin is a former hostage negotiator he played a prominent role in the release of Israeli soldier gilad shalet in 2011 after 5 years in Hamas captivity welcome back to DW gersan the question many are asking today is the delay in the hostage agreement is that necessarily a sign of a deeper problem or are delays to be expected in a situation like this it could be a sign of a deeper problem I'm hoping that it's just a matter of working out the final Logistics and getting it done there are so many moving Parts here that need to be aligned and agreed upon particularly when we're dealing with two parties that have zero trust between them and they don't communicate directly so we're relying on third parties like Qatar and Egypt to deal with all these minutia details that need to be agreed on so that the whole thing doesn't explode before it even takes place let's look into that a bit deeper as someone who has been involved in such negotiations help us to better understand the complexity of that situation as both negotiating parties as you say Israel and Hamas do not speak directly to each other right so what's been agreed on as we understand is that there will be a a truce a ceasing of fire for a period of four days during which time Israel will also give a window of six hours when it won't fly any drones above the Gaza Strip to enable Hamas to mobilize hostages that will be released probably in batches of 10 to 13 every day for 4 days with a total number of 50 Women and Children released at the same time Israel has prepared a list of 300 women and teenager prisoners in Israel who would be released on a on an equivalent of one Hostage to three prisoners be released the prisoners will only be released after hostages are turned over to the International Red Cross on the Egyptian side of the Gaza Egypt border they will verify identity check medical conditions and have them send to Israel will they be sent a to hospital this is very fragile and it could break down by a single shot of a soldier or Hamas fighter who returns to his home and sees it no longer there because it was bombed by Israel or Israelis who try to prevent gazin from traveling from the south of Gaza back to their homes in the North or even a crazy scenario that tomorrow Israel discovers the hiding place of the senior Hamas command and do they take the shot or don't they take the shot they probably would which would put an end to the steal but there might be also additional elements that we don't know about that are more substantial than dealing with Logistics that are trying to be resolved as we speak Gan if this First Agreement the terms of which you've just laid out for us if it's Su successfully implemented in the coming days does it get easier from here do you expect more hostages to be released more quickly in the future the hope is that this agreement would carry on before the four days Israel has said that it's willing to extend the truce for another day for each group of 10 hostages that would be released so it could go into day five 6 7 8 9 10 going on until all the civilian hostages are released my assessment is that Hamas is primarily interested in keeping the soldiers as hostages and not the civilians keeping babies and children and women and elderly people is a burden to them and requires a lot of logistical support on their side they'd much rather just have the soldiers and for Israel of course it's so essential to get these civilian hostages home Israel failed to protect them they were taken from their homes and their beds and the music festival and Israel has to bring them home and and remember every moment of the day the suffering of the families who are waiting for news about their Lov ones and what condition they're in and waiting for them to come home in terms of leadership how much extra strain does it bring to this situation gon that the Israeli government has committed itself to eliminating the military leadership of Hamas the very people we imagine with whom they're seeking to find a compromise here regarding hostages yeah there's no no doubt makes for a very difficult negotiation when you're negotiating with people that you intend to kill it makes it a very different difficult negotiation it's also been in the tradition of Israeli negotiations in these kind of situations very one-sided Israel doesn't take the initiative in making proposals and offering what it's willing to give it waits for the other side to make proposals and then it says yes or no in this case the the Israelis received the proposals and then asked President Biden to weigh heavily on the qataris to push the Hamas to make concessions but it's not a normal kind of negotiation where at least from Israel's point of view which which is very proactive Israel's responses are very reactive to the Hamas proposals and that also makes it very very unusual I mentioned your involvement in the gilat Shalit case more than a th000 Palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for the one Israeli soldier in 2011 is this an indication in any way of the concessions Israel will have to make to bring home all 240 hostages or can the two cases not be compared in this case I don't think we should compare the two cases I think that the lessons learned by the Israeli public and the Israeli me military with regard to that deal in 2011 is not to do it again um it should be noted that the only way to bring all the hostages home safely is through that kind of deal which would be an all forall deal all the hostages for all the prisoners in Israel there are some 7,200 Palestinian prisoners in Israel including 559 who were sitting on life sentences for murdering Israelis another 130 that were captured inside of Israel after they committed atrocious acts of terrorism on October 7th and some 300 plus Hamas fighters who have been captured by Israel since the beginning of the war um this is beyond imagination of what Israeli Society is willing to accept but I think that it is possible to bring all the civilian hostages home those who are defined by hamas's civilians of women and children and elderly and wounded and and and sick hostages the majority of them but Hamas will still be holding on to a sizable number of Israeli hostages who they Define as soldiers and those negotiations will be extraordinarily difficult former hostage negotiator Gan Basin great to get your Insight thank you thank
