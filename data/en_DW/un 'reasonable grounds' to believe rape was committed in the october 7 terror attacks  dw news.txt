a new report by the United Nations has established that there are quote reasonable grounds to believe that rape and gang rape occurred during the October 7th Terror attacks led by Hamas against Israel the UN Mission interviewed survivors and Witnesses of the attack and examined 50 hours of video footage and thousands of photographs to arrive at this conclusion the special representative on sexual violence and conflict said she and a team of expert experts had found clear and convincing information about rape and sexualized torture the report also said that some claims of rape could not be verified but there was convincing information that hostages taken from Israel were and might still be subjected to sexual violence during their captivity the UN Envoy let out her findings in more detail here's some more of what she said we also found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that conflict related ated sexual violence including rape and gang rape occurred during the 7th of October attacks in at least three locations namely the Nova Music Festival site and its surroundings Road 232 and kibuts and in most of these incidents victim were first subjected to rape and then killed and at least two incidents relate to the rape of women's corpses we regard to the hostages taken to Gaza which found clear and convincing information that sexual violence including rape sexualized torture cruel inum and degrading treatment has been committed against captives and we also have reasonable grounds to believe that such violence may still be ongoing against those still held in captivity I pause and must add at that I am of the strong opinion that this finding does not in any way legitimize f further violence but actually reinforces the need for emergencies let's bring in Christina Lamb she's a chief foreign correspondent for the Sunday Times and has spent much of her career covering the use of rape as a weapon she's the author of the book our bodies their Battlefield what war does to women welcome back to DW Christina now you yourself went to Israel in the aftermath of October 7th what do you make of the un's findings yeah well I mean the findings are really similar to what I found which is that there is a lot of as they said convincing information that uh there was sexual violence carried out on October the 7th um but I think they also found that it was very hard to find any actual survivors to speak to so there were witnesses there were people who had found been collecting the bodies of people that were killed and finding them in positions that suggested that they had been raped and fighting uh seman on the body things like that but there was it was um hard to find anybody who' actually uh being raped and survived and would speak about it yeah did you find that to be the biggest challenge when you went to cover the aftermath of October 7 yeah I mean as some having reported an awful lot on sexual violence and interviewed people um in many different countries about it I know that it's extremely difficult for people to speak about it and you know I know cases where it's taken 50 years for people to come forward and speak so the fact that people have not um come forward and spoken doesn't mean that there aren't survivors but of course there is the rather Grim possibility that everybody that happened to was either killed afterwards or was taken hostage you write in your book that rape is the most neglected War crime how big a factor do you think is the fact that it's so hard to document uh yeah it's hard document it's hard for people to come forward but the reason that it's the most neglected War crime is that unfortunately accountability is the exception not the rule it's really hard for people to get justice so there have been many cases in recent years where thousands of women have come forward such as the yides who were taken by Islamic State and kept as sex slaves TW uh 10 years ago um girls like the um chibok girls in Nigeria that were taken by Boku Haram but again that was just tip of the iceberg there were tens of thousands taken in northeastern Nigeria um the rohinga people in Burma or Myanmar that were taken from their Villages and um and raped by Burmese military or Buddhist militias um in all of those cases you know we have huge numbers of testimonies but not a single person had been brought to Justice in any of those cases ex set recently in Germany um for some of the Idis but it's a very small number but it is a start why do you think that is if so many women have come forward well I think there's a number of reasons I mean of course rape anyway is a crime where it is difficult to get Justice in my country United Kingdom only less than 2% of women that reported rape last year actually saw anybody charged so imagine in a country where you've got war going on or the perpetrators that are people running the country or running the area uh or or the people that it's happened to are refugees or displaced people and don't have resources so of course it's going to be much much harder but I think there's another reason which is that I every case I found that had been successfully prosecuted there had always been a female judge or a female uh prosecutor so that doesn't seem like coinci so I think we need to have far more women judges and I also believe that unfortunately when conflicts come to an end and and there are peace talks that this is often regarded as a side issue and so people will be brought to justice for killing and torture um but not for rape and I believe that that's partly because there's so few women in these peace talks and um but that you know is how it's been if you go back to nurenberg for example which people often hold up as you know the great example of international Justice um nothing was done about all all of the millions of women that were raped at the end of the second world war in Germany and Eastern Europe um you know there's no mention of it so it is something that traditionally has just been sidelined at the end of conflicts and that needs to change yeah the report also points at allegations of conflict related sexual violence against Palestinians after October 7th does that surprise you at all well I mean there have previously been reports in the Israeli jails um Palestinian women saying that they've been sexually assaulted so the this is again the same kind of report so unfortunately you know I mean it's very depressing but every conflict that I looked at in my book or have reported on um there seems to be sexual violence I mean obviously we also saw it again in Ukraine and it just one of the militias that I interviewed said to me you know it's the cheapest weapon it costs less than a Kalashnikov bullet and sadly if you want to humiliate your enemy or or terrorize them or take territory raping the women and girls is an effective way of doing that that was Christina Lamb Chief foreign correspondent for Britain Sunday
