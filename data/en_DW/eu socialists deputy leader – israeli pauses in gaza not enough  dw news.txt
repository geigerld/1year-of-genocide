Israel agreed yesterday to short combat pauses for Gaza is this uh is this the first step in the right direction yeah I would have to say so of course it's not enough uh we'll probably need much more I mean longer periods uh and then concrete conditions for the relief teams for the Emergency teams to go on the ground additional conditions even for the hospitals to operate um this conditions for this literally hundreds of thousands of refugees that are now within Gaza but but it's a step it's a step on the right direction it it it shows that International pressure from Europe from the US it's finally meaning something and it's finally giving us some result and anything that uh that creates some small relief on the so difficult situation of those Palestinians living in Gaz at this stage it's good to see but we really need more than that situation in in Gaza is getting worse and worse with every day so that is why your group is demanding a long-term ceasefire however how are you going to ensure that Hamas is also sticking with that that they are not continuing with their attacks on Israel there I mean um it's always a good question because when you are when when you are dealing with terrorists it's so complex because indeed the game is not even fair because one of the part one of the parts is immediately because they are a terrorist organization you you will immediately have kind of this risk that they will not accept any of these agreements that they will not abide by these agreements and certainly as it was obvious from the first Invasion to Israel Amash is not obviously concerned about international law or human lives because we could see what they did in Israel which was awful idious and has to be condemned but still we count on the influence on the work of the Arab countries they are key in the region and we hope that all together the International Community can also pressure uh put some pressure towards that side towards amas so that they also understand that if they don't respect these minimum conditions it's it's thousands and thousands of civilians in Palestine that are at risk we hope that they can also see that but uh on the situation in Gaza let me say that this is indeed a human drama that we are W witnessing the way hundreds of thousands of people are living in in now as refugees the the conditions in the in which the hospitals are still trying to provide some sort of relief the thousands of people sheltered in this unra in in facilities the tens of workers of unra that already died this this this International assistance workers that are perishing because they are trying to help the citizens that's why we really need um this humanitarian ceasefire this this longer ceas fire so that the civilians can be protected in the end it's it's about human lives we do need to protect these women and men that have nothing to do with the terrorist actions of Hamas Israel is saying that they are there in Gaza to to uh destroy Hamas at the same time some members of your group U have called out Israel for committing war crimes as they say do you share this opinion and if yes uh on what evidence is it based I'm sure there will be conditions and time to evaluate if indeed war crimes were also committed now in Gaza it's obvious that war crimes were committed by amas in Israel but when you see um the way our civilian infrastructures are attacked uh when you see civilians uh being subject to this to this situation uh there is a risk that some more crimes might have been committed already in Gaza I I'm I'm not I'm not not to judge that uh I would say inequiv but I think there will be time to evaluate that but at this stage more than saying if it's a war crime or not for me it's really the protection of the citizens the protection of human beings that's my biggest concern that's why we really ask Israel to refrain themsel in within the remit of the international law that's the most important it's not the word it's not you know it's the meaning of what is happening in Gaza to hundreds of thousands of people that's really Our concern but the left in Europe seems to be split over the Israel Hamas war with some uh socialists and Democrats condemning the terrorist attacks committed by Hamas in Israel and others refusing to call out Hamas as a terrorist group uh why is it so what's the problem here well uh I don't see that in my political family indeed I see that some political families I would say more to the left still have that kind of ambiguity which for me it's not acceptable what amage did is as I said absolutely idious it's not acceptable uh that you have any ambiguity towards what Amash did or towards that organization It Is by any means a terrorist organization that committed uh awful crimes towards israelian towards innocent victims in Israel so uh from our side as I said no reason for that kind of ambiguity you have to be absolutely INE equivocal on condemning Amash also even to have authority to request Respect by all the parts to the international humanitarian law if you are ambiguous towards amas then you suddenly I would say uh are not in the same conditions in the same place you want to be to condemn any other violation of the international law that should not be the case so indeed if there is any division is not on this political family the governing social Democrats in Germany they have made clear there are reing behind Israel Israel security and existence is a reason of State for Germany um are the German social Democrats in a very special position uh here and does the whole group understand their position well uh we have had in important debates uh I would say in all the European institutions we could see at the beginning that there were important divisions that we managed to overcome as a as a European Parliament even they the the biggest political families in the European Parliament we manag to unite around a clear statement towards this situation uh we had our debates internally but we also were United towards the resolution we managed to negotiate within the European Parliament and uh we always know that uh this situation this longstanding conflict between Israel and Palestine the longstanding incompletion of the two-state solution it's always something divisive across the Spectrum the political Spectrum as you know but uh we have been successful on debating the issues but finally come to a a joint conclusion a joint statement from all the parliament or most most of the parliament which I think it was a good sign it was a correct sign that we also I mean in a moment in which Europe was divided around the urul of underline statements and the differences with Mr borell or the council statements the parliament showed unity and we as a group even with our debates we have been able to to to show also that that stance of of of unity of coherence um there is suddenly absolutely no Divergence in my group regarding the need for for one side condemn absolutely what Amash did and from the other side to protect the civilians to protect the Palestinians the civilian ones that might be affected by this actions of Defense of Israel that's that's not an issue of division for us and now now as everyone is preoccupied with the war in the Middle East Ukraine is uh afraid that the Western attention could be um destructed and the Western support for Ukraine could be swayed away from Kiev um is that a big risk I would say that um the fight of the ukrainians it's really the fight for liberty in Europe um we should never forget that what happened in Ukraine was not just about the ukrainians it was an attempt from Putin to in a sense uh uh invade the European dream if you will and uh and the response by the ukrainians The Bravery of the ukrainians fighting for that European dream fighting in a sense for Europe was supported by us and I don't see any risk of us residing or diminishing our support to ukrainians there's a lot of there's a lot of conflicts in this world there's a lot of complexity in this world but Europe will I'm absolutely sure stand with the ukrainians and let us not forget that even in such complex weeks as we are still the European commission proposed the beginning the formal beginning of the negotiations for a session with Ukraine and mova and with Bosnia by the way which we salute which is also I think a sign to the ukrainians that we do not forget about them and we hope as a political family that then the council confirms this formal start of the negotiations with Ukraine with mova because indeed um there's so many people in this in that Eastern front of Europe that they are paying with the life the European dream so we have to pay respect to that prepare ourselves of course to host them but start these negotiations with them because they they deserve that hope from our side thank you very
