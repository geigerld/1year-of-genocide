now to Gaza where negotiations over a plan to end the war are scheduled to start in Qatar on Thursday the regions on edge as Israel awaits for retaliation from Iran after the killing of Hamas political leader Ismael hania in tan negotiators want to use a plan put together by the Biden administration at the end of May and endorsed by the UN Security Council this plan calls for a 6 we ceasefire in Gaza Hamas would release its remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners Israel would allow unlimited Aid deliveries and its forces would withdraw from the territory but Hamas says it is losing faith in the US as a mediator and will not attend the talks the top official in Qatar for the Palestinian militant group whose October 7 Terror attacks sparked the war said Hamas would still hear from negotiators we expect to be told by the mediators that Israel has accepted what is being offered and any meeting should be based on talking about implementation mechanisms and setting deadlines rather than negotiating something new otherwise Hamas finds no reason to participate Muhammad had left his family to pick up the birth certificates of his newborn twins now he's in a morg where his children's bodies lie alongside his wife's wrapped in plastic bags killed in an Israeli bombardment in central Gaza the Twins were just 4 days old I was away to get the birth certificates for the babies my wife gave birth the day before yesterday I didn't even have time to celebrate them she gave birth by cesarian section and she was still tired and couldn't walk re Abu haa is only 3 months old her face covered in cuts and bruises she's the only one of her family to survive an Israeli strike that hit her home on Monday the baby was breastfed by her mother we've been trying to feed her formula since this morning but she won't accept it because she's used to her mother's milk after 10 months of war in Gaza the strip's Hamas run health authority says almost 40,000 Palestinians have been killed leaving many grieving families and many children without their parents Israel says it's mil tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas that operates in dense residential areas they can't beat us on the battlefield but they think that they can beat us in PR terms it is Hamas that is responsible for any uh civilian casualties uh in uh Gaza uh they're not upset that there are civilian casualties they wish there were 10 times more because it's a key part of their strategy and as Israel increases the pressure on Hamas and its leadership in its response to the October 7th Terror attacks more Gans are likely to pay a heavy price many here will be watching and hoping that ceasefire talks slated for this week are not abandoned and that some kind of deal can be reached to offer them some respite in this Relentless War Israeli Peace activist and author Gerson Basin negotiated with with Hamas on the release of Israeli soldier at gillad shalet back in 2011 and welcome back to uh DW Gerson um we've been here many times before is there any reason to think a a breakthrough might happen this time the only reason to think that a breakthrough might happen is the joint letter that was issued by the three mediators President Biden president aisi from Egypt and the Amir from Qatar stani they seem more determined they made what can be read as an ultimatum and they said that they would put bridging proposals on the table in more than 10 months of War we haven't yet seen the mediators play such a proactive role the Israeli response is that the heads of the negotiating team are going to Doha that's the head of the mosad the head of the shinb the Israeli internal security and the representative of the Israeli Army and they spent most of the day today with prime minister nany going over their instructions perhaps their limitations um Hamas is not attending because Hamas and Israel don't sit together but the Hamas leadership is in Doha and they are communicating regularly with the Hamas leadership in Gaza and the Qatari and Egyptian mediators coordinate and speak to the Hamas leadership so this is an important negotiation and we'll see how forceful the mediators will be they all have carrots and sticks that they can bring to the table and from what we hear from them they are saying it's time for this war to end and it's time to bring the Israeli hostages home all right so just just to be clear this is the the fact that Hamas the Hamas team are not at the negotiations that's that's usual because they won't be in the same room but they are taking part they have never been together with the Israelis in the same room the talks are probably happening in Doha because the Hamas exiled leadership is in Doha and it's easy for the kataris to communicate with them they communicate with them on a regular basis as do the Egyptians so even tactically if Hamas said we're not participating in this round of negotiations they are they cannot not be participating because the qataris and the Egyptians will deliver to them whatever comes out of the room when they're sitting with the Israelis so as the world hold its breath waiting for Iran to retaliate against Israel for the killing of Ismael hania Iranian officials have said that Iran will attack Israel directly if Thursday's talks in Qatar don't reach an agreement what do you make of that threat well first of all there's an additional incentive right now on the table to reach an agreement if Iran is sincere about what they said that if there is a ceasefire agreement reached then they will not attack Israel that attack has the possibility of spilling over into a wider Regional War we don't know what the attack would be what would be hit and how many casualties there would be but if would be significant and severe catastrophic from an Israeli point of view there would be an Israeli response to it we have American and British warships surrounding uh this region in in the Mediterranean in the Red Sea in the Persian Arab Gulf U ready to take action if Israel is attacked we we really don't want this to spill over into a much wider conflict and therefore it's really important that these talks in do lead to a ceasefire there are some inaccuracies about the way that it was presented at the beginning of the show but it does really matter because I think that the mediators will put a new proposal on the table which should talk about a 4 to six we period that would end the war bringing Israeli withdrawal and returning the 115 Israeli hostages those who are alive and those who are not alive good talking to you thank you for talking us through that so clearly Israeli Peace activist and author gersan Baskin thank you
