now the UN Security Council has adopted a resolution calling for Urgent extended pauses in the Gaza Strip The Binding text calls for humanitarian policies in fighting and to allow Aid access but doesn't use the term ceasefire it also calls on Hamas and Israel to protect civilians especially children it's the first time the council has agreed on a resolution since the conflict began the security Council meanwhile the Israeli Army has released a video which it says provides evidence that Hamas was using the alifa hospital in Gaza as a command center complex Hamas denies the claims and the images have not been independently verified full military kit for one Hamas terrorist a live grenade ammunition fighting vest with Insignia boots and of course uniforms and last but not least standard AK-47 this footage says Israel is proof that Hamas was using alifa hospital as a command center both Hamas and the hospital's management denied the claims but now the Israel Defense Forces say they have evidence Israel's military claim the video shows caches of weapons and other equipment left behind by the militants have absolutely no business being inside a hospital these findings in the shifa hospital prove unequivocally that it was used for terrorism in complete violation of international law now Hamas has dismissed Israel's claims as quote lies and propaganda The Raid also Drew widespread International condemnation Israel's military incursion into alifa Hospital in Gaza City is totally unacceptable hospitals are not Battlegrounds with the humanitarian crisis in Gaza becoming ever more desperate the United Nations security Council adopted its first resolution on the conflict 12 of the 15 members backed the resolution calling for Urgent and extended humanitarian pauses Russia the United States and the United Kingdom abstained un Security Council resolutions are legally binding but with feelings running High all around the calls for pauses May well go unheard well for more we're joined Now by Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lana he's an Israeli military spokesperson in Tel Aviv thanks for being with us Colonel lenana tell us more about what the Israel Defense Forces found inside the alifa hospital we we saw the video uh does this what's shown there amount to what would be described as a command and control center good morning Terry in day 41 of our war against Hamas a war that Hamas chose to brutally Massacre 1,200 more than 1,200 Israelis and abduct 240 uh Israelis and foreign Nationals into Gaza we are fighting against a ruthless merciless terrorist organization that has no regard for Life Israeli or Palestinian and I say that precisely because of your question indeed we have found um Munitions weapons guns Communications materials in the shifa compound in one of the in one of the buildings uh we are still operating in the compound and we are just scratching the surface of their operations we understand a bulldozer uh was digging at the hospital overnight uh was that your equipment what what else are you looking for there exactly so we've been very very uh um forthcoming with our understanding of what Hamas has done to shifa whether it's overground around the grounds or beneath ground so while I won't go specifically what we're doing indeed we are searching in order to reveal to the world what Hamas has been doing has done to the hospital um they have had 16 years to prepare for this day they have extensively embedded their capabilities throughout the Gaza Strip we as we showed in the rantisi hospital where they had teror tunnels connecting from one place to another where they have uh utilized command control capabilities where they've hidden weapons cachets uh this is the terrorist organization this is the terrorist Army of Hamas this is the reason um not because of October 7th that we're at a war but we are at War to make to ensure that October 7th can never happen again Terry right now there are grave concerns as you know uh surrounding the patients and civilians that are Sheltering at that alifa hospital in Gaza City where where your troops are operating right now what can you tell us what more can you tell us about the humanitarian conditions there and uh efforts to relieve any suffering so we we obviously planned for this operation and in and in order to be prepared for it we included within the forces uh both medical medical uh professionals and also Arabic speakers in order to mitigate any uh problems in communication uh we have distinguished between the uh locations where we're conducting the operations and the civilians in order to keep them out of Harm's Way and continue their treatment whoever needs treatment to safeguard them um you know there was a lot of concern before the operation that you've also in do also reported about what will happen to the to the people in Theos in the hospital or in the hospital grounds the people of Gaza are not our enemy Hamas is our enemy and I would say to the fact that they used the hospital as uh and the hospital grounds as command control positions as a place for storing weapons it just goes to show that they're also the enemy of the people of Gaza I'm sure you're aware of the United Nations security Council resolution that was just passed it calls for Urgent and extended humanitarian pauses for Gaza will Israel be abiding by the resolution are you are your troops preparing for that so Terry I'm you I'm the military the military is deeply involved in the war fighting in destroying and dismantling Hamas which is which needs to be done because of their uh atrocities on October 7th but also in order to prevent that from happening ever again uh we'll leave the diplomacy to the diplomats of course as a professional military we will abide by whatever instructions we receive from government he of the Israel Defense Forces thank you very much good
