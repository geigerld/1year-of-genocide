Israel's Army has said it's carrying out significant strikes and has divided the Gaza Strip in two the military says it's planning to further expand air strikes with its troops having encircled Gaza City some people have been able to leave Northern Gaza but those who've made the journey to seek safety further south say it's very dangerous the Israeli Defense Forces have once again intensified operations in Northern Gaza they say they ATT targeting Hamas Fighters and infrastructure from the air sea and land Israel has repeatedly warned civilians to move South where it is supposed to be safer but a planned humanitarian Corridor did not materialize and those who do risk the journey say it's very dangerous we've been walking for 3 hours to get here I can't walk and my son has been pushing me all the way the situation is very difficult there's no bread no water nothing tanks in front of us and dead bodies it was very very scary especially for the kids the Israeli military has released what it says is evidence that Hamas is blocking roads to stop civilians leaving and using schools and hospitals as cover for its attacks this is part operation a ground operation that was conducted on the hospital then revealed a tunnel that was being used for Terror infrastructures in the Qatari hospital they launch rockets on Israel 75 M from an Hospital why they know precisely that if Israel will air strike a launch pad like that the hospital would be damaged as the attacks in the North intensify Israel now says it has split the Gaza Strip into two and despite increasing International cause for a ceasefire Israel says that won't happen until all the hostages held by Hamas are freed and until then those on the ground can only take shelter and hope to survive internet and phone services have been cut again in Gaza DWS Ben fulin in Jerusalem told us what that could mean they're the same reports we're getting Monica and when we hear those reports uh then it means a major bombardment is coming uh we had a statement released by the Israeli Defense Forces earlier saying that intense strikes were going to continue and sure enough as soon as we got this news that the internet and telephone lines were down the third blackout of its kind over the past month then sure enough there were reports coming from AFP the AFP news agency that an intense bombardment had begun that went on for about an hour Hamas also uh told journalists that the intense bombardments were centered around several hospitals an AFP uh person also confirming that the Israeli Army then going on to say that it had cut the Gaza Strip in two earlier uh we had been reporting that tanks had tightened their encircle of Gaza City also that there had been another day of Rocket attacks launched by Hamas towards Israel now uh cutting Gaza in two and uh presumably more bombardment uh what's this mean for the civilians in the Gaza Strip good question Monica it is a dire situation becoming even more dire uh if they're left in the dark so to speak when it comes to telecommunications they're not going to know where to to go uh these are really important times when it comes to uh using your mobile phone and being able to warn family members and tell others where strikes have hit uh some of these bombardments according to one journalist in the very south uh was so intense that they could hear them all the way to ruffa in the South uh the ruffer border crossing still cut off today uh the only Escape Route for juel Nationals and the most critically injured they've been intense diplomatic negotiations going on between Egypt Qatar and the us to try to reopen but unsuccessful and only a trickle of Aid coming in so really the humanitarian situation is just becoming unbearable for those one and a half million displaced people right now DW's Ben fulan in Jerusalem and there are mounting fears of an escalation and the conflict on Israel's border with Lebanon Lebanese officials say forc civilians including three children have been killed in an Israeli air strike near the southern town of anata the Israeli says uh it uh is examining the incident and that the strike was based on intelligence lebanon's Hezbollah militant group has responded by firing rockets at the northern Israeli town of Kira US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has been touring the Middle East to work on a solution for the conflict together with Arab states and also prevent the violence from spreading across the region he's made an unexpected stop in Iraq and warned there must be no repeat of recent attacks on US military bases there it was very important to send a very clear message to anyone who might seek to take advantage of the conflict in Gaza to threaten our Personnel uh here or anywhere else in the region don't do it uh I made very clear that the attacks the threats coming from militia that are aligned with Iran are totally unacceptable and we will take every necessary step to protect our people we're not looking for conflict with Iran we've made that very clear but we'll do what's necessary uh to uh to protect our our Personnel uh be they military or civilian our Washington correspondent Benjamin alvaris gruba told me why blinkin found the time to stop in Iraq Iraq is an important partner for the United States more than 2,500 American troops are deployed in the country they are task with advising their Iraqi counterparts in the fight against the Islamic State group and that's why his visit now and his words we just heard they condemning the attacks against us Personnel by Iranian backed militias are so significant secretary blinkin met with Iraq's prime minister Al Sudani in Bagdad the focus of the talks that lasted for a around an hour was the situation in Gaza and the risks of a further escalation in Israel's war with Hamas the office of the Iraqi prime minister reaffirmed the country's call for an a quote a ceasefire and opening the border crossings to prevent further suffering among civilians including women and children ahead of the stop in bdad Secretary blinken H talks in the occupied West Bank with Mahmud abas the president of the Palestinian Authority and there he spoke about violence against Palestinians and the West Bank and once again reiterated Washington's support for a two-state solution so a difficult balance that secretary blinkin is trying to achieve with these tools by committing on one side to the delivery of humanitarian assistance for Gaza but at the same time rejecting a ceasefire due to his concerns that the Hamas terrorist group might use that ceasefire to regroup and prepare further attacks on Israel right and uh secretary blinkin is expected to travel onto turkey what can we expect from his visit there there we can expect protests like the ones we saw earlier today when Turkish police fired teargas to disperse a prop Palestinian rally close to a military base that also houses US forces in the country the increasingly complicated relationship between turkey and Israel will make this visit of secretary blinkin quite difficult we had turkey recalling its ambassador to Israel for consultations president erdogan accusing Israel of committing war crimes and erogan recently also said that Hamas is not a terrorist organization but a Liberation group and after that speech Israel recalled its diplomats from Turkey so this complicated relationship will definitely make this visit by the Secretary of State even more difficult talking of difficulties and also protest you mentioned earlier how's the mood in the US while its top Diplomat is on a well- win trip through the Middle East so the discussions and the criticism on the role of the United States of the Biden Administration can be seen on the streets on on Washington here yesterday thousands of pro Palestinian protesters gathered close to the White House that's a place called Freedom Plaza to demand a ceasefire in an end to us8 to Israel but at the same time the White House is also alarmed and condemns the alarming rise in anti-semitic incidents at schools and on college campuses and that's something that the White House also stated on x Formerly Known is Twitter saying that there is no place for hate in America so thousands kilometers away of the conflict you can see that the discussions here in Washington DC also on the role that the US is playing here are growing DW's Benjamin Alvarez gruba in Washington DC Benjamin thank you so
