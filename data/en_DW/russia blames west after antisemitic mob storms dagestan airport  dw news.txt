Israel has called on Russia to protect its citizens and Jews after mob storm the main airport in Russia's dagistan region following the arrival of a plane from Israel as many as 20 people were injured in the riot at the facility in the city of mahakala at least 60 people were temporarily detained the airport has now reopened a huge crowd overwhelms the airport of makka voicing their support for Palestinians enchanting anti-semitic slogans videos posted on social media show how the mob broke through doors and barriers with staff members trying to deter them some made their way to the runway they were reportedly looking for Israeli citizens after a plane arrived from Israel authorities closed the airport and security forces were deployed at the site calm this issue cannot be resolved in this way we will talk with the relevant people and will continue to try to resolve the issue differently not with emotions not with rallies in an appropriate way after the incident in makach kala Israel called on Russia to protect its citizens for more on this our chief Russia correspondent Yuri retto joins us now he's in the lvan capital Ria where DW's been reporting from since being banned from Russia for our critical reporting uh Yuri what's the response been to the dramatic event we saw last night well for many what happened in dagistan Michael tonight came as a shock and that is of course uh not in dagistan itself but in dagistan I spoke to some people from dagistan who said very clearly that this Angry Crowd last night wasn't representative of the entire Republic but at the same time they said that certain anti-semitic Tendencies are nevertheless very clear in dagistan as well as as as everywhere in Russia nowadays so the result of last day night is 60 people were arrested 20 people were injured two of them very seriously and the investigative committee has launched an investigation and I think uh the reaction of the authorities will be very harsh in Russia uh because any form of protest has been suppressed from the start in Russia and the protesters now face up to 15 years in prison and as for the situation of the passengers uh from the plane from Israel they all seem to be safe according to the media makach kalala airport is reopened you mentioned it uh even though some shops uh uh there were looted at night however the flights to mahaj kalala were re indirected uh to other airports Yuri do we need any more context here do we need to understand anything more about the region yes dagistan is known for the peaceful coexistence of many cultures and different religions but as in many regions of the Caucasus Trends towards radicalization can be seen there as well because one thing is clear what happened yesterday at the airport inah kala wasn't the only anti-semitic act in the capital of cabardino balaria nalic the Jewish center that is currently being built was set on fire in dagistan itself and they before the airport was stormed a hotel was stormed where refugees from Israel was suspected in the end a note was hung at the entrance with the words there are no Jews here uh the reason for this aggression is clear um it's the general situation in the region poverty unemployment lack of prospects personal and social problems which all find an outlet in the street violence in addition the fact that protests are almost impossible in Russia only make people's anger even worse nevertheless Michael there there is no reason to fear that these anti-semitic protests will spread throughout Russia experts say 2third of Russians consider this conflict to be too far away and to want nothing to do with it only half a minute Yuri but I do want to ask you this violence came as a shock to Jews around the world particularly in Israel which has maintained close relations with Russia what response can we expect from the Kremlin while the kemin has already reacted Putin spokes span piskov called this outbreak of violence tried from outside he didn't specify by whom exactly he spoke only of a certain external interference in Russia's Internal Affairs the head of dagistan mikov became clear here in his opinion it was the ukrainians who run the telegram channel from which calls for violence were made this is also a very typical reaction in Russia to blame Ukraine and to point uh the finger firmly at the West you Shadow many many thanks as
