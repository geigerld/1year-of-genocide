the Israeli military says it has rescued another of the hostages taken in the October 7 terrorist attacks led by Hamas Israeli officials said kiad faran aladi a member of the country's Arab beduin minority had been freed following what they said was a complex rescue operation he's now recovering in hospital where his medical condition has been described as normal Hamas is thought to be still holding around 110 people though some are believed to be dead here's more from Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Daniel hagari several hours ago IDF and Chinet forces have rescued the hostage K fahan aladi in a special courageous and complex rescue operation 52-year-old resident of Rahat father of 11 fahan has arrived in Saka Medical Center and his condition is good and there he met his family journalist balik sladin joins us from Tel Aviv welcome back balik and what more can you add to that yes uh so apparently uh there is a lot of speculation about how faran aladi was rescued and uh there is also a lot of military censorship on these um details but what we can talk right now about is that he was found in a tunnel uh alone when we say in a tunnel alone first of all this is the first operation where the Israeli forces are able to rescue a captive or hostage in a tunnel uh because all three previous rescue operations uh they have rescued the uh hostages from above the ground which means they inside um houses or military compounds and not actually in a tunnel so he is the first one to be rescued from a tunnel second he was found alone now when we say found alone so either his captives has left ran away because of the advancements of the Israeli troops or maybe they were killed in previous operations and that's why he was there alone also another possibility that he just ran away from them now uh some Palestinian media Outlets are talking about that Hamas freed him because he is an Arab but it's uh very uh questionable because after all they had 10 months or 11 months actually since he was a captive to find out that he's an Arab and to free him uh this is happening right now and this is a rescue operation what's being said about his condition well um the Soko Hospital in Bersa in the South said that he is his his condition excuse me in general is fine his relatives are saying that he lost weight and that is also to be expained when we look at his photos before October 7th and right now so he lost a lot of weight actually but in general they are saying that he is okay he landed there he is being of course um treated right now and his first questions were about his family presumably this news has been met with um Jubilation yes it is definitely that's only one hand let's say because on one hand yes lots of Joy lots of people are shreding tears today of course his family uh even some lifeguards on the beaches are using their megaphones to announce these um announcements and people there are cheering out of joy and we can see that but on the other hand it says also that 108 other hostages are still in captivity in hamas's captivity in Gaza and uh people are worried about their conditions and their safety of course and that's why that is a reminder today that there are still people there held uh in Gaza and they should be freed at some point or another either by a rescue operation as we've seen today but more safely in a deal thank you for that bag balag sadine
