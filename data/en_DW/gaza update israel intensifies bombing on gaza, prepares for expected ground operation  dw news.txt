an estimated 1.4 million people have been displaced in Gaza which has been under intense bombardment from Israel after Hamas launched a terrorist attack Israeli air strikes hit a house in central Gaza Strip Sunday afternoon Reports say at least six people were killed the injured are rush to the hospital as neighbors and Medics duck to find survivors in Rafa in southern Gaza many homes were also hit by Israeli strikes 10 houses were destroyed with children between 2 and 5 years old were they Fighters if they're looking for Fighters they're on the borders not in safe zones Israel has stepped up its bombardment of Gaza saying its hitting targets connected to Hamas terrorists and other militant groups to the residents of Gaza City and north of Gaza City you see that we intensified our attacks and we will continue acting like that so move South a request many have heated but even the South isn't safe from Israeli strikes the UN says over 60% of gaza's population has been displaced and many are taking refuge in camps like these lacking basic facilities civilians face widespread shortages of clean water fuel medicines and food in the southern city of Khan yunes people have to wait for hours to buy [Applause] bread we've been here at the bakery's door since Dawn only God knows our suffering if the situation continues the same way for two or three more days it will be a catastrophe in the Gaza Strip children are starving we ask all countries and Nations to look at us with some Humanity drug getting basic supplies have finally reached Gaza from Egypt but the eight Falls far short of what is needed the most urgent needs at the moment are fuel water food and Medicine why fuel because fuel is used to produce water in Gaza there is no drinking water in Gaza and fuel is used to run the salination plans so it's very very very important and so far no fuel has been allowed into Gaza and without more urgently needed supplies the humanitarian crisis can only get worse and for more on that agreement to let more Aid into Gaza I spoke to DW's Tanya Kramer in the Israeli city of ashod near [Music] Gaza well I mean it has been trickling in now on Saturday in sundon but uh as we heard in the report it's far from being enough to cover the needs of the 2.2 million people living in Gaza the civilian population so we understand that there has been another phone call between US President Joe Biden and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the readout it says that they agreed to allow the continuous flow of humanitarian Aid into Gaza it's not specified how much that would be how often that would be and what it would be there's still a disp about fuel as well because that is needed of course hospitals are saying they're running out to operate their generators both also of course generators are needed uh to operate water pumps Etc so uh this is very much needed um so that has not been coming in because uh for almost two weeks we're now going into the third week of this War uh all the border crossings had been uh closed we also understand there's significant opposition in Israel by some of the groups from the far right we've heard that they don't want any humanitarian Aid going in as well from some of the families of the hostages that say there should be no humanitarian Aid going in if there are no hostages being released and indeed this is all taking place across the backdrop of Israel's military increasing its strikes on Gaza um what has the defense Ministry been saying about the next phase of the war well Army officials here have been saying that they intensify uh the already very massive uh campaign of air strikes uh on Gaza and we've seen this also uh from Sunday onwards um we are still waiting everybody is still waiting for the ground uh offensive uh to happen that troops go in there has been an incident on Sunday where apparently some Israeli soldiers went inside Gaza uh one uh uh Soldier was killed uh the isra the Hamas militant Hamas group military Wing the kasan Brigade said that Ambush them uh so this is uh certainly of concern to the Israeli army they have also been called to people in the north of Gaza again those who have been staying there to leave and go to the South this is very controversial obviously because people are saying you know whether we go to the South or we staying in our homes we don't want to be displaced because there also have been massive air strikes in the south on runis on Rafa on other places so it's not safe to go there this is what people there are saying and we also heard from the defense minister YF galland he said you know a ground Invasion could could last for one two or three months but the end goal would be that Hamas there's an end to Hamas but of course nobody talks about the political implications what will Gaza look like what it means uh on the political terms now on Sunday uh Netanyahu visited troops stationed near the border with Lebanon can you tell us a little bit about what the situation is like there well also there the situation has been seeing more crossb fire uh between uh the lianes shared militant group Hezbollah but also other militant Palestinian groups there you know anti-tank fire missiles and Israel has also been responding to that so there is a lot of concern uh that there might be another front opening uh there at the moment it seems to be kind of contained if you can say that but uh the the uh crossb fire has been intensifying uh there as well and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now issued again yesterday a Stern warning tobah that it would be a mistake if they would seek to enter War but of course military correspondents here also saying no there could be a miscalculation this is intensifying over the past days and something could happen out of there Israel could also opt to have a preemptive strike so we don't know what the strategy is there but we also understand that again Israel has called on more community unities in the sou in the North of Israel to evacuate towards the center uh of the of the country Tanya thank you so much for reporting that is Tanya Kramer for us there and we're now joined by Israeli military spokesperson Peter leoner welcome back to DW we understand the IDF has intensified its air strikes on Gaza can you tell me how many targets you have hit in the past 24 hours and how that compares to previous days give us a sense of the scale here yeah I'd like just to be a bit more accurate are we are intens intensifying our attacks on Hamas the terrorist organization that launched war against Israel on the 7th of October indeed we are conducting hundreds of strikes every day against the infrastructure that they have positioned pre-positioned and embedded within the civilian Arena putting at the the entire population of Gaza at risk We are continuing to call to the people of Gaza and specifically the northern Gaza strip to evacuate towards the south in order to try and keep them out of Harm's Way while we root out Hamas so in these uh strikes that the Israeli Army has been carrying out over the past two weeks what impact have they had on hamas's capabilities indeed we see uh Hamas in a state of disarray we see them in a situation where they have no idea what what is going on U mostly because they are hiding they are cowards they are hiding and they are trying to sacrifice the people of Gaza we are destroying the command and control positions we are killing their terrorist leaders from and and targeting the leaders who perpetrated planned and executed the attack of 7th of October um and that is it is showing itself and we are seeing a decline in their ability to launch rockets against us and indeed we have a full intention to destroy hamas's capability and making sure they can never ever use the Gaza as a staging ground for attacks against Israel and the people of Israel again now the Palestinian Health Ministry says at least 4,600 people are dead uh three times as many wounded how many of these were Hamas militants um hamas's propaganda Ministry of Health says that U we need to be very very cautious at accepting I would say even relying on any sources coming out of Gaza specific spefically hamas's Ministries um so I won't suggest that there is any reason to actually comment on what Hamas is saying indeed we are conducting strikes number for us I no I would not even comment on that number I would say there is a reality on the ground in Gaza where Hamas has prepositioned its capabilities within the civilian Arena when they put uh explosive uh drones on the roofs of housetops they are jeopardizing that those housetops we are operating within the realm of the laws of armed conflict we are calling for people to evacuate areas to get them out of Harm's Way as a temporary me measure and Hamas is trying to keep them In Harm's Way and sacrifice them okay so while you weigh on and AC accept for face value what Hamas is telling you because of these numbers we need to be very very cautious because this is an organization that has no problem in butchering babies in their bedrooms so why would they have a problem in lying to the world media okay we'll leave it there thank you Peter Lerner from the IDF good
