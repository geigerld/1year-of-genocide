now Israel's Army is warning gazans to evacuate the alifa hospital as it carries out an operation there the Hamas run Palestinian health authority says several people have been killed and part of the complex is on fire Israel released these images of the raid the Army claims Hamas militants fired at them from the hospital and that Hamas is using alifa as a command center it's the biggest and one of the last remaining health facilities in the strip gazans have sought shelter from the war at alifa after the Hamas L October the 7th Terror attacks let's get more now from DW's Tanya Kima who's in Jerusalem uh Tanya can you give us the latest on this uh this operation military operation at the alifa hospital in Gaza well from what we understand here we of course not on the ground is that the uh military operation is still uh ongoing um this is as you said in alifa hospital which is in the center of Gaza City it's uh another raid on this hospital and we understand that also from eyewitnesses accounts uh that there's also fighting going on in the vicinity uh to the hospital and that people in the neighborhood but also those Sheltering uh in the hospital uh on the hospital grounds uh have been asked to uh evacuate and as you said the Israeli Army started this raid early in the morning uh saying that uh they have intelligence that senior Hamas uh terrorists the as they put it uh were uh inside the hospitals there were shots fired at the troops operating uh there uh and uh that basically um many arrests have been uh also made until now now this is the uh another time that this hospital has been raided the first time was in November um and of course people have sought shelter in hospitals such as the shiffer hospital as uh hospitals are seen as protector space according to international law and and the people who are Sheltering there I mean is there any way for them to get out well there are a bit of conflicting reports what we are hearing I mean on the one hand there's a statement that came out early in the morning by the Army saying they had cautioned uh the troops operating there not to harm or to avoid any harm to the medical staff to patients that are inside the hospital but we are also hearing from eyewitnesses there that leaflets had been dropped in the area in the neighborhood uh of remal and also to those Sheltering on the hospital grounds that they should leave and evacuate uh to Southern uh Gaza to the area um of marasi that is uh on the coast in uh near rafar so of course it's a bit difficult now to understand how this evacuation of people uh will work is there a safe corridor also we have to understand these people have been there it's a very difficult area Northern Gaza we've been talking about it um supplies have not reach the area very frequently so people would have to see how they would get transport so all of this uh is still to see uh how this will unfold but it's certainly devastating for those people who have stayed in the neighborhood now to be told to evacuate uh once again Tanya came reporting from Jerusalem Tanya thank you so much German Chancellor Olaf Schultz has shared his concerns about the high number of Civilian casualties in Gaza in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister benami Netanyahu morid is now entering the Gaza Strip where conditions remain extremely dire air drops into Gaza continue Jordan Germany and the US dropped Goods in an attempt to relieve the humanitarian situation on the ground there are growing fears that Israel will soon extend its ground offensive to Rafa where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought Refuge eight agencies warn that parts of Gaza already face famine meanwhile after a visit to Jordan German Chancellor Ola Schulz arrived in Israel there he once more stressed Germany's support for Israel while urging to keep civilians in Gaza safe from the lum ground [Music] offensive we cannot stand by and watch Palestinians risk starvation that's not us that is not what we stand for together much more humanitarian Aid is needed continuously reliably I shared my concerns with the Prime Minister that provision of aid from Israel into Gaza and the conditions for distribution must be urgently and massively improved earlier on Sunday is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu doubled down that the ground offensive will soon be extended to Rafa our goal in eliminating the remaining uh terrorist battalions in Rafa goes hand inand with enabling the the civilian population to leave Raa it's not something that we will do while keeping the population locked in place in fact we'll do the very opposite we'll enable them to leave because our consideration for for reducing and minimizing civilian casualties has guided us and will continue to guide us in the future thank you very much thank you it's estimated that 1.5 million people are currently in Rafa which is more than half of gaza's population but Netanyahu and Schultz didn't specify where all these people should go before Israel's ground offensive expands into the overcrowded
