US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has returned to Israel to consult with officials over the conflict with Hamas he's arrived in Tel Aviv for his second visit in less than a week he's scheduled to meet Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as president Isaac Herzog along with their War cabinet Lincoln has been visiting leaders in several other countries in the region in recent days as well including Jordan Saudi Arabia and Egypt I'm very pleased pleas to welcome former US ambassador Gerald firestein he's uh focused heavily on counterterrorism in his work in the region and he's now with the Middle East Institute thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us we now have uh blinkin back in Israel in your view what needs to happen on the Diplomatic front to end this war well it's a pleasure to be with you uh uh today and uh I think that there are a couple of things going on one of course um as your reporter mentioned is uh concerned about the potential expansion of the of the conflict and so uh I think that secretary blinkin as well as others uh in the administration are working very hard uh to uh to deter uh any uh any thought on the part of hisbah or Iran uh that they should jump into this conflict uh and then the other thing is and clearly uh in his travels throughout the region uh secretary blinkin has heard a great deal of concern about the humanitarian situation inside of Gaza and and I think that the other aspect of the uh of the US approach is going to be to ensure uh that the humanitarian uh situation is addressed uh to try to get relief supplies into Gaza uh and also of course to uh pressure the the Israelis uh not to uh go in in a way that inflicts huge numbers of innocent Palestinian casual do you think we are seeing that kind of uh pressure what exactly do you think they will be telling their Israeli counterparts regarding the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza well we've seen uh we've seen uh some uh some result of of us intervention uh you know the announcement by the Israelis that they were restoring water to the southern Gaza area um and also of course the uh the intense uh diplomatic engagement with both the Israeli and the Egyptians uh to try to get relief supplies in so uh and and the other uh the other aspect of course is to pressure the Israelis as we've seen some result uh that whatever they do in the Gaza Strip must be in accordance with the internationally recognized laws of war now I also want to get your view here um Israel has made very clear that their goal is to eliminate Hamas what kind of challenges do you think they will be facing uh in routing a terrorist group from the Gaza Strip well I think that you know to to be entirely uh Frank about this uh one doesn't eliminate terrorist groups uh we of course in 2001 said that we were going to eliminate Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda is still there we've said that we're going to eliminate Isis Isis is still there uh these kinds of organizations don't get eliminated uh there is no military solution to this uh to this situation uh and of course the more that the Israelis are responsible for uh you know for indiscriminate uh military action uh the more deeply embedded these organizations become uh within the population so it's a it's it's a situation where the harder you try often the the worse the outcome but tell us more about that Israel is saying it is going into to Target hamas's leaders um even with the military might of the IDF you don't think that they would be POS it would be possible for for them to go in with enough Force um to stop Hamas from launching attacks from there uh over the long term no I I don't uh I don't believe that that you can succeed militarily in accomplishing that kind of an objective they can certainly um identify and Target uh Hamas leaders uh they've announced that they've killed at least one senior Hamas Commander uh they can do that uh but these uh these organizations reproduce themselves they they they fill uh they fill these positions others come along and and really the only solution to this situation is really a political solution uh and the Israelis need to be careful that as they go forward and and respond to this disaster in Israel uh this tragedy uh that they uh leave room within the Palestinian the larger Palestinian Community not Hamas but with Palestinians that they leave space to resume a diplomatic political negotiation that will hopefully lead to a permanent sustainable peace and looking also at the role of other actors in the region when you are um looking at a possible political solution where do you see a peaceful Horizon as as you have put it well I I think you know of course uh the uh the Abraham Accords countries UAE Bahrain Morocco have a potential role to play uh Egypt and and Jordan also uh and uh you know up until last week uh it was really the uh the Saudi dialogue with Israel which included a large component of measures that were aimed at improving the lives of Palestinians uh and I think that that that that perhaps was one of the motivations for Hamas was to untrack that uh that dialogue because they feared uh that a political solution that strengthened the Palestinian Authority would weaken them over the long term well thank you so much I'm afraid that's all we have time for Ambassador firin we really appreciate you taking the time to speak with us on DW news thank
