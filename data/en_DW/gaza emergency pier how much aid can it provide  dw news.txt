I'm CLA Richardson welcome the United Nations has issued a stark warning about the plight of Palestinian civilians trapped by the war in Gaza as Israeli military forces conduct operations into the southern city of Rafa the UN says Aid operations could grind to a halt in just days vital border crossings remain shut hospitals are having to close and air drops along the Gaza Strip have only brought limited relief another attempt is underway to bring flies across the Mediterranean a US container ship carrying Aid left Cyprus on Thursday in the hopes of getting much needed relief to Gins I'd like to bring in Sam rose with the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees unra he's joining us today from Rafa Sam the UN warning Aid is grinding to a halt can you give us a sense of of what the consequences of that will be in these next crucial days absolutely no we are we're we're running on empty essentially the borders closed to supplies the borders closed to fuel and this will have really serious impacts on the population of Rafer and the population of of the rest of Gaza we've got over a million people still in RAF and two million people south of w Gaza half of those people are children and they're already you know suffering and enduring catastrophic conditions in relation to food security Access to Health Care Water Sanitation and shelter so if those supplies grind to a hulks indeed they they do and and and people are on the move and suffering the impacts of another bombardment another operation we dread to think what what the conditions will be here now tell us a little bit about these evacuations from Rafa could you paint a picture for us of how how difficult it is for people you over a million people who've already been displaced and then tens of thousand of them to get up and move again to another part of the Gaza Strip yeah the situation is incredibly difficult for for these people we were estimating as as the UN last night that around 110,000 people had evacuated outside my office I I I've I've watched more and more people leaving today packing up their things that their their belongings what what little that they have into donkey carts bicycles pickup trucks and just fleeing for for safety so the people who are evacuating are those inside the evacuation Zone and those Beyond it because the bombardments and the air strikes have gone far beyond that declared evacuation Zone and people are on the move it's it's orderly where I am but other parts of G of Rafa it's quite chaotic it always is with this many people on on the move it's a very desperate situation right now and what kind kind of considerations are these people making as they as they take this difficult decision on the one hand Israel urging them to leave on the other hand facing these difficults uh difficulties in doing so what's going through their heads they face an impossible dilemma many people many of our staff unrest staff many working from Gaza they've been displaced five 10 times already so they're they're faced with this impossible dilemma they've been through it before whether in car Unice Gaza City or elsewhere so either either they wait uh or or or or or they go now hope either they wait and hope that nothing happens or or or they go now and if they wait the conditions could be worse when they go because the opportunities to move when they want to with they with what they they want to bring will be will be ever ever more difficult but it's also conditioned by where they are going they're being pushed out into sand Junes very difficult to provide services every very squalid overcrowded conditions or else they're being ushered back or or or into into canun which is a city that's sustained Savage bombardment has essentially been raised to the ground so either sand dunes or the ruins of bombed out buildings and in both those places very difficult for any Aid agencies to reach them and of course made more difficult night Impossible by the fact that no materials and no fuel are coming in right now now Sam rose with unra thank you very much for speaking with us on DW news thank you Israel's primee Minister binyamin Netanyahu says Israel will stand alone if the US halts armed shipments because of Israel's Rafa offensive President Joe Biden says he will pause offensive military assistance if Israel goes through with a major operation in Rafa more than 1 million civilians are Sheltering in the southern gazan city nanahu says Israel must defeat Hamas which is designated as a terror organization by the EU and the us including in Rafa we are determined and we are united to defeat our enemies and those who seek our souls if we have to stand alone we will stand alone I have said it before if we have to we will fight tooth and nail DW correspondent Tanya kma is following developments for us in Jerusalem t how intense are attacks on Rafa getting well in the past 24 hours there have been reports of uh air bombardments and intense shelling in across the Gaza Strip in Gaza City uh in some of the neighborhoods but also in central Gaza but again also very intensive in the Eastern areas but also in other areas in uh rafar uh also with reports that uh tubes and the tangs have been amassing in the past days across the the Border fence there in the South now of course the situation is very fluid and tens of thousands of people are actually on the move they have been uh told or ordered by the Israeli military in those Eastern parts of rafar to uh go or to evacuate to other areas towards the western side of the Gaza Strip now the United Nations uh uh agencies there they're estimating that over 80,000 people are have been heed that call but others put the number much higher and people are still leaving also those we've been talking to some of them on the phone uh saying you know even those in the areas that have not been asked to uh uh leave the area because they're fearing that this could expand also uh into you know other areas uh of rafar and now these are of course people we heard it in the report that have been displaced time and time again and they have the choice to either go you know further back up north to Han Yunis where a lot of the city is in wounds and in rubble and or to go to an area in alari that is on the western shore side that's a Sandy area and eight organizations have said you know there's not enough infrastructure it's a very difficult uh area for people being there they have to be in a tent it's another also very hot day uh uh today here in the region now and of course the south is the area where most of the eight organ organizations have been uh working and it becomes increasingly uh difficult for them so it is a situation uh that gets more dire by the day but Tanya doesn't a full Israeli offensive in Rafa put true stalks on the line well from what we understand now both delegations the Israeli uh and the Hamas delegation but also the American mediator they have all left Cairo now in the Egyptian foreign Ministry has put out a statement basically calling on the two sides that they should they have to show more flexibility uh to come uh to uh a deal or an agreement that would see a temporary ceasefire and the release of those remaining or at least some some of the remaining uh hostages uh uh in Gaza now um there seem to be major disagreements still from what we understand on the main points what Hamas wants a permanent end to uh the war and a permanent withdrawal of Israeli forces there's also you know not clear how many of the hostages that Hamas would be able to release are still alive but uh you know we are also hearing time and time again that uh the Israeli government has said they want to go into rafar whether there's a deal or not and that is of great concern especially here in Israel to the hostage families of those 128 hostages that are still being held in Gaza leave there for the time being T crer in Jerusalem thanks very much
