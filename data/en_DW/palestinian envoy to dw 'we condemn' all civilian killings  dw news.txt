Ambassador last week in the German Parliament the bundestag chancellor Schultz uh criticized the president of the Palestinian Authority Mahmud abas for not having reacted to what was taking place in Gaza and in Israel at the time uh saying that he thought it was a shameful way of reacting or not reacting why did it take so long do you think for a reaction to come from president us well first thank you very much for having me and I think that uh no one took any time to express uh our position Vis A the events that have been unfolding uh in the last uh nine days or the events that have been unfolding uh the last 75 years let me be very clear we've been uh condemning violence for 75 years we've been condemning uh terrorism for 75 years we've been calling on the International Community to intervene to implement international law to uphold the human rights for 75 years we've signed a historic peace agreement a peace agreement that was signed by his Excellency president abas himself uh that promised a better future for all the children and peoples of the region we remained committed to that agreement we remained committed to the agreements that ensued we remain committed to international law and to humanitarian law and to Human Rights and we remain committed to these agreements as we speak despite the fact that every single agreement every single provision in those agreements were violated by Israel had those agreements been honored had those agreements been respected had the International Community intervened to bring Israel to commit to those agreements we would have been in a different place today so I I I I would respectfully disagree uh with the assumption that we took our time to express our opinion I think that uh you took your time in hearing us out so you are saying you said you condemn terrorism uh does that include these attacks of hamus do you condemn them as terrorism on Israel I've told you where we stand we condemn civil the killings of civilians everywhere we reject the killings and targeting of civilians everywhere irrespective of nationality race or religion we call for the immediate release of hostages uh prisoners detainees on both sides we wish to see an immediate end to the ongoing aggression that has so far claimed the lives of thousands of innocent people we wish to see the current trajectory the of which only portends the death and murder of thousands more we wish to see an end to the current trajectory and that trajectory is not going to end without a meaningful serious intervention by the International Community what kind of intervention are you talking about to bring Israel to end the aggression what is happening today in Gaza as you see is an unbridled aggression that is targeting the most innocent the people that had no hand or decision in the conflict that has started not 9 days ago but has been ongoing for 75 years that have been paying the price for this inhumane conflict the continuation of which is untenable does not make sense is in breach of every international law of every humanitarian principle of every morality every fact every principle of decency the Israel and also Germany the United States have said this aggression has been started by that attack of Hamas on Israel otherwise there wouldn't be this conflict going on at the moment I think I think the conflict has been ongoing for 75 years I think the occupation the illegal occupation of Palestine has been ongoing for many decades I think that the peace agreements that we sign mind promised an end to the conflict 24 years ago they have been breached this conflict it's important as ugly as the events that we're all witnessing are it is important not to lose sight of the fact that this conflict did not start eight or nine days ago this conflict has been ongoing for decades we've seen we've seen in the last 10 years alone at least four uh assaults on the Gaza Strip military assaults that have claimed the lives of thousands of innocent people that's not forget the ongoing the unhinged the unabated assaults that have been taking place against the innocent civilians in the West Bank have been ongoing for years have been ongoing for years had the International Community rid its support behind a peace process that would end an that would bring an end to this conflict on the basis of international law on the basis of the signed agreements on the basis of the United Nations security Council resolutions we would have been in a different place now what role can the Palestinian Authority play in this process now what help can you offer the people of Gaza do you have any influence on Hamas at all our number one priority right now is to bring an end to the ongoing aggression that's our top top priority our top priority is to protect the innocent and civilians that are by that are being targeted by this ongoing aggression and the aggression end the war save lives that's our that's our priority but what can you do to do to to achieve that once again we have made our position abundantly clear we reject the killing of innocent civilians we renew the call for ending the targeting of uh uh civilians everywhere we call for an immediate release or all hostages detes prisoners on both sides and we are exerting every possible effort with the International Community for a meaningful intervention that would bring an end to this aggression okay so you are influencing the International Community in turn to influence Israel to stop the aggression is that your position at this point blood is being spilled on the on on on the streets uh neighborhoods are being uh destroyed one neighborhood at a time over 1 million Palestinians are being forcibly uh uh expelled from their homes uh the continuation of the current aggression would lead probably to the expulsion of the Palestinians as was made clear by uh by by by the official Israeli spokespersons as one of the uh objectives of the ongoing aggression is to expel uh the Palestinian people living in Gaza from the Gaza Strip we are witnessing a catastrophe we are witnessing the continuation of the current trajectory portends another nakba our number one priority now is to save lives is to bring an end to the aggression is to save the lives of the innocent people from all sides now German Chancellor Olaf schs is in Israel is visiting Israel today um as a show of solidarity also in terms of diplom diplomacy Germany says that protecting Israel or the existence of Israel is part of its um it's called ST which as I say in German so a fundamental principle of the German State what role can Germany play in this whole situation well I think this question ought to be asked to the government to give an explanation as what the concept ofon uh uh uh actually means but uh I'm 100% confident that also Germany is sincere uh when it comes to its commitment to international law to International humanitarian law and to human rights law and uh it's clear that the current events are in grave contradiction of international law of international humanitarian in law hence the values that Germany Champions and stands for now uh you've repeatedly criticized um that here in Germany demonstrations in favor of Palestinians Pro Palestinian demonstrations have been uh banned um the police have said that these will lead to incitement to uh hate crimes possibly what can be done to to kind of how shall I say to calm tempers here in Germany amongst the Palestinian Community well first and foremost let me uh make myself very clear we reject incitement we reject all forms of hate speech this applies Palestine and certainly applies here in Germany and I think in order to address incitement one needs to address the root causes of incitement and let's not lose sight of the the fact that the events on the ground are the most powerful source of incitement the events on the ground are the ones that are fueling all the emotions amongst everyone that being said I urge everyone to respect the laws to respect the values of the societies and as much as I urge each and every citizen to do so I urge the authorities in every capital and particularly in the capitals of the Free World also to respect the laws and to respect the values that serve as a distinctive Mark in these societies such as the values of free speech and expression I believe I believe that these values or the wide space for free expression is being Abed probably unintentionally probably out of impulse but this is where author parties should intervene reassess I assure you that the rallies and events that are being most of them that are being restricted wish to express rejection to war rejection to violence rejection to attempts to violate international law they are calling for upholding human rights I think it would be uh inappropriate unwise to restrict them now what do what chance do you see for peace what what is your vision for Gaza as you would imagine I'm very sad I'm very upset I'm worried for the millions that are being made to pay the price of this conflict the millions of innocent people I the heart breaks for the innocent civilians that have already been claimed during this conflict at the same time I'm equally sad for what is going to come unless this trajectory this current War does not end now that is why we are appealing to the International Community we are appealing to International organizations we are appealing to world leaders to intervene to bring an un to this aggression they ought to remember that the ones who are paying the price for this aggression for this conflict are the most innocent we're talking about 2,600 700 Palestinians have already been killed we're talking about over 800 children have already been killed over half uh of whom are under the age of 10 8 million kilg of explosives have already been dropped on Gaza the total area of which is around 1/3 the total area of Berlin meaning that 4 kilg have already been dropped on Gaza for each citizen we appeal to the International Community to bring an end to this conflict Justice is the way forward not Vengeance okay we can say if there is an appeal to the International Community you can say that the West the United States Germany have influence on one part in this conflict Israel who has influence on Hamas who can stop Hamas I think peace is the answer addressing the root causes of the conflict is the answer I think we should not lose sight of that fact I think that we should address the environment that leads to the violence which we reject and I think peace is the answer that is why I think that the International Community should focus its efforts on what's on what needs to be done to bring about a genuine solution to this conflict on the basis of international legitimacy and I think that if the International Community wishes to do so it can do so Ambassador thank you very much for speaking to DW thank you for having
