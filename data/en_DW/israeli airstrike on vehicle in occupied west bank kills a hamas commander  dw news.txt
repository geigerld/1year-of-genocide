an Israeli air strike on a vehicle in the occupied West Bank has killed a Hamas Commander that's according to a media Outlet linked to the group which is classified as a terrorist organization by many countries the Israeli military has confirmed the attack saying it targeted a militant cell around the city of tulam it's the latest in a series of strikes against hamas's leadership raising concerns about a potential spillover of the war in Gaza it comes a day after the group's leader Ismael hania was buried in the capital uh of katari Doha with thousands attending the funeral service he was assassinated in an alleged Israeli attack in tyan on Wednesday Hamas and Iran have vowed to retaliate the US says it will send additional fighter jets and warships to the region and we're joined Now by DW correspondent Constantine edgert in Jerusalem Constantine what more can you tell us about the Israeli Army operation toam well the Israeli officials are saying that it seems like it's a veritable battle that was going on in tarum today uh the Israeli uh Army confirmed that it had to strike uh Hamas Fighters again uh with another drone strike uh they did confirm that they eliminated uh five people in this first uh drone strike they were in a car and they said that the local commander of aadin Kasam brigades which is essentially a military uh wing of Hamas uh was eliminated in this strike uh it seems like other Fighters may have been killed in the battle with the Israelis so um yes T Kum today was definitely a fles point but to add to that uh uh the um Israeli Army and Israeli security uh forces said that they uh struck a car struck a hisbah commander uh in the south of Lebanon today so uh it's in a completely different area in different country so it was a very very uh unquiet day today Israel well with the war still raging in Gaza daily clashes in the West Bank a Bonafide Northern front along the Israel Lebanon border which you're just now referring to and a threat of retaliation from Iran and its proxies are we seeing a shift in Israeli strategy well I I I would say that it's not yet a front in the north although of course the situation becomes more and more tense there on the Lebanese border um as for this strategy I do think that um Israel the Israeli government the Israeli security establishment and army establishment always considered the possibility of a war onto France so uh I do not think it's anything spectacularly new but yes I think the uh the cumulate effect of uh these many clashes uh produces this feeling that uh the situation is indeed very very hot and yes you you feel it here uh in Israel although I looked out the window today is um it seems like very quiet in Jerusalem uh but at the same time Michael uh news keep coming that more and more Airlines for example are cancelling flights to Israel and to neighboring Lebanon so indeed tension is growing Constantine just quickly according to Israeli media reports a highlevel Israeli delegation has arrived in Cairo for truce talks Ismael hania of course was the chief Hamas negotiator before he was assassinated where does this leave talks and the hopes of Israeli hostages and their families Michael indeed uh if the these reports are true then uh uh both security Chiefs of domestic security and foreign intelligence uh of Israel are in Egypt for talks with the Egyptian security establishment uh I would say it's still early to say that it's some kind of movement with regard to Hamas but definitely uh Egypt was always very instrumental in uh everything that concerned Gaza so it is an interesting sign bear in mind the fact as you rightly said that Han was killed just just two two three days ago uh it is an interesting development if we believe these reports they should be confirmed further I think DW correspondent Constantine Edgard in Jerusalem thanks to you sir let's get more from DW's uh Beirut bureau chief Muhammad ASA Muhammad good to see you now that we are a few days after the death of hania and The prominent Hezbollah commander fuad shukar in Lebanon um perhaps you can give us an assessment of at this stage what seems like the most likely response we could see from Hezbollah well to understand the overall situation we have to see this from hb's perspective this attack on beut suburbs early this week is according to hasah an Israeli offensive on Lebanon and not a retaliation whatsoever since hasah is denying any responsibility for last week's attack on M Shams in the occupied Kanan and this is a very important detail because this determines the nature of hb's response on the attack on its stronghold in Beirut hasbullah um has been clearly saying uh that the retaliation is inevitable uh on the basis of that this is an offensive on Lebanon that this was carried out in a in a civilian residential complex it caused the death of uh innocent civilians and it targeted a senior hasah military uh figure and therefore we have to carefully read into Nala's speech in in that sense especially in the event of the killing of is in tanah said that the region entered a new phase of escalation and I would say that this indicates that we are far beyond just a supporting front but less than an allout War but in such moment of high tension it would be really ridiculous to rule out an allout War so what kind of diplomatic efforts have we seen to try to prevent this from becoming a much wider War in the region well you know we've been following on on the very active and intense political and diplomatic efforts to deescalate the situation to pressure hasah to exercise restrain and avoid a big uh retaliation but really this sounds far-fetched the heavily armed group have rejected all calls and actively been rejecting all calls to reach a a deal that would stop the confrontation with Israel based on the UN resolution 1701 which stopped the war between Lebanon and Israel in 2006 uh 2006 hasah have been constantly clear about that it um would only uh be interested in in um stopping the fire and settling for negotiations um once a ceasefire in Gaza is um enacted well thank you so much as always that is DW's Beirut bureau chief Muhammad Isa well Germany says it is also planning for a possible escalation in the Middle East Berlin is among Israel's stest allies and the government has repeatedly stated that Israel has a right to self-defense defense minister Boris Pistorius has ruled out deploying German troops to the region but he told DW the government is watching the situation closely well we are assessing the the the situation every day or every half day with together with the foreign Ministry and the chancellory and we are preparing for what might coming coming ahead like evacuation or whatever else but at the moment we are only in the in the phase of preparations not in acting
