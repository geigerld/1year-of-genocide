mourners in Beirut have held a funeral for Hamas Deputy leader who was killed in an explosion on Tuesday s aruri was considered a key figure in the group that carried out the deadliest terror attack in Israel's history on October 7th he was its Deputy political leader and a co-founder of its military wing aruri and two other haras members were laid to rest in the Lebanese Capital lebanon's militant Hezbollah group blames Israel for the assassination although there has been no claim of responsibility but Israeli officials have previously said they would Target Hamas leaders wherever they are waving the Hamas flag protesters in ramala voed their support and anger the city in the occupied West Bank was the hometown of Salah aruri the high ranking Hamas official was killed in a strike on Beirut on Tuesday this is crazy hysterical Revenge Revenge because Israel feels and is experiencing a kind of defeat and therefore it knows full well that there's no victory for it Salah aruri was Deputy to hamas's leader is hania and the groups ke liazon with Hezbollah in Lebanon since aror assassination in the suburbs of Beirut Israel and Hezbollah have continued to fire at each other across the border an almost daily occurrence since Israel's war with Hamas began the Lebanese political party and militant group is backed by Iran and considered a terrorist organization by the US Germany and some Sunni Arab countries Israel has not officially claimed responsibility for the strike on Beirut but Lebanese security sources said it was caused by an Israeli drone Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate calling it a serious assault on [Music] Lebanon if the enemy thinks of waging a war on Lebanon we will fight without restraint without rules Without Limits and without restrictions Israel knows what I mean the podum is yours Israel's main Ally the US has said it was not informed before the blast in Beirut Washington is now urging restraint to keep the war contained just wanted to before we don't want to see it widen Beyond Israel and Hamas and again we're going to keep working with Partners in the region to prevent that from happening Hezbollah has so far refrained from escalating Beyond border skirmishes with Israel but this attack in the heart of Lebanon has raised fears of an allout War and the Israeli Army says it's on high alert and ready for any scenario well let's dig a little bit deeper with shanie rosanes uh with me in the studio here our Middle East analyst shannie this strike was against the deputy Hamas leader but it was in a Hezbollah dominated uh neighborhood in in Lebanon uh that so far there has been no major retaliation from from Hezbollah what do you make of that well just to show you that the complexity of uh the the the Dynamics when we talk about alliances you know we talk about hamas's alliance with Lebanon uh with hasbalah forces that is um with Iran but then this Iran hisbah Shia proxy it's not a direct line when it comes to Hamas it as a Sunni off offsho they are committed to the fight for the Palestinian cause but they're not uh they're well aware of the fact that bringing Lebanon into the fight which is what Israel says is Israel does not differentiate from hisbah from Lebanon in that aspect when it's attacked from Lebanon the way it's going to it's threatening it's going to attack again against barut so for for Nala for his balah to be attacking uh Israel fierceful uh for Kamas cause this is a test that they're put into are they how far are they going to go with this Alliance and we're seeing so far that the bet that Israel has taken probably Israel has taken in going for a ruri assuming that his balah will be uh sort of moderate or or can contain his its response both sides can contain their response without escalation so far it seems to be um seem to be a safe bet we need to keep in mind this is just so far I'm sure hasbalah will will find more ways to uh show its respon it but just to show you you know putting pressure into this Alliance that we know already was kind of tens under under pressure because there was no coordination about and and pre- knowledge of hisb about the attack by Hamas we know that by now very interesting the power dynamics in in in all this now this week Israel has withdrawn some of its troops uh from Gaza is that part of a larger shift in strategy could we see uh increasingly see Hamas leaders being targeted outside of Gaza and less sort of conventional Warfare in Gaza well they Israeli Prime Minister said it himself the head of the Mad repeated that again they see all of Hamas heads anybody involved with the October 7 attack as as person that is deemed to be uh you know on their target list it's nothing new in that aspect but it is true that it's much more of a tangible achievement for Israel to get than anything that we're seeing now in Gaza in the last 90 days exactly today we've seen Israel uh trying striving for Meaningful strategic achievements in Gaza and and it's not capable to break actually hamas's control over the territory not yet so aiming at the heads of Kamas in a way makes it a bit easier to break this somewhat vague uh goal of of uh eradicating hamas's uh rule or or you know getting rid of Hamas and Gaza putting the the goal exactly at the heads of Hamas and chasing them wherever they are that's a bit easier to sell and maybe to achieve uh now you said it 90 days uh ago today uh and tonight the Israeli cabinet will be talking about how they will want to deal with the Gaza Strip after the war and two ministers uh of the government have called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and that raised fears of a forced expulsion is that the road the government is expected to go for really well first of all it's it's it's quite striking it took the Israel government 90 days um because how do you start a a an operation without knowing your end goal you know part of the pressure for this discussion is coming from the military saying we need to know where we're heading um so finally it's happening the talks about expulsion you know of Palestinian that's always uh some sort of a wet dream of the white of the extreme right in Israel and now they're being more you know unabashedly loud with this with this aspiration of course the American uh supporters of Israel are against it of course the International Community is against it it's also partly the core of the problem between Israel and the Palestinians what happens to the refugees what happened to all those Palestinians that are still refugees for so many years partially because the world does not want to help Israel solve the Palestinian problem in a way by getting rid of the refugees sort of saying refugees all of Palestinians they need to be finding their solution Within part of the greater ution for the Israeli Palestinian conflict so that these talks are probably not realistic netan said he does not support that what does he support that's the big problem um Israel has said mostly what it does not want to see in Gaza and it's finding it very difficult to agree on what it is wanting to see in Gaza the day after they don't want to see the Palestinian Authority they even not the new revised reformed one that the Americans are trying to conort they don't want to see Israeli settlements being rebuilt there they don't want to keep the military there for true to Long what do they want they're very limited in their options there are some talk about maybe local Clans local families that will try to take over many experts say it's not a very realistic chance of of of of fulfilling the goals for Israel to bring safety into that part of uh of of of the world um yet to be seen Gaza is not a problem going away so soon that uh seems to be for sure I'm at least analyst channie ranis there thank you very much
