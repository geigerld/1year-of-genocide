the US President Joe Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin said the president would reaffirm what he called America's Ironclad commitment to Israel's security he'll also discuss its War aims and strategy as Israel presses on with air strikes as well as the need to protect the lives of civilians and enable humanitarian Aid to reach Gaza blinkin said the visit was coming at a critical moment for the region and for the world now we'll have more on what to expect from the trip in a moment but first here's a look at the situation in Gaza where more than 1 million have been displaced and at least 2,800 people have been killed entire neighborhoods raised to Rubble Israel air strikes continue to flatten buildings across Gaza on the ground here in RAF the scramble to rescue people trapped under the debris after a recent strike demolished an apartment building rushing the injured to hospital and lining up the bodies of those killed outside the morg residents here say they have nowhere to go no electricity no water no n no nappies no milk but even if we die from Hunger we will stay here and we will not leave in 5 days we witnessed bombs fall on houses corpses in the street we fled to the UN school we thought it was safe but they targeted it and people died thousands of people from across Gaza have left their homes and headed south to Rafa in recent days after being told to evacuate by Israel mediators have so far failed to negotiate a ceasefire that would allow foreigners to leave Gaza at the only border into Egypt so for many it is a difficult [Music] wait we come to the border crossing every day we contact the embassy every day and they tell us to go to the crossing we wait for up to8 hours and then we go back the journey is dangerous we want them to solve this problem so that we can travel according to US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin America and Israel have now agreed to develop a plan that would allow a to reach Gaza but working out the details will likely take time time that is running out for the thousands of gazans caught in a growing humanitarian crisis and we can speak now to Steven Ryan a spokesperson for the international Committee of the Red Cross in Jerusalem thanks so much for joining us uh stevenh uh we know Gaza has been without food without water fuel medical supplies for a week now can you update us um about the conditions there right now well I can tell you that the situation is dire having spoken to our teams on the ground uh they're seeing the the effects the accumulative effects of this lack of access to Food Water electricity uh really CH and sta these uh large numbers of people who have been displaced we've seen families women elderly people trying to walk to safety but none of them are sure where is safe right now many people are still sleeping in the open and nobody knows what's coming next children are afraid and we're seeing people in complete disarray and right now the situation is critical I is your organization in touch with authorities in Israel in Gaza and more importantly are they are they listening to what you have to say well the International Community to the Red Cross is the organization that is responsible for working and humanitarian assistance during conflicts so certainly part of our job is to engage with uh engage in dialogue with all authorities with all parties to the conflict we have been appealing from the outset for respect for international humanitarian law for the parties to actively take every measure and every precaution that they should take in order to protect civilians and it's the civilians that are suffering the brunt of this conflict uh we also need to have access both to be able to bring in the much needed relief items that are going to assist these people as well as to bring in additional teams to support the response that's needed right now but to do this uh we need authorization from all parties to the complect okay so the authorization is is CR critical what are the sort of the other major challenges that organizations Aid organizations like yours are facing in Gaza well certainly it's the scale of the problem and the the rapid changes that are occurring from our point of view we uh we are ready to assist people in any way that uh we can anything within the Mandate of the Red Cross and of the ICC in particular our teams we have over a 100 staff members in Gaza and they are doing the best that they can to help the people that they can with the dwindling resources that we have this means that we need to have much more relief items into into Gaza as soon as possible to do this as I mentioned all parties need to give authorization and we also need to be assured that our teams will be able to work safely you heard already in the report and over the past couple of days that the lives of healthcare workers and humanitarians are at risk by responding here and this means that in order to provide assistance there needs to be pauses to the fing and or te need to be able to do their jobs the Israeli Army has been telling civilians in Northern Gaza to move South can you put into perspective for us how this huge movement of people uh is in impacting humanitarian efforts in the territory as I mentioned this makes the situation extremely Dynamic and constantly changing it also means that there are a huge number of people moving to one place and in the hope that they will be able to get assistance when they get there in order for them to get that assistance it needs to get into Gaza all of these people who have fled their homes they flee only with what they can carry as fuel is very short people don't have cars and certainly the Red Cross and other actors are Keen to provide the assistance uh that's much needed but this is going to be a huge Challenge and one that we're going to have to adapt to ongoing basis because the situation continues to change our priority is to provide humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza as well as the other aspects of the icrc's work including within Israel but right now uh access is what's needed and Fai access is what's needed Steven Ryan from the international of the Red Cross thank you so much for your time and for speaking to
