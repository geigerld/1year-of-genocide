Israel has reacted angrily to a decision by the UN Security Council to pass a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan the United States decided not to block the measure having vetoed three previous efforts in response Israel's prime minister canceled plans to send a highlevel delegation to Washington the resolution had also demanded the immediate release of all hostages still being held by Hamas the group behind the October 7th terror attack well there's no doubt that that UN resolution will feature in talks later between Germany's foreign minister analena barbach and Top members of the Israeli government now barbach has already called on Israel not to launch a military offensive against the city of Rafa in Gaza while she has cautiously welcomed the UN ceasefire resolution today there is perhaps the glimmer of light on the horizon the call by the security Council and therefore the International Community for a ceasefire is overdue let's get across live to Jerusalem and DW's Rebecca Ritter Rebecca uh Germany's foreign minister she's already met with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and she will meet her Israeli counterpart foreign minister Israel Catz later this morning what do you think we can expect to hear there after her comments on that Security Council resolution well CL I don't think we can expect anything too out of the ordinary from this meeting today this is the seventh Min uh seventh visit rather by minister bearok to Israel since the War Began and I think we can expect a bit more of the same though we are starting to see the temperature going up even when it comes to Germany and Israel's relationship that special relationship uh given its historical context now we have seen Minister Bok come out in support of the UN Security Council as you just heard there and that vote yesterday though Germany not actually a member on that Council didn't vote in that security uh Council vote yesterday but coming out in support which is already uh pretty strong for Germany who normally uh stands in steadfast support of Israel but we think we'll see that continuation I think as I mentioned we might see a turning up of the temperature and the rhetoric at that meeting but I think publicly we'll see Germany standing by Israel you know the the Germany bebok even saying in background briefings that there aren't that many carrots all that many sticks that Germany can use at this stage and at this stage without having gone into Rafer it still looks as though Israel hasn't crossed any red lines that would see Germany take any further action and top EU officials have also uh welcomed that Security Council resolution but what has Israel's response to it been are there chances that it might abide by the resolution I think we're certainly seeing the opposite to that so far CLA we Israel cats that Minister the foreign minister that we were just talking about there who'll be meeting meeting with bok later today came out after that vote saying we will not put out the fire and we have Benny guns come out on X shortly after he's a member of the war cabinet not a member of the government but a very important player uh in this six-month conflict so far he came out saying that Israel had a moral obligation to continue fighting to continue fighting to try to get out the hostages though it is notable that in that uh tweet or that message on X that benun didn't mention the other military aim is of course destroying hamas's military capabilities he just mentioned the hostages so that could be uh somewhat of a change in rhetoric but I think you know we're seeing at least in the rhetoric and the Bluster coming from Israel that they are going to continue that they will not abide by the UN Security Council vote so we'll have to see what that means when it comes to Rafer of course they are going to need us support when it comes to Rafer and now we've seen uh that support at least you know when it comes to the rhetoric uh even if that doesn't mean anything changing exactly yet on the ground we are seeing that start to change we'll have to see what happens going forward but it looks like uh Israel are going to ignore that un Security Council vote at this stage and what about its relations with Washington we have Israel now having canceled a delegations a planned trip to the US after that us extension do you think we're seeing a shift in US policy V Israel at the United Nations I think we're certainly seeing a shift in the relation ship if even if that doesn't translate exactly to a shift of practicalities on the ground yet CLA we you know we have seen obviously a big decision yesterday by the US to abstain from that vote not to use their veto power uh we have been seeing in recent days and weeks the rhetoric by the US changing when it comes to Israel and their actions on the ground particularly when it comes to the planned uh incursion into Rafa that southern city now home to over a million uh displaced Palestinians or or taking shelter there so you know we are seeing a change in that special relationship that steadfast uh relationship that we have seen Israel support uh sorry us support Israel throughout this six months we are starting to see the tone change there and as you mentioned uh the counseling of that delegation to the us though it must be said that the defense minister yoav galand is in the US and will be continuing with the scheduled meetings that he was supposed to have so there are of course still between these two allies but we are starting to see that relationship change how that plays out in the future remains to be seen but for the moment Israel uh certainly no doubt behind the scenes worried about what's going on between these two relationships Rebecca thank you so much as always that's Rebecca riters for
