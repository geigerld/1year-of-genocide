the White House has called for an investigation into the death of a Turkish American woman who was shot in the occupied West Bank Israel's military says its investigating reports that its troops killed the woman after opening fire on demonstrators Palestinian media say she was shot in the head during a march by activists in beta a town that has experienced repeated attacks by Israeli settlers our correspondent in Jerusalem Emily gordin joins us now Emily tell us more about this woman and the demonstration that she was attending when she was shot a yes Brent the activist uh in question has been identified as Aur um isi AI she is a dual citizen of both the US and turkey and she was in the occupied West Bank with the so-called International solidarity movement to protest an Israeli settlement in the area now this settlement in question was recently legalized by the Israeli government even though all Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are widely uh considered illegal under international law and Israel has been widely criticized for allowing them to happen so protests against Israeli settlements in the West Bank are not uncommon um but in fact in recent months some of them have um Turned violent and that is what is said to have happened in this case as well this case ended up in clashes with the Israel Defense Forces which then which then led to shots being fired which ultimately killed this activist and Palestinian as well as Turkish officials now say that it was in fact Israeli bullets that killed her and imily what is Israel saying about the allegations that she was shot by the Israel Defense Forces so the IDF has not confirmed this they have said that were responding to quote violent activity and they fired at an instigator who was throwing rocks at them and who posed a threat to them now um these claims are now the incident in itself is now quote under review and they're looking into these claims which is also something that the US has asked for um but Palestinian as well as Turkish officials um have responded and and claim that this killing essentially reflects um how Israel is intending ifying its um its repression of Palestinian protests in the occupied West Bank but if you look at the West Bank that occupied West Bank as a whole um over the past few months we've seen that violence between Palestinians and Israelis has intensified has increased not least because of the war in Gaza following hamas's Terror attacks on October 7th but also um in light of the rapid expansion of Israeli settlements in uh the occupied West Bank and there are serious concerns that this violence could escalate even further DW's Emily gordin in Jerusalem Emily thank you well Germany's foreign minister Ana barbach has warned Israel that what she called a purely military approach will not solve the crisis in Gaza at a meeting in Tel Aviv Beach told her counterpart Israel cuts that Israel needed to make a deal to end the war in Gaza and bring back hostages held by Hamas she also urged the country to end its settlements in the occupied West Bank and to punish settlers who commit violence against Palestinians barbach later met with Palestinian authorities leaders in the West Bank all right I want to get some analysis now with Natasha Hall she's a senior fellow with the Middle East program at the center for strategic and international studies in Washington DC it's good to have you with us the German foreign Minister she has visited Israel practically every month since the Hamas October 7th Terror attacks last year despite that the war rages on there is no ceasefire so what have these visits achieved well that's a great question and I will tell you that Americans are asking the same question about their diplomats right now we've been seriously talking about a ceasefire since February uh and yet every time we see talks ratchet up as we had in past weeks that this is the last chance nothing seems to to cataliz and I would say probably a a big part of that for the United States and for Germany is is the ongoing uh military support and and diplomatic support for Israel uh moving forward yeah you know you mentioned Americans and know the efforts by the US Secretary of State does Germany have any influence on Israel any more than that of the United States I I would say certainly not more than the United States but Germany is one of Israel's biggest trading partners and and also uh the source of many of its arm sales actually I think second to the United States um so so it is a significant player here and it has been a significant player in mediation in past flareups either in Lebanon or in Gaza in the past 20 years um but because of these the sort of unabashed support that we've seen from both Germany and the United States in the past 11 months uh since October 7th um we haven't seen a real significant shift um in Israeli Behavior or uh acquiescence to any kind of ceasefire uh negotiations um but I would I would definitely say that you know Germany would come and any other country for that matter would come far second or third to to the United States in terms of being able to to use its influence fluence um to move Israel in that direction and how about from the Palestinians perspective is there anything that Germany can do Beyond checkbook diplomacy to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza and to end the illegal settlements in the West Bank yeah I mean you called it checkbook diplomacy I would say it's just tangible measures I think there's a lot of finger wagging that goes on but at the end of the day if the arm sales don't stop then Israel has no actual motivation um to change course um but I would say that Germany does play a role in setting the tone um which I think is already been happening in the past week it's a significant change of tone uh for Germany compared to the past 11 months um where it has had uh very steadfast support for Israel regardless and has has really shied away from even calling for a ceasefire um really until very very recently but I think Germany does set the tone for the rest of Europe when it comes to Israel and so it it could potentially begin to to show a shift there in the um the full-on support for Israel moving forward and give Netanyahu the prime minister of Israel a bit of notice that that time is running out Natasha Hall from the center for strategic and International Studies we appreciate your time and your analysis tonight thank you thank you
