Iran has downplayed the significance of Friday's suspected Israeli air strike raising hopes of an end to the escalation between the two countries it was seen as retaliation for last week's massive but largely ineffective Iranian missile and drone attack on Israel Iranian officials say the strike hit a military base near the Central City of Isfahan describing it as a desperate attempt for Israel to save phas PR government protesters rallied in the capital with the familiar message thousands of people on the streets of Tran making their message to Israel clear they held signs Enchanted death to Israel ours after an alleged Israeli strike on Iranian soil these pictures posted on social media show an undamaged military base in Isfahan after the attack the area is a major Center of military production with the country's most important nuclear enrichment facility located nearby Iranian State media said there was no damage following the strikes basically in Iran life is based on whatever happens normally there's nothing whatsoever out of the ordinary speaking at the G7 Summit in Italy on Friday US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin made America's position clear what the G7 is focused on and again it's reflected in our statement and in our conversation is our work to deescalate uh tensions German foreign minister analena bbok called for cool heads as the G7 we have deci here today to impose further sanctions and measures on the Iranian regime at the same time everything must be done to prevent an escalation with unforeseeable consequences for an entire region Israel's war cabinet has been debating its response to a largescale Iranian attack last weekend that came after Israel's presumed strike of an Iranian diplomatic compound but it's hoped Friday morning's Maneuvers could be the last after Tran indicated it has no plans for retaliation now large explosions have hit the base of an Iraqi Shia militia south of Baghdad local medical sources say at least one person was killed the base belongs to a coalition of Iran linked groups called the popular mobilization forces the United States has denied involvement in the attack for more on this Let's cross over to Ramat Gan in Israel near Tel Aviv where DW's Shani ranes is standing by Hello shanni nice to see you lots of questions surrounding these explosions near Baghdad they have been called an air strike but the US is saying it wasn't us what's the conversation in Israel well not much honestly um what we know is that there are some Anonymous sources Israeli officials that are quoted um saying it's also not Israel but it's also typical we would expect Israel to be denying that uh any action in Iraq would be somewhat of an Uncharted Territory nothing that Israel would want to be admitting to do especially not on such tense days um but uh that is for now not much of a discussions and what about the Drone attack on esfahan in Iran which is widely being attributed to Israel how is Israel reacting to that incident you know it was quite tense 24 hours since uh the news of the attack uh were came public and in Israel and we've seen nothing coming from the government of course on purpose uh Israel did not claim any responsibility nor will it do it but I think it's quite clear that the fingers point back at Jerusalem um as a retaliation there seem to be a lot of content uh by the Iranian response we've uh we've seen the Iranian foreign minister for example complete completely denying Israeli involvement in that saying that would not have been making any sense we've seen a lot of signs that the regime in Iran is trying to push away any framing of this as connected to Israel which would might need to put force on on the regime uh to retaliate again so it seems like we're heading to deescalation and we've seen a lot of sze of relief coming of Israel following that but also there's also with the back of the Mind the fear in Israel that this might also be some sort of a uh a trick some sort of decoy a need for the Iranians to kind of keep Israel sleepy or off edge in order to maybe retaliate when they find the time it this is something we will have to deal with when it comes to Iran and Israeli um relations from now on it's interesting what you say especially when we we use the word deescalation from both sides let me let me get your sense of this uh what do you what do you make of how Israel is managing the threat of escalation with Iran and its proxy so we know that the attack assuming it really was Israel was sort of calming things down showing that Israel has made its uh response showing that you know an attack from Irani soil on Israeli uh land will not come you know without any response and also this was a very targeted strategically chosen um uh facility that is very close to Iran's nuclear facilities trying to Signal whoever did that assumingly Israel trying to sign if we wanted we could have made it harsher we could have gone all the way into attacking your nuclear program but what we need to fundamentally remember is that something has been broken a red line was crossed the relations between Israel and Iran you know the shadow war that we've been seeing in the last decades that has broken and the two sides have stepped into a a new territory of of of a spoken uh very public um conflict and that means we're not quite sure what's heading now I think every you know both sides are on their toes we of course see the world uh very much uh attentive to this uh conflict very careful of where it's it's going to lead both the the parties but the whole region um and for now it seems like we're heading to deescalation but everybody in the back of their minds have this fear of uh knowing that the old rules of the games were broken and slowly new rules will be uh written we will have to see how Bloody and how um aggressive they might end up being right only time will tell twws sha ranes thank you well I spoke earlier to Ali F NAD he's a political scientist and director of the center for Middle East in Global Order here in Berlin and I asked him what did he think was Israel behind this attack in Iran well I mean there is little probability that um you know those attacks were carried out by any other state so there there's a higher likelihood uh and also we have some reports sing us officials uh that are quite clear that Israel has been carry carrying out the strike there has been International worry that an Israeli retaliation for last weekend's attack would definitely escalate this conflict and then the counter response coming from Iran would make it even more of a bigger crisis but that hasn't happened how do you explain this this muted response on both sides well I think at this point in in time no one has an interest um uh you know to U provoke an allout War um this is certainly true for the Iranian side uh given also the nature of last weekend's attack on Israel uh you know the kinds of weapon systems that the Iranians have used and also what has happened and um you know today or last night um is also in my view an indication um that uh Israel did not uh choose uh a fashion of attack that could provoke Iran to uh further escalate and uh what instead seems to have been the case um I mean of course by now we don't have any confirmation about the exact nature of the attack and also the targets and also the damages uh but it seems that this was a demonstration of power from the uh Israeli side uh a signal sent to Iran that you know Israel can cross Iranian uh defenses uh perhaps at will and this has been a demonstration of power from the Israeli side uh signaling that uh if need be uh you know Israel could easily uh Target Iran in a force forceful way and especially of course Iranian um military infrastructure the Iranian media been reporting that drones were shot down near the Iranian city of Isfahan what would make this city um a a Target I mean um you know near esfahan there a lot of uh military um you know uh complexes but also nuclear facilities uh but um talking of the Irani reaction it's quite visible that the Iranians have no uh you know appetite for escalation uh they've been downplaying uh this attack uh to a uh quite ridiculous level uh in terms of saying that you know only three drones were you know uh shot and were intercepted by the Iranian side and from uh all we can GA so far this attack has been you know uh much more than that but the Irani side is is uh trying to uh you know keep it low to downplay it if not to belittle it uh that is also to not to have the pressure to respond uh which is again in contradiction to what the Iranian side via the head of the irgc the Islam grai guard had announced uh you know just following uh the Iranian attack on Israel as a new equation from the Iranian side which would uh uh you know which would suggest that any um uh attack from the uh Israeli side on Iranian assets would be met uh with a with with a response from inside Iranian territory so uh given the fact that this new equation doesn't seem to hold uh this signals that uh those have been you know warnings rather than a change of uh strategy and the Iranian side is still very much worried that an allout War could you know uh uh could evolve out of those tensions and uh in such a scenario this would also be very much destabilizing for the regime in Iran do you think the regime in Iran has is realizing that maybe it's misread or miscalculated uh the position of other Gulf States and that maybe they were counting on full support in a conflict against Israel and that is obviously not what they're getting uh I don't think so that this was part of the Iranian calculation that um you know they're going to be supported by the uh Gulf Arab Gulf States of um you know against Israel but the position of the Arab Gulf States is quite clear they're very much interested uh you know in bring about a deescalation because stability for them is vital uh politically but also economically and so they fear any kind of escalation in the region uh especially involving Iran um they've seen that Iran uh could be uh you know very damaging to their nuclear uh sorry to their economic viability to the kinds of attacks that we've seen in the Persian Gulf region against the UAE but also against the main oil facility uh of Saudi Arabia and September 2019 so uh you know at least since then uh they're extremely worried about destabilizing activities of Iran uh and um given their understanding of of relative reduction of us support they've chosen the way to seek accommodation with Iran but currently of course they do whatever they can uh toward deescalation Aliah n director of the center for Middle Easter Global Order we appreciate your time on this Friday evening thank you thank you and more I want to bring in now Sab ranbar Dei a historian who specializes in modern Iran at St Andrews University he joins us tonight from edoro it's good to have you with us we saw in the last 24 hours what appears to been a restrained air strike by Israel and a equally restrained response by Iran is that a correct assessment I mean what do you think we're witnessing here yes I would think so I mean obviously there's been no official confirmation by uh by Israel of the strike the Americans have also not confirmed it the White House or Anthony blink but uh the Italian foreign minister of all people who is hosting the G7 did confirm that the Americans did did they tell them that it's a Israeli strike and the Israeli and the American Media are confirming it as well so certainly it has been I think a low key Israel strike U and uh it has been to the level that the Ians I think are considering not to not to react and and just let it simmer and and and sort of make this round of Confrontation sort of uh calm down and and move to the next stage and and and why do you think that is because the world this week has you know been sitting on pins and needles wondering what kind of Israeli response we were going to see but also just as worried about you know a counter response coming from tayron well I mean I think first of all clearly there has been some negotiations behind the scenes that probably some countries have been mediating Qatar Oman were traditional mediators in these cases between Iran and the West probably the United States have stepped in and and and sort of the uh an arrangement has been in in one way or the other reach that there should be a mostly symbolic strike I think Israelis have chosen to strike around this spawn because of course that's where some important nuclear facilities are particularly in aans and they seem to have struck some radar stations either connected to the military or some of the defense systems connected to Natan so they wanted to more than actually inflict damage this time around give the impression that they can strike um that region u in the future and also Iran when when launching those missiles the previous week wanted to give the impression or or sort of prove that it's it is capable of hitting Israeli territory so so this is I think what the level of this is it's mostly an exhibition of potential military press rather than actually the intention to uh to cause damage and we shouldn't forget that espan of course is an important artistic city as well so a strike on the city would have caused a lot of Wrath amongst Iranian public opinion irrespective of their opinions towards Islamic Republic last night just just before this um attack you know allegedly took place the Iranian foreign minister gave an interview in the United States and said that if there were to be a any type of retaliation any type of attack by Israel the response by Iran would be at a maximum level now he was asked to explain that and he just repeated the word maximum Lev how do you interpret that well we shouldn't forget that Israelis are not actually admitting or taking U ownership of what has happened so clearly this gives some leeway for the Iranians to um sort of state that that pledge remains valid as long as the strike is significant and Israelis are actually um sort of acknowledging that it was them um and then obviously Iran wants to make the point that uh what we saw last week was just a an opening Salvo and they have better and and and and and more precise missiles that they can hit Israel with I mean we don't know whether this is the case but probably that's what Amir Abdullah Yan wanted to to state however as they said the nature of this Israeli strike makes it possible also for to keep that threat uh on the fire if you want but not actually executed at this stage and Before I Let You Go the fact that we had the Iranian forign Minister you know using this this Fierce rhetoric talking about a maximum response and just hours later the actual response Byron was rather muted is this a case that within the regime one hand doesn't know what the other hand is is doing or saying well I would say that it's also a very unprecedented situation for Iran I mean it is it is a we've the conflict with Israel is a is a very long-standing one obviously it's has been at lower intensity it has had this flare up with the the Mascus attack and we shouldn't forget it it's not over yet this this chapter might be over with these strikes but it's still simmering there in the background so Iran is really making policy as it goes along this is a completely unprecedented situation and uh and they are grappling with the kind of uh reaction and the rhetorical reaction has been very strong as we've seen from Iran all along but again I think that the nature of the Israeli strike um now that it has actually happened could actually um persuade Iran to step back and uh and avoid obviously this this issue from from overshadowing what's going on in Gaza of course they they portray themselves as supporters of the Palestinian call so they won't won't want that to happen Okay sa ranar Demi from St Andrews University we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us on this Friday night thank you my pleasure thank you
