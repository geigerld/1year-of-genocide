US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin says he wants to make sure the conflict in Gaza doesn't spread this morning he traveled to Jordan as part of a week-long diplomatic tour aimed at calming tensions blinkin says he's particularly concerned about exchanges of fire on Israel's northern border with Lebanon US Secretary of State Anthony blinken's week-long Whistle Stop tour is aimed at calming tensions that have spiked since Israel's war with Hamas began this is not just work a day diplomacy there is genuine concern that the conflict is already escalating we have an intense focus on preventing this conflict from spreading far too many Palestinians have been killed especially children far too many uh remain incredibly challenged in terms of their access to food to water to medicine to the essentials of life as the wheels of diplomacy turn in Gaza there's been no letup in the past 3 months Israeli strikes claim more lives food and Medicine are increasingly scarce and entire neighborhoods are reduced to Rubble the un's humanitarian Chief said Gaza has quote simply become uninhabitable but Israel says that it is making progress at the end of Fierce and determined fighting we have dismantled the Hamas military framework in jabalia we shall continue to deepen our achievements in these areas it takes time there are no shortcuts in the war on terror the risk of escalation is what concerns diplomats the most in particular the border between Israel and Lebanon the Israeli Army and Hezbollah forces have been exchanging shells almost daily since October 7 earlier this week a strike in Beirut that killed senior Hamas leader Salah arui inflamed tensions even further meanwhile inside Israel there are now regular anti-government protests demonstrators are increasingly dissatisfied with the government's handling of the war and the slow progress in getting the hostages returned some are even calling for the Prime Minister and his government to step down the hope is that this increased pressure both domestically and internationally can help produce a much needed breakthrough and for more on this we're joined by Jason cedonia who is the Los Angeles bureau chief for NBC News Radio uh Jason blinkin says he wants to make sure the conflict in the Middle East doesn't spread what's the risk for the us if that happens uh it could mean that we are going to engage in a war that is not ours for lack of a better term um and that may look like a loss in the election year here in the United States for the administration and President Joe Biden uh if we get involved in something like that especially with heavy military action increasing in the area of the Gaza Strip um I think right now the show of The American Secretary of State going out there is uh a 50/50 it's a coin flare if they get out there and say hey we don't want this thing to spread we don't want any other countries involved we don't want any other groups involved and nothing happens a ceasefire doesn't happen more Aid get into the area that's going to look uh like the trip was all show and no go and I'm not sure that's going to bode well here in the with the American voter and you're talking about American voters and that this is an election year what is the perception in the US public of the war in Gaz and how could it affect Biden's chances of getting reelected well I think if you go with the American Allies which you know Israel is uh is our Ally there and I think if you are going to the polls and you had to vote today um I really feel that the war in the Middle East uh not enough is being done and I think the American voter feels that way you know right now not enough is being done to stop the killing of innocent people people in the Gaza Strip uh we have protests every day in the United States on both sides Pro Palestinian pro-israel and when those two groups get together it's a violent protest and so I think I think this is going to be an uphill battle for the Biden Administration and I think sending the secretary of state is their way of saying hey we're here but critics are already saying that this is America doing what America does they go to other countries to tell that country how to run the country so that may not bode well uh as the week-long trip for the Secretary of State continues understood Jason cidonia with NBC News Radio thanks so much thank
