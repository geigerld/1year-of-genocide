now meanwhile the UN says a school being used as a shelter has been damaged after Israel launched an air strike near the building officials in Gaza say at least 20 people were killed in the bombing the humanitarian situation in the territory remains dire with more than a million people displaced and many without food or water the aftermath of an air strike on a school turn shelter run in the northern Gaza Strip officials from the Hamas run health Ministry say at least 20 people were killed in the attack children under 10 were cut into pieces where are the Arabs where is the Muslim Nation where is the spirit of Islam dead children were falling before our eyes what did we do those wounded in strikes are taken to overcrowded hospitals where anesthetic and Medicine are running out an Israeli embargo on fuel entering Gaza means the generators that power life support systems for newborns and critically ill patients will soon stop running Israeli officials say they will transfer fuel to hospitals when they deem it necessary so far we have not allowed fuel into the Gaza Strip we are checking the situation there every day note that for more than a week now they have been telling us that tomorrow the fuel in hospitals will run out so far it has not run out we will watch for when that day arrives fuel will be transferred with monitoring to the hospitals we will do everything needed to ensure that it will not reach Hamas infrastructures that it will not end up serving War aims but the real needs of treating the sick the Israeli strikes on Gaza have left over a million Palestinians displaced with nowhere left to go some families have had to take shelter in their cars we were in Northern Gaza and we moved moved to another region but there was also bombardment we sought refuge in the schools but then they were bombed so we came here to hunas there isn't enough space the men have set up tents outside but there's nowhere to sleep we sleep in the cars there's nowhere for the children everyone sleeps in their cars Egypt has allowed several hundred people to leave Gaza via the Rafa border crossing but most Gins are trapped Israel says it's ground forces have completely surrounded Gaza City they say their troops are advancing despite quote painful losses the militants are reported to have laid mines and booby traps in the area and have threatened to mount strong resistance the Israeli military says Gaza City is the center of hamas's Terror organization Israel launched its attacks on Gaza in response to the massacre by Hamas of more than 1,400 people in Israel and an IDF spokesperson gave more details of the new phase of the ground operation Israel Defense Forces Fighters have completed the encirclement of Gaza City the center of the Hamas terrorist organization in the last hours artillery and infantry along with the Air Force have been attacking bases headquarters concentration points and other Terror infrastructure used by Hamas and his terrorists so as Israel says its forces have encircled Gaza City I spoke earlier to military analyst Marina and I asked her if this means the war is entering a new phase good morning CLA well um Israel had announced yesterday that it started its phase three and it looks like this phase three will be encirclement or the siege of Gaza City because it's surrounded from all sides we don't know if Israel is going to leave a vent open for the civilians to escape this is a concern amongst others from the United States um in terms of the humanitarian cost but it would look like Israel is trying to weaken hamas's ability to resist probably before entering Gaza City itself and starting the um much dreaded Urban combat now the IDF has also said its soldiers are in close quarters combat with Hamas Fighters there can you describe for us what challenges and risks there are in an operation like this uh including to civilian life well that's probably the EST risk which has political ramifications because Israel would um lose support or or risk to lose support if too many civilians die during this operation however this is a nature of urban combat and unfortunately there is no one good way around it and the urban combat is very slow is very bloody it means they're fighting house by house having to clear everything from the basement to the rooftop and we have the added issue here of a multi m- layered tunnel system meaning that Hamas fighters who know it very well can just pop out in one place where the Israeli forces are not expecting them making it even more difficult and the Army has also now said it's encountering mines and booby traps um and that the militants have prepared themselves do you think the IDF will be surprised by their capabilities well I think IDF is understanding now the the capabilities that Hamas has and there was an encounter in 2014 so don't think it's a huge surprise besides those tactics are being used by um different Insurgent groups um when it comes to such scenarios they are trying to make it as difficult as it is for the opposing force to move forward and they might be using humans as a shield to make the operation even more challenging and I want to look at the broader Regional implications there's of course a lot of concern about this war spilling over we're already seeing attempts by the islamist houthi rebels in Yemen uh firing missiles and drones at Israel at this point How concerned would you be about wider spill over in the region I think it is very possible especially since Israel is already in Gaza so to say and we've heard the likes of Iran threatening that Israel would cross a red line so there is a possibility that Iran would get further involved in activating its proxies on the one hand another front could be open in the North of Israel but it also has broader Regional implications and implications for the entire world because as a grp sympathetic to Hamas or perhaps not so sympathetic but they're against Israel a calling for killing Jews um Americans and Brits because Americans and Brits are supporting Israel and have deployed reinforcements to the region so we should be worried that this war is not just going to be limited to the Middle East and tell us more about that Northern front I'm curious if you could spell out the specifics for us about what the concerns are at the Lebanese border well the concerns are is that Hezbollah might try to intensify its attacks and it might essentially spill over or even um try to conduct incursions however we don't know how far Iran is uh willing to risk losing its proxy by having it entering the war completely rather than being a distraction and rather than um trying to keep the Israeli forces tied in that region let's see bring it back across to our correspondent Rebecca riters in Tel Aviv Rebecca Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is in Israel uh what is Israel expecting to hear from him on this trip well Anthony blinkin is making his third visit to Israel today showing just how serious this situation is how important this is for the US he'll be bringing with him of course the message of solidarity with Israel that he's brought with him in his last visits and he's also going to be working towards getting the US hostages the US Jewel Nationals now I'm standing here at a monument for the hostages protest if you will uh from Israelis who were demanding that the hostages be able to be released and that this ground invasion of israels is preventing that from happening uh the other things on blinken's agenda today will of course uh be the next stages in this war he's going to be calling for these limited ceasefires these limited humanitarian ceasefires uh so that they can get humanitarian Aid into Gaza and some more of the at least the 7,000 juw Nationals that are listed uh give them passage outside of the Gaza Strip but he's also going to be here to look forward to what happens in a postwar uh Gaza who will be beginning the talks of who will be running the strip and looking at the next moves though it's very early days you've been hearing earlier in the program this now entering its third phase this war so I think the the postwar phase uh is still someway off so looking ahead to some of those major political questions that remain open um tell us about the military operations currently Israel's military has announced the complete encirclement of gaza's largest city yeah well we're were hearing it early in the program they've now completely encircled the city we do believe that they've completely cut off the main arterial roads from the north to the South as was thought was going to be part of their plan we know they've been calling for for weeks now for Citizens uh gazans in the the northern Gaza Strip to move to the South now any of the ones who remained any of the ones who stayed are going to be find it almost impossible to evacuate that area now and it's looks as though they're going to begin this ground this close combat ground um inside sorry hand hand-to-hand combat basically coming out of the tanks and moving uh into Gaza City itself now that's going to cause lots of problems and we may see the death hole of the Israeli military rise quite significantly when we get into this Urban Warfare it's very complicated Close Quarter fighting and you know Hamas know the territory very well their Fighters have a network of tunnels that they're able to use to pop out and surprise is the Israeli military we did see already the death toll of the Israeli military rise overnight that's standing at 23 at the moment the civilian death toll in Gaza still around the 9,000 Mark but we'll have some new figures later today uh the next phase looking to be bloody and exhausting and long indeed those numbers uh from the Hamas run uh Gaza health authority now as all this is happening Israel has announced that it is going to be sending gazin who are currently working in Israel back into besieged Gaza can you tell us a little bit more about this announcement yeah we heard that last night we're actually seeing that many have already been returned this morning CLA I'm not able to give you exact figures of how many people uh were from Gaza were inside Israel at the time but we know that around about 20,000 gazan work workers have permits to work inside Israel and many were separated from their families when this conflict began they weren't able to return into Gaza uh and now they're being forced to go back forced to go back and and and and now will now be in the besieged strip uh the the the the security announcement or the announcement that came along with this that there'll be no relationship between Gaza and Israel after this as I said we'll have to see its early days to know exactly what's going to happen in a post conflict world uh but at this stage those gazin seem to if not completely returned that will be happening in the next hours and what can you tell us uh about the current situation in the West Bank where tensions have been running High well the tensions have been running high in the West Bank uh well I mean they're always relatively High particularly in the last year 18 months CLA but since this conflict began there there's been a massive spike in tensions overnight we saw another quite large and long raid on the Janine Camp uh we believe that five people have been killed in F five Palestinians were killed in fighting there and we've seen a spike in settler violence as well yesterday it was a particularly bad day we saw around the Naas area many settlers coming down and burning property that's something else that's going to be on the agenda of U of Anthony blinkin when he's here today going to call for PE you know the the leaders here to be getting everybody to try and cool their Jets nobody wants to see a third front open up in the West Bank but at the moment we're seeing those tensions rise and of course that is the fear that that people are going to be so um exasperated there that this violence is going to continue and we could well see a front opening up on the West Bank Rebecca many thanks for your reporting that's Rebecca riters for us in Tel
