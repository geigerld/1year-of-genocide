kimim RV is the ambassador of Israel to the European Union and nato in Brussels and he's now joining me here at the European Parliament in Strasburg Mr Ambassador the parliament has uh debated the situation in Israel and Gaza of course the Hamas terror is rejected by all deputies but the parliament is also saying Israel should do a little bit more to protect civilians in Gaza what what do you say yeah what I'm saying is first of all we need to look how it started Hamas provoke a war the atrocities that they conduct cannot be forgotten and cannot be there cannot be any excuse for that Israel is acting according to International humanitarian law Israel is the war this war is not against the Palestinian people it's not against civilians it's not against H men women that are not involved it's only against Hamas activities and terrorists so we do all in our power to avoid to avoid harming un involved people and civilian nevertheless the European union says there is a already a humanitarian crisis in Gaza because the two million people are deprived of water food and so on and the you will now send if it's possible humanitarian Aid to GA strip so what can Israel do to avoid that we are not I'm not aware of any humanitarian crisis we are monitoring the situation there is no humanitarian crisis the movement of people is because we do not want to harm any uninvolved civilian this why Israel our uh Army and defense establishment call the population to move from areas that make some there might be harms so again the purpose of this warning that we will not harm any of people that are not involved un unfortunately the Hamas use those people as a human Shields they do not have they do not care for the population like the incident that we saw yesterday at the hospital where Hamas fir a rocket that hit or Islamic Jihad hit the hospital they they fire it from a PO area where civilian live in and it they hid their own hospital and they cause the deaths of hundreds of people this is the way that they act and they don't care for them yesterday was a success ful day because they succeed to sell the story that Israel is harming people and put pressure on Israel but we have a full evidence that it was done by Hamas and Islamic Jihad well Hamas is saying that Israel attacked the hospital in the European Union for example the head of the commission USA ferine also said the facts have to be established I mean of course you're the ambassador of Israel you tell your story Hamas tell the other story so what shall the public do there is only one story fact and we have a clear record of Hamas terrorist activist and we have a clear footage video of this rocket so there is no question mark about that there is no doubt about that and it's about time I'm not criticizing EU I'm just saying that I think that it's about time to listen I'm calling Europe and and and everybody watching us it's about time to believe and to strust Israel official statement and not Terror organization statement but we have the proof it's there is no question mark on that the EU says also that Israel of course has the right to self-defense and that their ground offensive will come in the next days maybe are you not afraid that there will be more pictures of maybe killed civilians in Gaza that then will they temper the the image and the cause of Israel around the world we are not now looking into image we are looking into what's happened and how to solve the problem and as long as Hamas is there the problem will stay forever we are fighting the war of Israel first and foremost but this this is also the fight for the Palestinian because as as long as Hamas is there they will not have any future so we I'm not going into the operational detail of what we plan and what we are not planning but Europe and the world need to understand what is this fight about and I want to tell you another thing is that we are very uh we appreciate very very much the support that we see from the you we appreciate very much that the first time maybe in our history that the first leader who come to show solidarity was the president of the commission Ula fond line and president of the parliament this is something that never happened before and it show how much the EU today have a strong leadership that saw support and solidarity without any Nuance you talked to a lot of parliamentarians here in Strasburg you even went to some of the groups and showed the pictures of the people that were slau Ed by Hamas in Israel um what was your reaction do you think this will the support might crumble if the operation drags on for very long we call on immediate release of those hostage among those hostage more than 200 people most of them are civilian babies wom old Holocaust survival all in all the Hamas this brutal Terror organization Isis type did not spare the life of anybody so we are calling for immediate release immediate release some of them among them are European citizens many of them so we want to show the face of those people and this is what we are doing there is a strong support and sympathy here to this because we all agree this should not happen this should not happen civilian should not be part of any any kind of of this this conflict Mr Ambassador can you give us a a sense of um the end game the aim Israel wants to achieve after Hamas has been defeated and is gone in Gaza Strip what will happen then and what what role could the EU play in that situation let me start with the opposite if Hamas will stay in any and they're not going to stay Gaza will never be recovered from that as long as Hamas is there Gaza will never recover this why I'm am saying that we fighting also for the Palestinian himself the end game is to eliminate Hamas his infrastructure the people who conduct this ter attack it's leadership we don't have any intention to stay there we by the way 20 years we almost 20 years we are not in Gaza this is this is a misconception about you know Siege or or or controlling Gaza Gaza is controlled by Kamas for more than 20 years so we don't have any intention to go back to Gaza the only intention that we have right now and plan and desire and we will do it is to wipe Hamas eliminate their capability the people who conduct these murders and their leadership that they will Hamas will not have after this war any capability to come back and control Gaza for many decades also the European Union has paid Aid to the Palestinian Authority and and also via Nos and the United Nations to GA strip should that continue after the operation we for years we call in the European Union and other International player to support the Palestinian Authority and to support the Palestinian people we are not we are not against the Palestinian we are not against the Palestinian Authority We call we encourage we in the past years we encourage the EU and other players to support the Palestinian economically and and in the last year we saw that the EU was the biggest donor of course we do not have a problem with that right now the US is uh viewing reviewing and we I think it's good to look into where this money goes and not goes but basically we are supporting any assistant for the economic assistant for the Palestinian thank you very much for your time
