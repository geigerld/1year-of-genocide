Israel's war on Hamas is having Ripple effects across the Middle East the conflict is rekindling tensions in Israel's neighbor to the North Lebanon with its fragile and divided population some in Lebanon support the Iran back has Bola which has threatened attacks against Israel other Lebanese fear their country which has been grappling with a severe economic crisis could be dragged into a fullscale war this Lebanese engineer is worried about about his future he is supposed to leave Beirut next week and start a new job in Saudi Arabia now he's not sure if that will be possible many airlines have suspended flights to Lebanon over security concerns and the country's state-owned airline has moved its aircraft to neighboring airports due to the growing violence on the Lebanese Israeli border can the country is in financial crisis so I decided to leave and I got a job opportunity in Saudi Arabia I should be traveling by the end of the month but now I'm worried that the airport will be closed our flight's cancelled I thought of leaving to a temporary destination right away but after considering the expenses I can't afford this option I'm anxious and I don't know what to the conflict in Gaza and Israel is driving a further wedge into lebanon's already divided Society fears are growing that tensions on lebanon's Southern border could escalate into a larger confrontation with Israel for some this is a nightmare we are scared of course we don't want conflicts and we are already in a crisis we're worried about engaging in a war the country is devastated and facing economic collapse We're Not Ready for War but it looks like we'll be affected by what's happening in Gaza Lebanon must not go to war we're not ready by any means the economic situation is terrible it's impossible to handle a war but across the street other Lebanese are organizing protests in support of Gaza some are even calling for military action against Israel we are all concerned and we should be unified if we don't support gazans today Israel will attack us tomorrow we are not scared of joining the fight it's our duty of course we support that Lebanon joins the battle because we are one people if we don't support them who will divided opinions among the public are a reflection of the political polarization in the country Lebanon has been without a president for a year now

prevent War but if it happens we will be faced with a shortage of Medicine fuel possibly internet Cuts also maintaining our hospitals food security and supply of wheat are great challenges that the government is tackling and we are seeking assistance from International organizations as fears of further conflict grow many countries have advised their citizens to leave Lebanon meanwhile like most Lebanese Muhammad is left with uncertainty and DW's Muhammad sha who filed that report joins us now from Beirut Muhammad Hezbollah has been exchanging daily fire with the Israeli Army across the Lebanon Israel border described to us the current situation along that border right now well the rounds of skirmishes and crossb shelling have become a daily routine on the Lebanese Israeli front it has remarkably increased in scale and geography over the past days since Israel evacuated thousands of Israelis from its northern border towns and uh on the other side the Benes who live in the southern towns near what is now a front line left their homes and moved north towards safer residents and and shelters this indeed uh contributed to the escalation of military operations and gave advantage to the Israeli Army and hasah to intensify and widen uh their strikes however at this point um this does not mean that the status quo on the lianes Israeli border it changed the fighting the actions and the reactions are still within the acknowledged um Rules of Engagement by both parties uh that we've witnessed uh since the round of violent clashes emerged on October uh 8th now senior representatives of Hamas and another uh islamist militant group in Gaza the Palestinian Islamic Jihad understand they've been holding talks with the leadership of Hezbollah uh Hezbollah based of course in Lebanon now they released a picture of one of these meetings yesterday what do we know about these meetings Muhammad well little information have come out of uh this meeting but truly a big significance now this Trio meeting between the head of hasah the head of Islamic Jihad and the vice head of Hamas Is Not Unusual in in Beirut but its timing is significant it's the first at least that we know of since the conflict in Gaza and Israel emerged in October 7th uh we have been seeing these type of meetings between hasah and his Regional allies right before the surprise attack that Hamas launched on Israel this again is a coordination meeting at least that's what media sources close to hasbullah uh uh said we know that all three parties receive fund uh uh logistic and political support from one backer Iran as they are part of the so-called resistance axis they have always talked about sharing information and being part of one military and uh political uh kind of um operation room they were also clear about engaging in a strategy that unifies the fields of confrontation with Israel and the West as they say Muhammad thank you very much uh for bringing us up to date there
