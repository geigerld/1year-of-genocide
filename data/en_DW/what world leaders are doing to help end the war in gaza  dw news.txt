Arab leaders have gathered in Saudi Arabia for an emergency Summit on Gaza Palestinian president mmud Abbas has said his people face a genocidal war and want International protection Arab nations are expected to issue a joint call for an end to Israel's bombardment of Gaza the leaders of Syria and Iran are among those also attending I'd like to welcome now uh Georgio cafiero CEO of Gulf State analytics a Washington DC based geopolitical risk consultancy uh sir this is supposed to be an emergency meeting but it's happening well over a month into the war so why now well is the humanitarian disasters in Gaza worsen by the minute and now in Gaza the death toll has as of yesterday surpassed 11,000 it's very clear that this conflict is prolonging and and anger all over the Arab Islamic world is intensifying and pressure is more and more pressure is coming down on governments of all these different countries in the Arab and Islamic world to take some action and I think the summit in Saudi Arabia today highlighted this can we expect any real outcome from this emergency meeting of Arab and Muslim states I am somewhat pessimistic while I think it was important for these countries to come together and to give a unified call for a ceasefire and for humanitarian Aid to Gaza the fact of the matter is that as long as Israel is receiving support from the United States it will be able to continue uh this monstrous bombing campaign of Gaza which as I said a moment ago has resulted in over 11,000 uh deaths in the besieged enclave and I'm not so sure that these Arab and Muslim majority countries have the leverage that would be necessary to incentivize Israel to stop there are of course cards that could play uh when it comes to oil Investments economic ties with the United States but I don't imagine these countries playing those cards to try to Leverage The try to leverage their influence to pressure the us into pressuring Israel I I don't expect that to happen I think this is a little bit more about rhetoric than action unfortunately Giorgio as you surely know there has been many discussions at this point about other actors in the region getting involved uh much more deeply than they already are in this conflict How likely is that to happen we can say that the longer that this crisis PR belongs the greater risk there is that the conflict and the violence will spill over into more parts of the Middle East possibly into Africa and so that's a very real concern and when people talk about the need for a ceasefire it's important to keep in mind what's at stake if there is not a ceasefire in Washington and many Western capitals there are very grave concerns about the possibility of Iran getting more involved I think that's certainly possible but also I think from tan we've seen quite a bit of restraint I think the Iranians know that there is quite a bit for their country to lose if it would have uh some sort of direct allout war with Israel so I think the Iranians have certainly been cautious but to repeat the longer that this conflict prolongs in Gaza there is a higher chance of more countries such such as Iran and also non-state actors that are tied to Iran such as the houthis and Yemen getting more involved the US said uh the Palestinian Authority should have a role in Gaza and the occupied West Bank when the fighting stops is that something the Arab states would welcome I think in the region there's a lot of skepticism about that idea we know that Palestinian Authority is seen by many Palestinians and many throughout the region as being um just basically partners of the Israeli occupation the Palestinians do not really see this body as having much legitimacy and I think it would have many problems if it were to be installed in Gaza I think among Arab Statesmen there's kind of a view that they want to not bear respon responsibility for what is going on in Gaza and additionally this talk of having Arab forces on the ground in Gaza I think that's something that Arab states are going to be very opposed to and will do everything they can uh to refuse any plan such as that our thanks to Giorgio cafiero CEO of Gulf State analytics appreciate it thank you European leaders have ALS o been speaking about the conflict France's president Emanuel mcon has called for ceasefire to ease the suffering of civilians in Gaza the German Chancellor Olaf Schultz urged Israel to abide by the rules of War but also said it's important Hamas be defeated it's necessary for us to show solidarity with Israel after the barbaric Hamas attacks for us to mutually ensure that Israel of of course sticks to the rules and the way in which it defends itself and that is how we see it and at the same time we make sure that humanitarian Aid can reach Gaza for that to happen there can and must be pauses that make it possible for the injured to leave Gaza but at the same time it is also right that Israel succeeds in defeating Hamas as they would otherwise only continue where they left off with the barbaric attacks on children and the elderly in Israel staying with Germany's role in the Middle East crisis a German foreign minister is in rala to meet with Palestinian leaders and Elena burbach will also hold talks with her Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen in tviv later this evening the trip comes on the heels of a meeting with Gulf State leaders including the United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia and qat barbach discussed efforts to free German hostages being held by Hamas as well as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza this is her third visit to the region since the October 7 Terror attacks because the Americans came with let's go back to DW special correspondent Aya Ibraham in Jerusalem Aya the German foreign minister is talking to Palestinian officials right now we understand how positive a sign is it that Palestinians themselves are being brought into the shuttle diplomacy revolving around the Gaza conflict well if we're talking about a larger more sustainable solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians I think there's Now recognition that it won't be solved without the involvement of Palestinians so it's certainly positive that analena barbach is meeting with officials from the Palestinian Authority as well however when it comes to the current um air strikes War rockets that Hamas is firing from Gaza into Israel it's it's not very likely that the people that analina barbach met with today can help with that they simply the the the Palestinian Authority has no control over the Gaza Strip they are in fact Rivals of uh uh Hamas and have not had any control over the strip since 2007 and so that's not really uh you know the role that she's expected to play with that visit today however um she we've also seen how um the US Secretary of State in a visit to in a recent visit to the region meet with um with officials from the Palestinian Authority because Israel the US European allies have said that Hamas will no longer cannot be in control of the Gaza Strip once this conflict is over and so there are now questions well can the Palestinian Authority somehow step in and be part of a a political future for the Gaza uh strip as a previous guest mentioned there's a lot of skepticism around that the Palestinian Authority is often times seen as uh weak uh not very effective and um as also being part of uh the occupation on uh Palestinians but certainly they are an important partner uh at the moment and important for uh Germany to continue having continue involving them um in dialogue as you know we inch Clos closer and closer to the urgency of that question well what happens to the ga to the Gaza Strip after the war what expectations are the Palestinians likely to have from bearbox talks and wider diplomacy in the region there is absolutely no expectation that Germany alone is going to be able to solve this it has to be able to act in concert with European allies um and uh uh the United States uh uh as well um however uh Germany is seen at least among the Palestinians a siding with uh Israel and uh German officials have iterated time and time again uh their support for Israel for its security for its right to defend itself and of course its right to exist this is not a these are by no means controversial questions uh for uh Germany or German politicians and so um it's not expected that Germany alone will be able to solve this however uh Germany has promised uh more aid about 50 uh million euros more uh since the October 7th attack to Palestinians so Germany also plays a really important humanitarian role when it comes to helping the Palestinians that isya Ibraham in Jerusalem many thanks Aya for more I'm joined Now by DW political correspondent Thomas Sparrow who's here in the studio with me Thomas uh what is German foreign minister barbach hoping to achieve with this trip there are immediate goals that Germany and by the way not only Germany has you will see German leaders as they've done in the past speak of humanitarian pauses not necessarily a ceasefire but pauses in plural so that humanitarian Aid can reach Gaza that's one of the sort of immediate goals that the German foreign minister has but there are more long-term or medium-term Solutions and Alena babok has been speaking of widening the picture of understanding what can happen also in the medium to long term and that's one of the main reasons why she's also talking to Palestinian leaders Germany has for a very long time supported the idea of a two-state solution and from that perspective it's important to also engage in dialogue not only with the Israelis not only with the Palestinians but also with wider Partners in the region and this explains why ala Bok is now once again traveling to the region but how much influence does Germany have I have mentioned it and I agree wholeheartedly with what she says because it's not only about Germany itself having an influence in the region it's about Germany playing a role as part of the EU and as part of the wider International Community so if you ask specifically what role Germany has Germany plays a rather minor role in itself but Germany as part of the wider European Community does indeed play a wider role when it comes to achieving these immediate goals like finding those humanitarian pauses but also maybe those medium to longer goals which also involve the idea of a possible two-state solution which involve having Israelis and Palestinians live at peace together in the region the actors in this conflict in short see Germany as a big Force within the European Union absolutely absolutely that's the case what has Germany's position been since the conflict began in fact analena Bok describes that as a as a dilemma because Germany has very clearly identified itself on the side of Israel Germany and the German government in particular say they have a special responsibility towards the security of uh Israel that's something that they've stated time and time again yet at the same time and we heard that earlier from the Chancellor Olaf Schulz it is becoming more important for Germany and for other European countries to also state that Israel has to abide by the rule by the rules of war and that essentially means respecting civilians that essentially means allowing humanitarian Aid to enter Gaza so you have these two sides of the story on the one hand supporting Israel a very clear support but on the other one also also making sure that Israel respects the rules of war in this war so that is is a rather tricky situation for the for the German government especially because the German government really from the beginning positioned itself in the side of Israel and Aya already mentioned that as well this means that it is necessary also for the German government to explain that position to the Palestinians so that's also another reason why alok is doing this right now what does the everyday German think about this particular conflict how worried are they they are concerned about the the conflict they are concerned about the war that's something that by the way uh several polls have revealed also Nationwide polls and they are not only concerned about what's happening in the region they're also concerned about possible implications here in the country here in Germany because what you're seeing is a lot of tension here among different sides among different population groups and you're also seeing an increase in anti-Semitism uh here in this country you can imagine that because of Germany's historical responsibility because of Germany's uh interest also in the region any rise in anti-Semitism is something that caused cuses a lot of shock and a lot of alarm so you're clearly seeing that not only officials not only the government is trying to make more to deal with that Rising anti-Semitism but it's also something that's affecting people in this country and in fact many have also said in Nationwide polls that they're concerned about this increase in anti-Semitism DW political correspondent Thomas Sparrow many many thanks and of course you'll stay with us as we await hearing from the German foreign
