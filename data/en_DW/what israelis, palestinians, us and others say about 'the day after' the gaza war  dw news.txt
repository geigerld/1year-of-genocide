diplomats have been discussing various scenarios for Gaza after the conflict is over but there's widespread disagreement even within Israel about what Gaza would look like the day after shuttle diplomacy US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin just spent a week in the Middle East hustling from Capital to Capital Consulting with Israel and other allies he laid down some ground rules for a post-war scenario in today's meetings I was also uh crystal clear Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow they must not be pressed to leave Gaza not everyone in the Israeli government agrees two far-right ministers have called for renewed settlements in Gaza and for other countries to absorb Palestinian refugees defense minister yuav Galant put forth his own Vision earlier this month he said no Israeli civilians would be in Gaza Galant said Gaza residents are Palestinian therefore Palestinian bodies will be in charge with the condition that there will be no hostile actions or threats against the state of Israel he stressed that Israel would maintain overall Security Control in Gaza that plan has not been backed by other members of the cabinet or by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu with so much disagreement what does everyone actually want in postwar Gaza Israel wants security from attacks and says there should be no role for Hamas the US and Saudi Arabia want the Palestinian Authority which governs the West Bank to also run Gaza in a United Palestinian government the Saudis say they want to normalize relations with Israel but that depends on the establishment of a Palestinian State the US and Saudi proposals face significant obstacles one is the unpopularity of the PA among Palestinians its leader Mahmud abas is extremely unpopular recent polls put him at 11% and hamas's popularity has grown since the war started Netanyahu has rejected a role for the PA as well but he's agreed to one key us demand Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population Israel is fighting Hamas terrorists not the Palestinian population Netanyahu has however repeatedly dismissed the possibility of Palestinian in statehood well let's look at Future options with Simon maban who's professor of international politics at England's Lancaster University he has a particular expertise in the Middle East welcome back to at DW Professor so medium to long term uh what do you think post-war Gaza is likely to look like well I think what we will be seeing is a very very long struggle to determine both the political nature of the postwar state the post occupation State perhaps um but we'll also be dealing with a very very long-term uh rebuilding process rebuilding the key institutions the infrastructure the the necessary features of life in Gaza and these will go hand inand but they're going to be very very complicated to go hand inand and how one addresses one issue will directly affect the other they are deeply politicized issues and it's going to be a very very fraught very tense struggle to try and mitigate the the concerns and amarate the worries of everyone so even the day after the bombing stops the next months possibly even years are still going to be miserable for for people living in Gaza yeah certainly uh let's go back to before October the 7th before those those awful incidents the terrorist attacks in Israel the devastating bombardment life in Gaza was incredibly precarious it was fraud it was difficult it was under an occupation it was under a blockade it was very difficult to get the basic things into Gaza that people needed for daily life and right now your your uh package just showed that 85% of gazans have been forced from their homes a lot of those homes have been demolished have been destroyed in fighting and so there's going to be a very difficult struggle to rebuild schools homes hospitals the basic infrastructure that people need on top of the broader political issues that that we've been talking about so let's look at political control Hamas grown in popularity uh since all this happened poll of Palestinians in Gaza indicated that 90% of Palestinians want president m mmud Abbas to resign so the the US idea of the Palestinian Authority being in charge of of Gaza certainly sounds like a non-starter yeah I don't think there are all that many who are in favor of Mahmud Abbas becoming the the the person ruling Gaza or at least responsible for taking the day-to-day decisions about life in Gaza the Israelis certainly Benjamin Netanyahu isn't too keen on that idea uh there are many who perhaps like the idea of the PA of the Palestinian Authority taking control over life in Gaza but much as we're seeing in the West Bank abass does not have that popular support that popular mandate that previous leaders of the PA of the PLO such as Yad Arafat had and that is a big problem if there is a democratic legit deficit or a legitimacy deficit that makes governing that makes politics incredibly difficult final word then on Israel's place in the Middle East as a result of everything that happened since October the 7th it's antagonized it its biggest backer the US it's upset countries like Saudi Arabia in the region who'd been looking to normalize relations and of course there's Iran sitting there waiting for the worst to happen how do you do you anticipate this conflict uh having affected Israel's future position in the Middle East I think what we're seeing is that the there has been an opening up of deep seated latent fishes deep schisms that have been there across the Middle East that the diplomats have been working incredibly hard to address to try and find some sort of resolution to we see that with Saudi and Iran their normalization we see it with the Saudis and the houthis we see it with the Israelis and the Saudis we see lots of diplomatic initiatives going on but what's happened with October the 7th and its aftermath is that a lot of those frustrations that anger those tensions have come to the fall once more now I do think normalization with the Saudis will take place I think there is a lot invested in that it's a matter of time but for now we are in a very precarious position where there are lots of different moving Parts there's a lot of anger a lot of frustration and that means a lot of combustible elements thank you for that Professor Simon maban from Lancaster University thank you now let's get some analysis with Dr Julie Norman she's an associate professor in politics and international relations at University College London has also authored several books about the Palestinian political resistant and is currently writing a book on contemporary history in Gaza Dr Norman what title would you give the current chapter in gaza's history well I think one of the only words we can use right now is is Crisis obviously this crisis started uh on October 7th for many Israelis but the way that the war has been conducted since has just really been an unprecedented level of of Crisis for gazin not only in the casualty rate that we keep hearing going up every day in in the headlines but also of course the displacement the rising rates of Famine of health concerns and just a complete Devastation of infrastructure in a society that um is going to be very difficult to rebuild from afterwards right now of course there's also worries about crisis expanding even throughout the region and and all these crisis of course are just having the most effect on un civilians in all of these communities and that's something that's going to be very difficult to recover from now the current War erupted of course after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th did you see signs of this escalation earlier well obviously we everyone who follows the Israel Palestine conflict this is not um near the first time that we've seen uh an episode but the scale of the episode on October 7 the scale of the attack I would say was surprising and was rather unprecedented with that said there have been ongoing tensions between Israel and Gaza for decades and especially between Israel and Hamas over the last 15 years we've seen a series of what are often called the Gaza Wars um starting in 2008 2009 another very significant one in 2014 and other punctuations as well some of those in hindsight are um much more smaller scale than what we're seeing now but a similar sense of um moving in from israeli's perspective for security concerns trying to go after Hamas but at the same time devastating many civilian communities and infrastructure in the meantime and so all these things I would say have been building for for quite a while now let's talk about Gaza after the war we've seen several options that are on the table there in our report what do you think it will look like it's extremely difficult to see that right now as the report noted there are different options that have been put forward as a result of uh Anthony blinken's shuttle diplomacy last week we have seen real commitment actually from numerous Partners in the region to assist with the Reconstruction but that's predicated on the idea that there will be some kind of Pathway to Palestinian statehood and that's something that Israel is just simply not going for right now the US would like to see some role for the Palestinian Authority the governing body in the West Bank but has also been noted they are extremely weak and have very little little legitimacy um publicly so I think we'll probably see a couple different phases after the war my sense is that Israel will maintain a security presence for quite a while probably some sort of transitional Government after that but the real question is if there's actually going to be some real substantive change that gazin want that Palestinians want that could actually lead to some kind of statehood that would actually address some of the deeper roots of the conflict now do you see any circumstances under which this statehood may still happen I think it's very difficult to see that right now at the same time anytime we do have a crisis like this we do try and look at it as an inflection point can this somehow change the status quo and at least get us talking in new ways about statehood about a two-state solution these kinds of models that honestly have been on the table for quite a while now but have not had the momentum um I think we could maybe talk about a a 3 to 5% chance of that as composed to opposed to a 1% chance before all this so it's still very slim but I do think it's important to note the fact that the US the Palestinian Authority most Partners in the region most Arab states are now talking seriously about that um and it's a real question of what that might look like on the ground and what kind of buying it can have most importantly from Palestinians and Israelis Dr Julie Norman there many thanks for sharing your expertise with us thank
