seated the setting is open the cours meet this morning to hear the single round of oral argument of the state of Israel on the request submitted by the Republic of South Africa on May 10 2024 for the indication of additional provisional measures and the modification of previous provisional measures in the case concerning application of the convention on the prevention and Punishment of the crime of genocide in the Gaza Strip South Africa versus Israel I now give the floor to the co-agent of Israel Mr gilam Noam you have the floor Sir Mr President members of the Court it is an honor to appear before you once again on behalf of the state of Israel this case even by its very name the application of the convention on the of genocide in the Gaza strep suggests an inversion of reality it has given rise to South Africa's egregious and repeated efforts to bring Israel before this court through the obscene exploitation of the most sacred convention South Africa presents the court yet again for the first time within the scope of less than 5 months with a picture that is completely divorced from the facts and circumstances Israel is engaged in a difficult and tragic armed conflict South Africa ignores this factual context which is essential in order to comprehend the situation and also ignores the applicable legal framework of international humanitarian law it makes a mockery of theous charge of genocide as Israel has previously stated before this court when dealing with the law facts matter truth should matter words must retain their meaning calling something a genocide again and again does not make it genocide repeating a lie does not make it true here in the peace Palace it cannot be otherwise Mr President Israel received notification of this hearing on Monday less than 4 days ago while it was observing a particularly painful National Remembrance Day this notification came as a great surprise because the court had already invited Israel to submit its observations on South Africa's request in writing by Wednesday of this week Israel Was preparing its written observations when the court suddenly announced that it would hold an oral hearing instead in seeking to accommodate the Court's decision Israel immediately reached out to its legal team so as to guarantee that it could properly properly be represented by Council that proved impossible as Israel's Le lead council is sheep this week and other Council were likewise unable to come to the ha on such short notice for this reason Israel wrote to the court in good faith asking that the hearing be rescheduled to next week it explained that the dates fixed dates fixed by the court significantly significantly impacted Israel's ability to be sufficiently well represented and the fundamental principle of equality of arms Israel's request was rejected the date of this hearing remained that which South Africa had expressly requested the regrettable result is that Israel is not represented today by its chosen team of council and Advocates the equality of the parties and the administration of justice have been severely undermined out of respect for this court the same respect that Israel has shown through all these past several months Israel's co-agents have nonetheless traveled to appear at this hearing South Africa's complaint yesterday that Israel has failed to respond to its current request is therefore wholly unfounded Israel expects that the court will appreciate the predicament that Israel has been placed in this is all the more so given that South Africa yesterday quite radically changed the terms of its requested provisional measures which Israel has been given less than 24 hours to respond to Mr President members of the Court bearing all that in mind allow me to recall four basic facts that South Africa continues to conceal it is highly regrettable to say the least that these basic facts must once again be stated in this Great Hall first Israel is engaged in a war it did not want and did not start it is under attack and fighting to defend itself and its citizens since the hor horrific Onslaught that began on 7 October 2023 which saw thousands of Israeli citizens brutally slaughtered mutilated raped and injured and 254 women men and children taking hostage into Gaza Hamas and other terrorist organization in Gaza continue to attack Israel including by indiscriminate rocket fire into Israeli cities and towns they have vowed to try and repeat the atrocities of 7 October many times over since the beginning of the hostilities more than 10,000 Rockets have been fired from the Gaza Strip towards Israel with the aim of killing as many Israelis as possible the last two weeks alone so 278 rockets launched damage of an unprecedented scale has been caused to Israeli civilian homes and infrastructure with entire communities destroyed approximately 60,000 residents of towns in southern Israel remain displac from their homes 7 months on it may be years before they are able to return to their homes and rebuild their communities Sirens continue to go off across the country as Rockets missiles and drones are launched against Israel from several fronts Rafa in particular is a focal point for ongoing terrorist activity it is a stronghold for hamas's operatives with several battalions belonging to the Rafa Brigade entrenched in the area also present in Rafa is an intricate underground tunnel infrastructure that runs underneath the city and provides provides ample space for operatives command and control rooms and military equipment nearly 700 tunnel shafts have been identified in Rafa from reach approximately 50 tunnels cross into to Egypt these tunnels are used by Hamas to supply itself with weapons and ammunition it could potentially be used to smuggle out of Gaza hostages or Hamas senior operatives since the start of the present hostilities more than 1,400 Rockets were fired from Rafa alone including more than 120 in the last 2 weeks approximately 600 launch sites were identified in the Rafa area many of which hidden within or in close proximity to civilian infrastructure information regarding rocket launches from Rafa during the current conflict can be found in tab one of your judges folder is Israeli hostages are also being held in RAF by their ctors in fact Israeli forces managed to rescue two Israeli hostages from Rafa on 11 February 2024 I recall that South Africa filed a request with this court the next day for provisional measures that would prevent Israel from taking military action in Rafa and this request was right rightfully denied South Africa purports to describe Rafa as a last refuge for civilians in Gaza while many civilians have indeed evacuated to Rafa over the past few months the fact remains that the city of Rafa also serves as a military stronghold for Hamas which continues to pose a significant ific threat to the state of Israel and its citizens in tab two of your folders you can find a map showing locations of Rocket sites tunnel shafts and command and control sites embedded in civili in the civilian population in Rafa South Africa warns this court that I quote if Rafa Falls so too does Gaza once again however the reality is exactly the opposite only by bringing down hamas's military stronghold in Rafa will Palestinians be liberated from the clench grip of a murderers terrorist regime and the road to peace and prosperity May finally be paved the reality is that any state put in Israel's difficult position would do the same the right of defense against the brutality of the Hamas terrorist organization cannot be oub it is an inherent right afforded to Israel as it is to any state Israel is committed as it must be to realizing this right in accordance with the law which is why it has worked diligently to enable the protection of civilian even as Hamas seeks deliberately to Ender endanger them to deny Israel this basic right would be to suggest shockingly that the most fundamental right afforded to all states should be withheld from one this is an unthinkable outcome that would tell Israeli citizens and the hostages that they are not deserving of protection of life itself and tells the Israeli state that it will be treated unequally in a manner that is at odds with the most basic of legal principles Israel is acutely aware of the large number of civilians that are concentrated in RAF it is also acutely aware of hamas's efforts to use these civilians as a shield that is why its battalions are present there that is why its Rockets are there that is why hostages are there we do not wish harm to these civilians as Hamas does that is precisely why Israel is taking steps to try and contend with the massive complexity that such a situation presents that is why there has not been a large scale assault on RAF but rather specific limited and localized operations prefaced with evacuation efforts and support for humanitarian activities does Israel face complex operational challenges in Gaza certainly but can we imagine a situation where a state does not take military action to protect its civilians when they are Under Fire and can we imagine a count of law a court of law sorry telling a state that the law prevents it from defending itself from Attack this is simply unattainable when alas stood at this podium in January Israeli hostages had been in captivity for almost 100 days at the time this seemed inconceivable yet the hostages have now been in captivity for over 7even months more than 130 children women and men including the sick and elderly have now been hand in Gaza for 224 days Inc communic and in inhumane conditions among them is 23 years yearold her Goldberg polling HH was abducted from the Nova music festival in raim severely injured on 25th April 2024 Hamas released a video of hsh in it he is seen with an amputated arm which was blown off by Hamas terrorist he is alive he needs medical treatment at least 36 of those who were taken hostage on October 7 have been confirmed dead and their bodies are still held in the Gaza strep among them are Yosi sharabi a 53-year-old father of three and it Veri who is 38y old both of them were kidnapped from their homes in bayy on 14 January 2024 in the display of pure and unadulterated cruelty Hamas made public a video of the two and of a third hostage 26 year year-old Noah aramani who was also kidnapped from the music festival promising to announce on the following day which of the three are alive shortly thereafter it was confirmed that Yosi and D Tai had both been killed after 102 days in brutal captivity additional information regarding hostages still held by Hamas can be found at top three of your judges folder it remains unclear how many more innocent victims have been killed at the hands of Kamas simply put this situation is unconscionable it is unbearable for the parents watch videos of their young daughters bruised and bleeding paraded before cheering crowds in Gaza and we have heard Hing accounts told by Survivor released from Gaza of the torture and sexual violence they suffered at the hand of their captors and it is intolerable for a nation obligated to defend its citizens and wishing for their return this court has called for the immediate release of the hostages but to no avail it is Israel's right and obligation to defend them and all its citizens from the evil that was Unleashed on them on 7th October and since then any state would do the same Mr President members of the court I next turn to the second fact that must be kept in mind Hamas with whom Israel is engaging in this armed conflict is not a party to these proceedings Israel is engaged in an intense armed conflict with a wrath jihadist terrorist organization one that is not only targeting Israeli civilians but is also using Palestinian civilians to Shield itself in utter disregard for their lives or for the law by exploiting the genocide convention South Africa is suggesting a convol a convol Ed reading of international law under which any armed conflict could be brought before the court it seeks once again to obtain provisional measures that would bind only Israel and not its adversary the Absurd result would be that Israel would be denied its inherent right to defend itself Hamas for its part would remain free to continue committing its horrific crimes the purp purpose of the genocide convention is not to have the court supervise the conduct of armed hostilities by parties to the conflict by the assertion of the genocide rather the convention and subsequently this court jurisdiction is limited to the Grave crime of genocide I am compelled to restate once again that there is a tragic war going on but there is no genocide yet particularly at the provisional measure stage when the evidentiary threshold is such that the applicant is not required to provide proof of its allegations or the existence of specific intent to commit genocide there is a danger that the court will find itself engaged in micromanagement of operational aspects of an armed conflict this is what South Africa has been asking the court to do judge ad do Barack warned precisely of this danger when the court handed out it its decision on South Africa's third request for provisional measures You observe that I quote the court has accepted South Africa's invitation to become the micromanager of an armed conflict and use the genocide Convention as an excuse to rule on the basis of international humanitarian law managing an armed conflict under the genocide convention is a dangerous Endeavor especially when one of the belligerant is not a party to the convention this remains true when considering South Africa's fourth request Mr President members of the Court this brings me to third basic fact that must not be ignored South Africa prepars to come before you yet again as a guardian of humanity in fact it has a clear ulterior motive when it asks you to order Israel to stay away from Rafa and to withdraw all its troops from Gaza it does so in order to obtain military Advantage for its Ally Hamas which it does not wish to see defeated it is this reason that South Africa continues to abuse the genocide convention this court and the procedure of provisional measure for provisional measures just 6 days ago on 11 May 2024 only a day after it submitted the present request for additional provisional measures South Africa hosted a Hamas delegation in Johannesburg South Africa's foreign minister herself met with Hamas Representatives they did not use the meeting to urge Hamas to release the hostages to stop targeting Israeli civilians to seize using human Shields to seize operating from within and nearby hospitals un facilities and other protected sites they apparently met to discuss their continued campaign against Israel court and on the ground Mr President members of the Court Safa is not interested in the truth nor is it interested in law or Justice once again it is exploited in the court and its authority to issue measures it is in no rush to reach the merits of this case when it will have to substantiate its Bas baseless claims with evidence that simply does not exist Israel for its part has shown nothing but respect for the judicial process and for the law more generally as the court will recall on 28th April 2024 Israel provided the court with a lengthy report detailing inalia the numerous steps that Israel actively and effectively taken to address the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip consistent with the court previous orders rather than first responding to Israel's report South Africa rushed to submit yet another request for provisional measures its fourth for fear that hamas's last significant stronghold will fall Hamas itself has repeatedly rejected every offered for a ceasefire on 25th April 2024 8 18 states called upon Hamas to release immediately the hostages still being held in Gaza they said and I quote we emphasize that the deal on the table to release the hostages would bring an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza that would facilitate a surge of additional necessary humanitarian assistant assistance to be delivered throughout Gaza and lead to the credible end of hostilities 4 days ago on 13 May 2024 the United States national security adviser noted in the same vein that and I quote there could be a ceasefire tomorrow if Hamas simply released women wounded and early hostages Israel put a forward leaning proposal on the table the world should be calling on Hamas to come back to the table and accept a deal South Africa spoke yesterday about rebuilding a viable Palestinian society yet South Africa's actions speak louder than it its words by its actions it is clear that South Africa wishes to see Hamas remain in control of the Palestinians in Gaza and to Destin them to misery it is Israel that wishes to see a different future to Gaza one in which Palestinians and Israelis can both live in peace Hamas the genocidal terrorist organization will stop at nothing to prevent that Mr President members of the Court this brings me to the fourth fact that the court must not lose sight of as is the case with all armed conflicts incidents involving alleged violations of the rules regulating the conduct of hostilities may occur this reality is not unique to Israel no state is infallible Israel's independent and robust legal system addresses all allegations of misconduct including in the current hostilities they must not be thrown before this court in the form of facts and conclusion and as evidence of something they are not armed conflict is not a synonym for genocide South Africa mentions some individual incidents reported in the media and attempts to present them as evidence of unlawful policies yet exceptional incidents are just that exceptional they do not evidence a policy of illegal Behavior let alone a policy of genocide and then also cannot be cided as fact until a proper examination is carried out not every media report reflects facts or incidents correctly or in their full context Israel has been and remains committed to acting in accordance with its International legal obligations including those under International humanitarian law and the convention Israel has in place the necessary mechanisms to examine and investigate allegations of wrongdoing by its military forces and to ensure accountability for violations of the law information about these mechanisms and their activity since the commencement of hostilities has been provided by Israel in both the report of 26 February 2024 and a report of 28 April 2024 it Bears repeating before the court today that since the beginning of the hostilities 55 criminal investigations has have been opened by the military Advocate General with respect to incidents that raise Prima fesi Reasonable Suspicion of criminal misconduct in addition the fact finding an assessment mechanism a permanent independent and professional mechanism in charge of examining exceptional incidents is in the process of addressing hundreds of incidents from the current conflict with respect to various public statements as I stressed in January before the court the Israeli legal system knows how to draw a line between statements that are troubling and even obscene but still fall within the right of freedom of speech in a Democratic Society and those statements which go beyond this that right Israel's reports have also outlined the steps taken by Israel's law enforcement agencies to examine dozens of statements made in the context of the current hostilities in order to assertain whether legal steps are warranted it was recently decided that some cases justifi the promotion of criminal proceedings at the same time since the outset of these proceedings South Africa has consistently cheric statements or taking others out of context in an attempt to attribute to Israel the intent to commit genocide taking advantage of the law evidentiary Threshold at the provisional measure stage it does so in the present request as well attributing to Israel Alle genocidal aims and acts based on statements clearly calling for victory over Hamas and for its destruction Israel has made repeatedly clear that the policy and instructions for conducting the hostilities stem from the decisions of the ministerial committee on National Security Affairs and the war cabinet and not from various social media accounts or interviews as Miss Kaplan turjman will explain the decision of the Israeli cabinet and their implementation on the ground leave no doubt that South Africa's allegations regarding genocide are completely and utterly baseless Israel's law enforcement authorities also act to counter Israeli protest protesters who block the transfers transfer of aid from Israel to Gaza the Israeli police secures coordinated convoys during their passage in Israel with respect to the incident of May 13 during which protesters caused damage to Aid Drugs the Israeli police is prioritizing the the investigation which was assigned to a special Investigation Unit it has already resulted in the investigation of several suspects and Witnesses the authorities are acting in this regard and will continue to act in order to investigate and prosecute if appropriate and to ensure the continued effective and efficient transfer of Aid as part of a Lessons Learned process an improved mechanism was adopted by the police and the IDF to ensure the safety of the convoys finally even during hostilities the door of Israel's high court of justice a central pillar of Israel's robust and inde dependent legal system are open to those who seek to challenge the actions of Israel's government this includes non-governmental organizations Nos and individuals who are not Israeli citizens and residents if they are potentially affected by such actions in fact Israel's high court of justice is currently reviewing a petition submitted by a number of Israeli NGS concerning the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip the court is reviewing the compliance of the Israeli government's policy with both International humanitarian law and Israeli law in its response to the petition the state has submitted extensive briefs and has participated in two public oral hearings before a senior three judge panel it has presented in detail the effort it is undertaking to alleviate the humanitarian situation an additional statement will be submitted to the court within the next few days concerning inter Alia the operation in RAF as I stated before this court in January 2024 even when the canons were in Gaza the law is not silent Israel's legal system and its domestic mechanisms are a testament to this Mr President members of the court let me now say something about the weakness of South Africa's allegations in its Council bered Israel yesterday for casting as Persians at what it called credible information provided by South Africa but the sad truth is that South Africa sites hateful social media accounts and unsubstantiated news reports in support of its claims surely this cannot pass an additional flow in this regard is South Africa's heavy Reliance on documents prepared by Third parties or under the opes of the United Nations when these cannot be said to constitute sufficient evidence of a reliable quality indeed the court has itself had occasion to observe that you reports may only be of such quality I quote to the extent that they are of probative value and are corroborated if necessary by other credible sources the court moreover stated that and I quote the precise evidentiary value accorded to any report including those produced by United Nations entities also depends on the methodology and amount of research underlying it its preparation it is important to cl to clarify Israel does not underestimate the reports of the UN and other sources we study them draw conclusions and lessons in the appropriate cases however statements from such reports should not be accepted automatically especially in a complex combat reality these words of caution are of particular significance in the present case as the materials cited by South Africa have been prepared without access to relevant and necessary information including that held by Israel and often without any attempt to access such information they frequently rely on Hamas sources or on those subject to Hamas intimidation one striking example which gives serious cause for alarm is that even un Ocha which has so far pared pared information generated by Hamas run agencies in Gaza regarding fatalities has recently started to accept that the information coming out of Gaza is flowed it highlighted that more than 10,000s of the fac fatalities declared by Hamas are unnamed and that's unverifiable concurrently it revised dramatically the number of verifiable fatalities of women and children fatalities to approximately half than was previously presented and stop parting the baseless claim that 70% of the casualties are women and children it turns out that the data that the UN were using and that South Africa was has presented to this code as true was wrong while the number of overall fatalities has not changed the breakdown is crucial Hamas has been concealing the number of militants in its unverified lists of Palestinian casualties hamas's lists also contains contain persons who died from reasons unrelated to IDF actions such as fire of terrorist organizations and show many irregularities in reported age gender and ID numbers in this way an armed conflict can easily be portrayed as genocide as we have stated every civilian death is a tragedy moreover overall fatality counts during a war are not in and of themselves evidence of unlawful conduct under international law once again the facts matter South Africa has not missed an opportunity to make outlandish accusations against Israel and its fourth request for provisional measures is replete with blat and distortion and misrepresentations we heard plenty s outrageous distortions and misrepresentations yesterday as well perhaps most repugnant is South Africa's suggestion that Israel has created zones of extermination evoking terminology reminscent of the systematic extermination of European Jews during Holocaust similarly outrageous is South Africa's cynical attempt to equate Israel's action with the genocidal practices at stood these allegations level that israels at Israel are patently untrue and emphatically denied like many of the claims in South Africa's application and requests they lack any basis in in fact or law South Africa claims that Israel has closed critical border crossings into Gaza when this is blatantly untrue it has claimed that Israel has failed to facilitate the provision of fuel for sustaining humanitarian operations and Facilities this is also untrue Miss kapan turjan will further elaborate on these points in a moment as as well as on the continuous efforts that Israel has been making to alleviate the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip as Council for Israel noted before the court during the oral hearing on 12 2024 a State intent on committing genocide would not undertake the operational and the humanitarian efforts that Israel has taken and is taken to mitigate civilian harm it would would not have delayed a ground maneuver for weeks urging civilians to seek safer space and in doing so sacrifice operational Advantage it would not invest massive resources in facilitating humanitarian Aid if anybody should be told that enough is enough it is truly South Africa and not Israel at what point do we say enough to to South Africa's repeated attempts to exploit the provisional measure procedure of this court in such a vile and cynical manner this war like all wars is tragic and terrible for Israelis and Palestinians and it has exacted a terrible human price but it is not genocide I can only recall once again that Israel has made it clear that if the hostage were released and Hamas were to lay down its arms the hostilities would cease and has been engaged intensively in negotiations to that effect Mr Court South Africa asked this court to order Israel and I quote seize its military operations in the Gaza Strip South Africa has asked the court to order the cessation of military operations by Israel in its previous request the court has not done so the court is well aware that to do so would mean that 132 hostages would remain to language in hamas's tunnel tunnels forsaken it would mean that Hamas would be left unhindered and free to continue its attacks against Israeli territory and Israeli civilians which it has a stated intention to do it would turn the genocide convention into a sword rather than a shield and would strip Israel of its rights under international law in Israeli civilians of its protection such a situation is both legally and morally unattainable for all of the reasons given in response to South Africa's earlier requests for similar provisional measures the court rightfully rejected South Africa's previous request and it would be wholly inappropriate to Grant a provisional measures measure in such terms the second of the provisional measures requested by South Africa repeats earlier request it has made either sufficiently covered by the various provisional measures ordered by the court or rejected in previous rounds South Africa has not given sufficient reason why the court should now deviate from or essentially duplicate its earlier decisions the third provisional measure requested by South Africa would require that Israel submit an open report to the court on all measures taken to give effect to to these and previous provision provisional measures as I have said Israel has engaged fully and sincerely in this proceedings despite the outrageous and labeless claims that have been leveled against it it has submitted to the court two detailed reports it has been forthcoming about the efforts it is undertaking as well as the challenges it is dealing with to alleviate the humanitarian situation in Gaza it has made clear time and again its unwavering commitment to its obligations under international law it has done this while the fighting continues and the citizens are still under attack South Africa has responded with a barrage of requests it has clearly adopted a strategy of dragging Israel to court endlessly regardless of any legal undertakings by Israel in these circumstances ordering isra to submit another report is unwarranted Mr President that concludes my statement I ask that you now invite Miss Kaplan turjan to the podium um I thank the co-agent of Israel and ask um mrar take the floor you have the M Mr President members of the Court it is an honor to appear before you on behalf of the state of Israel as you have just heard Israel is still under attack we are still counting more and more of our dead and attending 2,000 more who are wounded no less than 130 to Children women and men are still H hostage in unimaginable conditions by Hamas and other Palestinians militants Gaza tens of thousands of Israeli citizens are internally displaced most of them have not seen their homes in over s months many have no homes to return to the very grave effect of the horrific Massacre of 7 October continue to Ripple through our people and communities who must not be forgotten they too are worthy of international laws protection Mr President members of the court I draw particular attention to the women still held Old Stage in Gaza Miss Amit sna who was held captive in Gaza by Kamas for 55 days testified recently that she was physically abused beaten up and chained to a bed threatened at gunpoint and forced to perform sexual acts on her capture Kamas refuses to release these women and all the other oages it holds it presently refuses to alleviate the humanitarian suffering that this war has broke to all concerned on both sides it has turned down numerous proposals for a suire and it continues to favor death and destruction as a strategy we heard nothing about that yesterday in fact while South Africa South Africa made many outrageous false statements yesterday perhaps most striking was what it did not say we have hardly heard the word Hamas even though it is Hamas that has brought about all the suffering and pain that we are witnessing the suffering of Israelis and Palestinians alike instead we sat here and listened to vinist accusations to language that is so hateful so out of touch with reality that it was difficult to believe we are in a court of law Mr Court there is no doubt that this war is tragic and has caused Great suffer uing on both sides again this is Hamas is doing South Africa provides an account that is not only in incredible and Incredibly partial it is also distorted but to apply the law properly to impart Justice surely the facts must matter these facts can can not but show that Israel is seeking consistently to abide by the law in the excruciating circumstances of warfare that Hamas has deliberately created the blatant misrepresentation we heard yesterday cannot alter that for a start South Africa claims that Israel has shut down the two main land Crossing through which Aid enters into Gaza this being the Rafa and Kim Shalom crosses and that Israel has cut Gaza off from all humanitarian medical and other supplies this is patently untr the truth is that Israel allows and facilitates as it has been for months the provision of more and more humanitarian Aid to the civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip it does so through a number of Crossings on a daily basis I refer the court to the map that is now on the screen before you and also at tab five of your folders contrary to South Africa's claim the km Shalom Crossing have been in continuous operation since December 2023 with one recent exception between the 5th and 8th of May when it was closed after Kamas fired at Kim Shalom even though Kamas fire continued on 8 10 11 12th May and several times even yesterday the crossing remained open allowing allowing more and more Aid to flow in this Crossing has been the central entry point for Ed for months I know that South Africa has not only wrongly alleged that the km Shalom Crossing has been shut down it also requested that Israel relinquish control over it I hardly need to say much about this request given that Kum Shalom is situated on Sovereign Israeli territory as for the raer crossing to say that Israel closed this Crossing is inaccurate at best its operation was disrupted on May 6 and since then Israel has taken active measures and has been in intensive discussions with Egypt supported by other International actors in an effort to resume the flow of Aid in the meantime and in keeping with its consistent efforts Israel has taken immediate measures to ensure that alternative paths are available for the continued increase in its provision of humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip in this context the prime minister of Israel convened two high level meetings to ensure Contin continued adequate response to the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip the Prime Minister instructed the relevant authorities in Israel to take immediate interim steps to enable increased flow of Aid to Gaza strep through other routs and sources South Africa neglected to mention yesterday that the total amount of Aid entering Gaza in the last few days is now once again increasing s significantly indeed on 12 May a new land Crossing was open at eras West it joins yet another new land Crossing fully operationalized on May 1st at AR East which together allow for the entry into Gaza of additional 200 trucks per day after their inspection elsewhere an additional land route bringing Aid into Gaza since March 2024 which again is fully operational is gate 96 this land route brings a directly into Northern Gaza thus reducing the risk of floting of Aid convoys that otherwise make their way to the area from the southern part of the strip for this purpose Israel allows Palestinian Palestinian truck drivers from Gaza to enter Israel territory following Security checks in order to collect and upload humanitarian supplies Israel has done great deal to expand the capacity of land Crossings including by extending the working hours there it has also expanded infrastructure and Roads supporting the operations of the crossing the Israeli government allocated a approximately 52 million United States dollar to the implementation of such efforts we heard nothing about all of that yesterday aial Roots remain in operation so as to allow for direct parachuting of Aid to Gaza such operations are undertaken almost daily involving a significant number of States many thousands of Aid packages were provided in this way by dozens of operations in recent weeks the temporary floating Pier of the Gaza Coast whose construction began following President Biden's Declaration on 7 March 2024 begins operating today it is expected to enable the delivery of approx appr imately 2.2 million food portions per day by the world food program I should add that this location too came under Hamas fire last month while construction was underway further progress in relation to Maritime rots was achieved last week when Israel and Cyprus adopted on 8 May technical array ments which a which aim to facilitate the implementation of the Cypress maridi Corridor about which Israel has previously informed this court this Corridor was already UTI utilized even prior to the concluding of the arrangements but they will further improve its operation is this what a hermetic closure looks like m Mr President members of the Court it is not difficult to see that Israel has been making extensive efforts over the recent months together with various International Partners to increase the provision of humanitarian assistance throughout the G strep there have been remarkable achievements South Africa's complete disregard of this reality in and this truth is as telling as it is as it is alarming Israel extensive and ongoing actions have been detailed in the reports submitted by Israel to the court most recently on 28 April they have brought about a significant increase in the amount of humanitarian Aid that enter into Gaza there are con consistent with a decision adop adopted on 4 April by Israel ministerial committee on National Security Affairs headed by the prime minister of Israel and I quote to increase the efforts to allow and facilitate the transfer of humanitarian aid for the civilian population in the Gaza Street end of quote and to establish a ministerial team to and I quote implement the policy of the cabinet regarding the trans of humanitarian Aid to the Gaza Strip end of quote the decision records that these steps are undertaken further to the recommendations of security and Foreign Affairs officials concerning the need to continue the provisions of humanitarian Aid to the civilian population in the Strip all of these steps have had a significant impact in alleviating the humanitarian situation and avoiding the catastrophes which South Africa threatened were imminent in December then January then February then March and then April well the situation is constantly changing Israel is adapting and continues to work to improve the situation and to prevent harm to civilians and to Aid War workers I note that as Mr Noam has said Israel actions in this context are currently under the judicial review of Israel Supreme Court these steps have been repeatedly accompanied by clear statements from Israel leadership for example Israel's prime minister Netanyahu said on 15 my that and I quote our policy from the start from the beginning of the war my policy was you have to provide the basic humanitarian Aid that is required by international law but in the last 6 weeks we actually change it not only to providing basic humanitarian aid but flooding Gaza with humanitarian Aid end of quote Israel's defense minister Gallant likewise said on May 1 that and I quote we are taking significant measures in order to increase the volume of humanitarian Aid into Gaza this is essential end of quote he added that and I quote once more we are fighting Hamas a brutal terrorist organization we are not fighting the civilian in Gaza and we will facilitate the delivery of quote in order to show a genocidal intent that simply is not there South Africa continues to distort other statements in quoting the prime minister as stating that Gaza must not constitute a threat to Israel they omit to mention that he was expressly speaking about Hamas and returning the hostages it took when quoting the minister of defense is saying that the military operates neighborhood by neighborhood and will reach every location in Gaza they neglected to say that he too referred expressly to Hamas in the same statement he also made plain that the humanitarian issue is Center the central one while South Africa turns a blind eye to Israel remarkable efforts they have not gone unnoticed by others the UN senior humanitarian coordinator Who was appointed following Security Council resolution to 272 said on 24 April in a briefing to the UN Security Council that Israel has taken a number of steps to improve Aid delivery when asked about her contacts with the Israeli side she said that there is a very constructive cooperation with her Mission senior government officials of various States likewise said they saw real and demonstrable progress in the delivery of Aid to say as South Africa presently does that Israel is deliberately denying humanitarian Aid cannot be farther from truth on the contrary Israeli actions undertaken in accordance with orders from Israel's highest levels of government show opposite only yesterday no less than 365 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies enter into Gaza through the various land Crossings more than 330 of the trucks enter through K Shalom the same Crossing that South Africa said yesterday was shut down at allegations about South Africa far no better contrary to South Africa allegations thousands of international Aid workers have been entering and exiting Gaza the confliction mechanism were reviewed and improved following highly unfortunate incidents in order to guarantee that their safety is always maintained the these Lessons Learned too have been detailed in Israel recent report to the court fuel continues to be delivered to Gaza including this past Wednesday when 76,000 lers were transferred to the program times do not permit setting the record straight with regard to all of South Africa's outrageous misrepresentations but they claim that Israel deliberately hampering Medical Services in Gaza or that trfa is the last viable location for medical care cannot be left unanswered Israel persistently continues to facilitate the enhancement of Medical Services throughout the entire Gaza Strip in addition to the hospitals located in Rafa efforts have been extended to support the rehabilitation of Hospital elsewhere in the territory this may be seen at tab six of your folders in fact 14 hospitals are in operation outside Rafa eight field hospitals are in full operation with only two of them located Rafa a field Hospital which was established by the icrc in the almasi area began operating as recently as 9 May one more field hospital is due to open later this month and the establishment of four more field hospitals in currently under consideration mobile clinics continue to operate in the alwa area too collaboration with the host of ARS including the World Health Organization continues in order to strengthen and expand Medical Care all over South Africa will do well to tell its Ally Hamas to stop exploiting hospitals and other protected sites as military command centers and since we heard grave misrepresentation yesterday about the shifa hospital it must be made clear that even during very intense fighting in the shifa hospital after Kamas reinstated the hospital compound as a military Hub the IDF took proactive steps Aid to ensure continuous medical care to patient hospitalized there despite the intense military activity on the premises no patients or medical staff were harmed during the operation by the IDF on 22nd March 2024 the IDF broke into the hospital in the the course of its operational activity trucks carrying medical equipment food and water including over 10,000 units of medicine hundreds of painkiller packages over 100 packages of bandage and IVs and dozen of Advanced Medical monitoring devices contrary to the impression that South Africa sought to leave you with the idea of Chief of Staff said to the forces on that location that and I quote we do everything not to harm patients not to harm medical staff in this operation not one medical staff was harmed no patients were harmed and many terrorists were killed and captured end of quote he said that a hospital is not a safe place not safe for terrorists South Africa even so fit to present to the court a false translation in its attempt to create intent the soldiers in the video shown yesterday were not saying to destroy but to dismantle Rafa a clear reference to Hamas capabilities South Africa ignores any such statements that show Israel true intention it had to distort the fact to sustain its liable of genocide in such repugnant terms as final stages and exterminations zones is Israel continues to take Extraordinary Measures in order to minimize hard to Palestinian civilians Gaza these have been described at length to the court in the previous hearing and in our written submission and ignored to the same extent by South Africa time permits only several examples one of which is that Israel has sent over 15 Millions text messages informing civilians of planned IDF activity in specific areas so that they can avoid them it has made over 18 million pre-recorded phone calls and an additional 100,000 individual phone calls alerting individuals of danger in vicinity over 9 million leaflets dropped over specific areas have provided civilian with information as to where humanitarian Aid may be accessed and how to live zone of combat once again is this our military set on total or partial destruction of people operates it is also the Israeli military that has put in place clear and definite procedure for targeting this requires inter Alia selection of Munitions that would achieve the military need while minimizing civilian harm and the conduct for each and every strike of a proportionality assessment in accordance with International humanitarian law the IDF moreover marks s sensitive sites such as medical service and shelters on Military operational systems and takes additional measure to ensure that IDF forces are aware of them all this likewise applies in operations in Rafa as may be seen at tab seven of your folders while fighting to defend Israel it is also engaged in ensuring that human aring Aid Contin continues to flow in South Africa specs of extermination zones but the source cited in its request in support of this allegation does not say this let alone prove it it does reference Express statement from the IDF chief of staff that civilian in combat areas must not be killed and official statement by the IDF that the IDF does not define areas where anyone present could be shot and a discussion of the IDF review of EX exceptional incidents but there are allegations of violation of this rule equally unsettling is South Africa's false allegation that the IDF uses artificial intelligence that decides who to attack a claim the origin of which is one press report that is relies on anous Anonymous sources unfortunately South Africa did not tell the court yesterday of Israel's official response to the report which states clearly that the claims are simply not true South Africa's claims regarding IDF attacks procedures are also false Mr President members of the court if South Africa seeks to point to any change in the situation since your order of 26th March it should have acknowledged all these remarkable humanitarian efforts by Israel it should also have recognize the crimes committed constantly by Hamas and the circumstances the comp tell Israel to respond to them as any state would instead it offers Grand standing and and rhetoric no real evidence that's just a transparent attempt to relitigate the same matter one more time and to extract more and more from this procedure Mr President members of the court even if South Africa could establish a relevant change in the circumstances which is has not done it has not established any change in the situation that would justify the extreme measure that is now seing the measures currently in place are entirely sufficient and no further ons are needed as Mr no explained South Africa is trying once more to drag this court down a very dangerous path it will have you say that a sovereign state that is under a persistent attack whose citizens are held hostage in brutal conditions cannot defend itself or its citizens as you have consistently made clear there is no international law to this effect indeed it is inconceivable that there would be Mr President members of the Court we must be very clear exceeding to South Africa request would be an front to the very idea of the protection afforded by the law for the court to exceed to South Africa request is to enable hamas's Battalion to continue to Target Israel to attack humanitarian Crossing and to Destin the Palestinians in Gaza to Perpetual war is to enable Kamas to reconstitute its forces in order to commit the 7 October atrocities again and again as they have vowed to do it is to condemn the hostages to near certain death what would it mean for the women still held in captivity granting South Africa request would be to side with a terrorist organization which will no doubt celebrate any such decision it is to legitimize protect and reward hamas's despicable method of warfare to enable its heinous crimes to persist with all the consequences that might follow Mr President members of the Court it is one thing to require that Israel abide by its inter International legal obligations and protect civilian when exercising its inherent right to defend itself but to deny Israel that inherent right is a different thing altogether it is Unthinkable can it really be maintained that if hostages are brutally held captive in Rafa Israel cannot come to rescue can it really be maintain that if Kamas continues to use Gaza as a launching pad for its indiscriminate attack Israel cannot defend itself against them we respectively submit that international law offers a clear answer to these questions Mr President members of the court on this basis and in accordance with article 60 paragraph 2 of the rules of court I now proceed to to read Israel's final submission the state of Israel requests the court to reject the request for the modification and indication of provisional measures submitted by the Republic of South Africa Liars liars and ation about the existing humanitarian conditions in the designated evacuation zones in particular Al mawasi and how it would ensure safe passage to these zones as well as the provision of shelter food water and other humanitarian Aid and assistance to all evacuees that are and can be expected to arrive in these zones thank you Mr President I thank judge Nory the written text of this question will be communicated to the parties as soon as possible Israel is invited to provide a threat reply to the question no later than tomorrow Saturday May 18 2024 at 6:00 p.m. furthermore any comments South Africa may wish to make in accordance with article 72 of the rules of court on response by Israel must be submitted no later than Monday May 20 2024 at noon this brings to an end the order proceedings on the applicant's request for the indication of additional Africa versus Israel it remains for me to thank the agents
