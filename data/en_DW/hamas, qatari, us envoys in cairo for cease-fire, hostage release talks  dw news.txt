hopes for a ceasefire in the Gaza War are growing with the arrival of a Hamas delegation for talks in Cairo us officials say Israel has broadly approved a deal being presented to Hamas which is considered a terrorist group by most Western countries pressure is mounting for the meeting to result in a truce as starvation Looms in Gaza and according to the Hamas ran Health Ministry more than 30,000 people have been killed in the territory since the war started started on Sunday the Israeli Army intensified operations in the southern Gaza City of Kan Yunis it says it had destroyed dozens of Hamas targets well for more on this latest round of ceasefire talks taking place in Egypt let's bring in journalist Karim algari in Cairo welcome um Karim who exactly is now taking part in these talks and what's the latest you can tell us well uh we know that the delegation of Hamas arrived here in Cairo for the negotiations there is no Israeli uh delegation yet quite some optimistic sounds from Hamas one of the officials said there might be a deal within 24 or 48 hours but there seems to be all kinds of last minute conditions and uh some minutes ago the CIS w't even that the negotiations in Cairo might even break down well as we mentioned um according to the US Israel had already accepted the truce conditions that were on the table so what are the sticking points well first they agreed to the framework the framework is a six weeks truce and then the release of several dozen what 40 isra hostages in exchange for the tenfold number of Palestinians hold in Israeli prisons but I think there's several stumbling stumbling blocks we have to deal with right now one of them is uh that uh Israel presented a list of uh prisoners they have they are not willing to release that's the first stumbling block the second is that Israel is uh demanding a list from Hamas um who they going to release exactly who is alive who is dead and it seems like Hamas is saying that they're going to provide this list only uh when there is a ceasefire so a lot of stumbling blocks still to be moved out of the way there's also been lots of talk about getting to a breakthrough before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan which uh begins on March 10th or 11th depending on the lunar calendar How likely is is a ceasefire deal by then well there's a big pressure on all sides that this is happening of course Ramadan is starting the end of next week so um we have to see I mean as I said optimistic sounds at the beginning from the US uh also from Hamas that there is a framework but the devil here uh seems to be in the detail and uh until now there is even no Israeli delegation that arrived here because they're saying their conditions have to be meet met first that the Hamas provides the list of the hostages to be relieved released so there still a lot of work to do here in Cairo that was journalist Karim Al goari in Cairo for us Karim many thanks indeed for your reporting you're
