volatility in the middle east Israel's collective punishment of the palestinians and disproportionate and indiscriminate military on on gaza for over 200 have uned catastrophic humanitarian conse for example  we are horrified by the destruction of nasir and alifa hospitals and the discovery of m graves in their comps we demand independent th and transparent international investigations israel

under international law and ignore the repeated calls by the international community including from among stous allies to do more to protect civilians we are applied by israel's plan military assault on rafa despite warnings from the international community  and humanitarian agencies that it would lead to disastrous &rlm;outcomes mr president israel's brutality against palestinians has enraged people across the region and beyond the impunity that israel has long enjoyed has embolden it to act recklessly this has to stop this council must act resolutely and decisively to  enforce compliance on the part of Israel because the consequences could be extremely perilous not only for the region but also the world a sustained and permanent ceas fire in gaza is the fundamental first step towards de escalating tensions in the region the supply of humanitarian aid at scale into and throughout gaza must resume palestinians must not be forcibly displaced out of gaza all hostages and those in

allocated to unra towards this ende mr president malaysia deeply regrets the failure of this council to support the application of the state of palestine to become a full member of the united nations this council has had a momentous opportunity to help  fulfill the right to self determination of the palestinian people a right enshrined in the un charter at meeting the state of palestine as a full member of this organization would have been without any doubt the right thing to do 1440 members of the of the united nations  have recognized the state of palestine and many more will do so in the very near future furthermore palestine has proven itself worthy of membership &rlm;through active participation at all un platforms clearly there is no pl possible reason why palestine should continue to be denied of full membership  Supporting palestine's full membership would have been the crucial first step to address the root cause of the incessant crisis in the region that is the longstanding illegal occupation of palestinian lands by Israel it is ludicrous that those who have repeatedly expressed their support for the two state  solution as the only way to guarantee sustainable peace and security in the region could not support the full membership of the state of palestine mr president we are at a precarious juncture the choice we make today may lead to far reaching tumultuous and dangerous consequences it is a  moment that backs us to reflect and act with wisdom and courage we must not allow the of middle east and the world to be dictated by indiv whose only mo is his own

Thank you, Mr. President. I would like at the beginning to thank you for holding this ministerial meeting as well.  I extend my thanks to His Excellency Mr. Antonio Gooch, Mr. President. The Kingdom of Morocco, whose family is headed by His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God grant him victory, has renewed the Pastor’s Committee emanating from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, affirming its complete, comprehensive and firm solidarity with the legitimate rights of the brotherly Palestinian people based on international legitimacy and based on the two- state solution agreed upon by  party of the international community, leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the borders of June 4, 1967, with its capital in Qat al-Sharqiya. From this standpoint, like the rest of the Arab and Islamic countries, the Non-Aligned Group, and other countries, the Kingdom of Morocco renews its firm and absolute support for the request for full membership of the State of Palestine in the United Nations. Mr. President, we are listening today.  In light of the difficult and difficult circumstances that the Middle East region is going through, we have seen it in the past six months in the Gaza Strip and the catastrophic conditions that accompanied it, the humanitarian suffering of the Palestinian population, and the persistence in targeting civilians. The conflict has entered a more dangerous stage with major repercussions on the entire region, as the Israeli military actions in the Strip have demonstrated.  Gaza has reported grave violations that contradict the provisions of international law and international law. The number of victims of this crisis has reached unprecedented numbers, in addition to the famine crisis. Humanitarian workers, international laws, and humanitarian law, Mr. President, the Kingdom of Morocco once again to impose an immediate and sustainable ceasefire as the only sure way.  By ending these attacks and the need to ensure the protection of civilians in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law, and to allow humanitarian aid to flow freely and in sufficient quantities to the residents of Gaza and to establish a dignified and dignified Palestinian cause. The Kingdom of Morocco stresses the importance of immediate implementation and resolution 22. The Council met on March 2nd. Given the scope of the field in all its dimensions and respect for international law and law, the Kingdom of Morocco finds emphasis on its rejection and eradication of all transgressions, the policy of collective punishment and forced displacement, and the attempt to impose a new reality and religion on the Gaza Strip, an integral part of the Palestinian territories and a single Palestinian state. We stress that the threat to expand military operations to include all areas of Fatwa  Gaza does not have Rafah, and this is unacceptable because it leads to aggravation of the disastrous humanitarian conditions in Gaza. The Kingdom of Morocco also calls on the international community and the Security Council to accelerate entry and delivery of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian brothers in the Gaza Strip in a safe, sufficient, sustainable and without obstacles in implementation of Security Council Resolutions 2712 and 272 to this end and within the framework of  The actual commitment and permanent interest of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God grant him victory, Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee, in the Palestinian issue, and with sublime instructions from His Majesty, the Kingdom of Morocco provided important aid to the Gaza Strip, and the vacancy was completed in the past and coinciding with the advent of the holy month of Ramadan. Congratulations on launching a major humanitarian operation for the benefit of the population in Gaza Al-Sharif, and since the outbreak of operations. For more than five months, Morocco has been considered the first country to transport its humanitarian aid via an unprecedented land route and deliver it directly to the two thousand residents. Others may provide Jerusalem money, the implementation arm of the Jerusalem campaign, with food aid for the residents of Yemen during the month of Ramadan and this aid. This assistance also includes the establishment of emergency coordination at Al-Quds Hospital. Mr. President, when the Kingdom of Morocco expresses its support for UNRWA and stresses the importance of supporting this agency, which enables it to have the necessary resources sufficient to fulfill the mandate of the Prophet, Mr. President, the fatigue of the Kingdom of Morocco, whose Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God grant him victory, headed to the Jerusalem Committee, expressed its strong condemnation.  It denounced the storming of the courtyards of the Blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque by some extremists and their followers and their carrying out of provocative practices that violate its sanctity. The Kingdom of Morocco affirms its rejection of any measures that strengthen the legal and historical status of the City of Jerusalem, its sanctities, including the Blessed Al-Aqsa Glory. Forms of escalation and provocation: The increase in Israeli practices, unilateral measures, and repeated provocations in Jerusalem undermines international initiatives aimed at stopping the deadly cycle of violence. In this context, the Kingdom of Morocco affirms the necessity of halting all measures that affect the legal status and history of the city of Jerusalem in the service of peace and stability and to avoid the conflict turning from a political conflict into one.  A religious conflict will have dire consequences for everyone. The city of Jerusalem must remain a land of meeting and a symbol of peaceful coexistence for followers of the three monotheistic religions. It is a center for the values ​​of mutual respect and dialogue, as was stipulated in the Jerusalem Call signed by His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God grant him victory, the head of Jerusalem, His Holiness Pope Francis on 30  March 2019, the city of Al-Bat. In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to recall what was stated in the speech of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God bless him, to the participants in the extraordinary joint Arab-Islamic summit, November 11, 2023, in Riyadh, the sister Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and this decisive circumstance must be dealt with from the standpoint of the historical responsibility that it requires of us.  Starting from some alternative postulates, there is no alternative to a real peace in the region that guarantees the Palestinians their legitimate rights to achieve a two-state solution. There is no alternative to an independent and infallible Palestinian state that borders the East. There is no alternative to strengthening the Palestinian Authority under the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas al-Baz, and there is no alternative to establishing existing sustainable regional security mechanisms. Respect for international law and international treaties. This is fine. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank you for holding this session. It is unfortunate that the Council was unable to pass the draft resolution submitted by Algeria, which recommends granting Palestine full membership in organization. It is a shame for Palestine, which has been recognized by more than 140 countries.  To take its natural place among countries. It is a peace-loving state that has repeatedly undertaken to respect the obligations contained in the United Nations Charter, and it is able and willing to implement these obligations. As for its borders, they are known to all of us. Israel stands as an obstacle to granting it full membership if the Council fails to finance a project. The decision contributes to prolonging the conflict and keeps us away from achieving the two-state solution. Mr. President, in the year 2011, during two approaches to the Security Council, there was an attempt to give Palestine the right to full membership in the United Nations, which ended with a settlement to give it observer member status. Today, after 13 years, the sister Republic of Algeria, Mishal, takes up the Palestinian issue and tries once again.  Others, in the name of the Arab Group and with the support of 14 countries, but they collide with the same obstacles, are faced with the same arguments, and are obstructed by the same obstacles. We ask ourselves and ourselves when the time has come to grant Palestine full membership and recognition of the Palestinian state stipulated in successive United Nations resolutions. Mr. President, it is an attempt by the Israeli extreme right government to escape internal accountability.  Through its attempt to expand the scope of the conflict and extend it to countries in the air, it endangers international peace and security, and this is what Lebanon has been exposed to on a daily basis since October 8, 2023, as Israel expanded the scope of its attacks to reach the Lebanese neck and did not exclude civilian targets. This aggression has so far caused the displacement of more than 90 people.  Thousands of Lebanese from their southern villages. The Israeli aggression did not spare any journalists, civilians, or relief workers. We cannot help but recall the attack on the ambulance center in the town of Habriyeh, south of Lebanon, which led to the death of seven rescuers and the wounding of others, in addition to the destruction of the center. Israel was also exposed to army personnel and centers. Lebanon and the International Emergency Forces, Mr. President, Lebanon presented its vision for a solution based on restoring the territories occupied by Israel, stopping Israeli violations of Lebanese sovereignty on land, sea and air, and demonstrating the drawn international borders that are internationally recognized and confirmed by the United Nations. Lebanon also stressed, through its Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, the importance of moving forward.  In finding a diplomatic solution to the crisis and sparing Lebanon and the Lebanese from the scourge of war, Lebanon also thanks the friendly countries, led by the United States of America and France, for the efforts they are making to reduce the escalation and reach a sustainable solution. We affirm Lebanon’s firm commitment to facilitating the mission of the UNIFIL mission inside its territory, ensuring its security and safety of its members, and adhering to Resolution 1701 in full. Regardless of its levels and with all matters getting out of control, the political horizon for a two-state solution, ending the occupation, and recognizing the independent Palestinian state on the borders of June 4, 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital, must be revived in accordance with the terms of reference for the solution. A just solution to the refugee issue and the issues of the final solution must be revived and in accordance with international legitimate resolutions, especially the Council’s resolution.  Security Article No. 264 and the Arab Peace Initiative in Peru in 2002 and the elimination of Israel from the occupied Arab lands, Mr. President, all solutions that do not take into account everything we mentioned above will remain unreasonable and will not lead at all to a just peace.

conflicto de mayores propor ilo con Thank you, Mr. President. At the beginning, I would like to thank Malta for its presidency of the Security Council in this matter, and I thank it for raising the session to the ministerial level, and I take this opportunity to renew our appreciation and support.  Due to the efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, and his repeated calls for a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, Mr. President, the continuing aggression by the occupation forces on the Bass Strip and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory will last for six months without the international community and the Security Council being able to impose a time period for each settlement.  Calls, initiatives, meetings, and decisions have caused approximately 34,000 Palestinian civilian martyrs, most of them women and children, and the massive and unprecedented scale of destruction, horrific human suffering, and all forms of implementation, rights violations, starvation, war crimes, and genocide being practiced on the people in full view world. This continues to be aggression and recklessness.  The occupation authorities, with the decisions of the Security Council, the General Assembly, the International Court of Justice, and the principles of international law and international humanitarian law, have an impact on atomistic failure. The international community has been unable to bear its legal and moral responsibilities, even within its minimum limits, represented by stopping aggression, destroying lives, and bringing in humanitarian and secret aid. There is no doubt that this international silence is miserable.  The continuous failure of the international agencies to carry out their supposed role has given the occupation forces a free hand to continue their crimes, implement their plans, and impose their threat on the international community, especially the support and assistance they have received inside and outside the Security Council, within the framework of narrow calculations and in the absence of double standards, which has entrenched in them the idea that they are above all questions or issues.  Hold him accountable and encourage it to continue to disregard all international and humanitarian conventions. The situation cannot continue as it is, especially in light of the unprecedented suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza and the dangers of displacement and extermination that threaten 1.5 million remote refugees if the occupation forces carry out their threat of invasion, in addition to the repercussions of every...  This affects security and stability in the world, and in a region that stands on the verge of sliding into crisis and cannot bear more tension and conflict. Hence, he renews his call on the international community and the members of the Security Council to take immediate, effective and responsible action to put an end to this situation, and to hold the occupation accountable for the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza and impose an immediate cessation.  To launch fire and prevent all plans of invasion and forced displacement that the occupation forces are threatening, and to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid continuously, without obstacles, and in sufficient quantities. Failure to do so puts at stake the prestige of this Council, the credibility of the United Nations, confidence in multilateral action, and commitment to the bottom and international law in full and to Tunisia.  Its firm position in support of the wretched Palestinian people in their steadfastness against the occupation and the inter-state war to which they are exposed and in their struggle to recover their legitimate rights that have not been forfeited by the statute of limitations and to establish an independent state in Palestine and its inner Jerusalem. It also confirms its support for Palestine’s request to obtain full membership in the United Nations, considering that  It is truly horrific and undeniable. Thank you, Si.

I am making this statement on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of the Syrian Arab Republic, Dr. Faisal Al-Miqdad. Mr. President, I addressed your council today at a time when the eyes of millions around the world are turning to the United Nations in the hope that it will fulfill its responsibilities in maintaining international peace and security in a way that responds to the state of great dissatisfaction and deep pain. Who united the peoples of the world and the human conscience in confronting genocide and the brutal atrocities committed by the Israeli occupation authorities against the Palestinian people. We have witnessed and are still witnessing for more than six months of criminal Israeli escalation in Gaza and the accompanying repeated attacks on the lands of the Syrian Arab Republic and other Arab countries, not  It was a result of the moment and not in self-defense, as some of Israel’s sponsors and protectors claim. Rather, it is a continuation of a long series of massacres, acts of aggression and terrorism committed by the Israeli occupation over decades, which were met with the silence of the Security Council and the determination of the United Nations to put its relevant resolutions into practice as a result of the support of the American administrations. The blame is limited.  Israel: It has become clear that the utter failure of Israel to reconcile the Palestinian people and achieve their military goals has led them to bomb civilians with this unprecedented brutality and bloodiness, and to commit genocide, as a result of the campaign against humanity, which seeks to escalate the situation and blow up the critical region in the force law, and to uphold the law and the rights of women.  This barbaric Israeli behavior has resulted in the American administration paralyzing the Security Council and its standing against the will of the vast majority of the members of the Council in particular and the members of the United Nations in general, and its use of its veto four times without any light to continue leaning on the metaphor and displacement. What is more, it is the will of God to encourage Israel to continue its displacement.  The Palestinian people without mercy, Mr. President, The Syrian Arab Republic condemns the behavior of the Israeli administrations against the Palestinian people, which led, in its initial toll, to the martyrdom of more than 35,000 civilians, the wounding of tens of thousands, the majority of whom were women and children, and the killing of at least 240 humanitarian workers, including the United Nations Tawaq, and a settlement.  The Gaza Strip has left the ground, including hospitals, schools, and other civilian facilities, declaring the threat to destroy the city of Rafah, which is crowded with its residents and hundreds of thousands of Hungarians. Syria holds the Israeli occupation authorities and the countries supporting them fully responsible for the escalation and its repercussions, and calls on the United Nations to work on and put an end to this aggression, siege, and put an end to it.  To starve the Palestinians, prevent their forced displacement, and ensure that Israel is held accountable for its actions. It also demands that Syria implement the resolutions of international legitimacy and enable the Palestinian people to enjoy legitimate and inalienable national rights, especially in establishing an independent land and protecting its entire population in this policy. The United States of America uses the video  Against the draft resolution submitted by our sister Algeria before the Security Council to grant Palestine full membership in the United Nations, and affirms that preventing the establishment of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state is for the reason of prolonging the prolonged state of insecurity and instability resulting from Israeli occupation, Mr. President, that the crimes of the Israeli occupation in the Palestinian territories Inseparable from the crimes of the Syrian Arab occupier Vigo, the occupying power of Israel, the occupying power, has for more than five decades been its brutal policies against our people in Greece and the scapegoat of violations of international law and international law. Anas also continues the occupation’s expansionist settlement policy in Alanya, perpetuating its humiliation, prolonging the conflict, and imposing demographic change by increasing the numbers.  The settlers and the materials are natural and ground-sourced, and dangerous projects have been established for the Syrian people. Yes, the Israeli occupation forces are using the land and air of the occupied Syrian Golan as stipulated. The attacks on Syrian territory and the targeting of civilian facilities and residential buildings are a grave violation of international law, the Charter of the United Nations, and relevant Security Council resolutions. The connection and agreement between the 774th Forces and the recent hysterical attacks that affected the areas of Damascus and its surroundings, Wad Al-Zawh and the neighboring region, which led to the killing of innocent civilians, the injury of others, and the infliction of great hundreds of damages. The last veil of international conventions and treaties reached diplomatic mirrors, which revealed the targeting of an Iranian building from the air.  In conclusion, the Israeli occupation forces and the terrorist organization ISIS launched attacks on civilians and the military, which once again confirms the interdependence and coordination between the Israeli occupation authorities and their tools of terrorists.  The President and Syria's disgrace to Israel and its sponsors are degenerate and their policies are weak and push the region towards the Levant and demand that the pain be brought back from the link

in their homeland thank you for your attention. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to begin by offering the Maltese presidency my sincere thanks for all that must have been ignorant of the past period. We have witnessed, with your cooperation and sincerity, all the issues of the Middle East region. And the world is in order to see some progress in the process of maintaining international peace and security. Today, we continue in a public place surrounded by poisonous walls, amidst a diplomatic atmosphere that is being destroyed by the number of statements. Words remain, of which nothing has been achieved. They are just fleeting words, but as we sit here in this hall from which we have long been waiting. Many sit: the chosen Palestinian son in East Jerusalem, the orphan girl in the West Bank, and the mother who lost her son two days ago, two weeks ago her husband, and two months ago her daughter in Gaza. How long will this miserable situation continue? In this regard, and out of the humanity that unites us, not narrow international interests, they reiterated before all of you and in your esteemed council the necessity.  We must adhere to the three basic demands, which are, firstly, a ceasefire in Ghazr, and that the disrespectful Israeli authorities respect the blood of the individual Palestinians, and secondly, to advance the delivery of humanitarian and additional aid, and thirdly, to stop the forced displacement and sophisticated cleansing operations of the Persian people. Mr. President, I call on all of you to be a little bored with the faces of the innocent and vulnerable people in occupied Palestine.  Palestine, which suffered as no other country has suffered, with the continuation of the longest colonial march that humanity has ever seen in modern history. These are the goals of the world order that we have collectively decided to pursue. I will lead to seeing an oppressed people calling, with the loudest voices, for a land homeland with international recognition, and above all that, and with the increasing difficulties that...  The Palestinian people are experiencing it today. Some are demanding that UNRWA limit its activities and move its tasks to other places without realizing, even slightly, the impact of ideas affecting the future and the health crisis, and the pain of this painful development that has lost awareness and vision. The agency’s negotiator emphasized it by saying, and I quote, that it is almost impossible to restore Zion.  A child suffers from the severe foundations of teaching, and failure to provide this will condemn an entire generation to despair as it will lead to the loss of faith. Imagine, my colleagues, what the situation would be like if the international community did not recognize Palestine as an independent state and the racist colonial regime decided to defeat the interests of the aroused Palestinian people. How could it be? When interests are achieved, and when the values ​​of tolerance and coexistence spread and expand, history will not be kind to you. When your actions at the time will not purify your past path, they will be a disgraceful disgrace for the future. It is unfortunate to see the United States using the right to criticize the aspirations of the Palestinian people and the State of Palestine’s restriction of full membership in the United Nations.  But as our efforts continue forever and ever, I say to the ambassador of the State of Palestine to the United Nations, my dear brother, Ambassador Riyad, who is with me, the ambassador, and oh the proud people of Palestine? Kuwait is Palestine, Palestine is Kuwait, Kuwait’s membership in the United Nations is the land of Palestine, and your concerns are our concerns, and your challenges are our challenges, and your efforts and our efforts will not.  It stops even if some people violate its use of the right once, twice, and ten times. It is also unfortunate that we see the state occupying the Palestinian territories demanding that the international community not recognize Palestine as a state that shines in the full spotlight in the motherland. So how can we expect an oppressor to oppress or an usurper to amend and rule in a rape case? Where?  These are your values ​​that you have mastered, and it is astonishing that this rogue state, with its decisions and activities that lack moral legitimacy before legality, exploits its relationship with member states and relies on a member of your council whose mind is reverent to the right of peoples, the right of states and peoples to live in dignity, and away from everything I mentioned and the efforts of some to strip the Palestinian person of his humanity.  But the Palestinian is less valuable than other human beings. Do you not see the direct link between the Palestinian situation and the broader state of instability in the Middle East region? Mr. President, I beg your pardon for taking you back a little to an earlier time, even if you believe that the compass of history does not look back to its readings of half a century, specifically to November 1974. I would like to remind you of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution No. 3/36, which aspires to give Palestine complete independence and sovereignty, and the United Nations’ recognition of Viggio and Tebes. The resolution reaffirms the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in Palestine, especially first, the right to self-determination without external interference, and second, the right to independence and sovereignty. Patriots, and here I would like to point out that the occupying Israeli entity was recognized by the United Nations as a member four days after the founding of this organization. Palestine, and five decades after the issuance of the resolution I referred to, is still demanding its right to be recognized by the United Nations as an independent state like the rest of the countries. What is the message that we want to convey to the peoples of the world in our non-compliance with the United Nations resolution, the Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, that those resolutions do not advance human issues and concerns, that the ideal framework of the United Nations that was established in the 1940s only came to advance the realistic interests of the visions of specific parties, which is no good?  With all of us, we are surrounded by the walls of this most influential political hall in the world. If we do not adhere to the binding resolutions, and remind everyone, we must implement them, not ignore them. How long will all of us, the vast majority of members of the international community, demand the legitimate right of Palestine and its people? Great civilizations have collapsed when they are isolated and preoccupied with distant concerns.  On the cross-border values ​​and principles that united humanity for decades and were based on the expansion of the international system that exists today, Mr. President, the State of Kuwait renews its demands that society cooperate and look forward, not backward, and recognize Palestinian membership in the United Nations. In light of all of this and what the people have seen  The people of Gaza, defenseless from the pain it is difficult to describe, have been the result of the past months, not to mention the challenges that the United Nations has gone through in this regard, the most recent of which was the decision by several countries to suspend their support for the United Nations agency to employ Palestinian refugees in the Near East, as a result of a commitment claimed by Israel that was later revealed in this regard and from the standpoint of  Our moral responsibility and humanitarian goodness, I am pleased to announce to you today that the State of Kuwait’s provision of a voluntary contribution to the Al-Anwar Agency in the amount of 30 million US dollars indicates the continuity and continuation of Kuwaiti air bridge operations with daily aircraft loaded with all the needs of the Palestinian people, and that this support, even if it was little, did not come to the Palestinian people.  It is only a translation of the interest that the wise political leadership in his country gives to human issues and concerns. The Palestinian human being was not created to be a slave, and the Palestinian right is permanent as long as we are humankind. O Palestine, freedom. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to begin by welcoming Dr. Your Foreign and European Affairs and Trade Affairs, and I thank him for the money he has financed during his term as President of the Council. Mr. General of the United Nations, for the fact that the developments in the security and political situation in the Middle East region nullify all efforts to avoid aggravating the dire humanitarian situation and the inability of the Security Council last week to adopt a draft resolution on the full commitment of the United Mother State of Palestine to the brotherly Palestinian people.  The continuation of the war is detrimental, and the Kingdom of Bahrain renews its call to protect the international community, led by the Tartar Council, necessary without their suffering, improving the livelihood and protecting civilians in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law, because Mr. President, the recent military escalation serves to escalate the war and threaten regional security and stability, and the Kingdom of Bahrain calls for the necessity of commitment.

First of all, I congratulate you, and throughout this month, on the basis of your strong position on international law. This should be the congratulations to the members of the Sedition Council. We are pleased to meet you. This Council supports the noble purposes and lofty goals of the Charter of the United Nations. I would like to point out here that it unites my country.  He joins the statement made by the Permanent Representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, our sister Arab country, His Excellency the President. Unfortunately, this Council was not able to grant the Palestinian people their inherent right to recognize stable countries, which the overwhelming majority of countries recognize as the United Nations. There is no doubt that this willful and offensive neglect by some members of the Council, except for the following: And the worst and the West Bank, where Israel did not hesitate to practice mass oppression against the Palestinian people, including the brutal attack that affected thousands of children and women and employees of humanitarian relief teams, of whom, according to independent sources, nearly 250 workers were killed. So far everyone knows for sure, including the occupation authorities.  The Israeli statement said that this crisis did not begin on October 7, as is being promoted, and that this tragedy has root causes represented by Israel’s continued occupation of Arab lands and its humanitarian policies that conflict with the provisions of international law. Didn’t we call on your esteemed council to be aware of the responsibilities entrusted to it under the provisions of the Charter to provide protection for the Palestinian people and to hold them accountable?  Unfortunately, Israel's double standards have affected the credibility of this Council and the world order. We also call on your honorable Council to make international law, as if it were the basis of the foolishness on which organization was based, not take sides in favor of any party to the cause of injustice, civilian persecution, and the short displacement of civilians in the Gaza Strip.  It is widely considered collective in accordance with Article 2 of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide. It prohibits that the siege of Gaza deprives civilians of access to electricity, food, and shelter. It is an illegal and inhumane act and may be considered a crime. Such collective measures are prohibited under Article 3.  From the Alan Agreement, His Excellency the President, respected ladies and gentlemen, history and international law have taught us that self-defense cannot justify genocide or collective punishment and the targeting of innocent civilians, since preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the population is a crime under international law. Hence, the Sultanate of Oman demands the necessity of an immediate halt.  To open fire, stop Israeli military operations, and ensure the access of all humanitarian and additional aid and basic needs to the Palestinian people. We hold Israel, as a protesting authority, responsible for this action. His Excellency the President, Sultan Amman, intends with his restored political solution to dialogue and the rule of law, from the faction that calls for the intervention of the international community to lead to war in the Gaza Strip.  It was deterred by international law and its continued military operations against civilians inside the train, demolishing pedestrians, neighborhoods and civilian neighborhoods in all Palestinian territories. The call for holding a joint conference with the participation of all parties concerned with the Palestinian issue in this regard leads to the end of the Israeli rule and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and the extended divisions.

At the beginning, we extend our congratulations to the Mata delegation for assuming the presidency of the Council’s work for this month and for its distinguished efforts. We also thank the delegation of the sister Republic of Algeria for its great and distinguished efforts in submitting a draft resolution requesting full membership of the State of Palestine. Today, Iraq reaffirms  Before the international community, because it provides for the establishment of a Palestinian state with full membership in the United Nations, this recognition is considered an employee based on the principles of justice, equality, and the right to self-determination, which are the principles on which the concept of the United Nations is based existentially. The recognition decision is not considered a compliment or a grant of the state’s standards as stipulated. International law exists, so Palestine has a defined territory, a permanent population, a national government, and the ability to enter into designated relations with other countries. It is part of efforts to establish peace and justice in our region. Depriving Palestine of the status it deserves like the rest of the member states of this organization is a denial of basic religious rights and five values ​​of international justice.  The Palestinians, as you all know, have suffered from long decades of occupation, displacement, oppression, leveling, and confiscation of lands from the brutal occupying authority. Many of them lost their lives and lost their lands and homes that they inherited from their fathers and grandfathers as a result of an illegal occupation that is extremely severe in human rights violations and the distortion of peace, in violation of international law. Mr. President, the recognition of Palestine as a complete and complete state is a new confirmation of the international community’s commitment to supporting the rights of the Palestinian people, and a firm step towards a just and lasting solution to the conflict that we find in the country, as this recognition will lead to giving Palestine the appropriate platform to achieve its legitimate aspirations towards security, chastity, peace, and full effective participation in society.  And in obtaining the vital resources and assistance necessary for its development, my delegation expresses its regret at the inability of the Security Council to achieve the just Palestinian dream of establishing its independent state and recognizing it alongside the nations that offer peace and security. We extend our thanks, appreciation, and special greetings to the member states that supported the Q, Vote, and Sik project.  What in history are the honorable positions taken by those countries that reflected the noble values ​​and new human qualities for the sake of peace and security for the peoples of the world? Iraq will work tirelessly and without stopping with all those who love Islam for Palestine, a complete, playful and free state that has settled on its I have the h on beh 121 states. movement at the
