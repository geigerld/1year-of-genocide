let's go to the US now it says it won't support any Israeli plans to conduct a major military operation in Rafa White House spokesman John Kirby warned that doing so would be a disaster for the more than a million civilians who fled there Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military would soon enter the city to Target Hamas calling it one of the militants last remaining strongholds smoke Rises over the crowded city of Rafa Israeli bombardments in preparation for a ground assault into what it says is a stronghold for Hamas which is classified as a terrorist organization by many countries but for hundreds of thousands of gazin who have fled to the southern end of the strip after being told by the Israeli Army to leave their homes further north Rafa is the last Refuge it's also home to one of the biggest border crossings for Aid and supplies Israel says Rafa also houses multiple tunnels that Hamas uses to supply itself with arms the shelling has already taken its toll here even before soldiers arrive three missiles hit this same place where I'm standing there's not much to say about the victims children women and the elderly I wish we could have collected their whole bodies instead we have bits and pieces we're all hearing that there will be a ground incursion into Rafa I imagine things will be extremely bad but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin net yahu insists there's no alternative to the military collapse of Hamas there is no solution other than total Victory if Hamas survives in Gaza it is only a matter of time until the next Massacre and the Access of Evil of Iran and its proxies will continue their campaign we instructed the Army to prepare to operate also in Rafa and in two of the camps in the center the last remaining strongholds of Hamas with peacemaking efforts apparently stalled for the time being the people of Rafa will pay the price for both sides unwillingness to come to a deal for more on the American perspective on the situation let's go across to Janelle dumala from our Washington Bureau it's good to see you Janelle the US says it will not support an Israeli operation in Rafa uh have any more details emerged indeed we heard from both the White House and the state department today both of them saying that Washington will not back an assault into Rafa earlier we heard from National Security Council spokesman John Kirby saying that they had not seen any evidence that Israel was in fact planning to do this imminently nevertheless Washington feels it is important to warn that this would represent disaster that this would represent terrible humanitarian effects we are of course talking about 1.2 million people Sheltering there now it is not clear what the US would do at this point if uh Israel decided to proceed with such an incursion but if the death toll in Gaza approaching 28,000 is anything to go by despite us ENT treaties then we can probably tell at this point if is probably fair to say that uh the U that such us entreaties are not falling on the most receptive of years so a clear warning but no more details about how the US will put this pressure is it possible that this will have an effect on the aid package for Israel that the Senate is debating well that's difficult to say in advance but just to back up a little what we're talking about here is the foreign aid package being currently debated in the Senate as he said So within this package 14 billion dollar uh uh should be earmarked for security assistance for Israel $1 billion to go to uh civilians affected by uh to towards humanitarian uh assistance for civilians affected by war in the West Bank Gaza and um uh and Ukraine now the bill is at a stage where amendments are going to be proposed to it this is a bill that is probably going to stay on the senate floor until next week however what is going to be interesting to watch out for is whether Democrats especially from Democratic senators especially from the left wing of the party if they will be able to push through amendments that would compel recipients of such security assistance from the US to be a to only use Us weapons in accordance with International humanitarian law law and not impede efforts to get humanitarian assistance to civilians now these are amendments that might not mention Israel specifically by name but what could happen is the news of such an incursion in to Rafa might Focus minds and might uh might further uh lend urgency to efforts for lawmakers to get Washington to use the leverage that it has over Israel quite a bit to follow there DWS Janelle dumal in Washington thank you so much for doing that for
