well you are Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has met with Palestinian leader Mahmud abas in Jordan Mr abas Heads the Palestinian Authority which controls the occupied West Bank he told Mr blinkin that he rejects the forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza after days of Silence since the Hamas terror attack that killed more than 1300 Israelis the Palestinian leader finally condemned violence against civilians by both sides well our senior International correspondent uh fny fasar is in Jerusalem and she told me more about that meeting between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the US Secretary of State that meeting is quite important in fact it's pretty much the only channel that the United States as well as the International Community has when it comes to uh the Palestinian territories because Hamas as a which is designated a a terrorist organization is obviously not the organization that the us is going to seek any kind of channeling with they are turning to the head of the Palestinian Authority uh uh president abas who's been seen already yesterday meeting Jordan's King King Abdullah II and it's expected that pretty much what's been talked about there in Jordan uh with Mr Abdullah is also part of the conversation between blinkin and abas and that is number one how to deescalate the situation and also how to make sure that the humanitarian corridors in place to help aid getting in to Gaza Strip now uh the US Secretary of State blinkin meeting uh the head of the Palestinian Authority is important because he is in charge or partially in charge of occupied West Bank however uh Mr Abbas doesn't have any control whatsoever since 2007 over Gaza and also it's very important diplomatically even though there may not be any immediate result from that meeting for the United States from the US perspective in this realm of several meetings that are on the way that are uh to expected to happen uh for example Mr blinkin is to go on from here from Jordan to uh meet uh the leaders of Qatar and the leader of Saudi Arabia all in an effort trying to deescalate uh the US government says but also in an effort trying to somehow release the hostages many of them are also American in fact Qatar has already offered some sort of a mediation here with Hamas they have close contacts with a Hamas militant group trying to release this hostage but as we're hearing apparently at least according to the militant arm to the uh to uh the militant arm of the hammer group apparently 13 captives have been killed already uh during air strikes by Israel last night let's talk now to Middle East security analyst Jonathan Spire also in Jerusalem uh welcome to DW I'd like to talk about the the the role of of the of the Palestinian Authority leader um uh Mahmud Abbas in this we'll come to his comments in a in a sec but first let's start with his silence nothing until uh Anthony blinkin uh arrives what do we make of that I'm afraid what we need to make of it is that Mahmud Abbas in a certain sense is responding rationally to his situation which is that he and the rala Leed the malab based rather Palestinian Authority are simply not uh players in the uh drama current unfolding in the Gaza Strip and in Israel because of course as as we know since 2007 say for 16 years now since the Hamas uh expelled his organization fatak and the PA from the Gaza Strip they have not wielded power or authority or indeed maintained any consequential even political uh presence inside Gaza so mmad abess has been silent because as the saying goes in English whereof one has nothing to say thereof one should be silent I think he seems to be following that edict and it's perfectly understandable and he opens his mouth now and I I'll just read you the the quote that I have here he call for an immediate end to the comprehensive aggression against the Palestinian people he also rejected practices related to killing civilians or ambushing them on both sides so obviously quite an evenhanded approach no condemnation specifically of Hamas uh there what do you make of that well absolutely um abas is I suppose following the usual uh line in Palestinian politics whereby he will avoid criticizing other Palestinian factions which are engaged in Warfare against Israel I don't think anybody particularly needs to be surprised by this because it's been a constant pattern really with a and the PA over the last couple of years to avoid any such condemnation uh you know I think what it further indicates really certainly many Israelis I think will see it as further indicating the extent to which no partner really for dialogue unfortunately exists on the Palestinian side nobody's under any allusion iions regarding one the one side of Palestinian politics Hamas but really I think what abbas's response shows but it won't come as a surprise I think either to Israelis or to many observers of the situation is that he also from his basic standpoint I'm afraid doesn't really constitute a partner for any coherent diplomatic process or progress uh to be made but again I don't think this needs to really surprise us this is abas acting very much within the parameters which he's acted for some considerable time now so given what you say about uh Mr abas having no influence or authority over there in Gaza why is um Secretary of State blinken uh why is he there talking to him yeah that's actually an excellent question and I'm afraid I personally find it rather difficult to to answer I mean secretary blinken it's understood you know as the as a representative of the the superpower and of a country which also affords a large amount of Aid by the way to the Palestinian Authority wishes to speak to to all players on the ground so to speak but yeah I would have to also question really in my estimation at least whether that's a useful use of his time at the present time but I think your correspondent also pointed out and correctly that of course the Americans have no open dialogue with Kamas because Hamas is a designated Terror organization so I suppose secretary blinken wants to meet with somebody from the Palestinian side so he's chosen to meet with as I said at the beginning the somewhat irrelevant leader of the ramala Palestinian Authority at the present time who has no say no uh clout so to speak no ability to influence events on the ground in the Gaza Strip and obviously not on the Israeli side either so who either in the region or anywhere else is in a position to influence uh Hamas um activities we we've heard in the the last couple of days about uh qat uh being used as some sort of U intermedi intermediary intermediary are they the only people the I would say that Hamas really in the Middle East region has three uh countries or states which are Allied or aligned or supportive of it on one level or another and those three countries are Islamic Republic of Iran the Republic of turkey and the emirat of Qatar now with regard to Iran the Iranians of course are the main military or indeed the only military backers only significant military backers of Kamas the Kamas military capacity the m302 missiles the F even the Tactical abilities that were uh displayed on Saturday derived from the relationship with Iran so one could seek to talk to Iran Iran but of course that wouldn't be very useful because the Iranians are basically supportive of the Hamas uh Slaughter which took place on Saturday and of their military efforts that leaves you with turkey and Qatar who are not militarily backing Hamas but they do maintain close diplomatic relationships with the movement and indeed Kamas leadership top leadership is currently resident in Doha in Qatar so yes I think if one want if one were looking to establish a Channel of communication with Hamas the sensible way to do it would probably go through Qatar and that does indeed appear to be what is uh what is taking place my own sense at least certainly from the Israeli side at least what we're seeing publicly is that there's currently very little interest actually in a diplomatic Channel Israel wants to hit back militarily at the slaughter and murder of its citizens that took place on Saturday and I think there's probably going to be or I think it's we can all conclude really there is going to be a military chapter to this on the ground before any diplomacy of any kind really has a realistic chance of moving forward but yes Qatar is the address I would say for westerners and for westerners seeking to Western countries seeking to make uh contact with and communication with Hamas thanks for that it's very clear a security analyst Jonathan Spire in Jerusalem let's talk more about the blinken visit with Ian ler he's vice president of the German Marshall fund that's a public policy Think Tank welcome to DW what influence can the US bring to bear on this situation given that it's been largely absent uh from the this Middle East issue over the last few years well there are some important aspects of American influence in this above all over uh Israeli strategy and policy uh but even that of course would have its limits I mean as we can see with the blinkin visit there are attempts to engage with uh with nonviolent Palestinian political elements those have been ongoing of course for a very very long time but the Palestinian Israeli track of the peace process as you say has not has not progressed in many many years um beyond that when it comes to the hostage crisis and other aspects of this situation I think the American influence is actually rather limited and but it is very important for the United States to talk to countries like Qatar and turkey who may be able to play a role in that regard when it comes to the military side of things of course the United States has much more leverage because you you you factor into that as it as the the US talks to uh to Kata and and turkey and obviously not Iran the three main uh people who can uh influence uh Hamas that has to be seen uh under the the the shadow of America saying we absolutely and unwaveringly back Israel which kind of limits its room for maneuver well I think it does but I think it's also inevitable because that is that is long-standing American policy and and that really transcends the fact that uh prime minister Netanyahu is not entirely popular in Washington in many quarters and there have been many differences with Israel in recent years uh there could be differences over strategy now but the basic principle of supporting Israel after this devastating attack I think is is is is solid and I think the Biden Administration or indeed any other American Administration would have pursued exactly the same course I think that's that's it goes without saying the US is also in talks with Egypt about trying to create a humanitarian Corridor to allow civilians to uh flee Gaza uh the only Crossing into Egypt at the moment the Rafa Crossing we told is being bombed by Israeli aircraft so is such a humanitarian uh passage Corridor and likely to happen well it's possible it's possible also that that might be a place to establish a Carter for supplies to come into Gaza to Southern Gaza um of course Egypt is is not keen on having uh Hamas or indeed uh Palestinian refugees from Gaza coming into Egypt Egypt is already concerned by jihadist terrorism inside the country uh and you know the fact that the Border has been closed is really in part for many years the the result of Egypt not wanting it to be open so uh I I think this will be rather difficult but as the situation evolves and becomes more more serious and more desperate in humanitarian terms uh there may be an opening on that front and the United States actually could play a role in talking to Egypt about that so the the US has a limited uh diplomatic heft in this particular uh situation but it is on on the the military side sending an aircraft carrier and warships to the region as well as boosting military aid uh to Israel so let's talk about the uh the role of military defense in the US playbook in in this situation well I think that forces that have been deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean are are in part a signal of political support to Israel over the situation in Gaza but I think more importantly it's about the potential for escalation in Lebanon involving hisbah and Iranian back militias and even Iran directly perhaps under some circumstances and there you know having these additional American forces available would make a very very big difference I think at the moment it's all about deterrence but the other piece of this Which is less visible but maybe as as important as anything else is the intelligence cooperation that is surely going on between Israel and the United States and others who have hostages um in Gaza um we have to see how this situation evolves but obviously there are things that can be done on the intelligence gathering and even the Special Operations front uh where the United States could play a significant role right so it sounds unlikely that that the US Secretary of State is going to come away from this uh this visit with anything that looks like success well this the nature of the situation at the moment makes it very difficult to Define what anything that would look like success might look like um I I think you know simply making this Vis I do apologize Ian ler from the German martial fund we're going to cut it there because we're we're going now to a a press conference between the the US defense secretary and the Israel Defense secretary thank you so much for joining us though the secretary and I have just left the warm we set where decisions are made on Israeli Security on our most sensitive interests I brief the secretary on strategic developments in our region and the chief of staff together with the IDF leadership shared our our operations defense cooperation and US support in the Pentagon in the White House in the Congress ensure freedom of operation and enforce our capabilities in fact today we will receive the second aircraft carrying essential munition to the IDF us deployment of assets on land in air and at Sea sends a strong message on to both our partners and enemies in the region on beh of Israel's defense establishment and of be on behalf of our citizens Mr secretary thank you very much let me remind you all our audience who is the enemy our neighbors is Hamas the Isis of Gaza an organization enjoying the Iranian payroll I cannot not let the world forget the brutal attacks Hamas terrorists conduct against Israeli children Israeli women Israeli elderly and entire families murder rape kidnapping this is what we face in this war this is a war on the existing of Israel as a prosperous State as a democratic State as the homeland of the Jewish people this is a war on freedom and on our common values and we are on the front line we will keep fighting and we will win this war we will prevail with your permission Mr secretary I'll say few words in okay so you're watching DW news live from Berlin we're watching a press conference given by the US uh defense secretary and the Israeli defense secretary that's Lloyd Austin and youf Galant Mr Galant now speaking addressing the the meeting in Hebrew uh he he started off about two or three minutes ago in English um thanking Mr Austin for the for us defense cooperation which he said was to ensure the freedom uh of the operation and to extend is capability so he's thanking them for their Military Support he also talked I think he talked about an aircraft carrier being uh uh may put at the disposal of uh uh Israeli Defense Forces uh he said the US uh deployments send a strong message and then described Isis excuse me it described Hamas as the Isis of Gaza and being on the Iranian uh payroll you'll recall how um throughout this last just just under a week Israel has been comparing uh what happened uh last week Saturday to Pearl Harbor and uh 9911 combined this he said is a war on the existence of Israel and a war on uh the freedom and on our common values we will keep fighting and we will win this war he said so uh this is what's go this is what you're watching uh now uh on here on DW um you have and speaking in uh Hebrew uh we'll uh dip in a little more and then we'll hear uh very shortly from the US defense secretary Lloyd Austin this of course on the same day that the uh US Secretary of State is also uh in the region on the same thank you sir well good afternoon everyone y have we've been in close touch but it's good to see you again in person and it's good to be back in Israel even during such terrible days as a US Secretary of Defense I am here in person to make something Crystal Clear America's support for Israel is Ironclad and I extend my deepest condolences to the Israeli people for those killed or wounded in this terrible Slaughter by Hamas I'm also here in solidarity with all the fames still living the waking nightmare of not knowing the fate of their loved ones and we will continue to coordinate closely with Israel to help secure the release of the innocent men women and children in the clutches of Hamas including American citizens now Israel is a small country a place where everybody knows everybody and in times of trial the intimacy of your Society deepens the intimacy of your grief but that's not a weakness it is a profound strength and in times of test in Israelis know what to do over this awful week we've seen Israeli hotels and homes Tak in those who've had to to flee we've seen long lineups to donate blood we've seen whatsapps explode with messages as people race to support Neighbors in anguish and perhaps because I'm a retired General en I was especially moved by the story of a retired General named Noam T-Bone his son called him on Saturday from his home near Gaza to say that Hamas terrorists had stormed their caboots and were closing in and the retired General jumped into his car in Tel Aviv and raced toward the combat zone he linked up with other Fighters and rescued his son his daughter daughter-in-law and his granddaughters and when the general arrived at their house one of his granddaughters just said Grandpa's here and these are arrays of Hope in a terrible week and in times like these Sometimes the best that a a the best thing that a friend can do is just to show up and to get to work now this is no time for neutrality or for false equivalence or for excuses for the inexcusable there is never any justification for terrorism and that's especially true after is rampaged by Hamas and anyone who wants lasting peace and security for this region must condemn and isolate Hamas Hamas does not speak for the Palestinian people or their legitimate hopes for dignity security and statehood and peace alongside Israel as a former commander of Central Command the deliberate cruelty of Hamas vividly reminds me of Isis bloodthirsty fanatical and hateful and like Isis Hamas has nothing to offer but zealotry bigotry and death the world has just witnessed a great evil the deadliest attack on civilians in the history of the state of Israel and the bloodiest day in Jewish history since the end of the Holocaust so make no mistake the United States will make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and Israel has a right to protect its people you know and there are many phone calls this week President Biden has told prime minister Netanyahu that the United States would also respond swiftly and decisively to such a ma massive terrorist assault and the President also Al underscored that democracies like ours are stronger and more secure when we uphold the laws of war terrorists like Hamas deliberately Target civilians but democracies don't this is a time for resolve and not revenge for purpose and not panic and for for security and not surrender at President Biden's direction we have moved urgently to respond to this crisis and to send to send a strong message of deterrence the USS Gerald R Ford carrier strike group is now in the region led by the largest aircraft carrier in the world we've augmented us fighter aircraft squadrons in the Middle East and the US Department Department of Defense stands fully ready to deploy additional assets if [Music] necessary as President Biden has said for any country for any group or anyone thinking about trying to take advantage of this atrocity to try to widen the conflict or to spill more blood we have just one word don't the world is watching and so are we and we aren't going anywhere we will remain in close contact with our valued Partners across the region and security assistance from the Department of Defense is already rapidly flowing into Israel that includes Munitions and air defense capabilities and other equipment and resources it also includes more interceptors for Iron Dome to save israeli's Israeli lives and we will continue to ensure that Israel has what it needs to keep itself secure now Hamas attacked at a time of global challenge but the United States is the most powerful country in the world and we remain fully able to project power and uphold our commitments and direct resources to multiple theaters so we will stand with Israel even as we stand with Ukraine United States can walk and chew gum at the same time and US SEC security assistance to Israel will flow in at the speed of war and as this harrowing week draws to a close and as Shabbat draws near we stand together and we stand strong United States has Israel's back and that is not negotiable and it never will be and after this terrible week I wish you and all the people of Israel shabbat shalom thank you we'll be starting with the question starting with Alon B Channel 13 thank you Mr okay so you you're watching uh DW you're watching a uh a live press conference between the defense secretaries of the United States and Israel obviously uh in reaction uh to uh the events of almost a week ago uh yav Gallant the um the Israeli uh defense secretary spoke first uh and talked about defense cooperation between their two countries to as he put it ensure the freedom of operation of Israeli Defense Forces and to extend their capabilities uh he and the US Secretary of State both talked about uh the deployment of a US battle group uh to the Mediterranean and um Colonel Austin uh made the point or repeated the point that came uh from President Biden uh the warning uh to anyone thinking of extending the conflict he said we have just one word uh don't uh it was so what we're going to do now is go back to that press conference and listen to the question and answer session listening to um the Israeli uh defense secretary there answering a question in Hebrew one of the biggest points of uh this conflict that people have been talking about is where uh us how the US will respond to this new conflict as it uh is also uh dealing uh or leading the efforts to uh help Ukraine against Russia and the US Secretary of State was very uh firm about that the Hamas attack came at a time of global challenge he said we will stand with Israel even as we stand with Ukraine Gaza rise while Israel conducts its counterattacks and perhaps a ground Invasion do you believe the moral culpability for those Palestinian deaths belongs to Israel Hamas or both I'll leave it to Israel to uh to talk about its potential plans and uh its approach to uh conducting operations uh Matt I'll just uh um say again that Israel has a right to defend itself and we will support Israel's right to defend itself we will continue to flow in security assistance and I've worked with Israeli forces over the years over many years as you know I wore a uniform for 41 years my experience in working with Israeli forces is they are professional they're disciplined and they are focused on the right things and so I expect that uh going forward they will continue to exhibit that same degree of professionalism that we've seen in the past but you know Matt we've seen this before uh the International Community fought Isis uh who in some cases was uh was embedded uh deeply in builtup areas and that International Coalition uh fought valiantly and prot protected civilians and created corridors for uh humanitarian uh movement even in the midst of a of a pretty significant fight so again this is a professional force it is well-led and I I have every expectation that it will be disciplined thank you and for Minister Galant let's get more from our senior International correspondent funny FHA in Jerusalem welcome funny let's start with that meeting between uh the defense uh minister mins of the two countries talk us through what they said well basically the Us official US Secretary of Defense they made it very Crystal Clear just like his colleague US Secretary of State Mr blinkin yesterday who I met prime minister netan here in Israel that the support of the US is very much basically comparable to a blank check whatever the whatever Israel needs how long it needs it us is going to be there and as he says that support is iron class so uh when it comes to the US basically the message make no doubt about any of that that United States is going to stand side by side with Israel now that what I find quite interesting in that statement within this Prince conference that I was uh just listening to as well is that uh the defense uh uh Ministry there also made clear without actually precisely naming Iran for example or Iran backed hisbah the militant group uh in Lebanon for example he made very PR much Clear whoever wants to benefit from this and interfere shouldn't he used the word don't uh pretty much uh the same H remarks are made already by US President Biden uh prior to that so once again another Us official here in Israel making clear that the US has Israel's back uh meanwhile as these uh states are being made of course people especially Palestinians ask themselves what about the uh humanitarian consequences what will that support of the United States for Israel Israel trying to defend itself as it says and trying to take Hamas out the militant group from Gaza what does that really will mean what will that mean for people in a Gaza Strip and and and how will you be able to make sure uh that the humanitarian consequences here are not going to explode into really an apocalyptic situation in Gaza Strip and uh the other big issue of the day is this IDF order to people in Northern Gaza to leave to the South and what sort of response are you seeing uh there from uh Jerusalem basically uh what what what what people are trying to understand here first of all that that order by IDF by Israeli military to say basically half of uh the population there in Gaza Strip that's 1 million ion about 1 million should move from the north to the South how is this practicable at all how is that how how should that be put in action while obviously the constant bombings while there constant air trikes air strikes already we're hearing from Palestinian uh officials that apparently, 1500 people have been killed in Gaza Strip among them five 500 children at least so uh for one Israel warning basically the Palestinians by saying move from the north to the South but with in 24 hours which is H as the UN says impossible to do without any humanitarian consequences is a way for Israel to war to warn but on the other hand how can you really help the people the ordinary citizens uh in who are caught up in this and who are literally trapped in the situation in Gaza Strip as the next step is likely to unfold quite soon which is the a full scale invasion of israelian forces in Gaza Strip thank you that funny funny in
