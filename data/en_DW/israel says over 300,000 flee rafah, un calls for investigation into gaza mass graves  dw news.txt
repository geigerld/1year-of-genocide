Israel has called on Palestinians to evacuate more parts of Rafa as well as two neighborhoods in Northern Gaza the Israeli military says more than 300,000 people in Rafa have already fled the area as fighting between Israeli troops and Palestinian militants intensifies in the southern region which borders Egypt heavy clashes there have left crucial Aid Crossings in accessible according to the Israeli military Hamas is trying to rebuild its capabilities in the north of Gaza journalist Sami s joins me from Jerusalem hello Sami is this the start of Israel's long stated plan to attack the remaining Hamas forces in Rafa well on Thursday night there was a cabinet meeting a security political cabinet and there was also a meeting of the uh smaller War cabinet and in both of these forums uh they decided to go ahead with this offensive in Rafa but they did not say whether this is the beginning of the a major escalation or whether this will be a limited attack and I think that we will have to see in the uh forcoming days the the scope of this right uh the US has warned Israel against launching the full skill invasion of Rafa is the Israeli government worried about losing support from its main Ally if it does for sure there are grave concerns uh in Israel uh regarding the uh the the threats by the American Administration uh but I I can tell you many people here in Israel they view uh these statements that are coming out of Washington as statements that are linked to the internal politics in the United States and namely the upcoming November elections they're saying that inside the United States um Biden is concerned that the ONG gring protests in the universities uh against the Israeli War in Gaza is going to cost him the upcoming elections and therefore he's making these statements uh but that after the elections whether it will be Republicans Or democrats it would be more like business as usual right right uh there have been more protests calling for the Israeli government to do more to get hostages released how much pressure is the government under yeah well today the relatives of the hostages uh they stage a protest in Tel AV in which they were uh putting all the the blame on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and they were saying that so long Benjamin Netanyahu is the prime minister of Israel their relatives will not be released uh from captivity and that the first thing that has to be done is the removal of nany they called the other members of the government to leave this government they're saying that this government is not acting to release the hostage but is rather a aiming at the war in in Rafa and I I can tell you that even though majority of the public in Israel support some kind of a a prisoner swap a hostage swap the base the political right-wing base is actually in favor of these kinds of operations in RAF and this is where netan is getting his political support DW correspondent Aya Ibraham joins me now from Jerusalem Aya is there a sense there that this renewed evacuation order in Rafa is a sign that Israel is about to launch a major offensive there despite international calls not to do so well Israel Israeli officials and the prime minister of Israel have been cleared that going into Rafa is a priority uh for them that uh that Israel would uh continue with these plans despite as you mentioned International uh warnings from the International Community not to do so and in fact warnings from uh Israel's uh closest allies the United Ally the United States not uh uh to do so so far um Israel has been operating in uh Rafa but uh with air strikes that they claim are targeted air strikes but we are talking about uh an area that is uh very much dense uh densely populated with over 2 million people Sheltering in that southernmost part of the strip and there have been tanks uh as you mentioned um at the uh at the at the border crossing between uh Rafa and Egypt on the uh Gaza side of uh the border and certainly uh these new evacuation orders and the images that we're uh seeing right now with people um rushing out of that southernmost area seems to suggest that an operation is H eminent however analysts have also suggested that um this Invasion eminent Invasion on Rafa something that's a little bit more uh invasive than what we've seen so far is a bargaining chip for uh the Israelis um as it is now certainly the last uh what they say is the last uh part of the strip where uh there are there are still Hamas uh uh battalions so it's it's unclear but certainly um something that they've said that the Israelis have said they are willing and prepared to continue with just out of curiosity how did the people in Rafa get the latest evacuation orders well according to uh eyewitness reports uh they've gotten them through text uh or even phone calls uh there are also leaflets that are uh often being uh dropped in these areas as a way to warn uh people that's what um Israel always says is it's its attempt to try and um you know minimize civilian harm and to get civilians out of Harm's Way But as human humanitarian organizations have also been saying that um this you know warning people when there's no real safe place to go or no place where the basic needs survival exist uh is is is is useless in a way because where are these people these hundreds of thousands if not Millions supposed to go in a in a tiny piece of land that has been under a constant bomb bombardment for almost seven months now okay that is Aya Ibraham in Jerusalem many thanks you Aya now the UN Security Council is calling for an independent investigation into reports of mass Graves found near hospitals raided by Israel in Gaza Hamas accuses Israel of killing the victims and burying them but Israel says Palestinians buried the bodies a warning this report contains the stress and content rescue workers uncovered dozens of bodies at alifa hospital over the past few weeks hundreds of corpses have already been found in gaza's North and in the south at Nasa Hospital in hunis people have been coming to see if their missing loved ones are among the Dead my husband has been missing for about a month and we've been searching for him he didn't used to go out much he would only leave to bring us food and water he's been missing since the Israeli Army entered hunas and we've been searching for him but to no avail under International humanitarian law health facilities and hospitals are entitled to special prote ctions during war the United Nations says it's deeply alarmed by the reports of mass Graves it is imperative that independent International investigators with forensic expertise are allowed the immediate access to the sides of these Mass Graves to establish the precise circumstances under which hundreds of Palestinians lost their lives and were buried or reburied the families of the de and missing have a right to know what happened there are competing narratives around several of these Mass Graves including serious allegations that some of those buried were unlawfully killed Israel says Palestinians buried the bodies and that Israeli forces examined them while searching for the remains of hostages taken by Hamas in the October 7th Terror attacks the Hamas run civil defense accuses Israel of killing and burying them Israel had carried out raids in both hospitals alleging Hamas militants used them as command centers and to hold hostages Mass grave excavations are complex and the sites have already being disturbed uncovering the truth of what happened here could prove difficult
