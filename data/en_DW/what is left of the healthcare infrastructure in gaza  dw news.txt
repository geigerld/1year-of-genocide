well as gaza's Medical Teams fight to treat the thousands wounded by Israel's military operation the need to prioritize has become essential that means precious little care for those who were critically ill before October 7th as you're about to see evacuating cancer patients from gaza's hospitals poses considerable risks but in the current climate there's almost no alternative families wait for hours at gaza's Southern Rafa Crossing hoping to get a seat on the next bus into Egypt foreigners and Palestinian Jewel Nationals are permitted to leave Gaza and now some gazen cancer patients are being offered an opportunity to travel to Turkey for treatment but the process is not straightforward for everyone I've been left without treatment for over a month doctors provided me with a document to travel to Turkey to take merely one injection and return to Gaza as the hospital doesn't have the injection when I arrived at the Crossing I was told that my name is not on the list and I may return tomorrow or they'll call me two planes carrying cancer patients landed in anchora from Egypt following negotiations between the Turkish and Egyptian authorities Egypt has also accepted a limited amount of medical evacuees gaza's remaining hospitals are running out of medical supplies and fuel here in hian yunes they have to treat patients by torch light most doctors now have to prioritize a Emergency Care over patients with other health conditions but evacuating patients is not an easy process the World Health Organization says the options are limited to evacuate patients from gaza's largest hospital alifa in Gaza City following a raid on the hospital by Israeli military to organize a medical evacuation uh such as this in such an insecure setting uh is very very complicated uh firstly you need to secure uh security guarantees and safe passage for any Convoy um negotiations with the Israeli Defense Forces are being managed uh through uh the UN offices who does not do the direct negotiation on those issues um so uh the office for coordination of humanitarian assistance uh manages that element of uh of the evacuation process then you we have to prioritize the patients who who would be moved first uh so we'd be looking at the most critically ill and again those theat evacuating patients from gaza's hospitals poses considerable risks but staying put could be the more life-threatening alternative for more let's bring in Shaya low here she works for the Norwegian Refugee Council and is monitoring developments from Jerusalem first of all shanana tell us what you are hearing from from the alifa hospital there in Northern Gaza well we aren't hearing much of anything from Gaza right now because since about 400 p.m. yesterday there's been a Communications blackout so we are just in the dark as much as anyone else's at this point we did have staff at El shifa as recently as last week who were seeking shelter there but they fled about a week ago uh and and made their way further south now the Gaza Strip uh as you know is home to over 2 million people it's now a war zone thousands have been killed tens of thousands injured there what's left of the health care infrastructure in the Gaza Strip well we've been warning for weeks about the imminent collapse of the the Health Care system in Gaza and it seems like we are there uh I believe uh only a handful of hospitals are still uh operational in Gaza we're also of course because people are in such Close Quarters do not have access to proper clean water uh showers we're seeing the spread of diseases uh and and illness so on top of the fact that the hospitals are overwhelmed taking care of people who have been injured uh people with chronic conditions or people with preventable communicable diseases are now going to be overwhelming what's left of the Health Care System you work with a refugee organization ation the Norwegian Refugee Council uh talk to us about the displaced people in Gaza now because many from the north have moved to the South but in the South it's not really safe either I understand no it hasn't been safe uh in the South we're hearing up up until yesterday we were hearing daily reports from our colleagues about air strikes happening in the center in south of Gaza uh we had colleagues who have been injured and had members of their Ames be killed in these air strikes including one of our colleagues AAL who lost her her only child a seven-year-old boy in an air strike on Rafa about 3 four weeks ago uh it's really there simply is no safe place to seek shelter in Gaza and then on top of that you have an area that really doesn't have the capacity to support all those internally displaced people so shelters are bursting at the seams overc capacity many people are sleeping in the streets which is increasingly worried ing as the weather has transitioned here the last week uh and gotten uh significantly colder uh the rains have the rain season has started and so you have issues around people you know being exposed to the elements flooding uh is a regular occurrence in Gaza due to poor infrastructure even before this escalation so there are many concerns about how to support these internally displaced people and keep them keep them protected from the elements let alone uh Israeli air strikes and bombardments many of those who've been displaced of course are children uh talk to us about conditions for them for children in Gaza we know many have been killed and injured but what about those that been left orphaned by the fighting who's going to care for them you know Gaza is an is is a place unlike any other that I've heard about where they actually in the hospitals have an acronym for um injured child uh no surviving family and and it's it's really unimaginable when you have people whose entire families have been wiped out how are you going to take care of them we're now in a situation also where we have this Communications blackout so even the coordination of assistance for these children is difficult prior to this escalation uh save the children had reported that 80% of children in Gaza felt depressed and hopeless imagine how how children in Gaza feel today we at at the Norwegian Refugee Council were working in schools providing psychosocial support and training teachers to help work with children who had suffered trauma and displacement but at this point we have an entire population that's completely traumatized Shena thank you very much for talking with us that was Shaya low with the Norwegian Refugee
