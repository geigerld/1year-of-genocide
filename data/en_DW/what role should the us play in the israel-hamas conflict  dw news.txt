Israel is preparing for a possible ground assault against Hamas in the Gaza Strip at the same time US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is in Israel to show solidarity with an anguishing ally but also to sound out diplomatic possibilities listening whether or not Israel in the Middle East still have an ear for peace from here I'll go on to Jordan where I'll meet with his majesty King Abdullah and with Palestinian Authority president Abbas and then over the coming days we'll visit with leaders in Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Egypt and qter across each of these engagements we'll continue pressing countries to help prevent the conflict from spreading and to use their leverage with Hamas to immediately and unconditionally release the hostages we'll also discuss how we can continue to make real our affirmative vision for a region that's more peaceful more prosperous more secure more integrated and in fact that is the choice and the choice in some ways has been made even more Stark by the actions of Hamas on Saturday One path forward is a region that comes together integrated normalized relations among its countries people working in common purpose to Common benefit more peaceful more stable then there's the path that Hamas has shown in Stark clear light Terror destruction nihilism the choice could not be more clear we know the choice that we're making our partners are making we have work to do to carry it through all right I want to bring in Laura Blumenfeld now she spent two decades as a reporter covering the Middle East for the Washington Post she also served at the US state department as a policy adviser for the Middle East peace process and she is the author of Revenge a story of Hope which she wrote after searching for a Palestinian gunman who shot and wounded her father in Jerusalem a woman well qualified to talk about what we're talking about tonight miss blefeld it's good to have you with us you spent 20 years as a reporter in the Middle East where do the events of the past five days rank in your experience well in the words of the Secretary of State who you were just featuring it defies comprehension um we thought we'd seen it all and the two words that keep coming back again and again in these broadcasts is unprecedented and barbarism if you look at the scale of the Israeli response so far how do you think the Israeli strategy will evolve well they've got to present this as a war of necessity the the the endgame is to erase Hamas but you know how do you go about it it has to be uh not one of blood lust but of basic survival I think what was so traumatizing for Israelis is that the attack on Saturday Not only was attack on borders but it was on the imagination it went to the very heart of what Israel was supposed to be it went from Safe Haven to slaughterhouse and so they need to show strength because this is all about in a word deterrence but it can't be brute strength it has to demonstrate sophistication and strategic um forethought I remember speaking two years ago the head of the mosad and I asked him about retaliation when I was reporting my book revenge and he said to me we retaliate you choose the strategy you choose the battlefield and you choose the timing now what's so complicated now is Israel has no choice it's it's upon them they're they're the masters of the preemptive strike and they're paying catchup and the Palestinians involved here I mean we've heard warnings of collective punishment for the Palestinians um in the Gaza Strip we've noticed also this week that when um Palestinians have been interviewed it has been difficult even um for moderate Palestinians or their leaders to condemn the atrocities carried out by Hamas why do you think that is you know when I was negotiating as a state department senior advisor on secretary Ker's uh Israeli Palestinian team we were dealing with concrete issues tangibles like borders security Refugee Jerusalem but the intangibles were just as challenging if not more and what I mean by that is narrative there's context and history to this conflict it goes back a hundred years or thousands depending on where you'd like to begin you could take it all the way back to Genesis if you'd like um and sometimes the the sides get trapped inside their own narratives and it it it it uh eliminates the possibility for empathy and empathy really is the way forward we we heard a very nuanced message from Anthony blinkin uh today that support for Israel at the same time we recognize that Palestinians have legitimate aspirations not to be ruled by Hamas and the US will work with those in the region committed to that and to peace is that the message that Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to hear well this was this was secretary blinkin ber ler and I apologize for my pronunciation moment he landed in Israel and he said I am here as Secretary of State I'm also here as a Jew my stepfather was a survivor of aitz so I think he established his credentials what he was saying to the prime minister is I am I am one of I am I am you you are me we are we stand together and after that he said you know he talked about the atrocities he talked about Israel's right to defend itself but he also said how Israel does this matters we are the same morally and we expect that of our brother in arms and so I think that he I think that he sort of established the right to demand humanity and also yes sewing the seeds of Peace look where the Secretary of State's uh look at his travel itinerary it's Egypt Jordan UAE cutter Saudi Arabia and Beyond these are the seeds of Peace because in in in the crazy upside down world of the Middle East War often does lead to a greater peace yeah and and perhaps perhaps Anthony B is the the right man at the right time I mean the United States as you know has been largely absent as a mediator in the Israeli Palestinian Conflict for the past what decade and a half um what chance does the Biden Administration have to restart those talks well I think there's great opportunity and there's also a narrow window because there are the realities of domestic politics we're walking into you know we're we're we're approaching an election season national elections presidential race and nobody wants to run for president with two Wars right you've got Ukraine and then there's also the Middle East uh hostages just bring back you know the nightmare of Jimmy Carter and an oil crisis back in the 70s failed presidential candidates don't don't uh you know you're not looking for a war or for an oil crisis all of this uh threatens that unless there can be a quick resolution this week we've heard numerous times um that the path to peace and a two-state solution will be rediscovered in a future fure minus Hamas and a future minus Netanyahu do you agree well I mean I think that there will be many uh resignations and political upheaval netanyahu's political career started if you recall back in the 70s with a hostage crisis right there was the hijacking of the plane to anbi and his brother was a military hero was part of that rescue he died and netanyahu's star rose unfortunately I I I think it would wouldn't be you know going out on a limb to say that this is the end of his career ending also with a hostage crisis they're they're neat and tragic book ends um what about the Palestinians I mean who who is Netanyahu going to call that if he wants to talk with them I mean where are the Palestinians who can talk to Israel and have legitimacy among their own people well the Palestinian Authority you know they were the ones that who negotiated uh the Oslo Accords the first time I was sent to Gaza for the Washington Post was in 1993 where I I interviewed Hamas leaders they were literally sitting in the streets in the dirt bemoaning the end of their movement this was 30 years ago um so I think that because they felt like the Palestinian Authority had seized the imagination of of the Palestinian people and represented them so when there is opportunity when there is hope I think that there are um you know there are plenty of leaders among the Palestinian people who truly represent the desire to live as two people side by side that was never the case case with Hamas again going back all the years that I've been meeting with them with their leaders it was always maximalist it was it was a religious War to to occupy the entire um all of Palestine I got I've got um about 20 seconds left quickly let me just ask you um talks between Netanyahu and mmud abas um and bringing peace is is that possible at all well I think right now nobody's talking right there's there's going to be fighting and then the dust settles and then you figure out where you stand for the Israelis they need to really show a show of strength and if they emerge from this um able to sort of reestablish their Sheen of deterrence their Swagger I think they might be willing to take chances for peace but right now the Israelis I mean they're reeling they're on the ropes we've seen it before they're on the ropes just punching but right now it's it's gloves off La bloing Feld joining us tonight from New York City Mr blel we appreciate you taking the time and we appreciate you making this talk happen I know you um it's been a busy day for you thank you glad to be here thank you Daniel kurtzer was Ambassador to Egypt under President Bill Clinton he was US ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005 Ambassador it's good to have you with us this evening the Biden Administration as you well know has been critical of the Netanyahu government in the past the the scale of the Hamas atrocities plus the establishment of this emergency government do you think all of this will prompt Washington or is prompting Washington to give Netanyahu cart blanch to respond to Hamas well Secretary of State uh Tony blinkin is landing in Israel probably right about now and I'm pretty confident that he's carrying two messages number one is please reread what president uh uh Biden said and that the United States stands uh supporting Israel we have their back but I think the private message is um you need to moderate uh the response in a manner that doesn't create its own humanitarian distress and problem Gaza has been a problem for quite some time the people are being held hostage by Hamas now they have Israeli hostages as well um so Israel will need to take this into account as it searches out the Hamas leadership and tries to decapitate it what do you think the role of the United States should be um at this critical time should it be to offer unconditional support to Israel or should it be an agent to help break the cycle of violence I mean if the United States doesn't do it then what power will well I don't like the word cycle of violence uh hamas's actions over the weekend are beyond the pale and uh represent a horrific uh escalation of its own I think the United States as Israel's closest Ally can provide the kind of sobering advice that uh I hope secretary blinkin is bringing but as you saw we're also uh sending two aircraft carrier battle groups to the Mediterranean to send a very important message uh to other players such as his Bala in Lebanon and Iran not to escalate this crisis so I think we we play those two different roles um we will work with countries like Egypt and cutter to see if we can't get some dialogue started to uh address the issue of the hostages uh and see how this goes forward uh but uh Israel is intent upon uh trying to uh uh not only diminish but to uh destroy hamas's capabilities of ever doing again uh the horror of what they committed this weekend prime minister n Yahoo he talks about now of reshaping the Middle East um what is what's your take on on that rhetoric um what do you think he means well frankly I don't know um I think before hamas's attack there was a sense that a Saudi Israel understanding or normalization agreement would be transformative uh and I think that's what the Biden Administration was pursuing in the aftermath of what Hamas has done however uh I think it's going to need we're going to need a lot of time for things to sort out and I'm not sure that there's a new Middle East a comfortable Middle East that's going to emerge very easily um Israel will be on edge uh hisb represents a significant threat both in the context of what's happening now but also in the future Iran's nuclear pretentions represent a significant threat and so uh the analysts and policy makers ERS are going to be working overtime to try to figure this out I think it's premature to make big declarations about what the Middle East will be and and I'm wondering what this is going to do to the the thrust of US foreign policy the United States has been trying to to shift its focus from the Middle East um more towards a new security Focus being on Asia of course arising China does this conflict does it mean that that shifting policy is that over or is it going to be suspended well I think the us as well as others will have to reassess the bases of its uh policies and approach in this region um we certainly are not going to change with respect to our support for Israel and its security we're not going to change with respect to our support for other allies Egypt Jordan Saudi Arabia uh we're not going to change with respect to the importance of uh the security of oil and gas exports but uh how things shape out with respect to non-state actors I mean this has been a problem that all of us have been grappling with for a long time and no one really has a handle on it with States you can expect some kind of normal uh Behavior sometimes they go to war sometimes they don't non-state actors are not governed by any of these rules and as we saw this weekend not only has Hamas broken the the rules of international Behavior but has really declined into a a bloodthirsty uh horrible uh killing machine which uh is hard to grasp the level of um disinformation on social media um when it pertains to this conflict I mean it has reached unprecedented levels and a common theme that we're seeing is is an attempt to create a moral equivalence between Israeli actions and the atrocities committed by Hamas how do you see this look it's a particular problem worldwide I see it on the college campus I teach at Princeton University and uh we want to be sensitive to the feelings of uh American Jews and Israelis on campus who have been affected emotionally by what happened but we also need to be sensitive to the fact that we have Palestinian and Arab students who are now watching uh destruction of homes and and the killing of people in Gaza U and social media uh only exacerbates the problem uh you know I think you heard that um Israelis have advised parents to keep their children off of social media they don't want them to see some of the most horrific images that are out there but uh you're not going to get a lot of people off of social media and that means that the chance of disinformation uh uh really becomes much greater and only adds to the burden of trying to calm the situation down Ambassador cter we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us we appreciate your valuable insights tonight thank you my pleasure thanks I just spoke with Shalom lipner he is a fellow at the Atlantic Council he specializes in US Israeli relations I asked him how important Anthony blink's show of support for Israel is right now yeah it's hugely significant for Israel I mean you know is they're on the verge of a larger what appears to be a larger ground operation you know figuring out what the next steps look like large piece of that will be sort of the international legitimacy behind that that will be the wind in Israel sales as it you know gets that job done unprecedented statements of support coming from secretary blinkin from President Biden secretary defense Austin is on as we as Israel as well we know about the carrier group uh the Ford group you know the USG Ford gon Howard was on the way to the region as well I mean strong s you know show support from the United States um hugely important for Israel and for the region blinkin also today warned any enemies of Israel not to try and take advantage of this crisis why do you think he felt that he needed to issue that warning now that's right again I mean you know he's echoing sentiments we heard from President Biden as well and the president talked about the possibility of other other people getting into this fry and he you know he said emphatically don't um you know there there are real fears that this could expand to other to other uh theaters most particularly the Lebanese border opposite hisbah as we're looking forward to see if this you know becomes a wider regional conflict or it's something that stays sort of contained geographically to the Gaza area um you know the presence the statements from coming from Administration officials the presence of uh you know raw American fire power in the in the Mediterranean and other parts of the region sending that message to other people you know Israel is going to deal with Hamas situation is untenable the way that it is let's not make this a larger fight not good for anybody here America's you know willing to put fire power on the table to make sure that doesn't happen Mr Lim you have worked for seven Israeli Prime Ministers you know take taking your experience here what influence does the US have on Israel in conflicts such as the one that we're looking at right now well America's always been you know the sort of America's uh I'm sorry America's always been Israel's back stop in that respect you know it's always there it's been uh a real uh force of diplomatic support economic support Military Support um even moving forward you know when uh now we're seeing other other countries getting involved as well but when all of a sudden Israel needed reinforcements now the first country to step up after you know being asked was the United States sending in you know reinforcements shipments arriving um and you know and the fact that the United States will sort of stand guard on the security Council and other places to say that Israel's performing this task it has to because the current situation is untenable that will allow Israel space to continue that you know conceivably as long as that exists to be able to get that job done if that were to dry up it would you know conceivably bring other countries in to start to say you know maybe it's time to stop but as long as America standing at Israel side on this that we'll have an incredible you know the incredible force of keeping Israel Moving you know towards its Target Anthony blinkin plans to visit um Jordan tomorrow he plans to um talk with with other key figures in the Middle East I'm wondering how much influence can the United States have right now in the Middle East considering that basically for the past 10 years it's shifted its focus away from that region I mean it's been dealing with the rising China in the last year and a half it's been dealing with Ukraine and Russia I mean it's basically been a no-show for a lot of things um how much Authority does it have left well I think this moment you know sort of emphasizes the interconnectedness between all these theaters now I mean you're right you know certainly within the region you talk to people in the region and you hear repeatedly you know concerns that America sort of picked up and gone elsewhere um you know but we're seeing new levels of of American engagement in the region now as a result of this there's a lot of writing on the outcome of how this conflict comes out um you know there indicated there were disappointment in the gulf and other places too when when us allies found themselves under attack and sort of were wondering why the United States wasn't stepping up right now you know the White House and and other agencies are making it clear that they are here and that they mean business um that will be the message they they you know distribute in other capitals as well um and hoping you know to be able to to sort of reinvigorate that uh that pack between the US has had with with its long-term allies in the middle Shalom lipner senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Mr lner we appreciate your time and your analysis
