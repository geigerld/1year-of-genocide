and an Israeli air strike has hit a moss compound in Janine in the West Bank Israel's military said the building was being used by militants to organize attacks several people have been killed the Israeli air strike is the latest in recent days to hit the West Bank there has been an increase in violence in the area in the last two weeks let's get more from our correspondent Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem uh Rebecca tell us more about those overnight strikes in the West Bank well CLA we had confirmation from the Israeli military a little after 3:00 a.m. this morning that they had indeed carried out this air strike as you just mentioned they claimed that the the mosque in the refugee camp was being used to for as a compound for both Islamic Jihad and Hamas militants who they say were planning to carry out an imminent attack that they had intelligence of that and that's why they decided to strike uh they also said that these particular militants also carried out uh attacks in recent weeks uh and so they they needed to act that's uh according to the Israeli military now it's not the first time uh that Janine has been struck by the air in summer in the summer some people might remember there was a a quite a significant raid on the Janine Camp isra Israeli military uh going in to try and Route out militants as they say and try and take away some of the uh Hardware ammunition and and Destroy some of the other compounds that used by militants in the area now we we can't verify whether these attacks were going to be carried out obviously but we do know that Hamas in Gaza has been calling on militants all over the West B Bank to join in what they call their the resistance join into this war and and and pick up fighting from the other front in the West Bank that hasn't to this to this date hasn't has not opened up yet but that is certainly what Hamas uh operatives Hamas militants in Gaza are calling for Rebecca and you've been recently reporting from the West Bank let's take a look at one of your reports and then we will come back to you Friday prayers sound out in rala the West Bank's biggest city but the faithfuls prayers soon turned to protest against Israel's devastating strikes on this woman says her whole family is there shame for what is happening to them they slaughtered children and women we do not forgive the Arab countries because they let us down they did not stand by us they left us alone I hope someone will listen we don't need empty words we need someone that stands by us and more and more feel that Hamas is doing just that we are your soldiers Muhammad daif they chant praising hamas's military Wing Commander the West Bank is not governed by Hamas but by fut the party that controls the Palestinian Authority or PA it's widely seen as weak corrupt and ineffective and now more than ever the PA blames Israel and the West for its fragile legitimacy growing by the day don't forget last September Abu maazin stood before the general assembly he had made it clear that the International Community is failing the Palestinians that the Palestinian Authority has the responsibility and obligation to protect its people but Israel is making its actions not on void Israel is putting hurdles there are other hurdles for the PA in the two weeks since hamas's attack on Israel here in the West Bank at least 80 people have been killed in confrontations with Israeli forces and armed Jewish settlers on Thursday an Israeli raid an air strike on a refugee camp in the region killed 13 people including five children anger here is growing this group of protesters may be small but it's enough for the Israeli military to take strong action up on the hilltop you can see Israeli snipers they've been shooting Liv pounds of ammunition to these protesters who've been burning fires and throwing stones so far the paramedics say seven people have been shot including one of their own the West Bank is not a major focus of the Israeli military response for now but with the public losing even more faith in the Palestinian Authority and support for Hamas apparently growing there is a fear here that that could soon change Rebecca thank you so much for your reporting there did you get a sense in your reporting that the conflict in Gaza is indeed already spreading to the West Bank well when you speak to people in the West Bank they talk about their fear the biggest changes we've seen in the last couple of weeks in the West Bank is uh a significant deterioration of their ability to move around we've seen General strikes and we're seeing a rise in settler of violence and you know people saying that they're quite scared to leave their homes to go out I mean in cities like rala in the center it is controlled by the Palestinian Authority largely there uh not settlements in the center of the city so people have sort of more freedom of movement but moving in between cities in the West Bank has become increasingly hard checkpoints uh have been bolstered extra checkpoints have been put up so people talk about the the the dire situation to their just daily lives they're finding things a lot harder but also there is a huge amount of fear there as well people worried that that that the West Bank is is also going to be dragged into this conflict I said in the report that it so far hasn't really been a focal point for the Israeli military but that they have bolstered troops there they definitely are keeping an eye on that area and as we saw last night carrying out strikes we saw another one uh on Thursday uh in in another refugee camp further south than Janine so it is something that the Israeli military are concerned about and and residents as well I mentioned also the distrust of the PA I've been reporting in the West Bank for a while and when you speak to people uh for a long time they've been saying that the PA they haven't had elections they don't feel represented they don't feel supported and they don't feel secure they don't feel that the Palestinian Authority are offering them any kind of safety or any defense uh but that has just increased people used to not like to talk about those things publicly when now as you can see in that protest people openly supporting Hamas even in the center even in rala so we are seeing changes there and of course everyone watching very closely as to how that will evolve in the the West Bank indeed lots of concern internationally about Potential spillover from this conflict um this morning uh Syrian State media reporting Israeli air strikes uh there including on two airports what's the latest you can tell us about a conflict with Israel's neighbors it's really hard to verify information out of Syria as you can imagine but we are getting those reports that an airport was struck we're hearing reports of a couple of casualties as well though I won't say the figures because they could rise and I I don't have a way a way of verifying that information so uh you know Israel has not claimed responsibility for that attack but we know that they they do strike in Targets in Syria uh they do even before this war started they they target what they say is Munitions coming in from Iran and and operatives uh operating in Syria but they don't very often comment on it now of course the fear is the global fear the international fear as well is that that other countries particularly Lebanon and Syria will get dragged into this that Hezbollah the other terrorist organization operating in southern Lebanon uh that they they we've been seeing tit fortat uh skirmishes or or uh rocket fire I should say coming in from Hezbollah Fighters as well uh Israeli military retaliating Israeli military watching that area really really closely obviously that would be a huge escalation that nobody uh Israelis or or the international Community really nobody wants to see we're seeing uh support from the US B being bolstered in the Mediterranean to try and prevent that to try and deescalate the situation uh and it's unfortunately a bit of a wait and see as to just how involved we know that Hezbollah have threatened they said you know that that Israel will pay a deer price if they were to go in in this ground offensive this expected ground offensive in Gaza there no way of knowing whether or not that is what the Israeli military you know we we believe that this has been slightly delayed we're of course expecting it but uh it hasn't happened yet and perhaps that is part of the reasoning why it hasn't happened yet clear obviously a very tense situation particularly on the northern border the West Bank the other front that's being watched and of course the horrific scenes that we're we're seeing in Gaza Rebecca thank you so much for your reporting as Rebecca ritters for us in
