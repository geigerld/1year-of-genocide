far too many Palestinians have been killed far too many have suffered these past weeks the words of US Secretary of State Anthony blinken but who looks after those who are still alive in the middle of the Israel Hamas war zone my guest this week is Juliet tumor who speaks for anra the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees so far more than a hundred of their personnel have been killed in the Gaza conflict what we're seeing in Gaza right now now is unprecedented on a number of levels so how long can the agency go on functioning how long can ordinary people suffer the intense bombardment the acute shortages of basic Goods the lack of medical care how do the people of Gaza live today when they have no idea if they'll Die [Music] Tomorrow Juliet tumor welcome to conflict Zone good to have you thanks for having me Tim thanks for having me a week ago Israel's ambassador to the UN denied that there was any kind of humanitarian crisis in Gaza what would you say to him look way before this war in Gaza started on the 7th of October the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip has been very very dire I mean only at anra we were providing food assistance to 1.2 million people the levels of poverty were among the highest in the region so were the levels of unemployment and then Gaza let's not forget them was under blockade so access in and out of the Gaza Strip was very very difficult now where we are right now is a humanitarian situation was made far far worse due to a very tight Siege and a brutal War because of the bombardment and the strike that have been going on for five weeks now so a humanitarian situation was made far worse we are witnessing a humanitarian tragedy in Gaza made far worse every day this war goes on how much Faith Can you put in official statements either from Israel or from Hamas what I do know are facts on the ground what we do have at Andra is nearly 800,000 people who were forced to flee their homes they are now taking shelter in more than 150 anra facilities this is more than four times what we had planned for under a worst case scenario the situation in these shelters is absolutely absolutely terrible because they are overcrowded and also because anra does not have the supplies or the fuel uh to reach people in need need so their situation is terrible and they are under bombardment and Gaza the Hall of Gaza has been under siege for five weeks now we do not have the ability to respond to this volume this huge volume of humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip also because we are not getting the supplies that we need and we're not getting the fuel well I want to come on to that a little later but can you believe the casualty figures coming from the Hamas run Authority in Gaza the figure I'm I'm thinking of is over 11,000 people dead in the war so far can you believe these figures I tell you what when we look at the casualty figures among our teams among the Andra teams we can confirm that 102 colleagues of ours have been killed in in this war this is the highest number of un Aid workers ever killed anywhere in the world since the establishment of the United Nations and when we apply the proportionality of this 102 to the 13,000 colleagues that work with us and when we look at the data coming from the Gaza Ministry of Health and apply a similar ratio the numbers do tally now yesterday we had globally around the world the United Nations entities around the world we lowered the flag to half mast in recognition to the service of these colleagues that were killed the only place we kept the UN flag flying high was Gaza and it was a symbolic gesture on Andra side to show commitment to the people that we serve especially those 800,000 people who came to our shelters to seek protection and safety under the very same flag the Personnel working for anra who were killed they must have known the dangers that face them the risks they were running what kind of people will put their lives on the line like that for other people you see Andra has 13,000 uh employees working with us on the ground in the Gaza Strip until the war started we were present across the gala strip North Middle area Southern areas and these were mainly teachers um the vast majority of our teams on the ground are teachers who teach in unra schools which we sadly had to close this deprived more than 300,000 boys and girls in Gala from education for the past five weeks and we had to turn many of our schools into shelters to to take in people who sought protection and safety under the UN flag these were people who were the the the colleagues skilled I mean they were mainly teachers School principles doctors nurses Engineers support staff which is the backbone uh of of our operation many some killed with their families weren't they most of them were killed you're absolutely right Tim most of them were killed with their families um we have horrific stories one colleague of our Samir was killed in his own home with his wife and eight children another colleague of our Serene who was a gynecologist she was killed with her daughter while she was at at home onethird of our colleagues who were killed were not killed in the north onethird of our colleagues who were killed were in fact killed in the middle areas and in the southern areas where it's supposed to be safe where the Israelis said they weren't going to bomb because nowhere is safe te in Gaza nowhere not the north not Gaza City not the middle areas and not the South and in fact when we look at the data more than 60 un facilities under facilities specifically the vast majority of which are shelters where people are Sheltering 60 of those facilities have been hit more than 10 of those have been directly hit and 70% of the facilities that were impacted during this war in Gaza the unra facility 70% were in the middle areas and in the southern areas 70% do you reach a stage where you simply have to pull out because the danger to your staff is so great I asked because one of your colleagues said the other day every day you think it is the worst day and then the next day comes and it's even worse is that your experience they're absolutely right they're absolutely right it's not every day it's not only every day I think every hour the situation gets worse and worse the fluidity of of this war is astonishing things continue to change things continue to move and a very very fast pace people continue to leave their homes there is forc displacement happening in Gaza there is collective punishment happening in Gaza Andra is committed to stay in Gaza and to deliver to the people who need us most and we will continue to do this but we need many things for us to to do this we need supplies coming into Gaza on a regular basis we need to expand the number of trucks that are coming into Gaza we need to expand that humanitarian operation both in terms of the volume volume and the frequency and the predictability of that humanitarian operation we also need fuel it's really really critical that Andra gets fuel for humanitarian purposes we have not received fuel for the past five weeks we have been pleading to get shipments of fuel and to date we have not received any fuel and fuel we need for the fleet of the cars for us to be able to go pick up the supplies that are coming from the borders for us to give to medical facilities our own included for the water pumps to work in our shelters we need fuel and we have not received any fuel Gaza has not received a liter of fuel since the War Began on the 7th of October for obvious reasons there's a particular focus on the plight of hospitals in Gaza the Red Cross said they'd reached what they called the point of no return and that the lives of thousands of people were at risk this is a a daily even hourly emergency isn't it oh absolutely to get what what what medicine you can what little medicine is left to get what little fuel there is to get what little drinking water there is um how long can this go on for before before people get ill from malnutrition before there's illnesses associated with lack of Sanitation uh how long before before that happens look civilian facilities including hospitals but also un facilities have not been spared and these facilities civilian facilities schools hospitals clinics shelters un premises and compounds they are all protected under International humanitarian law and they have not been so rules of the war they have been broken in the Gaza stet the Israelis say that the reason reason they are surrounding alifa Hospital which I think is the largest hospital in in Gaza at the moment is because they're sure that there's a command and control center belonging to Hamas underneath the hospital itself do you know anything about that I tell you what we do know shifa hospital is the largest medical facility and the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip and one of the oldest Palestinian Health institutions it has been established in 1946 and in addition to it being this medical facility a very important and critical medical facility since the War Began shifa hospital has been hosting tens of thousands according to reports that we get tens of thousands of people in its Courtyards and in in its parking lot so it's also being used as a shelter now we at onra have been able to access shifa Hospital only once and deliver medical supplies basic medical supplies and Medicine throughout the war we were allowed only once to do this very urgent humanitarian delivery that we did with the World Health Organization and this shows you the immense challenges that we are facing in terms of access not only from outside of Gaza to bring in supplies but also within Gaza to move from the south into to the north where there is Gaza City where it has been the Beating Heart of the Gaza Strip for many many decades but there has been some evidence in the past that Hamas did hide weapons and tunnels under hospitals hasn't there last year your agency said it had identified what it called a man-made cavity underneath the grounds of a school in Gaza it protested to the Hamas authorities and you sealed the cavity permanently how did Hamas respond to your Discovery so what Andra do every quarter Tim is that we have inspection teams that go to all our facilities in the G STP and everywhere in the region where un operates and we do this inspection against um the humanitarian principle and for neutrality and in fact the last inspection we have done was just before the war on the 30th of September we do this every quarter 30th of September we have completed the inspection of all our facilities in the Gaza stet November 13th the Israeli Army showed pictures of guns suicide vests grenades explosives in what they said was the basement of rantisi Children's Hospital does that surprise you then given what you've just told me about the inspections you you uh conducted I saw these um reports Tim and un is not at all in a position to confirm or deny these reports R hospital is not an unwa facility and let me emphasize that civilian infrastructure wherever they are in the world not only in the Gaza Strip civilian infrastructure must never be used for military purposes are you satisfied it isn't being used in Gaza I really do not know that uh Tim I really do not know that you've been in other War zones you've been in Iraq you've been in Yemen what stands out about this one from your the experiences you've had to date well I spent most of my humanitarian service working on one of the most brutal Wars in recent history and that is the war in Syria where I worked in and out of Syria on the Syria War for more than a decade and I thought that I have seen the worst during that war because I started working on the war in Syria in 2012 When The War had just started and I saw Horrors and I was I witnessed terrible things happening including to children because I was working for Unicef back back then and I worked in different roles uh with other entities in the UN so I I'm very familiar with the war in Syria and I was very familiar with what wars do to lives of human beings well let me ask you about that because because in your experience what happens to people who go through this kind of trauma what what can we expect to happen to the people of Gaza do they ever recover what we're seeing in Gaza right now is unprecedented on a number of levels The Siege is unprecedented the level of damage to the civilian infrastructure including ton facilities is unprecedented the number of casualties is very very high the number of colleagues that were killed who work for anra is very very high in fact it's the highest ever since the UN started working towards the mid 1940s the challenges that we are facing as the largest humanitarian providers in the Gaza Strip are unprecedented it's unprecedented on all levels the shock and the trauma that this is causing to people including our own colleagues is huge these are scars that are going to be very very hard to heal and there are many many people in the Gaza Strip who are either reliving the trauma of 1948 or they are now living the traumas of their ancestors and their father fathers and their mothers due to this forced displacement and the resemblance of The Exodus of what's happening right now to the nakba in 1948 also known as the catastrophe winter is here do you have any idea what will happen to the hundreds of thousands of people who are now homeless and and in the in the longer term are there any models that could suggest how long people might have to deal with this homelessness with these shortages with all the problems that affect their daily life winter rain and the cold is going to make a tragic situation for people in Gaza far far worse because what we have had until recently is in our shelters is women and girls sleeping inside classrooms and men and boys sleeping outside in the open so with winter it's going to get worse and we are of course worried about the diseases the spread of diseases the lack of heat the flooding uh with the Civil Service breaking down how is this going to be managed it's going to be even bigger over a chaos than we have right now so this is why it's absolutely critical that there is a humanitarian ceasefire which we've been calling for for weeks on end now sadly it's falling on deaf ears it has to happen for the sake of civilians wherever they are including those in Gaza you've just got back recently from an Arab Summit in the Saudi Capital Riad report suggested there was plenty of anger and invective but I suppose anger is cheap who amongst the Arab leaders promised any concrete help at all for the Palestinians in Gaza so for us at Andre it was a historic moment because it was the first time in the history of the agency and we're almost 75 years old that we are invited at the level of our commissioner General to brief and to address the heads of States both of the Arab world and the Muslim world so for us it was important that we relay the message on behalf of the 2 million Palestinians who are trapped in this war so that was one thing that we wanted to relay and in terms of the reception we got funding for our operations from Oman and from the hashimite kingdom of Jordan and we got pledges from the UAE we are still not certain them if we are as an agency going to be able to pay salaries for the staff not this month November or not December including those unsigned Heroes that are working with the agency on the front lines in the Gaza Strip the head of your agency said the other day there was a feeling among gazans that they had been sacrificed and abandoned by the outside world how widespread is that feeling among the people that you've met and you've talked to very widespread very widespread it's among our staff and it's also among the friends that we have in Gaza and there is feeling of Abandonment and there's a feeling of um not feeling equal that the the suffering and the the Carnage that is happening in Gaza is not important um and that is changing which is very very good I think more and more and more people around the world are understanding that civilians are going through hell in Gaza and that they are going through a collective punishment that so many people have been killed including according to reports more than 4,000 children which is according to save the children the highest number of children killed in any conflict since 2019 these children have nothing to do with this conflict or with this war and no child should have witnessed what the children of Gaza have witnessed have Palestinians that that you've met talk to you about the atrocities that Hamas committed against Israel yes they have what do they say what do they say about that yes they have and Andra and the Secretary General of the United Nations have condemned in the strongest terms the massacre that happened in Israel on the 7th of October Juliet tumor what will you take away from all this how do you how do you process what you've seen how hard is that for you personally for me it's um determination to continue to be the voice of the Palestinian people in Gaza the civilians who are caught up in this war and also to continue to work with our colleagues with our teams on the ground who are by the way and it's not a gimmick that that I am using they are a rare ray of light coming out of the darkness of what Gaza has become it's my duty to continue to support them so that they continue to be able to deliver to people who need them most so that we continue as the largest UN agency to support and deliver the people that we are committed to deliver to and these are the Palestinian communities in Gaza and elsewhere in this region the head of your agency says that since October the 7th Gaza has gone from open air prison to graveyard if he's right what kind of Gaza do you think will be left okay it is hard to answer this question while you have an active conflict going what we do know from destruction from footage that we've seen of Destruction including around our own office which was in Gaza City since we started working more than 70 years ago by the way is the place looks like it's just been hit by an earthquake except we have to remind ourselves that this is all man-made and it's going to take probably years and years to rebuild but the concern right now is not for the brick and stone the huge concern right now is for the people and what they are going through and the mass displacement and the ongoing Exodus and the force displacement and the collective punishment that's really the biggest biggest concern that the agency I work with has your director said a new generation of agreed Palestinians are likely to come out of the bombing of Gaza and are likely to continue the cycle of violence do you share that view what I do know from other conflicts is that violence breeds more violence and violence will never never ever get us anywhere good and what we do know is the more violence continues the more the war continues the farther we are from peace and stability in this region this is exactly why we call for a humanitarian ceasefire and why do you think it's falling on De ears that's not a question to meet him it's not a question to me you know the region you talk to the players I don't know all I know is that the longer this goes on the more we're losing on our Humanity it's for the sake of humanity it's a point of make or break for each and every one of us about our Humanity do we regain it or do we just let it slip Julia thanks very much for being on Zone thank you Tim appreciate your time thank [Applause] you
