Israel's Army has given the green light to plans for a possible offensive into Southern Lebanon ratcheting up tensions between Israel and the pro-iranian Hezbollah militia the Israeli foreign minister threatened to destroy Hezbollah if it comes to an allout War his statement came after hollah hinted it could attack the northern Israeli Port City of hia has released drone images which it said showed areas around the city the Israeli Army released this footage which they say shows air strikes against several Hezbollah Targets in southern Lebanon clashes between the Israeli Army and Hezbollah have been nearly daily since the start of the war in Gaza in October for more on this Let's cross over to our correspondent in Jerusalem Rebecca ritters Rebecca launching a crossb offensive in Lebanon sounds like a drastic move given current conditions how likely is it that Israel will go ahead with this well just How likely is almost impossible to say with complete certainty Terry but the probability is rising every day as we see the rhetoric and threats from both sides also rising and now we're seeing this uh plan by the IDF saying that it has been greenlit uh now that follows visits by both prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and defense minister yov Galant who have toured the North in recent weeks and both have said uh to the to the IDF soldiers up there to be prepared uh that they you know are certainly preparing and willing to launch a a a greater full a fullon conflict with Lebanon with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon should they deem it necessary and as you mentioned there in your lead in these images purportedly uh showing a Hezbollah drone that has come in and captured several sites in Northern Lebanon that they potentially then would threaten to attack and that drone then returning uh if it is indeed true to Southern Lebanon and then then being able to release the footage is is certainly a threat from that side and now we're seeing you know greater ramping up of rhetoric from the Israeli side as well now there has been a border dispute between Israel and Lebanon for many years and Amos Hawkin the US Envoy has been trying to broker a deal between the two sides for for some time uh now we are seeing that those as we see this threat since October 7th these near daily skirmishes uh escalate um it's certainly looking like a fullblown conflict could be very possible certainly I was up in the northern part of Israel recently speaking to Residents many of whom some 70,000 have been evacuated from that northern border region and they said that they wouldn't return home or some of the ones that I spoke to said that they would wouldn't return home unless there was an allout conflict with hezb to push it back further away from the border that they simply wouldn't feel safe even if there was a political solution now tensions in the region are extremely high many are worried about uh congration consuming the Middle East what could help deescalate tensions between Israel and Lebanon at this point well there have been Diplomat diplomatic efforts ongoing certainly uh since the early days of October when things kicked off on the 8th of October with Hezbollah respond ing to uh the the the war in Gaza and saying that they were going to do what they could to tie up Israeli sources resources rather in the north uh so we've been seeing diplomatic efforts to try to stop this spreading into a wider conflict you know with the us bringing warships into the Mediterranean to try to to prevent anything from sparking spilling over uh but those diplomatic efforts haven't reached any final conclusion uh the the US Envoy that I mentioned before Amos Hawk he was recently just this week in Israel talking with leaders here trying to figure out ways that there could be some kind of political solution he says a political soltion solution is definitely possible uh he's now in Lebanon he's been speaking there with leaders uh from the Lebanese government trying to work out how best they could come to this political solution but so far we haven't seen any fruits of that Labor uh that have been successful we certainly haven't seen uh a downplaying or a calming down of tensions in that region in fact quite the opposite so the received wisdom of people you speak to here is it's not a matter of if but a matter of when Terry Rebecca thank you very much DW's correspondent in Jerusalem Rebecca ritters
