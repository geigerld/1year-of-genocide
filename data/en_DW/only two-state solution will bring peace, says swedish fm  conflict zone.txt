in response to the militant Palestinian group hamas's attack on Israel Sweden and the EU while reviewing their non-humanitarian aid to Palestinians while accusations are flying about a so-called double standard in the West's actions in the Middle East and Ukraine we shouldn't have any double standards we should apply the same standards when it comes to atrocities committee my guest this week on conflict zone is Swedish foreign minister Tobias bilstrom he joins me from Stockholm as the bombardment of Gaza intensifies How concerned is he that the conflict could spread in the region and with the risk of attention being diverted how can he continue to shore up support for the war in [Music] Ukraine foreign minister billstrom welcome to conflict Zone thank you very much there are fears that the Israel Hamas War could widen into a broader Middle East conflict as Israel steps up its bombardment of Gaza and clashes at Israel's northern border with Lebanon intensif how are you looking at the current situation well it is indeed a very very horrible situation which is now uh evolving before our eyes and I think that we have to look at this from both a shortterm and a long-term perspective the short-term perspective is of course that we need to bring more humanitarian assistance to Gaza we need to acknowledge that Reser has the right to defend itself against the atrocities and the terrorist attacks by the teror organ organization Hamas and Islamic yihad but we also have to look to the suffering of the people in Gaza and to find a way to bring humanitarian assistance in the shape of water um supplies food and also fuel for the the salination um plants inside of Gaza to to get fresh water to to the people in there is important and the other hand we also have to look at the very important issue of releasing the hostages taken by by Hamas and in this I can see many actors playing an important role the European Union the United States the UN of course but also the Arab states who I think are acting acting in a very constructive way I have done a reach out to colleagues in in this regard and that's my feeling the EU has increased its humanitarian Aid to the Palestinians but at the same time you will be reviewing your non-humanitarian Aid what does that mean are are you just now checking if you indirectly gave money to Hamas which the EU as you've mentioned there classifies as a terrorist organization I think that under the circumstances it is prudent to see to it that no money which is allocated to the Palestinian Authority Finds Its way into the pockets of organizations like Hamas or Islamic yihad but in the long term this is also connected to the question of the peace process we need to see to if the Palestinian Authority can functions and that it is a credible organization because if we are going for a two-state solution and this has to be the long-term perspective to establish peace in the region uh two states israels and Palestinians being able to leave side by side are you thinking about whether you will in fact reduce non-humanitarian aid for example on the EU level because I mean the EU is the biggest single donor of Aid to Palestinians well from an EU perspective uh I don't see that happening I think that it is important and I I think that there's a clear majority also in the council in favor of this uh I also we have to understand that you know undermining The credibility of the Palestinian Authority would be a dangerous thing that could actually help Hamas and Islamic Jihad to gain supporters in in the in the pal in Palestine in in both the West Bank and Gaza and that would be uh that would be a really dangerous when we look at the overall EU approach so far um what we have seen is disunity and confusion on display first there was a statement that the EU said it suspended its Aid to Palestinians in response to the attack on Israel by Hamas that statement was reversed soon thereafter isn't it a bit embarrassing in the middle of a crisis like this I think that we have to separate the issues it is quite clear that that statement was premature but that was done by an individual commissioner not by the commission itself and when it comes to the member states well it is the member states who are calling the shorts in on this and it is the member states also ultimately who decides this and I have to say that I've just come back from yesterday's meeting in Luxembourg with the feeling that yes there are debates and discussions quite naturally in a heated moment like this but the EU has to maintain and Achieve Unity now we have an upcoming meeting with the leaders the European Council now Wednesday and that I think will bring some more clarity to this but you know what it does speak to Mr foreign minister is is how the EU expects to find consensus on the future of aid for Palestinians and just the general approach to the situation um I'd like to ask you about one aspect of that how about for example calling for a ceasefire so that that crucial Aid that you mentioned the humanitarian Aid may be let into Gaza for those civilians the UN is calling for it EU foreign ministers couldn't agree at a meeting earlier this week where do you stand well we stand on the side of a high representative yoseph Bell who has spoken about a humanitarian puse I think that this is the way forward we have to understand again that this is a very complex situation no easy easy solutions to this no quick fixes but a humanitarian puse will be a would enable us to bring the aid into to gasa to the suffering people in forms of food and water and and medicine and also Fuel and I think this is important you spoke a little bit earlier about uh diplomacy and the prospect of a two-state solution um you know Sweden in general back in 2014 was the first EU member in Western Europe to officially recognize a state of Palestine saying and I'm quoting here um we hope this will show the way for others you've been supporting Palestinians toward a two-state solution is there any hope of that anymore realistically yeah well the two-state solution has to be achieved because it is the only way the only feasible way of bringing peace to this region to the people who are suffering to both Israelis and to Pal Palestinians and there are credible Solutions on the table and have been for many many years now but but what it boils down to is that you have to achieve trust and you have to achieve confidence enough among leaders and one thing though that I take a bit of Hope in and I I think one has to understand of course that during a moment like this when the bombs are falling it doesn't perhaps seem see perhaps you don't feel like this but actually after every big crisis of the last 20 years there has been a restart of a peace process and a way forward and I think we have to understand that this could be the outcome of this terrible situation which we're are facing right now and frankly the Swedish government don't really see an alternative to the two-state solution so we're going to work in favor of this with partners both in the Middle East with the United States with the UN and within the EU of which we are a part let's turn now uh to the impact inside the eu's borders um we are seeing heightened security concerns here in Europe over the situation in the Middle East uh the EU foreign policy Chief Joseph borell said last week uh that when he hears and I'm quoting here religious authorities speaking the language of interreligious conflict and explicitly stating that Europe is a party to the conflict he feels the storm clouds are looming he says he believes we are on the edge of the Abyss do you agree with him I think that he's on to something very important that we have to find a balanced way forward we have to acknowledge the indispensable right of Israel to defend itself against terrorist attacks Frankly Speaking which government wouldn't do that when you are faced with the slaughtering of your own citizens in in thousands as as has been the case on the 7th of of October atrocities so European countries there increasing their security measures including border checks as a result um of the conflict and a series of violent attacks here including two Swedish Nationals killed in Brussels last week by a gunman claiming allegiance to the so-called Islamic State presumably in response to a number of recent Quan burnings in Sweden this past year tell us a little bit more about the security situation and how it's affecting Sweden particular well the terrorist deed was of course terrible uh and and we we are you know we're all in shock together with the people the near and the dear who suffer the loss of of the lives of of the family members we also have to look of course to the security situation you mention it and and I think we have to do with this on many levels the Swedish Security Police already during the uh the summer raised the level of terrorist threat from three to a four on a five scale and uh we actually uh were afraid that something like this which happened in in Belgium could happen but that mustn't deter us from continuing along the same path that we have already started to throt and that is to clamp down on terrorism and we have to do this with the help of the police but we also have to do it with the dialogue with people so that we can push back the terrorist threats and and the levels which we see are rising now in our society but can you tell us a little bit more about how you're clamping down um on the incidents that have caused so much anger because you know many in the Muslim world are Furious about these public Quran burnings that have taken place in your country and i' just like to bring in the example in June because um there we understand that two men were watched by a crowd of people they tore Pages out of the Quran they burned them outside of a mosque um and they were granted a permit for demonstration that's how things work in your country they didn't hide their intent to burn the book and yet the New York Times reported this um that the demonstrations were not allowed to burn objects in Stockholm so how is it that these demonstrators were able to ultimately burn the book the reason is that the Swedish legislation is constructed in a way that we give permits for demonstrations but as you said quite rightly they do not have a permit to burn the book to burn hly scripture the Quran or any any other book what the Swedish government is now doing is that we have launched an inquiry into the public order act which governs the police police authorities um responsibility to Grant permits and that inquiry means that it all it would also lead to uh an opportunity to look into to the possibility of bringing National Security when you grant a naal when you grant a permit something which you cannot do today and this is a tool which the government wants to know more about and and Mr foreign minister your neighbor Denmark for example they're taking moves to actually outrightly ban Quran burnings following outrage over burnings there as well is it time for Sweden to think about doing the same the problem is that Denmark and Sweden have different legislations if we were to do the thing which we are doing in Denmark that would be a constitutional issue it has to lead to constitutional changes in Sweden while if Denmark were to do what we are planning to do changing the public order act that would lead to constitutional changes in their legislation because they don't operate permits Russia has meantime been spreading narratives especially in the developing World saying saying that Sweden is hostile toward Islam uh for example the Kremlin controlled Outlets created a rumor that Swedish Social Services were systematically kidnapping and trying to christianize children from Muslim families that campaign is said to have reached hundreds of millions of followers on social media how widespread is disinformation like this how big is the problem for you it is a big problem and we can see that states both Russia State and State actors Russia and Iran is also another country which has furthered this this campaign and promoted it in in social media channels and it is a very very um aggressive campaign and it aims both towards Muslims in in other countries and Muslims in my own countries uh in my own country we are now combating this uh we have brought together the responsible authorities in Sweden all the way down to municipality level and all the way up to National authorities in order to hammer out a counter campaign to this and we are well on this from the government side to do so we're also going to do it together with partners and we have to understand that this is the new information Warfare um operational Arena which we are living through this is the way things are going to be conducted that you find things small grains of Truth and then you blow them up it's an old Russian trick but you have to work against it let's turn now to the war in Ukraine how worried are you that attention and weapons will be diverted elsewhere given the conflict in the Middle East uh for example we've seen the US uh saying last week that tens of thousands of artillery shells promised to Ukraine are now going to be diverted to Israel a sign of more to come you know I'm quite confident in the words of President Biden when he was interviewed we other day and said you know we are the United States of course we are capable of handling two conflicts at the same time and I'm quite confident that that that this would be the case and also the conflict in Israel is not the conflict in Ukraine it is not only in a much much smaller scale it is also different in in its entire makeup the war in Ukraine it's a large scale War uh something you know we haven't seen in Europe since the second world war so we have to look at it from that point of view but as I said we're quite confident in in the words of President Biden but where do you get that confidence um Mr foreign minister because I mean it's it's quite clear that uh the US president doesn't always have his Congress behind him we've also been seeing divisions in the EU over Russia um they have been taken to the next level in fact after hungary's orbon met with Putin we've also seen the election of Robert FICO in Slovakia who ran on an anti- Ukraine platform basically showing how quickly the tide can turn especially considering that Slovakia was the first country to deliver fighter jets to Ukraine aren't you concerned about EU unity and support for Ukraine I mean this is seems like a clear sign of of waning European support President Biden is clearly cont cont lating a package to be B Congress consisting of Aid to both Ukraine Israel and Taiwan in in the same combination I think that's needs to be brought into to to the scope to understand the political realities and I again we feel confident about this looking then to the EU well uh during the the recent Swedish EU presidency during the Spring um we were able to bring forward two new s sanction packages against Russia and I think that we are able to maintain unity and move forward and I'm I'm not worried about this but we have to constantly contemplate it and not taking it for granted that's that needs to be said and we above all we have to give acknowledge acknowledgement to the huge effort by the American people I've said this publicly and I'll say it again the fact that the US has provided so much Military Support to Ukraine is the reason why Ukraine is still standing as a state the EU has done a lot when it comes to financial support to Ukraine budgetary support but we need to do more when it comes to Military Support and acknowledge what the US people are doing for Ukraine experts say that one of the few weapon systems that could change the course of the war's fighter jets Sweden says that it will only provide its grip in war planes to Ukraine if it gets NATO accession is there no chance of you providing these war planes beforehand well I was present at the press conference at hon the the prime minister's summer resident when President sadinski visited us earlier this this Autumn and what the Prime Minister said then it still stands namely that we have to see to it that our NATO accession process is finalized but we are already now training Ukrainian fighter yet Pilots how quickly could you get Ukraine the planes if you are indeed admitted to Nato well I'm not going to talk about that because that is of course military Secrets but what I could say clearly is that once we have become NATO members things will be be in a different light but we have to look to our own Security First that is that is of course imminent and imperative another security threat recent attacks on underseas infrastructure this time a Communication cable between Sweden and Estonia in the Baltic Sea a gas pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia also damaged your prime minister has warned that these undersea data cables are both essential to the modern economy and vulnerable to attack how vulnerable are you well it's not just us actually we have to look at this again from an EU and from a NATO perspective I mean we have a we have a neighboring country Norway who has gas fields and oil fields where you can see where the underwater cables are essential economy and I think that we have to understand that this is also a new type of of time which we are living in and the attitude of my government is that we need more cooperation with our neighbors more cooperation with our our NATO allies in order to to count this and and that c of course both more um how should say capabilities when it comes to surveying situations underwater and luckily Sweden has good capabilities already but we also would like to see more cooperation on this because this is not something which is going away we can see that this will be a could be a very dangerous tool tools for for adversaries to use against countries like Sweden Estonia and Finland in this case and finland's foreign minister said the two underseas links have probably been damaged on purpose do you agree is it likely sabotage who's behind it Russia uh well again I need to say that I'm not going to attribute this to any country right now there is a police investigation under way when that is finalized and the prosecutor has said what they they need to say I might be able to to do a public statement on this but before that I'm not going to do it I think that would be wrong with me as a minister to do so let's talk about your membership in NATO uh which uh has long been blocked by turkey Turkish president r t Tye erdogan has just submitted a bill approving your membership bid to his Parliament for ratification in general though how how disappointed are you in the process and the demands that turkey has been placing on you uh I've said it many times before and I'll say it again that the memorandum signed in Madrid at the The Summit in Madrid last year was important because it meant that Sweden undertook certain responsibilities for changes that were legit legitimate on behalf of of turke and those changes have been conducted that means that we now combat the organization pkk's activities in my country in a more coherent way taking measures which had led to people being handed verdicts in our Courts for an example A man was handed a verdict just two weeks ago a 4 and a half year sentence for armed robbery with a Clear Connection of get getting money to send to the pkk now the pkk doesn't conduct terrorist operations as such on on directed against Sweden on a territory but they collect money which were used to terrorist activities against Tura so turkey have had legitimate claims but The Summit in vus this summer meant that turkey acknowledged that Sweden had fulfilled our part of the bargain and that means also that the pro the start of the ratification process now under way in the Parliament is a is a firm sign of this um but you know I mean there was the recent comment though however from from the Turkish vice president saying that we we don't see a satisfactory level of implementation um when we talk about those measures that you have taken um we have also seen um erdogan uh you know make a request from from the United States um including the US selling F-16 fighter jets to turkey as a precondition to your accession you know you've already taken all these measures that you've highlighted there when is it just too much for Sweden what are your red lines well first of all this is a fundamental change of Swedish foreign and security policy the largest one in 200 years we have been a non-military aligned country for for two centuries so of course a question of a few months doesn't mean very much in that perspective and we are not disappointed at all on the contrary yesterday's news were of course source of joy but we aren't through yet we need to see the full ratification process happening in Tura and then of course also in Hungary and yeah let's talk more about Hungary because they must also sign up um there the foreign minister has written you a very pointed uh letter um asking you to um stop your politicians and press from criticizing hungary's democracy otherwise it won't ratify your accession the hungarians even uploaded that letter to Twitter uh and of course they know that you can't control uh what opposition politicians or press might be saying because of freedom of speech laws so what do you think is at play here the Hungarian government just looking for excuses to feel insulted and how concerning is this I think that the Turkish govern sorry the Hungarian Parliament has been very clear on the matter saying that we won't be the last the last to ratify Sweden that has been repeated both by prime minister Victor Orban and also by my foreign minister calling and that means that uh Hungary has already committed itself once the process in in Turkey is underway as it is now we expect ratification to start in the Hungarian Parliament as well and they only have the final vote left they've already done the committee work in the Parliament and also just on on that on that same line there is a difference also between Tura and Hungary with Tura we have had a memorandum clear memorandum clear State clear Stakes uh with Hungary never asked for anything like that when they accepted that Sweden were given the stat as the invite at last year Summit in in Madrid so I think that the Hungarian Parliament should move on with the ratification and that is the clear position of the Swedish government some especially in the global South are looking at the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East as an approach that is laced with double standards one analyst um saying there's a perception that the West cares more about Ukrainian refugees about Ukrainian civilian suffering than suffering in Yemen in Gaza in Sudan and Syria um the former Swedish prime minister Carl Bild has said the following this is something that we must deal with first of all do you even recognize that there could be a double standard at play and how do you deal with it well we have been very clear from our PA on our path um especially in my statement which I delivered at the United Nations General Assembly where I said very clearly that we need to take into account that the Ukrainian conflict is something which you know is of importance to all the world because it means that if Ukraine were to lose the rules based World Order and the UN Charter would be gone and those are principles which means a lot to our Global Partners wherever they are in the world and this is a good platform to stand on but I do acknowledge what you say we have to to take we shouldn't have any double standards we should apply the same standards when it comes to atro is committed and we should also mean that means that the humanitarian problems which we now see in gasa needs to be solved in order for this to be um you know a credible policy operated by the EU some diplomats are warning that the West is losing the global South what is the danger here if this situation is is not handled well by the EU if the South does not perceive that the West is handling the situation well and equitably well that could be a definitely could be a threat but I think that we are doing the right thing right now with both seeking a reach out to the Arab world in looking for Solutions both to the hostage crisis in relation to the terrorist organization Hamas and also the question of humanitarian P when it comes to Gaza and ultimately the two-state solution which needs to be brought forward only by operating on all these levels at the same time can we maintain credibility uh on the global level foreign minister bstrm we have to leave it there thank you so much for joining us on conflict Zone thank you for your time thank you very [Applause] much
