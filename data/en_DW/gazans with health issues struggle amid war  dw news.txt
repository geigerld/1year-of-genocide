We Begin the day at the largest hospital in Gaza a hospital Israel claims is also being used by Hamas as a war room in the first weeks after Israel declared war against Hamas the alifa hospital became a shelter for more than 60,000 displaced people many of those people have reportedly moved on in the last two weeks the Israeli military has repeatedly pointed to alifa hospital claiming that Hamas leaders are operating a command center underground directly below the hospital complex on Thursday a strike hit inside the hospital grounds the source of the blast is a known Hamas said it was an Israeli air strike the IDF has not commented our first report tonight contains images that some viewers may find disturbing displaced Gins were sleeping here near Al Sher hospital when it came under attack now the area outside the hospital looks small like a graveyard the hospital complex where thousands I believe to have been staying came under bombardment before the attack Israel said that his forces had been operating near the hospital our forces in Gaza have reached the heart of Gaza City they're at the outskirts of shatti they're near alifa hospital and very near to the gasa Port those terrorists who were in the basement's underneath alifa hospital tonight can hear the Thundering sound of tank chains the bulldozers that pound the ground they can hear it underground the Israeli military said it had started using new methods to Target Hamas militants in underground tunnels but since some of these tunnels are under Gaza hospitals many civilians have run out of options to hide from the attacks we were on the fifth floor because we were wounded so we were staying there and then we found bombs falling on us the daughter of my husband's brother was mared she was already wounded from before and she was mared the World Health Organization said that several hospitals across Gaza have been targeted it added that an increasing number of hospitals are no longer functioning the information I have at the moment is that there are only uh we now only have we we got 20 hospitals out of action we also know that there was significant bombardment of rantisi Hospital which is the only Hospital providing Pediatric Services in North Gaza and in that hospital were a number of children who were on life support and children receiving dialysis as Fierce fighting continues with more and more Health Facilities attacked for civilians in Northern Gaza neither stain nor living seems to be a safe option I'm joined Now by journalist Sami soal he is following things for us from Jerusalem Sammy let me ask you about the explosion the the strike at the alifa hospital Hamas says that it was an Israeli air strike has the IDF commented yeah well we did not hear any kind of denial uh from the IDF regarding what happened there and in fact they're confirming that there is IDF activity around the hospital of shifa and around the complex of the uh hospitals which are further bit a bit north uh we're talking about the the Children's Hospital ontis the ner Hospital there's no no denial and in fact there's also confirmation that they've been calling on the staff in these uh hospitals to leave and they've been calling all these hospitals to evacuate to the South the prime minister of Israel Netanyahu has now elaborated on a plan for Gaza after this war what do we know about that yeah well it's it's not a very detailed plan but definitely uh it is he stating that Israel will have the security control over the Gaza Strip that uh not only will it not be in the hands of of Hamas but it will not be in the hands of any other International uh force and there have been suggestions that that maybe there would be an Arab force that would come there well Natan is saying no there has to be Israeli presence in the Gaza Strip I mean he said that Israel doesn't have intentions uh to to occupy it in the long term that means there might be some ministers in this government that are thinking in terms of of building settlements in the Gaza Strip well this is not the position of the Prime Minister and he's saying that uh we're just talking about a kind of a security uh control and on top of it there will be a buffer zone uh which will be a tightly controlled by the Israeli military uh along the border with Gaza the security buffer Z meaning inside the Gaza Strip Samy we know that the the conflict the fighting is not limited to Gaza there have been air strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon there have been raids in the West Bank does the government of Israel does it have the Public's confidence as it fights what looks like multiple fronts here yeah so uh I I would say that in terms of West Bank and and Lebanon we're talking about two very different kinds of theaters I mean Lebanon is seen as a major threat with hisbah having tens of thousands of rockets some of them exact that could cause a lot of damage much more than what we've seen coming out from the Gaza Strip and their voices in the Israeli public and also in the Israeli government that believe that Israel should strike and and have a kind of a preemptive strike inside uh Lebanon hit hisbah Israel has evacuated tens of thousands of Israelis along the border with Lebanon so there is an anticipation that there will be an escalation uh with Lebanon now in terms of the trust that you were asking about the in the government I would say that even though nany himself is not popular all currently there is trust in the military in the IDF even though the IDF failed on the 7th of October still the public believes that that the military can do what has to be done and that kind of faith is what is keeping morale among the the soldiers so we hear quite High journalist Sammy so with the laters tonight from Jerusalem Samy as always thank you well to say that almost everyone in Israel has a personal connection to the military that would not be an exaggeration military service is required of everyone men and women and for many the current war against Hamas is their first encounter with life and death combat my colleague Ben fulan just returned from Israel where he met families waiting for their sons and daughters to return from service and for security reasons in his report names and locations have not been volunteers Israeli American mother of four Karen is in charge here 1500 meals a day feeding evacuees from communities close to the fighting as well as troops on the front her 20-year-old son is one of them this is the only thing that distract me from thinking of him and bad [Music] thoughts the pictures going around the world are especially hard for Karen to watch her son is part of an elite combat unit he's been on the ground in Gaza since day one she's only heard back from him a couple times over the stretch of a month she says this is her contribution to the war effort it's amazing it's amazing the the feeling that you do something behind the scene um it helps a lot mentally physic everything it's like you wake up in the morning and you have something to do because as of now the whole country is like on hold all parents in Israel know that their children must do military service but that doesn't make the sacrifice any easier for Caren Knights are the toughest I ask her what goes through her head everything everything that you want from sadness to happiness to Proud to no sleep passs and I'm like getting emotional um it's a difficult feeling Karen yearns to hear from her son but dreads a call from the military she says no news is good news I'm joined Now by Benjamin Anthony he's in IDF combat reservice and a veteran of several IDF campaigns he's also the co-founder and CEO of the Miriam Institute which describes itself as the Premier International forum for Israel focused discussion he joins us tonight from Washington DC Mr Anthony it's good to have you on the program the US president thank you for having me U the US president and the Secretary of State they have exerted a lot of public pressure recently to get Israel to say yes to these daily pauses in the f in Gaza the concerns coming from Israel's allies are they impacting the effectiveness of the military's campaign in Gaza no I don't think so at all and I think that it's positive that the states of Israel has moved towards what it calls tactical pauses in the fighting it's positive because it means that we're making very good progress there militarily it's also positive because under no circumstances is prime minister Netanyahu willing to enter into a long-term ceasefire with Hamas despite hamas's pleas for Israel to do so and requests for Israel to do so and the Prime Minister has reiterated and stood firm behind the goals of this war which are to topple Hamas and to have the hostages returned home to our people inside the states of Israel safely and whole and therefore the humanitarian pauses can take place but if there is to be a ceasefire the prime minister is very clear the hostages must come home let me ask you about targets the the IDF says that its targets are chosen for military reasons and that they are in line with international law but above that to what extent does the moral dilemma caused by the death of civilians in these engagements to what extent does that put the Strategic goals in Jeopardy well actually the IDF activities inside the Gaza Strip supersede the standard imposed by International humanitarian law I'll give you an example the dropping of leaflets and the reiterated calls for the gazans to evacuate South by way of a humanitarian Corridor that's facilitated by the Israel Defense Forces that actually supersedes the requirement of militaries in armed conflict that's actually a standard that the IDF employs as a consequence of our moral standard our moral standard being higher than the legal threshold so that's just one point with regard to that and in terms of the targeting it's absolutely proportionate to the goals of the war once we saw the Rampage on October the 7th of Kamas which resulted in the murder of 1,400 of our people our elderly our infirm our women our children our unborn children and the kidnapping of some 230 hostages 240 hostages into the Gaza Strip including Holocaust Survivors and all of those categories of people that I mentioned earlier the war goal became the topping of Kamas because of that it is proportionate to make more direct more key more impactful strikes if they are in service of that war Aim so I'm very comfortable with the proportionality of the idf's activities Israeli soldiers as I'm sure you're aware are dying in this war that was started by Hamas but it's also a war that was caused by a failure to provide security and political parties which have turned out political policies which have turned out to be flawed military leaders in Israel they have admitted their responsibility are you happy with the response that you've seen from Israel's political leadership I'll be perfectly Frank with you I'm speaking here as an individual as a citizen of the states of Israel as a combat veteran of service in the Israel Defense Forces I'm not happy with the fact that the prime minister is yet to say very very clearly and unequivocally that he Bears responsibility for what occurred during October the 7th now let me be clear the doing of what occurred on October 7th is not prime minister netanyahu's that is the doing of Hamas this terrorist organization that we must now destroy the responsibility for what took place of course that has to rest at the head of state that being prime minister Netanyahu and I'm very hopeful that he will actually come out and make that statement because it's a statement of leadership if one accepts upon their shoulders clear responsibility for something as heinous and horrific as this is I think that the community there in the states of Israel that our people in Israel will understand that there is a leader cognizant of everything that took place and willing to shoulder the burden of responsibility however heavy that may be yeah what you're saying there is words matter Optics are also important especially in in war are you aware of any Cabinet member attending the funeral of a fallen Israeli soldier in this war so I I'm aware of Defense Minister yev Gallant who is the only individual that I know of who has attended funerals now this is obviously something that needs to be remedied and improved upon it's unfortunately a basic standard and it's durur that cabinet ministers Prime Ministers and so forth will attend the funerals of the fallen in the states of Israel in the event of a loss the fact that that's not taking place is deeply regrettable but I do want your viewers to stay very clearly focused on what brought about this circumstance that we now debate the virtues or or demerits of people visiting the funerals of those who've been killed what's at play here is the most murderous Rampage against the Jewish people since the events of the Holocaust nothing short of that what's important to note is that it's not the same Jews that were there during the Holocaust these Jews in the states of Israel are able to fight they're able to defend themselves and I believe they're more than capable of bringing about the toppling and destruction of Hamas Israel um started this war politically divided you know case in point judicial reform last night I interviewed Uriel abula a political science professor at Tel Aviv University and he told me that Israeli Society is united only in its opposition to Hamas the polarizing politics of Netanyahu he said they remain do you agree with that statement and who do you see being a future bridge builder inside Israel so I don't know the professor that you mentioned I'm not familiar with his work or his opinions I do believe that Israel unfortunately unnecessarily came to this war it's a period of deep deep disunity within our society and among our citizenry that's very regrettable and lamentable and the role that that played in this failure that you announced at the top of this interview that will be investigated thoroughly absolutely Ely thoroughly now what you have at the moment is you have very clear and declared Unity among the forces of the Israel Defense Forces among the security establishment and you also have a Unity government that's come to play that includes members of the Coalition of prime minister Netanyahu and members of the opposition most notably Minister Benny Gant who has stepped into a central role in the war cabinet so you do have that Unity it's positive to see but but one has to understand the disunity that predated this war that was over something that was less than vital in my opinion it's only my opinion but that is my view now you have something that's absolutely vital to the cohesion of Israel at play right now number one you have 200 more than 200 of our hostages inside the Gaza Strip you also have more than 1,400 members of our society who have been murdered the relatives and families of both of those groups they are going to let their voices be heard and they will start to become increasingly outspoken in their demands for answers as to how this could take place and how in the case of the hostages this can be remedied I want to ask you Mr Anthony for your thoughts on a quote from the late Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Chiron from 2004 when um he was quoted as saying by the end of 2005 there will not be a single Jew left in the Gaza Strip I mean that was almost 20 years ago but when you think about happening right now how does that quote from an Israeli leader how does that sit with you now considering what is happening well I personally think that the seeding of land is a mistaken thought it's a mistaken aspect of political philosophy it's not a process that works the idea of seeding land for peace has not borne fruit when it comes to negotiations with the Palestinian Arabs we gave land we withdrew entirely in 2005 as you alluded to that quote from former prime minister shaon we withdrew entirely from the Gaza Strip by way of the disengagement in 2005 there indeed was no Jewish presence there inside the Gaza Strip there was an opportunity for the Palestinian Arabs to develop and to build upon the Gaza Strip to create an oasis nothing short of that along the shoreline of the Mediterranean they instead chose terrorism and they proceeded to build rocket launching factories they proceeded to arm up they proceeded to launch horrific Terror attacks the worst of which we've just seen on October 7th against the one and only Jewish State targeting our citizens and targeting our civilians and I think that what you will probably see is that October 7th marks the death n not only for Hamas as a movement as as I said it must be destroyed militarily it must be completely vanquished from the face of the Earth nothing short of that but you've probably also seen the death Nell of the two State solution I do not think that the Israeli people will be in favor of the seeding of any land to the Palestinian Arabs in the pursuit of peace I think that you have to pursue peace in return for peace not give away land in return for a peace that remains elusive Benjamin Anthony with the Miriam Institute Mr Anthony we appreciate your time and there's plenty more to discuss we hope you can come back and talk with us again thank you thank you for having
