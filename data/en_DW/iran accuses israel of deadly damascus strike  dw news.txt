Iran has condemned a suspected Israeli air strike on the Syrian Capitol Damascus which it says killed five members of the paramilitary Revolutionary guards group Iran's President says tyan will not leave the attack unanswered Regional tensions have been escalating as Israel continues its war against Hamas following the October 7th terrorist attacks this is all that remains of a four-story house in his neighborhood in the Syrian [Music] Capital but the attack which apparently targeted the building also damaged several cars and other nearby property at around 10:30 we heard the sounds of three consecutive explosions they targeted the building here behind us we were shocked what was the situation in your home Everything Is Broken the fence of the building flew over and landed in our kitchen thank God there was no one there of course all glass is broken the fridge was damaged the wood was damaged as Rescuers have been trying to find survivors under the rubble Iran's revolutionary guards said several members of the paramilitary group were among the dead Tran blamed Israel for the strike and threatened to respond Iran has been a close Ally of Syria's president Bashar al-assad as well as the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon it also supports Hamas which carried out the October 7th terrorist attack on Israel Israel has not claimed responsibility for the strike in Damascus it comes just days after the Revolutionary guards claimed it hit what it called an Israeli spy headquarters in Northern Iraq well for more we can speak to gido Steinberg he is a Middle East Analyst at the German Institute for international and security Affairs welcome to DW first of all can you explain to us why members of Iran's revolutionary guard were in Syria what exactly were they doing there the guards have been in Syria um at least since 2011 and they have assisted the Syrian government in its fight first against the protests uh and then against the Insurgency in the country ever since uh this Civil War has virtually ended they are still there they uh they have about a couple of hundred uh Personnel in the country they advise the Syrian military and the Syrian um and the Syrian intelligence services and they have tried to build uh what they call a second front in Syria uh from which to confront Israel now as we've been reporting Iran says Israel uh was to blame for this strike is it likely that indeed Israeli forces were responsible for this killing of Iranian revolutionary guards in Damascus I personally am and am convinced that the Israelis are responsible um the Israelis have attacked the Iranian and uh Iranians supported militia militia Targets in Syria and sometimes even in Iraq since 2017 uh they have uh attacked between a th000 and 2,000 times ever since and they have already killed quite a number of high ranking irgc Personnel so there is no doubt that the Israelis are Al also responsible uh in this case and in this particular case how big of a blow do you believe that this particular strike on these particular individuals is for Iran well this is quite a blow Ju Just like uh many other attacks in the past the Israelis have attacked high ranking Personnel of uh the Iranian revolutionary guards in this case uh it seems as if they have um as if they have killed the head of the irgc intelligence service head for Syria that's one of the high ranker highest ranking um Iranians in the country he's probably a brigadier general that's a major blow to the Iranians all right so seeing that this was quite a highlevel uh attack on very important members of the Revolutionary guards what do you think is going to happen next can we expect retaliatory strikes from Iran or maybe even Syria against Israel directly well not Syria Syria is not not able to attack uh Israel and uh I have as I said ever since 2017 uh the the Israelis have attacked Iranian and Iranian Allied Targets in in Syria we have seen some retaliation by the Iranians but by and large ever since the Iranians have not not found any adequate measures uh to retaliate against these strikes I think the the Iranians will now think very hard whether they might be able to Target uh Israel with missiles with drones perhap perhaps from Syria but the overall U the overall situation in the Middle East will not change simply because the Iranians have so many Israeli attacks to retaliate for um and they are looking for every opportunity to to hit Israeli Targets in the Middle East and possibly even abroad and to what extent is this particular incident linked to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas and also to the cross border uh hostilities in the north between Israel and Hezbollah well this incident is mainly linked by by The Coincidence um the Israelis there is a certain continu continuity to Israeli air strikes against Iranian uh Targets in Syria at the same time we do see the Iranians stepping up attacks against Israeli American and other targets but mainly by proxy for example by letting hisbah hit the Israeli North uh I think this will continue but there is also the possibility that the Iranians will get more directly involved in attacks against Israeli and other Western targets that was G Steinberg from the German Institute for international and security Affairs thank you so much for your
