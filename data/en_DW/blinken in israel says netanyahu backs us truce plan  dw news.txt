US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin says Israel's prime minister has reaffirmed his commitment to a ceasefire proposal for Gaza blankin says the honest is now on the militant group Hamas whose Terror attacks on Israel sparked the war after talking to relatives of those taken hostage in Gaza on October 7th he said the the longer that this takes the longer that the war goes on the higher the chance of the conflict spreading the families have been protesting outside the hotel where blink has been holding talks with Israeli officials on Monday evening the UN Security Council endorsed the us back ceasefire proposal but there's still no official line from Israel on the plan for the withdrawal of troops from parts of Gaza the return of hostages and a six-week truce that could become permanent let's listen to what blinkin had to say to reporters in Tel Aviv a short while ago everyone's vote is in except for one vote and that's AAS and that's what we wait for um it is on Hamas to move forward with this proposal or or not and it's very clear what as I said virtually the entire International Community wants to see and of course what so many families want to see and it's also what the people of Gaza so desperately need DW's Rebecca Richard is following blink's visit for us Rebecca what did you make of what the secretary of state had to say well Anthony blinkin brought with him Terry many of the messages he's brought in his previous seven visits to the region you said one there uh in your leading he said that the longer this goes on the the more likely this will spill over into a wider regional conflict that's something the US has been concerned about from the very beginning uh he also said that a hostage deal is the only way to bring back all the hostages uh that remain in Gaza and it's the best way in reference to potentially put a nod at the uh the rather violent operation that took place on the weekend to rescue four hostages uh where you know scores of Palestinians were also killed in that but what he also said and you heard it from him there he said that that everyone has said Yes except for Hamas putting fur the ball in hamas's court to come to the table and agree to this deal that the US at least is touting as an Israeli deal and he said that Netanyahu reaffirmed with him in their meeting that the Israelis have a agreed to this deal although we haven't heard from Israel publicly uh that that is in fact the case and it's certainly uncertain that that is the case when you look at the makeup of the current Israeli government the farri right Coalition and those far-right members is having more sway now that the more moderate Benny gun stepped down just a couple of days ago uh from the war cabinet and from the government putting a lot more uh onus on the far right members of Benjamin netanyahu's far right uh farri right Coalition and they have said repeatedly that they will not enter any enter in into any agreement uh that that looks towards a permanent ceasefire Rebecca we saw protests taking place outside the hotel where secretary blinkin was staying there in Tel Aviv what more can you tell us about those well these weren't protests against Anthony blink are against the US in fact they're more in support of what the US are trying to achieve here with this trip and with this proposed plan that Biden set out uh a week ago this is many of the families of the hostages friends and and others who support a deal and are putting pressure on the Israeli government rather uh to try to get them to come and get on board with this deal they desperately want to see their loved ones return and they see that a hostage deal is the only way for that to to to happen Rebecca thank you that was DW's Rebecca RS in Jerusalem
