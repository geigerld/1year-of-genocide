well families of German hostages who were taken in the H mastera Terror attacks have traveled to Berlin to put pressure on the government to take more action Chancellor Schultz met some of them in Israel earlier and their entreaties have been heartfelt my sister she's a very very ill woman in this picture here she's knitting heads for new born babies in all margarite Moses was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists along with five other family members their relatives have come to Germany to keep pressure on the government here here this is Mr Schultz and me and I told him we don't want to interfere the German politics but but you have to do something the attacks have left them with sleepless nights and endless thoughts about their loved ones our mission is to try our best that Germany will react against the terror and not only show their sympathy that doesn't help we need now walk and not sympathy Gard Conrad is a former German intelligence officer he's had experience mediating between Israel and Hamas he believes it's likely that the hostages that the hostages are being held underground uh to our likelihood they will be held in safe places uh underneath that means in the tunnel system of Gaza uh distributed possibly nowadays in the view of a forthcoming Ground Forces operation in the north of Gaza possibly more in the South than in the north but not in one place that would be unlikely uh and they will be placed in order to protect their abductors the hostage takers in first of all explain to us what you what do you mean by that they will be placed to protect their abductors that means in the proximity that means in the proximity of uh let's say decision making um people of of Hamas that trans military leadership political leadership as far as they are in Gaza uh that means uh if you want to hit them you risk hitting the hostages so we're back to this this uh notorious Hamas use of of human Shields and again we can only we can only speculate but you're pretty sure there still inside the territory they won't have been uh taken away that would be uh quite outlandish uh because that would assume that the Hamas would have been able to smuggle them out via a tunnel to Egyptian territory there are no other options right and the practicalities of looking after a so many babies children women the elderly one of whom a holocaust Survivor the the practicalities of looking after them in such stressful circumstances that is to all likelihood a challenge on the one hand on the other hand we could assume that Hamas is looking very well uh after themselves that means they are privileged in terms of uh food in terms of Beverages and so on they won't share the same fate as their fellow Palestinians uh uh above uh so it should be possible for them although I could imagine that um caring for the most vulnerable uh persons among the hostages might be a challenge might be as well a reason for hopefully releasing them earlier than all the others right and are we clear what Hamas wants in order for the hostages to be released uh in in Prin yes although we will have to ask ourselves whether Hamas ever expected to have 200 roughly 200 hostages because um and of course such a diverse let's say group of hostages being having bals uh from quite a number of uh international country International actors countries foreign countries so um let's say the first aim now is just to keep them in order to to to safeguard their own lives that means Hamas abductor lives the second aim might be then to uh negotiate uh or to enforce a kind of not benign but acceptable outcome of the war for them for Hamas and the third one if they achieve that is of course to negotiate uh within the Frameworks we know the release of the maximum number of Palestinian prisoners in Israel and you know there are let's say 4,500 or possibly 6,000 we don't know um and they will for sure ask demand uh to have them released all of them okay we again speculate for us how do negotiations begin who talks to whom and how especially when both sides have said we will not talk well that's uh that's true for the moment of course nobody will talk now as long as the guns have have not yet Fallen silent there so that means in the end uh if there is no way to to in to enforce their release and as you know this is quite a challenge to say the very least um then uh in the end there will be negotiations uh indirect ones of course mediated to our likelihood by Egypt because Egypt maintains the channels to both sides can we look at your own personal experience uh with the Israeli soldier gillad shal shalet Hamas held him for 5 years even rejecting requests from the Red Cross to visit him to check on his welfare when you worked on those negot negotiations what was the Breakthrough what was the thing that made you think now we're starting to get somewhere well as I said the if if War uh one day is over then Hamas if it still exists this is one of the question the question is who will then be the negotiating side from Hamas but let's assume someone will be left and the and if the hostages are there as well someone will have to decide uh how to uh release them and if Hamas or a successor has still a kind of power negotiation power they will do that and the the time to speak will come uh when Hamas or its successor or whosoever gives a kind of signal we don't know we are not aware whether there are some tentative back channels maybe uh uh on a on Purely humanitarian grounds that might be might be a first attempt I don't know people countries governments sometimes indicate that they are exercising their utmost efforts to do so this might be just talk I hope uh there is something behind of that but at the time being uh as I said Hamas will insist as long as it exists to get the kind of guarantees uh for their own Survival first basic line and the second one uh is to uh demand the maximum of concessions from the side that's the framework whether the framework can be upheld that's a question thank you so much mediator hostage negotiator Conrad Gart Conrad thank you thank you Germany's president has met the families of German hostages being held by Hamas Frank valter steinm expressed his solidarity and tried to reassure them it's important for me to have you here today as ter president and to tell you you belong to us We Stand By Your Side in these terrible hour and we are doing everything in our power to I can assure you and you have already heard it from the chancellor that the German government is doing everything in its power to secure the release of your loved ones and we are in close contact with all the key players in the region and also Beyond it well our senior political analyst Melinda crane gave me her assessment of the German president's address deep empathy uh there at the beginning for the individual uh families and uh and uh very personal uh expression of compassion and sorrow from the president and then toward the end a a a very very powerful condemnation of anti-Semitic attacks uh we have seen anti-semitic uh incidents uh on the rise since Hamas uh attack against Israel and a very very strong statement there from the president that this will not be tolerated that as important as freedom of expression is it does not include the right to denigrate Jews the right to express anti-semitic hatred that every person who lives here must know what aitz was about must know the history of the Holocaust and that that is a civic duty of all who live here and that Germany does not discriminate on the basis of religion and will not tolerate any such thing now all of this comes with the background of these protests that we have seen that were not simply protests uh expressing support or solidarity with Palestinian civilians but that went be far beyond that to express anti Semitic sentiments and this is uh as he said something that Germany cannot and will not tolerate because as he as he mentioned the founding of the state of Israel is essentially part of the history of the Federal Republic of Germany due to Germany's uh responsibility for the Holocaust and therefore um need for very very strong action here and I thought particularly those closing words that will be a message that will be welcomed by many here in Germany who have been horrified to see for example Molotov cocktails thrown at a synagogue not far from where you and I are sitting at this moment just this week that is a very terrible reminder of course of of the incidents that led up to World War II and the Holocaust and um and for anyone who has followed Germany's attempts to deal with that painful history uh it will be as he said deep disgracing and shaming thank you for that
