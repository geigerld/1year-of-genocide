meanwhile the UN Secretary General Antonio guz will visit the city of Rafa on Saturday to push for a humanitarian ceasefire in the ongoing Gaza War this comes after a US sponsored resolution for a ceasefire failed to pass a un Security Council vote after it was blocked by Russia and China US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin meets families of Israeli hostages during his visit to Tel Aviv the US has consistently supported Israel in its pursuit of Hamas militants in Gaza responsible for the October 7th attacks and in trying to free the hostages held captive there but as the conflict in Gaza continues and the humanitarian crisis for Palestinian civilians becomes critical the US Israel's closest Ally is voicing concern all of them now after his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister benam Netanyahu blinkin explained that the two countries do not see eye to eye on Israel's planned ground offensive in the southern city of Rafa a major military ground operation in Rafa is not the way to do it uh it risks killing more civilians it risks uh wreaking greater Havoc with the provision of humanitarian assistance it risks further isolating Israel around the world and jeopardizing its long-term security and standing Netanyahu remained undeterred from his plans for Rafa I told blinkin I greatly appreciate that for over 5 months we've been standing together in the war against Hamas and we recognize the need to evacuate civilians from the war zones and meet humanitarian needs but I also said we can't beat Hamas without going into Rafa and eliminating the rest of the battalions there I told him I hope we'll do it with the support of the USA But if we have to we'll do it alone while blinkin was in Tel Aviv the US faced another setback in its diplomacy the UN Security Council failed to pass a US sponsored resolution calling for an immediate and sustained ceasefire hamas's terrorist attacks on October 7th it was vetoed by Russia and China as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan continues men and boys gather amongst the rubble in Rafa for Friday prayers their mosque lies in Ruins People Prayed in the street for nearly a month after the mosque was bombed the Israeli occupiers deprived people of praying in their mosques during the holy month of Ramadan as you know Muslims eagerly await this month to perform their religious duties especially the night prayers over 1 million Palestinians fled to Rafa from other areas of Gaza in recent months to seek safety they now find themselves in the middle of Israel's war against Hamas let's get reaction now from Shina low who's from the Norwegian Refugee Council in Jerusalem welcome to DW um can I start with your initial thoughts on hearing this news of the failure of this us resolution well we've seen that that multiple un resolutions uh calling for a ceasefire though my understanding is that this one did not explicitly call for a ceasefire have now failed in the security Council but we need world leaders to keep pushing we need there to be a ceasefire that's the only way to put an end to the tremendous Devastation death and destruction that we've seen all over almost 6 months in Gaza and the only way for humanitarian agencies such as the Norwegian Refugee Council and our partners to be able to scale up Aid to the to the people of Gaza who desperately need it as famine is is on the BR we're on the brink of famine and the people of Gaza do seem very much to be um stuck in the middle of uh great power politics in this absolutely these are the people who are losing the most they've been suffering ing for 6 months of hostilities there's been uh 32,000 Palestinians who've been killed over the last 6 months uh more than 60% of housing in Gaza damaged or destroyed uh 1.1 million people facing acute starvation levels at this point we it the situation could not be any more dire we've been warning for months that this would what is what would happen so long as hostilities continued and so long as as uh not enough Aid was reaching the people in God and now we are at this point of of serious desperation and we need the world's Community to come together to push for a ceasefire once in for all that's the only way that we can even attempt to try and address the the tremendous needs quickly Rising on the ground in Gaza and give us an idea uh would you please of how much Aid if any is actually getting through whether uh by Overland by air or indeed by sea nowhere near enough a is getting in uh to Gaza by any of those means I I just checked the numbers a few minutes ago and it looked like only fewer than 200 trucks per day continue to enter Gaza there uh over the last few days we need a massive scaling up minimum of 500 trucks per day to enter we know that there have been these alternative uh routes that have been attempted the the air drops that we've seen which really are very expensive not very efficient have landed in the sea in Israel have landed and and killed people when parachutes have failed to deploy they simply are not an efficient or as effective way to to reach people in need as the ground Crossings are in terms of the the sea corridors there certainly is potential for that to to scale up uh and and to have it have a greater impact but in terms of the popup Port that the United States has committed to building that could take uh 30 to 60 days to construct and the people of Gaza just simply do not have enough time we need there to be continued pressure on Israel not only to operate the current Crossings at their capacity which which is which they are falling far short of but also to open additional Crossings regularly to allow uh for more Aid to get in particularly to Northern Gaza where uh famine is is really looming thank you so much for joining us and outlining that so clearly for us to shine a low from the Norwegian Refugee Council let's go more from Middle East analyst shaie rosanes welcome shaie so we have Anthony blinken there reiterating the White House message that a ground incursion into Rafa is a bad idea and Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will go into Rafa with or without us backing this seems like a new low in relations between these two allies no doubt the tensions have never been so high in the last five and a half months since October 7th and and both sides are not shying anyway away from it by now um uh it almost becomes like a political tool in each Camp you know and by the Dem for the Democrats to show that they are pushing against for Israel and for nany to show that he's pushing against the Americans Rafa became a symbol to what happens in Gaza the way the Americans see it the Israel insistence on pushing towards Gaza meaning that they're not ready to move on to talk about the greater vision for what happens to Gaza the day after um they were hoping that they will give Israel support for a few months and Israel will complete its operations and then they'll be able to look into the prospect of the Middle East and into you know into future for the Palestinian people Palestinian statehood uh as as long as the Israelis are pushing for for Rafa they're pushing away from any of that which is the American Vision and that's why Rafa is such a big symbol of what's Happening Now when it comes to the war in Gaza okay but they are still talking and several Israeli officials including the defense minister are due in Washington next week that's exactly that is that to pressure the American pressure I mean the the Israeli defense minister is there to meet with Lloyd Austin his counterpart who already said yesterday he wishes Israel will consider other plans for Rafa we know that Biden demanded that nany will send his top uh people which will be coming to Washington next week exactly for that they're trying to get Israel not only to back off from Rafa but actually opt in to other solutions for the Palestinians and for Gaza and Israel is very reluctant and the question that is being being asked in Israel is what are the reasons is that politics that is running uh uh driving Netanyahu or is it actually the benefit of the war and the effort which many feel was justified at the beginning but now it's kind of lost its cause the effort to eradicate Hamas who is a terror organization acknowledges such by many countries in the world so this is where we are at now we know we're five and a half months in the feeling for the Americans is that Israel is not quite clearly knowing its way out out of Gaza and is trying to help it find its way out and Israel is you know at least netan keeps pushing to stay in Gaza and to fight off any of the um political solutions that the Americans are offering but until and unless Israel actually does go into uh into Rafa then both sides can maintain their positions and both sides can appeal to the various sections that they're trying to appeal to indeed and this is also partially why the what's on the line now in Doha the talk we are seeing for a ceasefire are so important because that will bring finally some uh quiet some calm to this very you know terrible conflict uh what's on the table is about 40 42 days of a ceasefire that will allow Israel the Americans of course Hamas as well and Palestinians the whole region to regroup and rethink and maybe find a way for a more permanent solution for Gaza this is happening as we speak right now and hopefully we will know better I mean Lincoln was cautiously optimistic about the chances for uh for a deal to be reached soon hopefully that will maybe be the way out and some sort of breakthrough okay thank you for that Shany DW Middle East analy sh ranes thank you all right we want to go now to Tel Aviv I'm joined by Myra zanzan of the international crisis group she's a senior analyst focused on Israeli Palestinian issues and Regional conflicts it's good to have you with us Russia and China vetoing this us sponsored resolution what do you make of that did did you expect this vote well I think uh it's it's pretty clear that the US is trying to at least appear to be doing something on the front uh of the Israel Gaza War but uh in effect the US has not called for a ceasefire a permanent ceasefire which I think everybody understands at this point is necessary because of the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza Russia and China of course have their own interests uh in in vetoing or abstaining or going against the US resol politically but either way the resolution itself did not call for a ceasefire without condition which is I believe what many of the members were looking for and and the fact that this us backed resolution failed to pass in the UN Security Council can Israel now claim this as a a sort of Victory well Israel claims plenty of Victories when it can the icj South Africa hearing the fact that it didn't uh actually re call for a ceasefire or uh uh decide that Israel was actually committing genocide only the potential was claimed as a victory by Israel um you know so Israel could certainly claim this as a victory Israel still has full us backing for this War uh and it continues with its offensive and continues to make threats as about Rafa as well uh I want you to take a listen to what we heard from the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu what he said today after meeting with the US Secretary of State take a listen I told blink I greatly appreciate there I told him I hope we'll do it with the support of the USA But if we have to alone that's quite a statement isn't it we've got the prime minister saying we are going into Rafa whether or not the us our most important Ally likes it what is this going to do to Israeli us relations well first of all I think we need to take into account that um Israel and nany specifically are purposely using the threat of Rafa which we've been hearing about for weeks now um is an imminent threat when when people understand I understand that for various reasons including military recruitment on the Israeli side and the need need to move the population out uh 1.4 million people who are you know internally displaced in RAF these things would need to happen before they could go in so that threat of going in is really a way to distract from the humanitarian disaster and the imminent famine that is happening in North Gaza and could also reach South Gaza uh so I think this is a ploy by Netanyahu I think it's very clear that he he is using this to to take away attention from the fact that he understands that he can't do those things without us approval Israel is completely dependent on weapons shipments from the US it's not something that Israel can do without the Diplomatic and Military Support of the us so you say this is a ploy by Netanyahu then what do you make of these Israeli officials I understand it's the defense minister the war cabinet minister that are traveling next week to Washington they're going to be talking about as I understand about a possible ground operation in Rafa is this where the real decision is going to be made and do you see the US convincing Israel not to move forward on this uh I think the US has leverage to to to make this uh to to create a a ceasefire uh in Gaza and it has chosen not to do so whether or not real decisions will be made I'm not sure part of it to me seems to be performative on both sides Netanyahu tries to appear tough he's trying to drag out the war for his own political survival and the US gets to show that it's doing everything it can to stop or to minimize a Rafa operation so I see this as largely performative uh obviously I don't know what's going on behind closed doors um but I think this is just a way for Israel to show that it's cooperating with its uh Ally with its largest benefactor uh when in reality you know uh neither side if it really wanted to is taking the action that it says it wants to take my zign of the international crisis group joining us from Tel Aviv we appreciate your time and your analysis tonight thank
