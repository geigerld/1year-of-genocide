I'm Phil Gail welcome to the program media linked to the terrorist organization Hamas say an explosion at a house in southern Gaza has killed an injured several people including children many of the Wounded have been taken to a hospital in the territory's densely populated city of KH Yunis Reports say at least four people have been killed Hamas blames an Israeli air strike for the casualties the United Nations says more than 3,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the 7th of October that was when Hamas killed than 14400 people in Israel launching this current and most serious escalation in the decades long Israeli Palestinian conflict Israel Defense Forces say these strikes are targeting infrastructure of the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza IDF claims to have killed the head of the military branch of another armed terror group in these strikes Israel say terrorist group hisbah along the Israel Lebanon border was also targeted overnight our aircraft continued large scale strikes on Military positions of the Hezbollah terrorist organization the rational is to strike hezbollah's observation systems along the border of course this is in retaliation for missiles fired at Israel any strike by Hezbollah will be met with a significant response from in the Gaza Strip news agency footage shows aftermath of an Israeli air strike in southern Gaza Israel had earlier told gazin in the north of the territory to evacuate South for their safety Medics rushed the injur to the hospital many including children reportedly didn't survive there is absolutely no difference between Gaza City Rafa KH Yunis between the North the South South the east or the West they sent us to the South and there have been strikes here every day every day there are deaths in massive numbers and this footage shows buildings turned into Rubble reportedly after a strike on Rafa near gaza's border with Egypt my daughter was not a militant and was not involved in any battles she was sleeping peacefully at home she was just a child and couldn't differentiate between an enemy or an ally what shall I do now it's a crime it's unfair where is the world and the people calling for children's rights a question International powers are grappling with British prime minister Rishi sonak is the latest head of government to travel to Israel and the Middle East attempting to deescalate the conflict well after Colonel Peter lner speaks for the IDF Israel's military welcome back to DW leftenant Colonel is the IDF bombing Han Unis in southern Gaza the IDF is conducting strikes against Hamas extensively and I would say throughout the Gaza Strip absolutely most of our operations are focused on where uh the the the Hub the heart the Beating Heart of the terrorist organization the terrorist Army of Hamas but absolutely when there is a threat originating or uh being conducted against Israel from the south and we will strike absolutely and since last week I I the IDF has been telling civilians in Northern Gaza to evacuate to the South for their safety why did you tell them to go there if you were going to continue to bomb the area we did not say at any stage that we would not strike Hamas terrorists wherever they are hiding this op operation this war against Hamas continues wherever they are hiding they have no the Hamas terrorist organization has no safe place we will pursue them we will kill them and we will make sure they can never ever abduct murder butcher Israelis ever again so when uh men women and children take the idf's advice and move to Southern Gaza uh at your behest they are still liable to be bombed by Israel no we do not Target civilians that's in an in accurate uh conclusion that you made we are targeting Hamas specifically specifically and and I need to emphasize that we are not targeting targeting civilians we are moving civilians out of Harm's Way We Are announcing to civilians where we where we intend on striking that is precisely why we evacuated so many people from the north because we intend and continue to operate against this Terror organization indeed there are terrorists still Hamas terrorists still in hunas there are still terrorists operating in Rafa just like uh um and and therefore we will continue to seek them out and and um take them out of the equation absolutely you you say that you are targeting Hamas terrorists and yet there are deaths and casualties uh in their hundreds uh in uh hospitals in the overcrowded hospitals in Khan Unice um so your targeting appears not to be that precise no on the contrary I would suggest that the vast majority of our efforts are focused and effective against Hamas against the terrorist organization and I heard that DW were actually quoting Hamas media so you're quoting the propaganda machine of a an organization that is putting a huge effort on psychological terrorism so I I would be very very cautious in any figures coming out of H the Hamas uh machine of Lies this is a a very problematic situation it is nevertheless a war a war on those that care for life like Israel and those that have no regard for any life Israeli or Palestinian uh we're showing uh viewers now a map of the al- maazi humanitarian Zone in uh West Khan Unice which the IDF presented on Wednesday a tiny sliver of land inside the tiny territory that is Gaza which is home to about 2 million people will that be safe from Israeli bombing that is a designated Zone indeed that has been declared a safe zone or a humanitarian Zone and you know we are continuing our operations against Hamas and indeed there is a huge challenge in the civilian Arena but the responsibility for the people of Gaza does not lie on the shoulders of Israel Israel is not inside Gaza uh today we have no forces except for very small raids that are taking place to collect bodies of that Hamas abducted and dropped and left in the Open Fields on the perimeter area so the responsibility lies with the authority but where is Hamas they're hiding and they're sacrificing the people of Gaza our responsibility is to restore security to the people of Israel the security that was devastated by the atrocities of a terrorist organization that has no regard for anybody's life they don't care about Israelis and they don't care about Palestinians they are holding 203 israelies hostage today and they're holding two million hostages of Palestinians thank you for that I'm I I wasn't clear in your your answer um whether the al- maazi humanitarian Zone in West Khan Unis will be safe from Israeli bombing as I humanitarians if terrorists come into a humanitarian Zone and condu conduct attacks rocket attacks against Israel then they are jeopardizing a humanitarian Zone you expect us not to defend our people because Hamas abuses their people Hamas of course a terrorist organization Israel a democratic State tell us more about the measures that the IDF is taking to minimize the civilian death toll in Gaza the uh operations of the IDF are built around three concepts of Distinction first of all between non-combatants and terrorists second of all the military necessity of the military operation so if it's a specific strike we look at that and then build around the military necessity and then a after all uh uh we weigh on the proportionality that that strike the military strike will give us a military Advantage when defeating uh Hamas in this in this war so when we look at those three components that we then talk about the tools that we do whether it's evacuation or forewarning announcement you know when we announce that we are going or to evacuate a specific area we are basically setting us s second setting ourselves up for Ambush by the enemy this is the challenge we Face indeed it is a very we see we are seeing the images coming out of your your your answer is very clear a word about the future as I understand it you're hoping to eliminate Hamas as a military threat to Israel and a political entity in Gaza so what is the plan for Gaza the day after you achieve that from Israel's perspective any alternative will be better than this alternative than Hamas of course this organization can never be allowed to rule the Gaza Strip as a staging ground for terrorism Butchery abduction ever again and so the the the plight or the the the future of the Gaza Strip I would say will lie on the shoulders of the people of Gaza not on Israel we don't want to run Gaza we don't want to rule Gaza we left Gaza precisely because we don't want to rule Gaza but we cannot permit it to be a staging ground for massacres of of women children and babies we cannot allow the the Gaza Strip to be used as a springboard for terrorism against our people our responsibility and this is this is why we didn't choose this war we are determined to win it and we will our responsibility is to restore Safety and Security to the people of Israel thank you so much for joining us leftenant Colonel Peter Lerner from the Israeli Defense Forces thank
