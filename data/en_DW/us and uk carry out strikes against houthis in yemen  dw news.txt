we begin with some breaking news the United States and Britain have begun carrying out Military strikes against Targets in Yemen the targets are linked to the iran-backed houi rebels who control much of the country explosions have been reported in the capital S and elsewhere the houis have been attacking shipping in the Red Sea for weeks now they say they're supporting the Palestinian militant group Hamas by targeting ships linked to Israel let's get more of detail abusion dumala and she's been following the story from for us from Washington DC Chanel what more do we know about these strikes well the White House has now confirmed these strikes so there's now an official statement from the White House saying that the US and the UK authorized these strikes along with other countries mentioned in the statement so Australia bin Netherlands Canada among them we know that uh a dozen targets were were the target Target of these strikes and that these targets included inventories of weapons weapons that the hooes had been using to launch their attacks in the Red Sea so the emerging objective of these air strikes from the US and and its Partners appears to be to to be able to send a message to the hooti saying that the US and its Partners can and will uh act to kneecap hou's capabilities to launch these attacks attacks which have not only crippled international shipping but also raised the Spectre of a wider war in the Middle East now in the statement that the White House released President Joe Biden also said that the US will not tolerate attacks on Personnel or allow hostile act actors to imperil freedom of nav navigation and that Biden will not hesitate uh to act and direct more protective measures to this end so that clearly means that this could be the beginning of what could be a drawn out process even as Biden is already starting to uh Garner criticism from various coroners for acting without Congress on this and again amid fears of the us being dragged into a larger Middle Eastern War something of course which the US has some experience of so clearly a warning to the huis but these attacks have been going on for weeks now why is this coordinated International response coming at this point yes one really does have the sense that the other shoe has dropped here as you said these tensions have been simmering for weeks and the US has been unequivocal in saying that it does not in fact want uh to see a spread of the conflict elsewhere Beyond Israel and Gaza and in fact preventing that spread was one of the key objectives of Secretary of State Anthony's Anthony blinken's most recent visit most uh to the Middle East but uh clearly the us along with the UK has decided that it has been uh pushed into a position where they deemed that a response was necessary that their hand was perhaps forced on Tuesday we saw the largest ever barrage of houti missiles and drones uh against vessels in the Red Sea and that is widely considered to have been the last straw that's according to US military officials and that could be the main reason why we're seeing the air strikes that we have seen today tww Chanel dumal in Washington DC thank you so much for your
