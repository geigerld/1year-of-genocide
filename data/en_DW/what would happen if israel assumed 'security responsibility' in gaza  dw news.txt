we start with an escalation in Israel's campaign to destroy Hamas in the Gaza Strip Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that Israeli troops are now operating inside Gaza City he also says there will be no fuel deliveries and no ceasefire until Hamas releases the more than 200 hostages that it captured today one month ago on October 7th fighting in the south is advancing with a forest that Hamas hasn't known Kaza city is encircled we are operating in it and deepening the pressure on Hamas every hour every day so far we have killed thousands of terrorists above the ground and under the ground there will be no entry of fuel no entry of workers and there will be no ceas fire without the release of our hostages Netanyahu has also signaled that Israel will manage security in Gaza after it eliminates Hamas but that difficult Urban combat lies ahead after a month of constant bombardment Israel's military says ground troops are pushing into Gaza City in the northern part of the strip and taken over a Hamas compound as soldiers prepare to attack Fighters hiding in underground tunnels for the first time Israel's prime minister has also provided insight into his government's future plans for the territory during a US television interview President Biden has said that it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza who should govern Gaza when this is over I think Israel will for an indefinite period will have the overall uh security responsibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have it when we don't have that security responsibility what we have is the eruption of uh Hamas Terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine weeks of pounding air strikes have reduced entire neighborhoods to Rubble Israeli ground forces have effectively cut the strip in half as fighting intensifies in the north Netanyahu says Israel is considering tactical pauses to facilitate the entry of humanitarian Aid and the exit of hostages Israel has rebuffed mounting International pressure for a ceasefire now one of the functions of cordoning off that the northern Gaza area into the northern sector of operations is to seal off Hamas leadership and of course Personnel who are already there and kill them or capture them I suppose in some cases military analysts warn that the weeks ahead we'll see grueling house to house fighting in Gaza for this latest phase Israel has put its Elite 36th division to the task but the 36th division has combat power equivalent to the British army so when you see those pictures of these all inspiring shock and a barges not only from Theon artillery that's what you're seeing you're seeing the power of a large modern well equipped Army and its most powerful division about to go into action Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but kept control over the territories airspace and Coastline Netanyahu did not make clear what security control of the strip would look like us officials have advised Israel not to reoccupy Gaza and I'm not joined by Roy Krick he's a director of the director of research at midm that's the Israeli Institute for regional foreign policies in Jerusalem Ro what do you make of netanyahu's remarks about taking responsibility for the overall security of Gaza what does that mean well it means that he continues to choose um his own longstanding strategy of managing the conflict look we have only re two realistic alternatives to the question of who will control Gaza either it would be an ongoing Israeli occupation which includes the continued existence of Hamas it's an ongoing Warfare it is a continue the managing the conflict or there's another alternative that a moderate Palestinian entity that recognize Israel and provide security peace and prosperity for both Israel and Palestine citizens so we have two Alternatives what Netanyahu suggests is to choose to continue his prolonged strategy of managing the conflict and if you want to ask me why I can explain why uh I have another question what about what what about the Civil governance of Gaza I mean Hamas has done that to a degree uh can and will Israel provide that too well no it doesn't want to do that it want to control it or to try to depict or to replicate what's happening in the West Bank to Gaza uh but in the West Bank you have an entity the Palestinian Authority who uh cooperate with you uh and manage the Civil um Civil Life of the citizens in the West Bank you don't have that in Gaza so or you continue to fight Hamas who will continue to manage the Civil uh aspects of of life in Gaza this is what netan actually proposed continue managing the conflict or you choose the alternative and work hard work hard to build an alternative in Gaza a Palestinian one how credible will that be well it will be a Palestinian government put in place if you will uh uh by Israel does it have any credibility it's there's no credibility of such meaning there's no Palestinian entity who would enter Gaza and take responsibility over what's happening in Gaza um escorting by by the IDF the only way an alternative to Kamas the only way to eradicate Kamas is to build a credible Palestinian Authority there is by providing it with an asset meaning with a state a Palestinian recognized State and this is exactly why Netanyahu wouldn't choose that because if we want for example the Palestinian Authority to take responsibility over Gaza it would be ready to do that if it comes with a state recognized State and for that Israel should need to um compromise in the West Bank it means at the end that netanyahu's government would fall because it comprom compris out of the settlers movement and the fundamentalist religious parts of Israel so if he need to choose Netanyahu between continueing managing managing the conflict with the IDF in Gaza or compromising the West Bank and choose a two-state solution provide a Palestinian state but losing his tenure then he would choose himself unfortunately Ro K there director of research at midv the Israeli Institute for regional foreign policies in Jerusalem thank you very much for your time thank you well earlier I spoke with eron lman he spent many years inside Israeli intelligence he also served on Israel's National Security Council under prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu I asked him whether Israel's soldiers are now fighting Hamas above ground or in the terrorist tunnels below well it's both um it's the bulk of the Gaza area City area is now cut off from all directions progress is very slow systematic and um designed basically to find and destroy the tunnel entrances as well as basically destroy Kamas positions and Kamas forces and create the conditions under which their command structure will be destroyed um step by step uh the IDF is were trying to fight quite carefully uh the uh there is a humanitarian Corridor still open for the people in the combat area to clear out in the direction of the South but this is a um the most complex form of warfare imaginable in a in a densely populated area and uh and uh therefore it's being T done in a very I would say uh measured pace mhm um and in with close cooperation between the uh uh the armored formations the Infantry Air Force support artillery all the elements being brought to bear uh in this uh in this battle Mr Lemon let me um get if I could your read on what has been said in just the last 24 hours um the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Israel will have overall security responsibility in Gaza indefinitely but we heard just this evening the defense minister Galant saying that neither Israel nor Hamas will govern Gaza after the war is that a contradiction in your opinion not necessarily when we speak about security responsibility it means that we are going to retain the right to prevent the emergence of any threat from Gaza uh for the indefinite future that doesn't necessar entail governance we have a reality now where we act uh in for a similar purpose in areas under Palestinian Authority control in uh in the West Bank and and uh uh we don't govern these areas but we do operate there to to ensure that they do not constitute a threat ultimately the there certainly not in no intention I believe in on the part of the Israeli government to actually govern uh Gaza um but there are going to have to be uh security Arrangements put in and for the time being it's indefinite in time because we have not yet had anyone coming up saying very clearly uh what is the the the plan the Palestinian Authority is uh simply incapable of taking over it is too weak corrupt and and has failed in governance even in the areas under it's Direct Control so the the the mission in Gaza is beyond their capacity the United Nations has the Russians and the Chinese uh we're not going to go with a un Mission so we need an alternative and it needs time and and and effort to work out with our American and and other friends how to go about it in a way which would be useful for a better future for the Palestinians in Gaza and for ourselves we heard again today from the defense minister that um the there will be no humanitarian pauses in this campaign until all of the hostages have been released I mean with that in mind the idea of getting all of these hostages brought home do that limit the scope of action that the Israeli military has in Gaza well uh right now the government is operating on the uh opposite assumption namely that the uh if we relent in terms of our military pressure Hamas will certainly play indefinitely for time and we have seen them uh uh drag us for years in negotiations over two individuals who who they hold to the uh demented person who crossed over to Gaza and the bedwin boy and uh and the bodies of two of our soldiers so we know their tactics we have no uh doubt that if we simply say okay now we settled now we stopped the fighting and we settled to negotiate it would be years before we see the hostages released so the need for the intense pressure both in terms of military operations and in terms of the uh um constraints obviously on humanitarian a no Israel family understands how it can be that a child of three is held without access to the red cross and Israel is providing humanitarian corridors into Gaza we are doing this uh uh basically out of respect to the opinions of others internationally but it is not the the government it's the people of Israel who are asking this question how can this possibly be that they're holding babies and children without any access to in even to information and we are providing humanitarian Aid yeah Mr let me ask you one question before we run out of time but we know that there have been members of the the military who have admitted to making mistakes or decisions that did not work that may have led to security breaches um on October 7th we have not heard a Maya culpa coming from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu tonight there's a rally in Jerusalem people calling for the prime minister to resign should he say that he was part of the security weakness well I believe that uh first of all um he has already said that he would also have to answer uh to what happened I believe that uh if he fails to take full responsibility uh in person uh there is bound to be a a commission of inquiry uh at the what we call at the national level not at the governmental level that is to say an independent commission led by Supreme Court Judge the way we've seen these uh option this option taken in 73 and again in 82 and again after the second Lebanon war and uh and um I think this will also have a deep political impact even people close to netan now concede that we're going to have a complete completely new political field while once the war is over Mr eron lman with the Jerusalem Institute for strategy and security we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us tonight and we appreciate your valuable insights thank you you're welcome my next guest is Assaf oron he's a former Brigadier General in the Israel Defense Force from 2010 to 2015 he served as head of strategic division in the IDF General staff's planning directorate and he's currently with the think tank The Institute for National Security studies he joins me tonight from Tel Aviv General it's good to have you with us the IDF has now divided the Gaza Strip in two is the next step the complete capture of Gaza City I think uh what we uh need to expect is the further uh infighting uh inside Gaza which is the center of gravity of the terrorist Hamas Army and governance in Gaza so what what we are seeing now is like closing in on the city of Gaza and fighting against the core of Hamas forces uh in that area do you anticipate the IDF moving into the southern part of Gaza uh we need to uh see how the camp campaign develops but this might well be part of the future phases as our leadership will assess the situation of the enemy and the need to further degrade and defeated it I'd like if you could maybe to help our viewers understand what do people need to know about how fundamentally Israel intends to reshape Gaza um and and how long is Israel prepared to take doing that I Know It uh it sounds a bit uh you know distant in a sense but uh it will uh we will do it as long as it takes because after the uh October 7th Massacre uh I think we are talking about an Israel transformed uh it is no longer uh willing uh to accept a a terror government in uh in Gaza uh being able to slaughter our uh people our communities uh to hijack and kidnap uh hostages babies toddlers uh women elderly Holocaust Survivors all of this and to hold 240 of them in Gaza as hostages uh uh we just a half an hour ago we got the evening Salvo into the Tel Aviv metropolitan area by Rockets uh we've tried for many years to deter and somewhat degrade but uh on on the whole tolerate the concept of Hamas uh Terror government in Gaza thinking that it's the least of all evils no it's not the least it's as evil as Dash and Isis and maybe worse uh the barbaric and sadist uh uh hyenas crimes and atrocities are not something that we're going to accept and under never again we are willing to pay the price and take as long as it take uh our time and efforts and our uh soldiers uh casualties and so on to remove this uh threat to our border communities and to Israel at large General you say that um there was a time when you thought that Hamas was maybe the lesser of evils um and you say it's not it's just as bad as as Isis are you pointing the finger at your prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is he guilty of allowing Hamas to Fester as long as it apparently has uh Israel faced a wicked choice between uh going into Gaza as we now do or trying to deter and some somehow uh you know get to terms uh arve at some terms with Hamas which live which allow coexistence you know the mixture between sufficient uh military action uh economic relief measures just the weeks before the hyenas attack uh we actually approved more working permits for gums in Israel I think that that Saturday put all those uh Concepts to sleep so we need to change our Paradigm we need to recognize the enemy that we are facing and we need to act appropriately if we want to live here as a democracy and our communities must be safe and not to wake up with with a pogram of jihadis uh at their doorstep and and at their the doors of their safe rooms General I I know you're a military man but let me just ask you about politics if you will for a second you say we need to change the Paradigm does that mean does Israel need to change its government change its prime minister change of leadership um most of our defense and intelligence leadership already claimed responsibility uh which means that uh in due time as the War uh subsides they will probably step down what about the Prime Minister yet to we have yet to hear it from our prime minister and I'm sure that in in a vibrant democracy like ours the public will demand its its answers and it will also pass its verdict on on the leadership responsibility and accountability of that National level unprecedented catastrophe today the Israeli defense minister Galant said that there will be no humanitarian pauses in this campaign until all hostages have been released to what extent do the hostages constrain the military's scope of action it's a very high priority uh goal for us to free them to bring about their uh release and to repatriate them back back home there are full families there Jews Arabs uh uh foreigners of of uh various Nations and we want them we want them back they're naturally uh let's say a complex situation in which the military pressure uh helps to apply pressure to the decision makers in Gaza but at the same time there's also the operational risk and Hamas likes very much to uh uh ta us and say okay your era strikes have just killed dozens of your own hostages that's part of the psychological warfare we are facing uh this this is a part and parcel of being a terrible uh Terror organization governing a piece of land uh on our border let me ask you for the the period after the the fighting has ended um after as a military arm has has been destroyed that's the stated goal here you know there remains of course the battle for the hearts and minds of Palestinians in the territory as well as in the West Bank to what extent can Israel defang the the ideology underpinning Hamas among Palestinians Israel can defang this snake from its poisonous uh teeth which are the military side or the military capabilities and the government capabilities uh it's not for Israel to compete on ideology this is intra Palestinian issue uh in in many aspects both part of uh of the Palestinian theater suffer from a leadership crisis both the PA in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza suffer a crisis of legitimacy and they each survive in its own way but if we want to deradicalize or to bring a genuine non- Jihadi ideology to the Forefront with the Palestinian Society this is for the Palestinians themselves uh to work out probably with some help of their uh Regional supporters and our own Regional Partners both the peace treaty country Jordan and Egypt and also the abraam accord's countries and maybe in the near future also Saudi Arabia General before we run out of time let me ask you I know you've you've seen the pro Palestinian demonstrations that have taken place in cities around the world mainly in North America and here in Europe there are calls for a ceasefire in Gaza those calls are growing getting louder Israel seems to be losing sympathy on the global stage How concerned are you about this it's concerning but we need to uh remind ourself of what at stake uh right now it would be better uh for the public in other countries friendly countries to be better informed not to uh get uh along this from The River To The Sea Palestine will be free or should I say Jewish free you know Jews free I don't want to translate it into German but we understand the extermination uh aspect of what Hamas is seeking to do it's saddening to see that so-called liberals and Progressive uh uh crowds are going after this uh pipe dream which seems to be all about The Liberation and freedom but it's all about genocide and and ethnic cleansing of Jews in Israel General Assaf Oran we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us tonight please come back and talk with us again thank you thank you for
