the devastating war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza means persistent danger for journalists trying to cover the conflict recent figures from the committee to protect journalists show Palestinian journalists made up the majority of all journalists killed worldwide in the past year since hamas's October 7th Terror attacks 83 Palestinian journalists and two Israeli journalists have been killed in the conflict within Gaza it's now almost exclusively Palestinians reporting on the war on the ground Israel has refused to let foreign journalists in to report independently there all those reporting from within Gaza are doing so under extremely difficult conditions there are numerous risks confronting Palestinian journalists covering the Gaza Strip particularly in the face of Israeli measures that indiscriminately Target everything Palestinian be it people trees or even stones with each new raid that happens near my family I can't help but feel an overwhelming sense of anxiety the difficulty in reaching them and ensuring their safety adds to the complexities of my situation working in this field entails navigating a mix of emotions on the one hand the focus is on reporting the news and political developments on the ground on the other hand as a human being and a journalist there's a deep desire to be with family and share in the challenges and dangers they face starting from Gaza I displaced with my family for 16 times between Gaza to kanones uh to RAF so to be honest I move my family a lot and because I try to protect my family from the isra Shilling and the isra B apartment we don't know what to do uh my uh kids they consider me I'm shelter and I'm not not while they are looking to my face they think that I'm a shelter and I'm came to protect him from the Israeli Shing they feel that um could do something for him but between me and myself I do nothing uh while I'm covering for example inside the hospital and there is uh some injury kids they are coming you know to the hospital from the Israeli Shilling it's coming to my mind this those kids could be my kids well for more now we can speak to Hassan baloa he's a journalist from Gaza who's been displaced several times and managed to leave Gaza at some point he joins us today from Aman Jordan ham as a journalist in Gaza you went through the same hardships that you were reporting on how difficult was it to do your job under these circumstances it's super difficult to be honest um for many reasons um because we are human being we are part of the conflict U we have families um to take care of um um that was the the time that I spent in Gaza uh my my main concern was about my family Their Fear uh being displaced in different places uh taking U or seeking um a safe place or a safer at least than the place that I used to be um I got displaced different places so I have to to manage um and I have to feed the family as well uh there is there was a shortage of food so I had to go and search for it it's not like normal days that everything is settled and everything is sorted out so I have to do this job by by myself um along of that we had no electricity so I had to go and to recharge my devices my laptop my um my mobile phone um there is there was problem um a huge problem of the internet connection um um I had to go and seek the signal where isit bitter in Internet so I can um know about other places in Gaza Strip and to communicate with my Outlets um and and feed them with the with the news so um um these the two main things that having a family and being Po and under danger and the same time you have to keep an eye on the news and and and send it along hasn't the number of journalists killed in this conflict is extremely high what makes it so much more dangerous to be a journalist in Gaza compared to other conflicts well Gaza is a very small place and the number of um death is among journalists is really um uh horrible uh this number is really high it's un and compared with other conflicts Gaza is very small place um people are overcrowded um it's it's it's very hot because everywhere is um is targeted there is no safe place um um or designed as like a a really 100% safe place that all people or civilians and journalists can seek um uh so wherever journalists are they they seek the news to the um um um in in in a conflict places so that's why that the number is very high and there is no I mean this war is really different um there was um in there there were um many conflicts along the years uh it's not the first war of course it's the uncomparable with the with the previous conflicts but uh this one was really hard because it's very destructive and very devastating right what's your impression C of how this conflict is being reported are news audiences getting an accurate picture in your opinion of what's going on in Gaza well this is one of the main concern that Palestinians are Palestinian journalists who are only allowed in uh to be in Gaza and and foreign media and foreign crews are not allowed to enter Gaza I mean Israel didn't allow fore media to cover the wars except one war in in the past times in 2014 um but the other conflicts they they shot the the gate and they don't allow for journalists to come in in 2008 they didn't allow them but some of them they sneaked through rough Crossing with Egypt but this time nobody allowed in uh and and nobody was there I mean like before um the warc place um um being a Palestinian covering the news and and all the time is um accused that you are biased is not easy I mean to keep uh and to keep to keep the the being objective is not is not easy Mission aome thank you very much for speaking with us again and thank you for all your reporting over these months during the war journalist hen Balia there in Aman Jordan
