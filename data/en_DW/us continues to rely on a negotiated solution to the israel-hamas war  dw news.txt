We Begin the day with an offer and a counter offer to stop the fighting in Gaza two plans leading at least for now nowhere this week a plan supported by Egypt Qatar in the US calling for a ceasefire in Gaza was presented to Hamas the response to that plan was delivered today to Israel a plan outlining how the war in Gaza could end how the hostages could be returned to Israel at the same time leaving Hamas intact this evening Israel's prime minister addressed the nation and he said the Hamas plan was a no-o and he vowed to keep fighting until Hamas is no more we are on our way to Absolute Victory the victory is in our reach it's not a matter of years or tens of years it's a matter of months continuous military pressure is necessary to bring the hostages home surrender to hamas's Preposterous conditions we heard them not only will not bring them home but will also bring upon Israel another Massacre a disaster no Israeli citizen is willing to accept DW's Middle East analyst Shaunie ranes is here at the big table with me tonight she's been following us through the evening as these developments are presented to us we weren't surprised that Netanyahu rejected this counter offer from Hamas were you surprise though that he said victory over Hamas total Destruction is Within Reach just a matter of months well it's been his line for quite some time and he's also you know he has you know if you look to internal politics in Israel he needs to boost up the soldiers he needs to show the Israel determined also it's good for the you know negotiations to toughen up your position say we're going all the way in because there's always a suspicion that maybe Israeli military and the Israeli public is getting a bit tired there's somewhat of fatigue there's a fear that maybe Hamas is waiting you know to see Israel kind of exhausted and netan needs to show that they're not going to retreat anytime soon you think that's setting in I mean we aren't five months into this war now oh there's no doubt we hear also from the Israel military that it's it's harder and harder even the forces that have been you know uh withdrawn from Gaza are not going home many of them are going are deployed in the north uh in the northern border so there's no doubt that Israel is a functioning democracy a functioning modern country cannot last for too long in this War uh however you know as long as the hostages uh situation is still out there there's also a wide uh support in the Israeli public to keep on fighting the US secet of State Anthony blink he just spent the past few days trying to to to put together to push this idea of a ceasefire in Gaza here's what he had to say about that take a listen we had an opportunity today to discuss with the Israeli government the response that Hamas sent last night to the proposal that the United States cutter and Egypt had put together uh to bring the remaining host's home and extend the humanitarian pause um what I can tell you about these discussions is that that while there are some clear non-starters in hamas's response uh we do think it creates space for agreement to be reached all right those last words there Netanyahu rejected the plan today and then we hear blinking saying there is space for an agreement to be reached do you know where that space is it's a very narrow path but I think the main contention point is the uh the demand of Hamas to for Israel to to give it consent to the end of the war well Israel is willing to go for a deal only with a suspension of the fire and if Hamas and Israel will be willing to be a bit more vague about the details of how exactly the mechanism is going to work because a big part of the deal was to start negotiating the final terms after the first immediate uh terms have been accepted for the first 45 days of of of secession of fire so as long as Israel and Hamas will be willing to focus on that first stage a bit like what we've seen also in November in that deal that we have seen back then if isra Hamas will be willing to focus on that immediate first phase maybe there is a way and this is what the Americans are hoping for to move forward without really clearly asking Israel to to make a commitment about the end of the war and for Hamas maybe to accept that these are like baby steps if you will correct this is and the Americans feel like as long as there's a process going and as long as you know there's some sort of momentum definitely the people of Gaza need this relief you know um we've seen blinkin in his talk put let great emphasis on the dire condition in Gaza the humanitarian needs and so on and also the American pressure to give more and more support to the Palestinians in Gaza about the the American influence there particularly with Israel um an analyst earlier tonight told me that he does not see the United States being able to move Israel and my question is if the United States can't do it is there another Power then that would be able to come in and bring change to this impass do you see any other actor well you know it's true that the Americans is limited with their ability but they have quite a lot of influence on Israel Israel depends on them for military supply first and foremost but far more than that not to mention you know the longlasting alliance throughout the years netan what we're seeing in netan is bringing more and more to the right the weaker he gets in the base the weaker the public support for him diminishes you know the weaker he gets the more he breaks to the right hoping to clinch to power and that of course puts him at odds with the American government that wants him to be more moderate to give more concessions it could that what will be the first Domino break to fall or to change things and Israel would actually come from within uh if the moderate forces in his Unity Coalition if they will say we're not willing to keep up with this anymore we feel like you do more politics than actually uh focusing on the goals of the war that might be the first step to move netan wasad to bring some sort of Shuffle of of power within Israel for the relief of the Americans but how much pressure is there inside I'm talk about domestic pressure on Netanyahu to to bring you know to bring the hostages home I mean to do something well the great pressure you see there's a there's a mass support for those hostages 136 of them uh many people on the street know their names know their their stories the media deals with it quite extensively but then at the same time as we were mentioning Nan's weakness turn you know he turns more and more to the right and over there we're seeing a a growing Rift between the right side of Israel saying we need to keep on fighting to the complete Victory as n was saying no matter what and more moderate left leaning uh which are not his base and he's not caring for saying bring the soldier bring the hostages now home let's deal with Hamas later and that's destabilizing Israel on the long term then still doesn't find a way how to make this all you know work and make both goals of the war bringing the hostages and defeating Kamas um simultaneously work it doesn't seem to be worth and it feels like time is running out for that correct I mean it's been four months exactly today and patience is running out all right Sha ranas as always sha we appreciate you here Studio appreciate your analysis thank you all right I want to pull in now Simon Maan he is a lecturer in international relations from Lancaster University in the UK it's good to see you again Simon let let me just ask you considering that this counter offer that came from Hamas basically would have left Hamas intact inside of Gaza I mean did Israel or did Netanyahu really have any other choice but to reject it not really given what he's been saying for the past 115 or so days he's taken a very very hard line on Hamas and hamas's continued presence in Gaza and to go back on that stance to reject his position of saying that they cannot fathom a Gaza or cannot tolerate a Gaza with a Hamas presence would be unfathomable for him and that would have serious consequences for his political Capital within Israel itself so there's a lot at stake for him what does this rejection by Israel what does it mean for its relations with the United States and I ask that considering the top Diplomat from the US the Secretary of State Anthony blinkin he has just spent the last three or four days in the region yet again trying to push this idea of a ceasefire I think it puts further pressure on an already fraud already tense relationship between the two countries and we know that it's been incredibly tense ever since the the devastating attacks of October 7 both States face a huge number of domestic pressures that are manifesting and shaping their country's foreign policies and in Israel's case it's policy towards both the US and towards Gaza and I think what the the latest round of shuttle diplomacy from Mr blinkin demonstrates is that us abilities US influence in the region really is on the Wayne and we understand that there are going to be further negotiations expected in Cairo next week what should we expect there Simon and is it is it am I being a cynic here or a pessimist when I say that um many people are not expecting any diplomatic breakthroughs there either it's hard not to be cynical in light of everything that's happened in light of continued diplomatic failings in light of a seemingly intractable political and diplomatic position taken by the various actors involved here so I think your cynicism is perhaps appropriate sadly um something needs to happen to get a diplomatic breakthrough there needs to be one for huge numbers of people the huge numbers of humanitarian reasons that that are manifesting in Gaza it is a devastating situation there it's a devastating situation for Israelis whose families continue to be held hostage breakthrough is needed I'm not sure that the US is the one to facilitate that breakthrough and I'm not sure we're going to get it in Cairo next week either do you do you see then another power that would be able to facilitate that breakthrough I me considering that what you say we've heard from other analysts as well is that the influence of the US with Israel appears to be somewhat eroded yeah I think we've seen uh Mr blinkin pushing very hard over the past three months to try and get some type of diplomatic resolution to to the the situation there and so far he's been unable to get anything really off the ground so I think what we're doing now is we're looking for other Alternatives we're looking for someone to step up whether that be Qatar whether that be China whether that be the UK someone perhaps even Germany to step up and say this situation cannot continue it cannot continue in its current for there is too much human suffering on all sides and there has to be a resolution Simon May joining us tonight from Lancaster University excellent analysis we appreciate it Simon thank you thank
