Amnesty International has said the world is seeing a near breakdown of international law it cites multiple conflicts and the rise of artificial intelligence as the main threats the annual report on human rights singles out Israel and its allies for quote multiple violations committed in Gaza It also says China and Russia are demonstrating a willingness to destroy the rules-based order the organization said there has been a betrayal of Human Rights principles by today's leaders and institutions amesty International Secretary General condemned what she called the collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza the level of violation that we have monitored is unprecedented we have certainly seen that in in Gaza over the last 6 months with an extraordinary number of victims within the civilian population with the use of famine as a weapon of war with Collective punishment imposed on Palestinians the largest number of journalists killed the largest number of humanitarian actors killed u a very unprecedented harm to civilians ever recorded So these violations are not only um extremely serious they are also Justified so Israel is justifying uh all of those violations and the United States until very recently has done the same well for more on this I'm joined Now by our special correspondent AIA Ibrahim a amnesty's report puts a spotlight on Israel's war in Gaza it also draws attention to the October 7th terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel that triggered the war uh amnesty is again urging the international criminal court to take on and investigate alleged human rights violations is all this likely to have any impact or there likely to be consequences of this well that's exactly the point of this report right is that in the face of all of these violations or alleged violations there haven't really been consequences and certainly the report highlights um the situation in in Gaza Israel's war in Gaza uh but also it talks about Ukraine and uh China and other uh world uh powers and what the report says is that because there have not been consequences we're risking the collapse of the post 1948 world uh order uh the the values that had been declared Universal back then and the belief that they work for everybody and that they work for everybody equally that's what's at stake in addition of course to the lives and livelihoods of the thousands if not millions of Innocents whose uh rights are being violated every day without consequences according to the report I looked at uh the report just the top of it and it suggests that the world is indeed regressing in terms of human right rights uh in the world um just want a quick question about Germany it's also uh singled out in this report what why is it criticized well Germany is one of the most um is the staunchest if not the strongest Ally and supporter of Israel uh in uh this War and what the German government we should specify that this is the German government's position uh historically has been is that the Germany has a special responsibility towards the Jewish people because of the crimes of the Holocaust and that that translates into support for the state of uh uh of Israel and Germany which had you forged an image of itself post second world war as a country that upholds human rights is now being accused of double standards of not being harsh enough and critical enough uh towards its Ally Israel as it commits human rights violations in in Gaza and we've seen German leaders visit Israel the United St American leaders have done the same declare time and time again their support uh for uh Israel and the war despite there being some very serious allegations of war crimes and an alleged genocide uh uh being accused uh Israel is now being accused of an alleged genocide as well and German support has been pretty strong throughout this is a big report it covers 155 countries what are your main takeaways so of course course there's the you know there's that overarching theme that uh Powers not just the United States but also Russia because of the war in Ukraine and China uh BEC because of the violations against Wagers in shinjang that these three uh Powers because of their veto uh Power in the in the UN Security Council they're the ones that are sort of accelerating this descent towards a world where Universal human rights seem to be uh uh uh meaningless and it's really um almost invites a rethinking of that world order and whether or not these three superpowers should have as much power as they do to really dictate uh you know accountability questions of accountability so the report looks at Major Powers it looks at individual conflicts but it also looks at developments in terms of Technology uh it talks a lot about artificial intelligence what does it say about that well the report definitely points the finger to Big Tech uh the lack of regulation for artificial intelligence and the way that technology could be abused to accelerate uh uh violations of human rights on one hand it says we are regressing we're going back to a a pre-1948 world at the same time we're sort of also racing towards this future with AI and with the rise of this new technology but so far that is not been uh uh regulated so it's a weird time warp we seem to be finding ourselves in yeah thank you very much uh that was our special correspondent AA Ibrahim now in the weeks following the Hamas terror attack on October the 7th last year Israeli authorities cracked down on protests that criticized Israel's milit military response while over 100 Palestinian citizens of Israel were arrested for participating in protests or posting on social media DW special correspondent armian ISF met up with the human rights lawyer Ahmed Khalifa a Palestinian citizen of Israel who was himself arrested at a protest and charged with incitement to terrorism in a small apartment in hia lawyer and activist Ahmad Khalifa is under house arrest after spending 114 days in prison it's an improvement but Khalifa says he's still essentially a prisoner that's the uncle bracelet you can see it exactly so if he steps outside the apartment with this electronic tag the police will be alerted they'll call him on this communication device and if he doesn't answer he could be held in violation and sent back to prison the worst part for Khalifa is that the court ordered him to rent an apartment outside of his hometown where his children live and go to school they can only come to visit on school holidays like today the only thing that we did is going in a de demonstration try to support the people of Gaza that uh were under 12 uh days of heavy bombing on October 19th last year Khalifa helped lead a protest in the Israeli town of um alfam where he's from they chanted slogans in support of Gaza he says not Hamas a video from that day shows him urging the crowd to remain civil soon after it began heavily armed police intervened and started arresting arrested they wanted to teach the other people a lesson by us that's why our arrest was so so cruel Khalifa was charged with incitement to terrorism and spent 3 and a half months in megiddo and gilboa prisons where he alleges he was deprived of sleep and food and was beaten by guards as a lawyer who has defended Palestinian Prisoners the experience was eye-opening I used to think that when they say physical torture the people exag exaggerate because they want to get out from jail you know but uh the stuff that we we saw there is amazing like it's real Horrors Khalifa claims that in the weeks after the October 7th Hamas Terror attacks Israel's justice system abandoned the rule of law it's like if you're not with us you're against us that that's the thing and they said it to me clearly in my investigations and it it's thing that make you think again about everything that you learned about the whole law system you you know in one night the there was no law no police no authorities and everything changed I put Khalifa's claims to Israeli authorities the Israel prison service sent me this response we are not aware of the claims you described nonetheless prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities the Israel police wrote the individual in question participated in an unauthorized Marge characterized by incitement where he assumed a leadership role the Israel police will continue working diligently to protect our citizens and will not tolerate individuals endangering Public Safety through incitement to violence or support of Terror Khalifa is hopeful that the Israeli courts will acquit him once legal proceedings wrap up his life will eventually return to normal he says but his faith in the justice system has been shaken to the core and our special correspondent Arman ISF who fil that report joins me now in the studio hi armian um tell us what is the state's case against Khalifa well he's been charged with incitement to terrorism and identification with a terrorist group this goes back to the chants that were um chanted at the protest that he helped organized uh one of them that he mentioned was Gaza will that translates roughly to Gaza will not be conquered from video we are able to hear another chant which was um there's only one thing to do push out the occupiers now both of these are being interpreted by the state as being pro Hamas Gaza will but not be conquered and being anti basically calling for um the expulsion of Jews from Israel uh so push out the occupiers but of course he himself is a lawyer um he's been to protest before he he said that he and the other organizers sat down and came up with chance that they believed would not get them in trouble because everybody was afraid that they would get in trouble and he assured the protesters that they would be safe if they chanted these chance and in the end he was arrested and uh sent to prison so Amnesty International El alleges that there has been a Crackdown on any criticism of the um Israeli state with all of the research you've done the people you've spoken to does your research back this up it seems to have been a period in October and November when there was a zero tolerance policy uh for any kind of anti-israel um protest now don't forget that the anti- uh government protest have been tolerated that's against Netanyahu and his government but anything that's perceived as being anti-state or anti-military anti- operation in Gaza there was a major Crackdown on this in October and November um the state itself said the official figures that 140 indictments were put out against people for protests or social media posts adala which is a Human Rights group said that they counted 270 indictments arrests or warning talks 95% of these were Palestinian citizens of Israel so not Jewish Israelis but Palestinian citizens of Israel uh we did I met with one uh Jew Israeli um mayor Baran who was arrested and he was spent four days in prison but he himself said that the Palestinian citizens have it worse um most were for social media posts um and in every case I've seen it was for instances of speech or protests that could be interpreted as being against the state or against the military but uh something that in Germany or the US uh would not have been punished with prison time anyway okay and what is the legal basis for this Crackdown the legal basis is a 2016 counterterrorism law but of course the enforcement of that law uh a lot of human rights groups say has been political uh in ahmad's case um also mayor buan the Jewish Israeli they said that it was because there was local authorities far right or who had a grievance against them and were using this time in October to settle a score Ahad uh Khalifa is an activist and he did a lot of work about police violence so the police didn't really like him and he thought they were settling a score with him we weren't be able to ver we couldn't verify that but another thing that human rights groups are saying is that um this goes back to the national security minister itamar benav who is one of the most far-right members of uh the uh government in Israel and he is in charge of law enforcement he's in charge of the Israel prisons and in charge of the police and they say that his influence has had a chilling effect on Free Speech because of the way that the police and the prisons are able to enforce these things now don't forget the uh the um Supreme Court has thrown out a lot of these cases but the chilling effect is still there when you get thrown in prison even if you're not uh convicted anything amen thank you so much that's DW's special correspondent armian
