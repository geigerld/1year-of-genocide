us defense secretary Lloyd Austin says the White House paused a large shipment of bombs to Israel he said the decision was due to opposition to Israel's plans to assault Rafa in southern Gaza Austin told a US Senate hearing the Biden Administration was concerned about Israel launching a major offensive in Rafa without a plan to protect civilians there meanwhile Israel continues to bombard the city the Army says it's conducting a limited operation to kill Hamas Fighters and dismantle the group's remaining infrastructure here's more from the US defense secretary as he addressed that Senate hearing so we we've been very clear Senator as you know from the very beginning that um that Israel shouldn't launch a a major attack in arafa without accounting for uh and protecting the civilians that are in that battle space uh and and again as we have uh assessed the situation uh we paused one shipment of high high uh payload Munitions um and U and again I I think we've also been very clear about U the steps that we'd like to see uh uh Israel take to to account for and take care of those civilians before uh major combat uh takes place we certainly would like to see no major combat take place in Rafa but uh but certainly our focus is on making sure that we protect the civilians and we again we've not made a final determination on how to proceed with the uh with that shipment Let's cross over to our correspondent Benjamin Alvarez in Washington DC Benjamin good to see you again now we heard the US defense Chief there what else has the Biden Administration said about the whole matter the state department vo what it call is a very serious concern over a widespread rough operation and what that would mean for the civilian population there spokesperson Matthew Miller said this was made clear with their Israeli counterparts on several level and the state department said it passed one shipment of military assistant and is reviewing others while also adding quite similar to what we just heard from Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin there that the long-term commitment to Israel has not changed so definitely in line also with those remarks saying that the US will continue to ensure what he calls is Israel's means to defend itself so that's also what his secretary of defense Lloyd Austin said that comes as a time where a high stake report is looming over the White House over President Biden on whether Israel has violated International humanitarian law during its war in Gaza a report that has led to intense debates for months across the administration and and has even led to divisions inside the state department but the state department already said that it will not meet today so Wednesday's deadline to send this report to Congress saying whether the US administrations find the assurances by the Israeli government credible and reliable and the spokesperson today only spoke about a brief delay without giving an exact data for the publishment of this highly anticipated report what does this move tell us about the US commitment to Israel and its goals in the war this new decision is the latest sign of a growing Rift between both governments but there has been a number of of of allies in Biden's Democratic party in Congress that have for weeks and month have urged him to limit or hold arms shipments to Israel something that he has refused to do until now and the fact that the Washington finally did so shows how big the frustration is among the administrations in Washington here that the Israeli counterparts are not hearing the warnings about the us against a major operation in raffer many are applauding this move saying that the US is finally using its leverage as the biggest arms exporter to Israel that was DW correspondent Benjamin alvarus in Washington thank you so much hjob Schindler is the senior director of the counter extremism project and joins us now from New York welcome back to DW do you think Israel can achieve its goal of dismantling Hamas through an assault on Rafa thank you so much for having me unfortunately the sad truth is that without some kind of military operation in Rafa it will be impossible for uh the dismantling or at least the more or less long-term removal of Hamas as an ongoing terrorist concern in Rafa at the moment the leadership in Gaza Strip of Hamas is located there are still some deports there there's still a very active panel Network there there have been attacks out of Rafa against Israeli forces including uh border crossing so yes unfortunately some type of military operation needs to be conducted in Rafa and the spat between the US and the Israeli government is not on the if it's on the how this military operation supposed to be conducted M 7 months after October 7th to what extent um as far as you're concerned has Israel been able to diminish hamas's capabilities oh the Israeli government has significantly di diminished hamas's physical capabilities so the tunnel Network in other parts of Gaza are pretty much destroyed they did arrest and eliminate quite a large number of Palestinian Hamas Fighters they were able to get some of the hostages out through negotiations very handful but that's to be expected via military operations only but if the leaders are staying intact if there is a part of the tunnel Network that stays intact if there are some functioning Hamas military units which are now concentrated in Rafa the time for Hamas to reconstitute itself as a major terrorist threat to Israel is really diminished which essentially means all that Hamas has to do is to survive in order to win this country the kind of elimin ating that possibility of Hamas surviving is what Israel has set out to do but looking at it more long term How likely is you know the suffering the death the destruction that we've seen in Gaza uh since this military operation was launched to fuel further anti-israeli sentiment and extremism in the region that then could could backfire against Israeli security interests once more yeah I mean unfortunately it's really clear that the competing aim of eliminating Hamas as a terrorist concern you cannot eliminate an ideology of course and freeing the hostages are really in somewhat of a contradiction because the hostages are the survival guarantee for the Hamas leadership so I doubt that they would ever be willing to give up even all of the hostages um unless there is some kind of an agreement that the leadership is allowed to leave with their heads attached from Gaza the problem with the suffering is Hamas is causing this extremely deliberately it is part of the Hamas strategy from the beginning of this conflict from the 7th of October to highlight the suffering that is caused by the military conflict as much as possible in order to increase the political pressure on Israel to stop military operations before its physical Terror in infrastructure and its leadership is completely incapable of operating again so it's part of the Hamas strategy um but if Israel would stop before harfa is concern is is dealt with then there would be a major major problem um as far as the terrorist threat from Hamas in the near future so unfortunately the Israeli government is between a rock and a hard place here let's look at the how then if and as you say this this operation is inevitable to to reach the goal um that Israel has here the US has ramped up pressure on Israel by halting arms deliveries or one of their deliveries how does that impact Israel's position in Gaza as well as in Cairo where ceasefire negotiations are underway well first of all it's important to understand that when the big deal was signed that also had the billions for Ukraine there were $680 million US dollar for Israel Aid including humanitarian aid but also weapons that deal is untouched what they have paused is the delivery of very large ordinance 2,000 pound bombs and equipment that make dumb bombs into smart bombs also of the larger variety something that you really shouldn't use in a dense urban area like Raa if you do a military operation there to eliminate terrorist organization so it is a very much a clear political signal because it's very unusual for the US Administration to hold arms deliveries to Major allies beat Ukraine or beat Israel so it's a very clear political signal militarily for the way that the Americans want this um operation to be conducted very targeted very very careful um with extreme care for any collateral damage that may be caused you wouldn't need those bombs in any case so where does that leave Israel then in the negotiations in Cairo well Hamas has made a very smart move in in its public propaganda with accepting 80 um the problem is that the deal that Hamas accepted was not the deal that the Israel is prior if you remember this steal has been banking around for a while um priorly accepted so they added some Clauses of course it's easy to basically say I accept the deal that I rewrote so that it fits my needs but in the negotiations both sides need to be able to agree to the all of the provisions in the deal not just some of the provisions and so we are still in this back and forth phase but very skillfully Hamas has now batted the ball back into the Israeli court and makes it harder for the Israeli government now to argue because of course the details of the deals cannot be made public in a negotiations like this that now this deal has changed and they have to renegotiate but the negotiations are still ongoing there is an Israeli delegation in Cairo as we speak so we're not at the end of the process but it was a quite smart public relations move by Hamas what do you think a deal could look like because as you say Hamas has agreed to something that is a non-starter for Israel yet the White House says that there is some light at the end of the tunnel that a deal could be within reach yes I mean there certainly we've seen that a deal is generally possible fairly soon after uh the war of Hamas against Israel started when hostages were released now even at the time it was clear the next round is going to be much much harder because we are now talking primarily about Military Officers and soldiers of the Israelis um and of course as I said Hamas will hold back some of the hostages um to guarantee the survivability at least of its key leaders zva and Dave in Gaza that's pretty clear now so what is achievable is that hopefully the majority of the remaining hostages will be relieved against the release of some Palestinian prisoners and Israel has been quite flexible on that point how many prisoners what type of crimes these prisoners are accused of in in the negotiations the last couple of weeks however all of the hostages in one go I really doubt that as I said it is the survival guarantee for the Hamas leadership so some will unfortunately very likely stay back fascinating insights our security expert Hans yakob shinda thank you so much for your input thank you so much
