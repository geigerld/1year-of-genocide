well Israel is a Jewish state but it's also home to a mixed population that includes about 20% ethnic Arabs many of whom identify as Palestinians and they often face discrimination with tensions in the region once again flaring one group of activists in Israel is trying to promote solidarity across ethnic lines DW's a Ibrahim reports tonight from hia a sight to behold this room contains right now Palestinians and Jews who actually in the darkest most polarizing most difficult moment in the history of the two peoples right now is choosing to like actually work together they want to send a message they feel cannot be repeated enough millions of Palestinians will remain here and millions of Jewish people will remain here and that's a fact this meeting at AOS and hia is organized by standing together a Grassroots peace movement made up of Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel activists tell me such togetherness has been rare since the October 7th Hamas attacks and that often demonstrations of solidarity in either direction are met with rejection we have friends we have neighbors we have peers we have colleagues who are Jewish who got deeply impacted by this and and we we were devastated um but by the ATT uh but even that was not something that was fully accepted by a lot of the Jewish public oh you're hurting for us now but so you can't say you can't identify as Palestinian we do suffer um calls for violence from being called being a traitor from inment against us Jewish people that are working towards peace that are working to build solidarity um among Jews and Palestinians the fact that we are even unable to fully experience and grief our people um is is like the it's like the the epitome of our psychosis and our experience as Palestinians in Israel like I'm literally unable to fully grief my people while also like like you're like on a mission to convince people you're human like [Music] um people here believe deepening divisions in Israeli Society make it all the more important to meet and to show empathy with one another so they put that empathy quite literally center stage in defiance of local right-wing groups which tried to get the event cancelled it's happening under tight security it's more than just talk though volunteers visit places where Muslims and Jews work together like this hospital near hia they handed out thank you cards to staff written in Arabic and Hebrew Tamara assadi is a Palestinian Israeli teacher who works at a predominantly Jewish school it is important for me to be a role model for my students for my country and everyone around me the visit is happening 1 month after the October 7th terror attack it's so important to Mark to remark the fact that we are together in the staff here and many other places we are doing very very naturally together togetherness naturally togetherness what about jewi people like yourself back at the assembly I ask Alan Lee green if he feels their movement speaks for the majority in Israeli Society no but do all the society the majority of society have the interest of the direction we want to go I think the answer is yes after the speeches attendees break up into small groups they brainstorm more practical ways they might spread their message and to convince more of their fellow Israelis to see each other the way they do an inspiring story there my first guest tonight is Omar bartov he's a professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University and the author of numerous books on war genocide and anti-Semitism he has written on how the memory of the Holocaust informs contemporary Israeli politics in an opinion piece for the New York Times last week entitled what I believe as a historian of genocide Mr bov wrote that we know from history that it is crucial to warn of the potential for genocide before it occurs rather than belatedly condemn it after it has taken place I think we still have that time Mr bov joins me tonight from Cambridge Massachusetts in the US it's good to have you with us Mr bartov um you obviously Advocate a proactive approach stop genocide before it starts do you see the Genesis of genocide in Gaza right now uh yes thank you for having me um yes I think that we are very close to um a a humanitarian catastrophe we may be seeing ethnic cleansing as we speak and that combined with the massive disproportionate uh killing of civilians may become genocide you also write that the urge to label all atrocious events as genocide tends to obfuscate reality rather than explain it so this urge is that what we are seeing in these Mass protests here in Europe and on University campuses in the United States a a rush to to judge or label something before the crime has been committed yes that's true that's the other problem with um with the term genocide you know this term was uh uh coined in the in the mid-40s and then became part of a UN resolution in 1948 and it's a very specific crime and um on the one hand it is important to as you cited me writing it's important to warn about the potential of genocide before it happens because after it happens it's obviously too late but at the same time there's a tendency because this is considered to be the crime of crimes the worst crime one can imagine uh to label anything that is atrocious that is terrible that we object to uh as genocide and I think that tends to obfuscate things rather than to clarify them I I understand that the the legal or the academic definition of genocide I understand that those are important but um one could say or ask does it matter I mean the legal definitions they mean little when the images of human suffering on a tremendous scale tell us that seeing is believing what do you say to that I think it does matter you know I mean in war um many words uh civilians uh are killed and there's a great amount amount of suffering if you think for instance uh during the um during World War II uh the massive bombing of Germany in which hundreds of thousands of Civilian uh German civilians were killed um that was a war against Nazi Germany uh Nazi Germany was carrying out a genocide the United States and Britain uh that were conducting strategic bombing which might have been defined subsequently was not but could have been as war crimes were're not engaged in genocide so when you show images as such um and images of suffering people you need to contextualize them to know what how to distinguish between one event and another it's also important simply because we need to know if we are sliding toward that event toward genocide crimes against humanity war crimes ethnic cleansing or not and showing those images on on their own is not sufficient to make that determination you know being able to contextualize anything it requires um patience time and also a knowledge of History do you think in our social media world that we live in right now um a news uh um clock that is on 247 do we have those U qualities today well no obviously not I what we are seeing you know still going back to the war the Russian invasion of Ukraine and now the war in Gaza um you find that people um have short memories they haven't studied history and they are dependent a great deal on social media which not only gives them only only tiny little segments of information but often keeps them in a bubble of the kind of information that they want to hear uh and and that unfortunately doesn't help us know how to act in any given situation I'm sure you're aware that um Germany has pledged full support for Israel the German Chancellor Olaf Schultz he repeated that pledge today take a listen to what he said Israel has every right to defend itself against Hamas and to attack those who are active as Hamas fighters in Gaza it's unaccept that Hamas should again have the opportunity to reestablish itself gather weapons and attack Israel and that's why we are clear on this issue and stand by Israel's side Mr bov when you hear those words no consider that and consider the people that I've spoken with this week I spoke yesterday with the author Nathan thr he and the german-american author Deborah Feldman they both put forth the observation that Germany's commitment to isra isra's survival and security leaves no room for any criticism of Israel's government and its policies in fact in Germany often criticism of the Israeli state is tantamount to anti-Semitism what are your thoughts about that look I mean I I grew up in Israel I I grew up surrounded by holoc survivors I became a German historian and I saw how Germany shifted uh in the 1980s from um generally denying any individual responsibility or even Collective responsibility for the Holocaust to creating this Memorial culture which is very important so um from that perspective and also as an Israeli I can say I agree with what the chancellor says as far as uh Israel right in fact duty to defend itself and its citizens that is not the question and I think it's very nice that the chancellor says that but Germany is a very powerful country and big player on the European scene and defending yourself from atrocity responding to atrocity doesn't mean that you should do it yourself and here I think Germany could play an important role first of all in pointing out that Israel is is engaging now in what probably looks like uh war crimes um so that's that's the to me a important point it's true that there is now a culture in Germany where it is very difficult to criticize Israel without being accused of anti-Semitism I've encountered that myself in Germany in the United States I think that's nonsense of course I mean you should be able to criticize a country's policies without uh doubting its right to exist which of course Israel has like any other country but Mr BR do you really think that it's realistic for a a German Chancellor or a German government to go public with with that statement that we support Israel but we think what the government doing right now um could constitute a war crime do you think that Germany would really ever ever dare to say that I think it will I mean I think there's actually a growing shift in public opinion in Germany which is not yet reflected in its a political in many ways also intellectual Elites but I think we're seeing that shift in Germany we're seeing that shift in the United States a younger generation is coming to the for and they're much more critical of Israel I I actually worry that um this will create a sort of backlash against Israel which I would not like to see I I would like to see um um realistic criticism of Israeli policies at the same time I would like that to influence Israel to change his policies so that he would not be subjected to this right now just criticism do you think Germany's approach to this rise in anti-Semitism is the right approach we got we've seen some pro- Palestinian demonstrations for example they have been banned due to fears of anti-jewish and pro-islamist strains being given a public platform do you think that's the right approach no I think it's excessive and and there's also a tendency in Germany not only in Germany to to associate um uh demonstrations against Israeli policies with the Arab or Muslim uh elements in society which which actually ties in with all kind of prejudices in in German society as in other European societies there is a a Neo-Nazi a powerful right-wing Neo-Nazi movement in Germany right now and they're about as anti-semitic as anybody can be so in some ways this focus on that part of society reflects prejudices in German society which are camouflaged by a a um sort of support for Israel uh so no I I don't think it's the right approach of course Germany and all other countries should uh respond to anti-Semitism uh anti-Semitism is a vile sentiment but not all criticism is anti-Semitic on social media we see lots of people talking about the just the sheer number of people who seem to be moved by what is happening in Gaza and Israel and they posed the question why were there no Mass demonstrations when Bashar al-assad's regime was killing countless civilians during the Civil War there why were there no protest or why are there no protest against the Iranian regime and its treatment of women W with that in mind do you think that it's possible that there is too much Focus or even a fetishization of the Israeli Palestinian conflict possibly even you know how it pertains to genocide look there is I mean it's a it's a complicated uh history right I mean Israel was created right after the Holocaust so there is uh in Europe in the United States a a particular attitude toward Israel both a sensibility to its safety and um sort of sensibility to what it does when it does something wrong uh but Israel also has presented itself always as the only democracy in the Middle East and so if it wants to be part and it was moving toward becoming part really of Europe uh it wants to be part of that Universe it has to be measured by different standards than the the the tyrannical regime of Bashar al-assad or of the Iranian regime we don't expect much of those regimes but we do from Israel because it presents itself as such and it should I think it's it's the right thing but then you have to be also willing to be subjected to a different set of standards and criteria as to the way you behave Mr Omar B we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us tonight very enlightening discussion thank you we hope you come back have a good evening thank thank you very much good
