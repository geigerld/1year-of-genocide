the UN agency helping refugees in Gaza says it will be forced to Halt its operations there today unless more fuel is delivered it says its supplies will run out later today a fourth Convoy of 28 trucks arrived in Gaza early Wednesday after crossing the border from Egypt but Israel's military is refusing to allow fuel into Gaza it's accusing the militant group Hamas which runs the territory of hoarding supplies the fuel shortage is hindering emergency services that are already stretched to the Limit staff in this Hospital in Gaza City are working around the clock to help those hit by the ongoing air strikes rushing to help people severely injured and also in a Race Against Time before critical supplies run out the water pressure is so low it they are unable to uh operate the a central sterilization machine that we use to sterilize our surgical equipment and the electricity keeps cutting out and we're completely dependent on the fuel which I understand is no longer coming in doctors are under pressure to conserve whatever little water and fuel supplies they have for the electric generators that many hospitals are now relying on Aid is now beginning to trickle into Gaza but Israel says they still have reason to block the transport of fuel supplies we are aware that Hummers needs fuel they need it badly for their military infrastructure after they stole all the fuel from unra we'll discuss the issue of the fuel with the world and if the hospitals are in Peril Hamas are the first to ask that hummas resupply the fuel to the hospitals and to the poor residents the world must demand this from the UN says that they may have to Halt their aid operations if the situation is not resolved quickly fuel is extremely urgent because without fuel the trucks themselves cannot uh move without fuel the generators cannot produce electricity for hospitals for bakeries and for the water desalination plants the White House has said it is working with with its Partners in the Middle East to push for fuel to be allowed into Gaza for the citizens of Gaza time is running out Ahmed bam is from the Norwegian Refugee Council that's an independent humanitarian organization that's operating in Gaza he gave me the latest information about the situation there actually I just listened to a message from my colleague in Gaza who was telling me um about the situation there and how amilies don't have time to grieve the people they lost yesterday because they are losing more people today more relatives more parents um my colleague um probably that you know he has a partial answer to to your report on on fuel had to look for one liter of petrol um for four hours before he could find some in his friend's car that he siphoned out to use for for a water tank so that children can can drink or wash um the situation I gave you an update last night it's got much worse since last night 700 people have been killed including 300 children the Mayhem has to stop the Carnage has to stop and uh people are being collectively punished an entire population here is suffering from an unprecedented humanitarian crisis what what can your organization actually do to help the people in Gaza in in the current circumstances very little I mean I I know a lot is expected from Aid agencies such as ours the Norwegian Refugee council is on the ground we have 54 people on the ground we have provided some cash assistance for people so they can go to the to the supermarket and get whatever they can get but we can't do much uh much more without without the you know the the crossing opening sustainably uh sufficiently I mean we're having a handful of trucks a dozen or two dozen trucks every day this is nowhere near enough for Aid agencies to operate un is saying that they might shut down their operations because they're running out of fuel um AG workers are still getting killed our staff on the ground have been displaced they have suffered loss and damage to um their homes um so yeah I mean a Aid agencies need that support enable to to be able to bring Aid in and give it to the people who are in need we know that you know parts of Gaza have literally been flattened critical infrastructure has been destroyed of course Israel is saying it is doing this to destroy Hamas but the effects on the people as things stand do you see these all of these internally displaced Palestinians ever being able to return to their neighborhoods or or or will they need to make a home elsewhere this is this is a question that will will take a lot of personal um calculations I mean of course what happened a couple of weeks ago when Israel ordered the the you know the relocation of people we want on that day that this would be a grave uh breach of international law which prevents prohibits the forcible relocation of people now they have relocated and just to say they are being bombed where they are being relocated again my colleague told me how homes in southern Gaza were being you know you know homes that are Sheltering dozens of families are being struck and hit constantly um over the night um there is no safe space in in Gaza and there's no way we can portray any spot in Gaza or say tell people that you know this is going to be um safe from bombings people have to have the agency to make their choices have to be supported to rebuild have to be supported to to recover so no we're not for the forcible relocation of people we are with people um you know giv a safe shelter given a home uh wherever they choose to be we are right in the center of this right in the middle of this crisis right now and as you're saying it is getting worse by the day but looking ahead do you see any chance that this you know this massive escalation of a long running conflict could produce any Solutions in the long term I mean just the you know the the question itself tells me that the International Community has suddenly become helpless in finding a a a peaceful resolution to this this is a failure that we haven't seen in you know um in other places um it's almost inevitable it feels from the International Community that yes civilians will be killed and and this should not be accepted this should should be unacceptable um and I think one thing that um International Powers those who have who can exercise pressure on Israel can do at the moment is to call for an instant humanitarian pause there can never be a solution a bloody solution to any conflict let alone um you know a a punishment of an entire population in order to get uh military uh military outcomes so no they there can't be a solution with violence violence has to stop has to end now and lives have to be spared I'll end on a note that you know my my colleague again tells us that there is no person in Gaza who's not traumatized by what is happening and there is a chance they will take years to recover from this ahed Bam from the Norwegian Refugee Council thank you so much for your time let's talk to Michael fakri who's the UN special Porter on the right to food welcome to DW uh we're now on the third day of a deliveries to Gaza deliveries to a war zone which are now a fraction of what they were were before the war broke out how do you decide where those supplies go so I'm not in a position really to make that decision I'm an independent expert with the United Nations But ultimately what's important is that civilians are not receiving essential food water fuel and medical supplies so there's a there's a full Siege against all civilians and Palestinians so what we need is the influx of basic necessities as soon as possible to all civilians in Gaza and so how will the work of the UN and other Aid agencies be affected by the Israeli decision uh to stop granting visas to un Representatives what's going to happen is this uh this disaster is going to get worse on Thursday uh UN Human Rights experts among uh myself included raised the alarm we're very worried about the risk of genocide that's the degree of the humanitarian uh concern here what's happening is people are on the brink of starvation so if un uh workers if the United Nations is not able to get in if United Nations officers are denied visas this is this is a Lifeline for people uh in Gaza I just want to be clear that the but we all we're all uh understanding you clearly you say that Gaza is on the brink of genocide genocide defined how committed by whom against whom yes so of course genocide has a very specific legal meaning first of all there's the physical aspect what's being hap what's happening is Israel um is responding to the illegal attacks by Hamas so Hamas illegally uh has targeted civilians but the response by Israel has been to illegally uh Target homes churches hospitals and to call for a Complete Siege of Palestine so there's also the intent what we hear from political leaders in public from Israel is the intent to lay full Siege and to punish all civilians um and there's also been from the Minister of Defense from Israel describing Palestinians as human animals so there's degrading language so there's both evidence of escalating physical damage of and and mass uh killing of civilians and and the blocking of the basic necessities of life of using starvation and food as a weapon of War what makes it specifically the issue of genocide and we're worried that Israel is uh at the risk of of causing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza is also the intent the the language that's coming out of Israel and I should add from its allies so third parties have an obligation to prevent genocide as well we've raised the alarm we the alarm at the general assembly and the Human Rights Council so you said that Israel you've accused Israel of illegally targeting homes churches and hospitals they would say that they are targeting Hamas who are using civilians as human Shields I let me Begin by saying there is no exception to genocide there's no excuse there's no legal exception and there's no moral exception I understand that Hamas has attacked Israel and has targeted civilians this is wrong and this contravenes International humanitarian law and international human rights law however the response must be proportional and there's no excuse to this degree of targeting civilians as we're witnessing in Gaza and and again just because you you you keep saying that they are targeting civilians because I know that they will say and I will be speaking uh to a representative of the IDF later he will say something along the lines of we are targeting Hamas targets who who place themselves uh under or near civilians so the and they will they will describe the the loss of of Civilian lives as problematic and unfortunate but they will say that they do not Target civilians thank you for clarifying the question what's what's also happening is a Siege there's the blocking of of food water and fuel maybe they'll say that fuel is I heard the report previously let's focus on food and water my mandate is on the right to food Security Council resolution 2417 is very clear you cannot use uh the starvation as a weapon in armed conflict nor can you deny uh the access to humanitarian Aid in a conflict these are clearly clearly illegal I'm not sure how water and food that are the basic necessities of life for thousands and thousands uh over 2 point over 2 million civilians over a million are children I'm not sure how uh the weaponization of food and the denial of humanitarian relief has anything to do with uh responding to Hamas that's very clear thank you so much for that Michael fakri our un special raor on the rights to food thank
