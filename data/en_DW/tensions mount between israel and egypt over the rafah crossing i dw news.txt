hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled the city of Rafa as Israeli forces intensify their military operation there neighboring Egypt has now told the United States that Israel's actions in Gaza are jeopardizing Regional security foreign minister Sam shukri discussed the need to restart Aid deliveries to Gaza in a phone call with Secretary of State Anthony blinkin the two also discussed the Israeli seizure of the Palestinian side of the Rafa border crossing Cairo says the presence of Israeli troops and tanks violates 2007 treaty Israel's move has exacerbated simmering tensions between Egypt and Israel so much so that Egypt has announced it will formally support a case brought by South Africa at the international court of justice accusing Israel of committing genocidal acts in Gaza let's bring in journalists Kareem El gawari in Cairo and balik sadine in Tel Aviv good to see you both let's start with you kareim it's Egypt's decision to join the J case a direct result of Israel seizing the Rafa border well what is clear is that the Egyptian side is very very angry they asked for weeks Netanyahu not to do an incursion into Rafa they pleaded to the Americans to stop this idea now it's happening since days Israeli operations in the immediately area of the Egyptian border and even at the Egyptian border cross Crossing of Rafa with Israeli tanks and soldiers stationed there and famous pictures of Israeli tanks pointing their barrels towards the Egyptian s so a lot of Egyptian anger and basically two answers the first answer was that the Egyptian s suspended the security cooperation at the immediate border area with the Israeli Army that of course has an effect on the AIDS coming from the Egyptian side to the Gaza Strip because that has to be coordinated between the Israeli Army and the Egyptian side and the second thing as you mentioned um that Egypt joined the case of South Africa at the international court of justice in the H um where Israel is accused of genocide so a lot of Egyptian anger yeah the second one a more symbolic one what does this tell us about the state of relation between Egypt and Israel current well they are very frosty right now I I would say I mean the Egyptians are saying basically that the Israeli incursion into Rafa violates existing treaties between the two countries where there is stated that there should be some kind of demilitarized zone in the immediate border area where there are no heavy Weaponry where's no heavy Weaponry allowed the Egyptians say this is now violated and in a way I mean this is of course don't forget Egypt and uh and Israel this is the oldest peace treaty between an Arab country and the Israeli side came David 1979 and we might come to the point where this is it at a disposal so that for Israel after the foundation of Israel and the 67 War and the gaining of occupied territories the Camp David peace treaty is maybe the biggest achievement of the Israel State and that might be at the end even at risk in this whole thing we're seeing right now B let's hand it over to you so Egypt is saying that the seizing of the Rafa Crossing violates security agreements between Egypt and Israel so why is Israel so keen on holding the Rafa Crossing well if the question is why so keen on holding the Rafa Crossing it's obvious that wants to make sure that there are no smuggling of any weapons from the sin penia inside Gaza at any point in the future but Israel after all doesn't want to hold it forever and this is the main point here uh a report today in Israel said that Israeli officials asked the pa the Palestinian Authority to take control at least unofficially for the Rafa and they refuse because they don't want to um um do it before the end of the war which means maybe they don't want to do it before the end of the war because they don't want Hamas to attack them and this whole idea of the Egyptian narrative that they are uh doing this as a result of the Israeli operation in Rafa doesn't really align with the fact that Israel according to many officials did coordinate with the Egyptians this um uh uh operation limited one uh to say uh um for months now so this is a very weird that the Egyptians are taking these tips right now especially after the coordination well they say they are angered and the two countries as Kareem pointed out have a long history of security cooperation um that is very beneficial for both countries um how worried are Israeli officials over the tensions with Egypt well we can say obviously there's a lot of frustration between the two parties right now but I talked to security officials today they told me that they see this as a lip service uh um by the Egyptians because after Israel um uh entered Rafa Crossing and Israeli flags with the tanks were uh very close to Egypt they want to calm the anger from the Egyptian public that's why they are now participating in this uh um uh case against Israel in the ha and then then um the officials saying that uh Israel or excuse me Egypt just just doesn't want Israel to expand the operation in Rafa because their red line is obviously the uh gazans to actually go through the crossing to the Sinai penena this is the red line for Egypt so they want to pressure Israel by doing this not to expand the operation that is taking place right now in Rafa so kareim what can Egypt do about all of this about Israel Crossing its red lines and you know the presence of Israel troops on the Rafa border would they risk suspending the peace treaty with Israel I mean for them it's to wait and see when there is a time to they can exert pressure on the Israeli side because don't forget Israel needs the Egyptians as mediators between Israel Hamas and the US this is the role they were playing all the last weeks so this will continue and the second thing is also that the Israel needs probably Egyptians for the day after and right now of course we don't have any idea what the day after looks like I mean Netanyahu told us that when he will go to Rafa there is four Hamas battalions which we he has to destroy and then the war will be over now the war is flared up in the north again in in jabalia so it's all one big mess and I guess I guess as long as stays to be such a mess Egypt will stay out of any kind of post-war role within the Gaza Street balik we don't have much time but I do want to talk about the day after does the Israeli government believe there is an end game in Gaza which doesn't involve heavy Egyptian participation well this is exactly the main point of this agreement not only between Israel and Egypt also between Israel and the Americans nanahu even today said it that there will be no discussion about the day after unless there is a full disarmament of Hamas and total Destruction of Hamas in Gaza a lot of critics critics are saying that Natan can't take that decision because of the right-wing hardliners in his cabinet and in his uh government in general and as I see it in the current formation of the Israeli government and Coalition this can be done there can be uh uh the uh wishful thinking or the the wish that Egypt wants which is the PA controlling all of Gaza so this is the main point of this agreement for now kareim and balik thank you so much to both of you
