Fierce fighting is continuing in the Gaza Strip Israel's military says it has carried out aerial strikes on over 300 Hamas Targets in the past 24 hours these images show K yunus in the south of the territory strikes have also been reported in the north of the Gaza Strip Hamas appointed officials say scores of civilians have been killed let's bring in Ahmed bam here he's a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council joins us from the Jordanian Capital Aman thanks for being with us Ahman we're looking at a pause of at least 4 days here in the fighting uh in in Gaza how much Aid can organizations like yours achieve uh how how much relief can you provide in that amount of time good morning Terry um not much the answer is um we have been even you know during these you know as we speak we are delivering eight on the ground very limited in in our capacity um in our ability to to move around shelters we do manage three sites where we have hundreds of people who have taken shelter we're providing hot meals and you know some water for people and some cash assistance for people uh this is a fraction of what we can really do if we have the right conditions during these four you know four days I mean this is this is also very little time for us um just to give you an example we have have 10 trucks of Aid that are waiting to be delivered into Gaza 4 days is not enough given the administrative uh given the logistical given the screening that you know the aid has to go through it's a long process it has to drive you know a bottle of water has to travel over 100 kilometers before it can make its way into Gaza this is very little time for everyone this is why we are saying 4 days of um you know a pause is is nowhere near enough we need a long sustained uh SE Seas fire so our teams on the ground 50 of them or more at the Norwegian Refugee Council can go out and deliver and and provide much needed Aid to talk to us more about uh delivering that Aid because uh we can get maybe aund a few hundred trucks into Gaza during this uh pause in the fighting but it has to be distributed what's your plan for Distributing the aid that does get into Gaza yes um as of now we do rely on the Gaza Market because we hav't managed to bring in any trucks for the reasons of I've just given it has been very complicated and and you know a very low volume of trucks compared to the actual meat has been able to pass through what we need on the ground uh what we plan to do is to deliver hot um hot meals to deliver shelter support for people in shelters blankets mattresses pillows for The Hundreds who have you know left their homes with nothing on them uh pure I mean drinking water as well is a big challenge we can't do this without the fuel without um without the guarantees that our uh you know our Aid workers uh will be able uh to operate safely not just us of course everyone else I think the needs on the on the ground are so massive you're talking about the heavily wounded who are you know who are waiting for treatment for surgeries uh you are talking about children who are traumatized by this what we are saying don't give these children safety so you only take it away from them in a few days keep it safe and keep that ceasefire going now many organizations and governments welcome the humanitarian ceasefire deal of course but uh they're calling for a longer term solution here how optimistic are you ammed about reaching such a solution in this case um I would say it seems that the political will has managed to achieve a breakthrough it looks like pressure has been exerted on all sides to come to an agreement to release hostages and to bring Aid in what what does stop it from what does stop these you know uh big powers from achieving a long Seas fire I think with the right political will we can come to an agreement um we appeal to the US to the EU countries and also to Arab countries in the gulf and to Egypt to um continue that pressure because clearly um you know that it has worked this time um for for you know we have been able to put civilians interests uh here but not very long what we need is that you know these Powers continue to exert um you know with diplomacy their pressure on the countries on on Israel obviously and on the armed groups in Gaza to agree to a longer ceasefire we are hopeful we we never lose hope in humanity um again we saying children think of children children and think of their families that the thousands who have been killed they deserve um you know they deserve some safety and sense of morality now Ahmed thank you very much for talking with us that was Ahmed Bam from the Norwegian Refugee Council thank you Israel says it's not expecting any hostages to be released by Hamas before Friday the country's National Security adviser said a deal with the militant group has been delayed although the reason why remains unclear and agreed pause and fighting in Gaza is also on hold with Qatar who has played a key role in these negotiations saying an announcement about the temporary truce could come within the next few hours here's the Israeli Prime Minister benam nany I just spoke with President Biden again I thanked him for working at my request with the Brokers to achieve a significant Improvement of the deal and indeed such an improvement was achieved the combination of military efforts and political effort provided the conditions for the return of our abdes I believe this combination will also allow the release of additional abductees in future stages our special correspondent a Ibrahim in Jerusalem has more on why the truce and hostage release deal have been delayed well it seems that it has to do with logistical issues a White House spokesperson has said that the final details are still being worked out um and we don't have any sort of confirmed further explanation as to why this delay important to note that while this delay is disappointing it's not completely unexpected officials have been saying since the beginning of the negotiations of this deal that this kind of thing is done only when it's done just because there are so many moving parts to a deal like this and so in the grand scheme of things if the deal actually ends up up being successfully implemented this should be a minor uh delay and remember even if and once the deal hopefully starts being implemented there could still be bumps along the road uh uh then we're not expecting all of the hostages to be released at once they are indeed expected to be released in batches contingent with a 4-day uh ceasefire and it could happen that one or both parties for whatever reason violates that cease fire H and so we can expect also that this is not going to be 100% smooth how important is this deal a for both the Israeli government and Hamas hugely important for the Israeli government that has been coming under increased pressure and has been indeed the subject of growing anger at the perceived lack of uh action to bring back the hostages since they were taken on October 7th uh by terrorists um there's also a sense that that the Prime Minister himself is sort of was coming under pressure uh to to to do something to bring back uh the hostages for Hamas um this is you know as a as as a militant fighting group on the ground at truce gives them perhaps time to uh regroup which is actually one of the criticisms of this deal coming from a very vocal rightwing minority within the government who were opposed to the deal saying that it actually plays into hamas's Advantage because it gives them time to uh regroup there's also the people in Gaza who stand to benefit from the ceasefire as the ceasefire also means that uh you know hundreds of trucks of Aid will be coming into the Strip This is much needed after you know more than 40 days of near constant uh bombardment that was DW's special correspondent a Ibrahim speaking to me earlier from Jerusalem well for more let's bring in y Hilman director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the international crisis group thanks for being with us Yos this ceasefire agreement has been weeks in the making walk us through what you know about this how this tentative deal was struck good morning Terry yes the deal um was discussed right almost from the beginning uh after October 7th once it became clear that Hamas and other groups had taken Israeli hostages qat which hosts uh the political Bureau of Hamas in Doha immediately uh presented itself as as a negotiate as a mediator I'm sorry uh between Hamas and Israel Egypt has also taken on that role being the neighboring states to to the Gaza Strip um but but there were many uh problems along the way uh one of them was that uh at one point there was a deal that was almost in place negotiated by uh the head of the masat David Bara in in in Doha uh with with the other side and U and then the Prime Minister Natan yaho decided to launch the ground Invasion and that put that deal to an end so now we we are many weeks later into uh the bombardment of Gaza uh and there is now talk again of a deal I think I think uh as your correspondent rightly pointed out uh the Prime Minister has come under huge pressure uh mounting pressure from the families of the hostages uh to uh come to a deal and to implement it uh and he's going to do it I think uh it's clear we Face some procedural H hurdles but nothing or logistical hurdles but nothing politically serious uh from the Palestinian side uh the situation is is beyond desperate uh we've seen now in the last 24 hours an escalation uh of the Israeli bombardments in the southern Gaza Strip where most people have fled uh with at least 100 people killed just over the last 24 hours so uh the situation is is really terrible and people are desperate for uh a pause that would allow uh a to come in and for people to find maybe somehow a safer place to go to but really frankly there is no such thing now the outlaw of the deal uh we have those and it suggests that 50 prisoners or 50 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza would be released in exchange for about 150 Palestinian prisoners uh being held in Israeli jails what do what do you know about those prisoners who might be released as part of this deal I haven't seen uh the list and so I don't know exactly uh who is going to be included uded but um Israel has has hundreds if not thousands of Palestinian prisoners many of whom uh have been arrested and and and some in many cases convicted but there's also many who have not been convicted um for uh very minor offenses and some for very major ones uh all having to do with the Palestinian struggle against the military occupation uh because as you know Palestinians have been under military occupation for the last 56 years and are rejecting it so um but it can be Stone throwing it can be raising slogans it can be um spitting at soldiers who are on patrol it can be any number of things um and of course many of them are children meaning uh under 18 um who have been uh arrested along with many women so uh I think this is the first badge down the line in exchange for the release of other Israeli hostages there could be others okay uh y h from the international crisis group thank you very much for speaking with us you the hostage release delay means the agonizing weight goes on for the families of those being held by Hamas many have maintained constant pressure on benimi netanyahu's government to make sure that the release of the loved ones is a main priority DW's Ben fulan reports from Tel Aviv where some relatives are holding a permanent vigil this has become known as hostage Square in downtown Tel [Applause] Aviv a place of prayer and hope that this first partial hostage deal happens I have hope and I don't have hope the same size because I don't trust ramas I don't trust as long as we get a few I mean it's better than none and the that tiny certainty of life and people coming back I think is a huge signature of Hope and is a huge gain for us um but it's it's horrifying that it's not everyone women and children only as one of the young men captured Alon Orel won't be coming home yet his mother set up this piano on the Square music is part of his life he's been playing for from when he was 9 years old what's that feeling like um having people down here every day playing the piano for your son it's amazing it gives us a lot of hope it's a hard time it's not it's not easy a symbol of the agonizing weight an empty banquet table for the 240 hostages in every part of the square reminders of the struggle to get them all home the message too from the Israel ballet we want them back want the people back as soon as [Music] possible well as we wait for the hostage release deal to be implemented Israeli media are reporting that an agreed pause in the fighting in Gaza has also been delayed I spoke to Mike Martin a former British off army officer and Senior fellow at the department of War studies in King's College London I asked him about how difficult it is to arrange such deals it's super complicated I mean you need three things really uh both sides obviously need to want to come to a deal and it's taken actually some time uh with this particular deal for both sides to want to be in that place you need an intermediary and interlocutor who's trusted enough by both sides to conduct that diplomacy initially shuttling between the two sides and I think that highlights the importance of Qatar here and then of course you need once the deal is going through you need someone to watch it and make sure that the the terms are verified so as you say very complicated to get those three conditions in place from a military point of view how complex is an exchange of hostages and prisoners which this deal foresees again very complicated and you you know you just said in your package there that that the deal's been delayed the concerns that I would have would be around spoilers to the deal so you've arranged this deal you're going to have a ceasefire and you're going to trade prisoners but there will be people I'm thinking particularly on the hammer side who don't actually want to ceas fire perhaps they've lost someone they've been fighting with and and they are just they want to Scupper that deal there are also other factions within Gaza so Palestinian Islamic Jihad no mention has been made of them whether they were party to this deal so they may not want a deal either so the big problem now that we move into the implementation phase is actually about stopping other parties who either deliberately or or by accident want to Scupper that deal and they start uh the hostilities again yeah important point to keep in mind that there are other parties involved here the Israelis uh have previously rejected calls for a truce claiming it would only benefit Hamas are they still concerned Mike that Hamas could exploit a truce for their own Advantage very much so and and I think they've got good cause to so one of the points of contention in the negotiations was whether the Israelis would be allowed to continue overflying Gaza so Hamas wanted a stop to all or a pause during the ceasefire to all Israeli overflights and so of course the fear is that uh Hamas will use this period to restock rearm move supplies around get rockets in position ready to go again once the pause comes to an end so I think that is a valid fear of the Israelis now Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war against Hamas is not over despite this deal should we expect the Israeli military then to Simply pick up where it left off when the anticipated truce is over you know Terry I wouldn't be so sure here because uh pauses have a tendency to become ceasefires and ceasefires have a tendency to become longer ceasefires both sides you know Hamas have said that their finger is on the trigger and Israel says they're going to go again but actually we've already seen we haven't even started swapping or returning the hostages and already it's been delayed by a day so one assumes the ceasefire is going to be a day longer at the other end and what the pa in fighting allows both sides to do is to sit back and look at what's happening and say actually maybe this fighting isn't achieving the political goals that we want it to so perhaps we could use this pause and allow it to develop into a longer ceasefire but of course we shall have to see Mike thank you so much that was Mike Martins a senior fellow at Kings College
