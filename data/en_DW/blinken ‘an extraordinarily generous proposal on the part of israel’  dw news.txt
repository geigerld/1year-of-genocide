We Begin the day as diplomats dare to talk seriously about a serious ceasefire Israel and Hamas have been at War practically non-stop seven months now the only pause was about a week last November tonight something more substantial appears to be in the works Israel is reportedly offering a limited ceasefire in exchange for the release of 33 Israeli hostages Hamas reportedly is demanding the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons now will Hamas and Israel will they find Common Ground will a no be a green light for Israeli troops to launch their ground defensive against Rafa this is what Israel's closest allies said on Monday Arab and Western foreign ministers are meeting in Saudi Arabia with the war in Gaza on their minds this is the US Secretary of State's seventh visit to the Middle East since the October 7th attacks and he's urging Hamas to accept this deal proposal a 40-day ceasefire and the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel in exchange for more than 30 Israeli hostages held by Hamas Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily extraordinarily generous uh on the part of Israel and In This Moment the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas they have to decide and they have to decide quickly conditions in Gaza have worsened overnight three separate Israeli attacks killed 22 people in Rafa hitting three houses including that of the Abu Taha family their small child died in the attack we were sitting in our homes and then the house was bombed and we didn't know anything everyone was sleeping in their bed the displaced those who were not displaced most of these Martyrs were displaced in addition to the the family living here 10 members of the family and the displaced were killed they have nothing to do with anything all of them are girls and women this is the target they're looking for Israel still plans to invade Rafa to root out what officials say are Hamas militants hiding in the city the new ceasefire on the table is only an extended pause Israel has said once it's over it will resume its assault on Gaza potentially worsening the scale of a humanitarian crisis nearing its seventh month all right I want to pull in now Hans yakob Schindler he's an international diplomacy analyst and the senior director at the counter extremism project he joins us tonight from New York Mr Schindler it's good to see you so diplomats they have been open especially in the last 24 hours about their optimism about this possible ceasefire deal um what does this tell you well I mean we are close undoubtedly but I'd like to add a word of portion we been closed before um it has frequently really uh been a problem that the leadership in Gaza of Hamas was not willing the willing to accept the conditions of a deal that the Hamas leadership outside Gaza for example in Qatar was willing to accept so while there is pressure not just from secretary blinken but also 13 Nations collectively called on Hamas to take the deal and to release the hostages it's only over when it's over and that is the inter ational Community pressuring Hamas which what you just mentioned what about the the pressure on Israel to make this ceasefire deal a reality well the Israeli government to be Frank has been open to make a ceasefire deal um for a while now there has been a subtle shift from only wanting to accept shortterm uh ceasefires and a limited number of of people uh also only uh uh to be released only Palestinians with minor crimes now that has shifted to a longer willingness to have a longer ceasefire but also to release Palestinians that have more serious crimes against them and what would the Israelis like to have from Hamas look I mean it's very clear that the general aim of uh Israel's operations in Gaza I.E the destruction of Hamas as an ongoing terrorist concern is still and remain still the main one of the main targets the other ones of course being the host and this is where the problem exists the hostages are at the same time for Hamas their life insurance so I doubt that Hamas is willing to uh release all of the hostages equally I doubt that even if this deal is made that Israel is going to commit to an unending ceasefire there is still Rafa there's still four battalions of Hamas in Rafa as well as the key leaders leaders save Dave and Sina in Rafa they cannnot leave live leave Raa alone otherwise Hamas will reconstitute very fast after they leave and and so how do you see this if Hamas does not take this deal will that be a green light then for an Israeli ground operation into Rafa let me formulate like this if the Israeli government can't get the hostages back with this deal very shortly they've been preparing for the Rafa offensive planning talking to the American uh government about their plans how to protect civilians in Gaza doing their offense if they can't get the hostages back the Israeli government has no choice they will have to do this offensive and try to free the hostages by force rather than through negotiations all right another topic that's on the radar particularly in in Israel Israeli media are reporting that the international criminal court might soon issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli government and military officials I mean do you see this timing as a coincidence or or is there something more here well I mean first of all the plan is uh potentially to issue arrest ons not only for Israeli senior military officials but also for Hamas officials so if it happens it hopefully will be a bi biased approach looking at what happen an arrest war is not necessarily yet a conviction of guilt mind you so I don't see a particular connection between what the IC ICT does and what um the negotiations do in in Cairo and in Doha okay H Shindler as always Mr Shindler we appreciate your time and your analysis thank you all right we're want to go now to Cairo and I'm joined by journalist kareim elari Kareem it's good to see you you know all eyes are about to be on where you are right now Egypt are you seeing any movement towards a possible deal a possible agreement well we have basically four positive signs the first sign is that even before this meeting in Cairo took place um a high ranking Hamas official said that there are no major issues any longer in the way and they will look positively to the new Israeli proposals um the second sign is there was a delegation of the Egyptian Security in Israel last Friday they came back and we have heard from sources of the Egyptian side that there are concessions on the Israeli side the third thing is what you already mentioned that is what uh us what the US foreign minister blinkin said about a general proposal of course that's a way to also put pressure on Hamas but something is moving and there seems to be there's also a force point there is a straighter line of communication it seems to be that the leadership of Hamas in Gaza is now able to do the decisions on their own uh before this was always through the political leadership in in in in in Qatar had to go back through the Egyptians to Gaza then it took days because the leadership of in Gaza is undercover until the answer came back so a much straighter line of communication which is of course important and Kim do we know what is being asked of the Hamas delegation in Egypt well I think nothing new it's uh to release the hostages and to keep a ceasefire one once it's agreed upon um all the other questions are questions or issues of the postwar order and there seems to be until now no coherent plan from neither side about this time can we say then that there have been any concessions made by Israel um in this agreement this offer yeah there uh is some movement there's some movement on one of the key demands uh of Hamas they talking about the fac release of hostages in stages in exchange with Palestinian prisoners and at least Le in the second phase there should be an agreement for permanent ceasefire so that's a key demand the permanent ceasefire of Hamas um now we hear through Us Media through us us Network actually saying that in the new Israeli proposal there is the term of restoration of sustainable calm which is not a permanent ceasefire but moving into this direction there's also talk about displayed Palestinians being able to go back to the houses in the North in Gaza that is also of course related to the prolonged presence of the Israeli Army in the Gaza and you know something we're seeing that we we have not seen is diplomats are now rather open with their optimism about what's about to happen what do you think is behind this momentum for a deal at this point well I think one word pressure pressure on all sides I mean Hamas is under pressure to uh avoid any kind of military offensive in Rafa the Israeli government is under International under International pressure not at least by their most important Ally uh the US to agree to a ceasefire and to put the Rafa offensive at least onto the back burner I think also we have a case where the US President Joe Biden himself is under pressure through the protests in the US universities and is handing down the pressure now uh onto Netanyahu in addition to that Netanyahu is under pressure at home because people see that there's a failure that he didn't bring back the hostages in the last six months all that created a a movement in this negotiations we will see if it will lead to to the conclusion of the talk talk especially before the Rafa offensive because if this offensive happens of course all the deck of card will be reshuffled again journalist kareim alahari with the latest from Cairo tonight Kareem as always thank you
