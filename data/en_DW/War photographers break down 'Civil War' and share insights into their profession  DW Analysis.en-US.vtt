00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.380
A fractured United States is at
war with itself.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.400
That's the premise of Alex Garland's Civil War, number one at

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.520
the US box office.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.360
A bit weird, considering
its unusual heroes.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.390
War photographers, someone said,
don't make it about journalists.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.600
Everybody hates journalists. Now.
Journalism can't end the civil war,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.880
but if it fails, the movie seems
to say one is more likely to start.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.560
We don't ask. We record,
so other people ask.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.760
It's an imaginary scenario,
but it looks disturbingly real.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.750
So I talked about it with
some of today's most important

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.909
war photographers, incredible people
who filmed real wars,

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.550
assassinations and genocides
that have been shot,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.590
bombed, kidnapped.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.110
That's coming from someone who's
been kidnapped twice.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.830
I was not able to stop
people from being executed.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.030
Some of them are risking
their lives right now.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.110
So how does their job actually
look like?

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.150
And how accurate is the movie?
Just a quick warning, we are going

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.030
to discuss details from the movie,
so expect spoilers.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.910
And we're also going
to look at war photos, so expect

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:08.750
images of violence.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.040
So did you like the movie? Yeah,
I like the movie.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.440
Powerful and unsettling.
Kirsten Dunst did an incredible job.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.080
One of the things
that was so realistic about

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.760
the film were these summerly
executions that happened

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.160
so fast with no conversation.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.200
The relationship between
the more experienced photographer

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.080
and the younger photographer,
the fragility of life and how people

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.280
can go from living
to dead in seconds.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.360
The monotony of sort of driving
through a war zone you're planning

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.760
with your fixer or the reporter
you happen to be working with.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.990
Any anyone of your team, a driver.
Everything is more intense and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.070
so relationships evolve
at a faster rate.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.110
Having been a photographer working
on January 6, being inside

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.950
the Capitol, there's some remnants
and and some similarities.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.150
They got a lot right,
and that's more than most films do

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.590
when it comes to photojournalists.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.310
There were some certain things
that did not make sense.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.030
We're talking about Hollywood,
right? We're talking about

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.470
very violent film.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.510
It's not that realistic
that journalists are given

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.830
that front row seat to violence right
off the bat.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.150
There are times when we're wearing
flak jackets and helmets.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.030
Other times we're not without
any kind of rhyme or reason.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.350
She has her sort of breakdown at
the end of the movie while she's

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.470
still on assignment.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.030
I don't think that's
when you would fall apart as a very

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.550
experienced war photographer.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.750
I think that that would obviously
happen during the quiet moments

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.310
back at home.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.590
The fact that there was number
medical kit, there was number effort

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.590
to even stop the bleeding.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.190
They didn't really give
the characters time.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.630
To converse with civilians.
But one of the biggest things, of

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.910
course, is that if there's
a siege on the White House,

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.310
that there are only four or five
journalists there.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.750
In today's day and age with
everybody that has a phone,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.190
everybody that has a camera seems
literally impossible.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.470
OK, now let's zoom in on five
scenes of the movie from beginning

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.430
to end so I can ask you how realistic
they are and use them to talk about

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.070
war photography in general.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.389
We are towards
the beginning of the movie and Lee

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.270
the experienced journalist meets for
the first time Jesse, the aspiring

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.430
photographer and saves our life from
a suicide bombing.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.990
Unfortunately I cannot show
the next part of the clip because

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.669
it's not in the promotional material.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.070
We'll have to get ingenious with
the whole video in that sense,

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.230
but I have a picture right here and
I'll send it to you as well.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.080
But in any case.
Immediately after the bomb went off.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.320
While this is still shocked,
Lee is already photographing

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.960
the dead bodies littering the road.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.350
So. How realistic is that?
Would you go out and shoot

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.670
pictures in a situation like that?

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.430
I photographed a suicide
bombing years ago.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.430
Former Prime Minister of
Pakistan Benazir Bhutto

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.710
was assassinated by a suicide bomber
who also shot her with a pistol.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.350
And I was very close to the vehicle
when that happened.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.670
She was waving from
an open armored car and I saw

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.830
the panic in the drivers,
her driver's eye.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:27.330
So I backed up and from the moment.
I noticed that problem where

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.770
I was about I don't know,
a couple yards away from

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.640
the vehicle to when the explosion
happened was only 10 seconds and

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.770
so and so I moved back and and
it saved me because I followed

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.610
some intuition and after
that explosion I was pushed

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.170
back in a in a Stampede.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.370
But then I had the choice which
is the choice that you see in

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.370
the film of going in and continuing
working or just calling it a day and

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.080
and I made that choice to to go
in and photograph.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.750
What I can see in the distance,
and so would I do that again today?

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.950
I'm not sure. And why is that?
Because as we've seen in in Ukraine,

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.990
we saw it in Syria,
we see it in in Gaza as well.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.670
It's it's called the double tap.
When there is a bomb that comes

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.140
in or an air strike or a suicide
bombing, people like photojournalists

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.020
and 1st responders go in and
then the second one happens.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.350
That's incredible. Can you share?
That's really incredible.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.029
Can you share more episodes like
that? I'd really like

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.110
our viewers to know.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.070
What risks you have taken?
So is there any moment that stands

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.150
out or you thought,
why the hell am I doing

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.550
this job now?

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.270
I would say when I was kidnapped
in Libya in 2011 during

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.990
the popular uprising, you know,
for about a week it was unclear

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.430
whether we would survive.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.550
We were. I was taken hostage with
three colleagues from

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.870
the New York Times,
so Tyler Hicks, Anthony Shadid and

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.830
Steve Farrell.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.029
Right. Sort of. At the moment of our
kidnapping, we were put on the ground

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:11.150
execution style, with each one of
us had a gun to our head and

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.790
they were about to execute us.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.870
And I think in that moment,
I was pretty sure that I would

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.029
not survive.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.710
And I didn't say in that moment
I would quit.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.750
But I definitely asked myself, like,
wow, I really need to ask myself

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.830
why I'm here and like why I'm risking
my life because my family, you know,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.029
I thought of my parents in
that moment, and I thought,

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:36.110
what will they think when they hear
their daughters been killed

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.550
in Ajdabiya, a place in Libya that
no one's ever heard of at the end of

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.470
that when we were finally released.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.230
You know, ironically,
I never said I'm quitting.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.150
I've been taking
prisoner a number of times.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.750
I've had governments have
to negotiate for my release.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.430
Any, any risky moment that stood
out? Not really, because there

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.270
have been so many different moments.

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:02.790
I've documented over 25 conflicts.
I worked in over 100 countries.

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:04.830
People often ask,
oh, where was the most dangerous?

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.110
What was the most close to this or
close to that I've been.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.830
Very blessed, very lucky
not to have been injured,

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.190
obviously not to have been killed.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.270
Many of my colleagues
have unfortunately suffered

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.150
the ultimate sacrifice and
these situations whether it could

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.710
be.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.430
A bullet going by too closely,
shrapnel landing too closely.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.470
All these different things that they
they are part of the risks that come

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.990
along depending on the situation.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.150
Why do you take such risks? I mean,
I understand a soldier fighting

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.310
for his country, but why?

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.360
Why do you go to so many countries to
different wars and

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.880
different wars in many countries?

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.240
So why does one decide to risk
their life over and over again?

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.710
The interest and fascination and
violence and war,

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.990
it's it's you know that's one of
those things that that that I that

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.430
there I have no answer to like
objectively speaking I find

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.790
the interest strange.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.000
A bit off putting. Kind of messed
up on some level, like

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.080
why be attracted and dedicate
my life to the very thing

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.160
that most people are trying
to get away from?

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.240
Why volunteer to do this thing?
Why do it over and over again?

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.590
Why do it for decades?
Why do it after friends die?

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.710
Why do it after being hurt?
Why do it after

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.230
like mentally being scarred?

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:35.470
It doesn't. It makes no sense.
So the answer to your question

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.230
is that I that I have no answer
because it makes no sense.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.910
It's just it's who I am, you know
and and you have

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.510
to be who you are on some level.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.790
But we would be remiss to not talk
about the fact that no international

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.110
journalists are allowed
to report from Gaza.

00:08:49.309 --> 00:08:54.590
It is the only war in history
where fought by a democratic country

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.110
where journalists are not allowed in.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.150
I think the statistics show
that journalists have been targeted

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.420
now more than ever.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:05.350
I think. I think it's incredibly
important to talk about the fact that

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.790
journalists are also targeted with
impunity and no one ever gets taken

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:09.390
to task.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.190
No one ever gets convicted
of killing a journalist.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.870
Personally, I believe
it should be a war crime,

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.710
but I, you know, that's coming from
someone who's been kidnapped

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.510
twice and and you know,
and once by forces loyal to Gaddafi

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.990
when he was still in power.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.270
Because they didn't like
our coverage. And that's really

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.070
important because a lot of
these journalists are being killed

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.270
because governments don't want
their coverage to get out.

00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:37.070
And so I think that that's
very important to understand

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.230
why journalists are being killed,
because it's to censor

00:09:40.309 --> 00:09:42.910
and it's to stop people from getting
coverage.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.270
And Gaza, more journalists
have been killed than

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.190
any other war in history,
almost 100 journalists between

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.350
Gaza, Israel and Lebanon,
and a majority of them,

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.270
of course, in Gaza.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.790
So it's important to talk about,
Yeah, we actually managed

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.910
to get in touch with someone there
to get their perspective.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.630
Well, obviously not on the movie,
but on the general topics

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.590
we're covering here.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.420
Let's just ask him if you can tell
me a bit about yourself, Mohammed,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.510
where are you from?

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.870
Are you from Gaza? Or if not,
how did you end up there?

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:39.790
Are you safe? When I pick up a couple

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.590
of. Like in a Sabbath party.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.320
Leila.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.000
You you risk your life even more
to take these photos.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:15.900
Why?

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:47.250
Say no. Men and Alfano Satosh.
It can fit us idea to Heiko Maserati

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:52.770
rule land Alfayoum Telrato machine
or washing hatta de la Habra.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.460
Going back to the movie, in in
many distressing situations like

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.380
the suicide bombing, Lee looks
jaded and Carlos.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.980
I feel like it's a bit like
the images they put on cigarette

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.140
packages with rotting
lungs and limbs and all the horrible

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.620
things that smoking
dust to your body.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.650
First time they are horrifying,
but then, yeah,

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.210
they're still disgusting.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.250
But you can't.
You get a little used to it.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.290
So do you think
that that also happens

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.370
to your photos?

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.010
And do you think that happens
to you? Do you become callous?

00:12:30.929 --> 00:12:34.090
This is a complicated question.
So it's a good one.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.570
It's a good one. Yeah,
it is a good one.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.140
You're asking very good questions,
actually, you know,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.580
so for someone who's just discovered
the topic, you've done your research.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:52.370
And. I don't feel.
I don't feel desensitized at all.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.090
In a weird way, I feel more sensitive
than I used to.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.250
I'm speaking for myself, you know,
maybe others.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.020
Lindsay. Lindsay said the same,
by the way, earlier in my career,

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.820
anyhow, you know, I was, you know,
when I was in my early 20s.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.940
I don't know how old you.
How old are you, by the way?

00:13:10.059 --> 00:13:14.500
I'm 3232, OK? I mean, if you remember
being in your early 20s,

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.260
you know you're at least for me.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260
I was more wrapped up in myself,
my own ambitions,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.500
my own insecurities.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.220
There was a lot of noise inside
my head.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.570
Getting in the way of honestly
confronting my emotions, We're also,

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.490
you know, men in a society
that doesn't always,

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.970
that often doesn't encourage
men to be honest with their emotions.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.610
So you know the the passage of
so So in a weird way when

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.650
I was seeing more violence,
I was less sensitive to it because

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.530
of all the noise in my head now.

00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:49.850
You know, thanks to thanks to time,
thanks to age, thanks to therapy,

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:55.330
thanks to, you know,
family, mind altering psychedelics,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.330
thanks to family,
thanks to all sorts of things.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.210
You know, I have to be honest about
what all the various qualities

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:02.050
that go into it.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.850
I mean, I think, you know,
thanks to family, thanks to love,

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.170
thanks to friendship, you know,
all these things make

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.690
one much more sensitive.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.890
And you know, ironically,
I don't know if that makes

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.690
me a better photographer on
some level.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.530
Perhaps it makes
me a worse photographer

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.530
because I'm not.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.570
I don't have the stamina
I used to have.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:26.100
I don't have the I can't be.
As unflinching as that used to be,

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.660
I think that's one of
the things about

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:33.100
Civil War that I found
a little problematic because I felt,

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.940
I felt, you know,
I think Kirsten Dunst did a great

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.420
job of being a war photographer.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.900
And look, there are a lot of
war photographers who are totally

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.180
stoic, but I personally could
not relate to her stoicism because

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.020
I'm a very emotional person.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:53.530
I'm I'm the kind of person who feels
what I see and what I photograph.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.650
And yes, I have the camera sort
of as a as a divider between

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:58.810
me and what's going on.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.690
And I I continue to, you know,
do my work.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.650
But I would say it's not to say
when I get in the car, when I get

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.610
home to edit, I'm not emotional.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:13.170
I think that over time I have become
more sensitive to people

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:18.210
I photographed because in some cases
I see what happens

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.210
to them years later.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:24.690
Right. I I, I not very often but
once in a while and and I realized

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.930
that these things that I document,
these little pieces of history

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:33.210
are just a moment for me and
my camera, sometimes much more than

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:33.610
that.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:38.570
But for these folks it's it's
a change in their life that they'll

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.010
they'll never have again the life
that they had before and what comes

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.450
next will never be the same.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.290
And I'm also thinking about things
which are kind of mundane to mention.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.740
I'm thinking about
whether I have the thing in focus.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.210
I'm thinking about
whether my camera got bumped,

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.490
the settings got bumped
and everything is under exposed.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.570
I'm thinking about things like
that and that that keeps

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.890
us hyper focused in that moment.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.450
And so when there's
a really emotional

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.730
traumatic situation happening,
usually it's not affecting

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.410
us then it affects us later on.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.730
And in my personal case,
it's often when I'm editing

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.050
the photographs either
later that day or the next day.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:24.450
What it's like?
Every time I survived a war song,

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.810
I thought I was sending
a warning home.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.620
Don't do that.
But here we are. There's

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.660
a moment when Lee seems to have
an existential crisis,

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.340
despite all the photos of
all the horrors in other countries.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.140
People don't seem to have learned
the lesson, and here they

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.900
are covering a civil war in the US.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:50.020
So does Lee's resignation ring true?
Do you ever lose

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.460
faith in your photos?

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:56.250
Wish it were sufficient to end war.
But the forces that provoke

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:00.450
wars are not the same forces
that usually lead people to want

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.130
to document them, you know,
and there are many kinds of humans

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.250
out there, and all you need is.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.900
A very, you know, a few powerful,
charismatic ones that want to create

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.609
their place in history or expand
their country's territories or

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:19.380
resources, and they can manipulate
enormous numbers of people.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.210
So I I I don't think.
That photographs and evidence of

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.010
war on their own are ever enough
to end war.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.840
Or they would have. I mean,
what more could we possibly need

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:32.290
to see to convince
us of the grotesqueness of it?

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.690
At a certain point,
how many pictures of guys shooting

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.330
at each other can you possibly take?

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.970
So but I do think it's important.
You know, we all play

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.570
our small role in society.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.730
Ron, you covered 3 genocides.
Rwanda, Bosnia, the four.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.410
So I'm wondering,
do you do you recognize

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.730
yourself in this scene?

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.210
I mean never again. Must sound like
a farce to you.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.670
Is is it definitely an American,
but possibly more just Western

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.310
attitude that it's either
all or nothing?

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.100
If the work that we do doesn't stop
the war, doesn't stop

00:18:08.109 --> 00:18:09.190
another war from happening.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.390
Therefore the work has failed.
And yes, I think that's a legitimate

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.550
conversation to have,
but in reality based

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.510
on my own experiences with
my own work and having done this for

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:25.750
so long and seen the impact of
the work on.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:31.010
On the audience.
But more specifically on

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:34.570
the people in the photographs,
or people that are related

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.330
to people in the photographs,
or foreign policy or other things

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:44.530
that the work can actually affect
change, but maybe not in the grand

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.250
way we want.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:50.840
But I took, I took a photograph in
Darfur during the crisis there of

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.600
a young girl about
to go get firewood, risk her life.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.260
Trying not to get to rape,
to get firewood,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.940
for a family to cook food and so on.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:04.690
And. And the photograph was used by
Amnesty International, by UNICEF

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:10.080
to raise money, to raise awareness,
and so on for programming for food,

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.290
other things that would go back to
Darfur.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:19.210
Whether or not that specific girl was
ever directly helped as part of that,

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.010
I'm not sure I tried to find her.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:26.890
I wasn't able to, but. The photograph
helped people, for example, during

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:32.450
the war, early days of the war in
Ukraine and in March of 2022,

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.970
when Putin was repeatedly saying
he would not target

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.770
civilians and that he was, you know,
only targeting combatants.

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:43.170
And. And then I was in a mortar
attack that almost killed

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.210
me and it killed
a family in front of me.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.840
And and you know,
I made a photograph in that moment,

00:19:49.369 --> 00:19:53.170
and the New York Times chose to run
that photograph on the front page.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.530
And that photo was used not only by
the US ambassador to

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.420
the United Nations, but it was used.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:03.410
Sort of worldwide to show that in
fact Russian troops were targeting

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.170
Ukrainian civilians because
it was a known

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:07.840
civilian evacuation route.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.600
It didn't stop the war,
but it certainly brought

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:14.170
worldwide awareness and it certainly
brought brought more backing to

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.690
Ukraine and making
sure that Ukraine was getting

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.650
the weapons it needed to defend
itself.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.770
And so I think,
I think we can affect policy.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.359
I still believe that. Well,
there was a time,

00:20:25.369 --> 00:20:27.690
years ago when I was covering
the Iraq war.

00:20:28.369 --> 00:20:31.210
Goal was to educate
the public so that they could make,

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.080
they could make rational decisions
when they went to vote in

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.450
the next presidential election.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.250
Well, as it turned out,
the Iraq War did not matter as much

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:44.170
to as Americans that as I thought
it would and and it didn't really

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.450
affect the election at all.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:51.730
And so sometimes we have to realize
that what's important to us as

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:55.970
photojournalists in the field,
what's things that are so important

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.050
that we're willing to even risk
our lives.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.410
Might not be important to others
back home.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.530
Who? And that's that's a tough
thing to realize.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:11.890
And and so ever since then I consider
it my goal not necessarily to change

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.530
the government policy,
although that would

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:15.600
be nice sometimes.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.050
My goal really is to educate
folks on what's happened.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.890
It's not. And it's not only about
change, right?

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.130
It's about keeping a record.
This is what other photographers

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:24.450
told me.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:28.780
You're keeping a record. And with
that can come accountability.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:32.080
Absolutely. I think
like when we we go back to let's say

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.840
go back to World War 2, go
back to the Holocaust,

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.810
when Churchill Roosevelt were asked
why didn't you bomb

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.450
the railroad tracks,
why didn't you do this to save

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:40.490
the Jews and so on.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.050
The response was quite easy.
We didn't know,

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.690
so we didn't we didn't do it.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:53.250
You Fast forward to Rwanda in
94 Bosnia the same time period with

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.050
President Clinton in
the United States helmet

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.930
Cole Mitterrand and so on.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:04.340
CNN is going live. From Sarajevo.
The the day in,

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.140
day out of footage of of the of
the genocide in Rwanda,

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.700
people Kofi Annan couldn't say,
oh, we didn't know from

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.140
the UN It's like, yes, you did know.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.500
You chose to ignore it and you need
to be held accountable for it.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.020
No international journalists
are allowed in Gaza,

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.900
so your photos are essential
to document what's happening.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.940
Do you think
they can also bring change?

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.490
Oh man.

00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:11.920
My fellow Phil Otfal,
My fellow Finley, Sir.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:20.810
My fellow film, Water in my fellow.
Help you folks just looking for

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:25.050
gas 300 for half a tank and two cans.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:32.240
300 buys you a sandwich.
We got ham or cheese.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:42.240
300 Canadian. OK, and
then what happens is that Jesse steps

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.640
out of the car and walks around
the corner and she seems attracted

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.119
by something horrific
she has glimpsed.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:55.119
It's two men hanging from the wrists,
covered in blood and.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.840
I want to ask something about
that attraction.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.800
It's it's a very difficult question
to ask and maybe it's a bit offensive

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.040
and naive, but I'm going
to try anyway.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.800
Here's the thing.
You take beautiful pictures of

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.840
horrible things.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.920
Is there something attractive about
horror?

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.720
A bit. A bit like when there's
a car accident and you know

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.119
that there's traffic also because
people slow down when they pass by.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.520
Because they want to look.
So is there something seducing

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.240
in horror?

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.440
I do think horror and beauty are much
closer to one another than we'd like

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.680
to think or imagine.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.760
No, I absolutely agree.
I think my aesthetic

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.760
is very deliberate.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:46.480
It's essentially it's it's
a seduction of using the aesthetics,

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:51.359
color, composition, light, to have
an emotional connection between

00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:52.480
the viewer and the image.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.080
Even if it's something
very difficult, because I want

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.280
you to not be able to look away and
then when you can't look away,

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.600
you understand the content.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.680
People are dying
violent deaths all the time.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:08.000
These violent deaths are are recorded
all the time, by film, by by

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.810
photographs, by eyewitnesses.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.030
What is to distinguish
one death from another and using

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.670
the traffic accident thing
is perfect, right?

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.869
Like, oh, that could have been
me. Let's see,

00:25:18.869 --> 00:25:19.710
let's see what happened.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:20.990
Oh, maybe I can tell
what they did wrong.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.950
So I don't do it wrong or just
this sort of fascination of

00:25:24.109 --> 00:25:26.350
how what happens
when things go completely wrong.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.230
And I think it's and the movie
too, right.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.710
Like we are watching
apocalyptic movies.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:34.670
Literally. Yeah. I think
exactly like this is.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.750
And I think that this,
the film is in some ways, you know,

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.710
a bit of a warning for not just
the United States but for for

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.030
many countries on on what
could go wrong.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.520
So I do try to make
pictures beautiful. Even when they're

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.359
in ghastly situations.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:54.080
Now, granted, I try to I try
not to include gore in my pictures,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.640
and I try to photograph
people in a way that's respectful

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.080
to them.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.160
I don't want people to look look
ridiculous when they're in

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.640
a traumatic situation.

00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:09.720
It's not my goal to to make them look
horrible or foolish or take

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.040
advantage of of their vulnerability.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.960
And so yes, I want to make pictures
that are aesthetically pleasing,

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.440
otherwise people won't look at them.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.080
And I also want to acknowledge
that it's very provincial of Maine

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:27.520
to sit here and complain about
modern spectators enjoying

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.840
violence as a spectacle,
because that violence is far from

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.600
me and I can choose to ignore it.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.160
But that's a privilege and for
many people it's not the case.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.880
And so I think it's important to flip
the perspective and ask.

00:26:45.609 --> 00:26:49.490
What do the photographed think?
What do the people that suffer

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:50.609
this violence think?

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.320
Do they do they want their suffering
to be represented?

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.680
You're talking about
kind of armchair critics that have

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.720
basically 0 frame of reference or
what they're talking about making

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.080
broad sweeping commentaries with
a lot of self righteousness.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.119
I mean that's that's a big part of
the culture in general about

00:27:08.119 --> 00:27:09.119
many issues.

00:27:09.119 --> 00:27:13.280
I mean I've never had a lot of regard
for people that shoot 1st and ask

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.359
questions later or people that speak
with authority about things they they

00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:18.840
they do not know themselves.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.040
So I, I, I honestly, you can hear
the. My voice.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.720
But I also just tend to dismiss these
things out of hand because it's not,

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.320
it makes no sense to me.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:32.119
You know, it's so easy to comment.
It just it's just too, you know,

00:27:32.119 --> 00:27:36.520
I try to avoid commentary on things
that I I don't feel

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.400
confident about commenting on.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.760
You know, it's, you know, it's like
the old Bob Dylan line.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.040
You know, you better know
your song well before

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.080
you start singing.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.970
So sounds like a good journalist.
Yeah, well, you know.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.840
It's you try you know and a flawed
you know you're I make

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.160
plenty of mistakes I mean
this is the nature of things is being

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.640
honest with yourself about
what you can do and what you can and

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.240
who you are.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.280
But but back to your question
you know you know I've had moments

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.400
where I've overstepped
boundaries and and and overstepped

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.080
people's privacy and they've
they've reacted negatively and of

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.000
course at that moment
you you you apologize you step

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
back you you you know you and
you feel bad about that.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.240
I would say buy and I'd say that's
a lot more rare than people

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.240
might expect it expect
you know by and large I think

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.640
also if you're if you're being smart
and thoughtful and kind of kind and

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.160
respectful in your approach.

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:45.570
People tend to to want
to be photographed,

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:50.010
have these moments of pain because
the hope is that it then

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:51.050
has some meaning.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:55.250
This like senseless,
horrific loss will somehow.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.200
Means something other than
just the finality of death

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.040
and despair.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.240
You know, I would,
I would feel that way.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.640
The interaction between
the photojournalist and these folks

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.760
is really important because,
you know, anyone can imagine

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.920
someone they don't know comes with
an, comes in with a camera and starts

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.680
photographing without speaking
to them and they're in a moment of

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.440
distress.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:25.290
Well, instead of that, go up and
talk to someone and say.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:30.470
I can't believe what you're going
through today, and I'm very sorry.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:34.030
I'm trying to document this so people
can understand what's happening.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:37.830
If you don't mind, I'd like to stay
and you'll get a whole

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:38.830
different reaction.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:44.710
And that's how the pros that I know
in this profession deal with

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.470
the folks that they're photographing.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:50.950
It's not just running in and snapping
images, it's it's a lot more

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:54.530
sensitive and the people who have
longevity in this profession.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.400
Are people who function in that way.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:10.210
Hey. Out of interest.
I think that's a weird is like.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.440
Pretty huge civil war going
on all across America, sure,

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.880
but we just try to stay out.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:27.170
Stay out with what we see on
the news. Seems

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:28.490
like it's for the best.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.680
Yeah, well let me know if you want
to try anything on.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:41.080
Thanks. For a movie about
a civil war, it doesn't really

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.520
show many civilians.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.360
Like there's a lot of
journalists and soldiers,

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.360
and but these people in this town
are a rare example of civilians,

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.760
and all they try to do is to ignore
the civil war.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:59.880
And this reminds me of how a lot of
people today just don't want to see

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.280
any more news at all.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.880
You know, we talk a lot about
news fatigue and news avoidance and

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.320
how people are tired of scrolling
their Instagram and finding among

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.770
videos of happy dogs and funny cats.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:17.730
Suddenly another war image.
So are you afraid that that happens

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.650
to your work as well?

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:25.050
Look, I mean, I unfortunately,
I believe that it's important

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:27.890
for people to see what's happening
around the world especially,

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:33.090
you know, if if you know your country
or in the case of my country,

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:36.650
I'm American, contributes
to that war in some way, you know,

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.770
for sending troops, if we're sending
tax dollars, if we're sending

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:40.650
whatever I think.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.840
Americans have a responsibility
to understand what's going

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.840
on in those places.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.880
So I believe fundamentally in
the fact that even if this image

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.360
makes you uncomfortable,
you probably have to take

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.400
a look at what's happening.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:57.160
So we saw this in Syria, 12 years of
war, people are like by by year #3,

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.360
it's like, OK, whatever,
more dead Syrians, whatever.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.960
Now you're going.
Now you're starting to see it to some

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.680
extent with Gaza as we pass
six months, we already see it for

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.840
sure with Ukraine.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.920
Oh, yeah, OK,
another city in Ukraine's bomb.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:16.400
So, So what? That's not the right
attitude in my opinion.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.440
I think it's it's very difficult,
but it's not the right attitude.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.920
Like the the attitude should be like,
why are these things still happening?

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.320
It's human nature to turn away and
to turn a blind eye from

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.320
what's horrible.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.760
I think so in that sense,
one of my jobs as a photojournalist

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:37.200
is to try to find a way to tell
a story in a way that maybe is not

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.960
overly graphic, that can convey
a story in a way that is sensitive,

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.720
that evokes emotion, but that doesn't
necessarily make you want.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.680
To never read a newspaper again.
Is there any photo recently

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.240
that you think people should see?

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.440
There's the one of the mother
that just won World Press cradling

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.120
her child, I think.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.520
And again, that's not too graphic.
And I think that's one of the reasons

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.960
why it spoke to so many people,
because you just see

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.200
the mother's pain.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:25.130
In the machine.
Hey Michelle had been this one idea.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.720
Saba ship then did.
The legend was a flare like

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.440
an Al Khatib in a nurse.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:40.730
When it had the alarm be.

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:16.050
It's it's one of the unfortunate
aspects of the movie that,

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:21.010
at least in some scenes, it depicts
journalists as war junkies,

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.250
adrenaline junkies.

00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:26.250
I'm thinking of when the veteran
writer smiles to the young

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.530
photographer while they're
being attacked by a helicopter.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.920
That particular shot.
Yeah, that's right.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:37.480
It's a bit perpetrating, don't
you find It can be.

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:40.170
And and I am a fan of the movie,
I like the movie.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:43.290
I thought that Kirsten Dunst did
an incredible job.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:49.960
As the veteran photographer in
in depicting some of the long term

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.690
issues that we face
psychologically after witnessing

00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:55.290
so many things over time.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:59.810
But. Of course the movie
has some issues.

00:34:59.969 --> 00:35:04.210
I think that that the adrenaline
thing is is really and and

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:08.290
I think it's a little bit perpetuated
by movies like Civil War where

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:11.850
it's just like this constant
adrenaline rush through a war.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.410
You know, I think that the,
the what we need to see is the quiet

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:20.770
time and the downtime and the toll
that that conflict takes

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:21.960
and and why we do it.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.370
I'll say this, I don't have
any serious colleagues in

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:28.890
this profession who do
it for adrenaline.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.650
That comes along with it, but
the but the but the.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.330
But the problem is even bigger
because at the very end,

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:38.890
when the soldiers dragged
the president out of his desk,

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.770
the same journalist stops
them from shooting him and says

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.290
I need a quote.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.090
He gets the quote and he then lets
them execute him.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:53.090
Now the director Garland said
that he wanted journalists

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.290
to be the heroes of his movie.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.730
I'm completely over,
completely over this.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.510
Demonization and villainization of
the press.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.110
It's been happening a lot.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:14.350
Yeah, it it's it comes from
politicians and it comes from within

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:18.310
social media, which is this weird
public discourse space that doesn't

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:20.790
really relate to how people talk to
each other at all.

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:25.110
We all know that, right?
And and in some places it happens

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.670
within the press,
but whatever it is.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.020
And it's very good that he talks
about this issue, but I'm not really

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.780
sure if he succeeded in the movie.

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:39.650
I mean, this is this,
I think, is a perfect example of

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:45.130
how journalists can turn people into
news items and dehumanize them.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.250
This is the opposite of
good journalism.

00:36:48.489 --> 00:36:50.610
This is the opposite of what
a good photo does.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.920
I know I found,
I found it. Obviously I found

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.480
it very difficult and very,
very uncomfortable.

00:36:56.210 --> 00:37:00.440
But to be honest with you,
I've been in that situation to

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:01.570
an extent several times.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.780
Where unfortunately, that I was not
able to stop people.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:10.050
From being executed and that was what
was going to happen and there's

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:10.650
nothing I could do.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:15.050
And there were other times.
When I was able to say don't kill

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:19.810
these people and and either
my presence there with the camera,

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:23.810
my presence is a white westerner,
or my presence of actually

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:24.530
just saying.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:32.100
Take them prisoners, which happened
one time in in Afghanistan in 2001

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.300
with the battle for Kabul
that they captured

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:39.580
two young Taliban soldiers and
they were going to kill them.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.730
And I said no, don't kill them.
You should take their take

00:37:41.739 --> 00:37:43.860
them prisoners and give them to
the Americans and the guys go,

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.060
OK, we're going to go do that.

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.920
And that was the science.
And then in Bosnia, I was with

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.610
militia and security,
unarmed civilians, right,

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:55.480
right in front of me, telling
me the whole time don't take

00:37:55.489 --> 00:37:56.370
any photographs.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:04.940
So. I did. I needed to document
what was obviously was a war crime

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.860
and the aftermath of the war crime
and the photographs were used as

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:14.460
evidence in the war crimes tribunal
to indict many people and help

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.500
convict them of of of war crimes.

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:20.780
But unfortunately at that moment and
nobody will ever know except for

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.380
the journalists themselves,
if you could have stopped

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.420
it or not stopped it.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.300
I thought there was nothing
I could do and.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:31.440
All I could do was make
sure that there was evidence of of,

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.210
of the crime.

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:36.410
I've never witnessed anything like
that, you know, You know,

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:42.850
you sometimes you see
bad behavior from other journalists,

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.810
photographers, you know, it's where
people are human or sometimes

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:48.920
they're being foolish,
sometimes they're being,

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:50.650
they've been at it too long.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:56.100
I also can say that a lot of
my kind of colleagues and and and

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.690
friends in this profession
are amongst the most.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:03.090
Thoughtful, honorable, courageous
people I've I've ever met.

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:10.820
You know, and and so. I tend
to not appreciate these caricatures.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.690
You know,
I don't think they're accurate.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.940
You would never have a journalist
asking someone to stop from

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:20.340
assassinating or killing
that person until they got a quote.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.210
That person would would not be in
the business for very long.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:29.690
So callous. I just need to quote
and then go ahead and kill him.

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:33.500
I don't care.
At the same time, I'm not.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.980
I mean, I think if I was there,
obviously as a photographer,

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:40.690
I would have been doing
what what Jesse did.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.860
But as a journalist,
I don't think I would have,

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:47.340
I don't know.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:50.900
I don't think I would have asked.
I would have let, just let,

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:51.820
I would have said.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:55.010
Maybe I would have said don't kill
him. I don't know.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.620
I want to end by asking
why do you do what you do?

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.100
Francois Truffaut once said
that every movie against

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.500
war ends up being pro war.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.540
And I don't know
if civil war succeeded

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.660
or not at being against war.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:16.140
But one thing he shows,
I think, is that war is hell,

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:19.140
but it's also maybe
not attractive but addictive.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.060
And there's a bit in your book where
you say we feel more comfortable in

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.300
the darkest places than we do back
home, where life seems

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.060
simple and too easy.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:33.960
Can you talk about that? Yes.
When I was covering the wars in Iraq,

00:40:33.969 --> 00:40:37.890
Afghanistan, Darfur, back-to-back
combat, you know,

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.570
I was literally flying from
one war to another and going

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:45.130
home basically where I was living
in Istanbul to do laundry.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.130
And then I would get back on
the plane and go.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:52.210
And so I felt at that time that
I could really only relate to people

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:53.650
who did similar work.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:58.210
You know, for me, I felt
the most comfortable when I was not

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:02.330
necessarily in a war zone, but
surrounded by people who understood

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:04.810
what I had witnessed
and what I continue to witness.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:09.690
And given that history, again,
often happens through conflict,

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.960
it's important that we are there
to document.

00:41:12.969 --> 00:41:15.650
We are there to amplify
voices that need to be heard.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:20.050
And as much of it is a cliche,
it is true to shine a light,

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.210
to remind people what's going
on they might not be paying

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:27.370
attention to, you know,
to me, you know, Are we just trying

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.010
to provoke emotion with our images?

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:33.410
Are we trying to also provoke
a certain amount of understanding?

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:38.440
You know, to me. Emotion is a is a is
a casual feeling.

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:40.730
It can be deep,
but it also can be fleeting.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:44.530
You know, I I want to try and take
images and create works that have

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:48.690
a really sustained relationship
that that hopefully have, you know,

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:50.330
a deeper impact over time.

00:41:50.489 --> 00:41:54.650
It's my job as a photojournalist
to keep them interested and

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:58.250
if they're turned off from the news,
maybe I'm not doing

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:59.170
my job well enough.

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:03.570
And so I I I take
that as a a personal challenge.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:07.440
You have to look. At a familiar topic
in a different way.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:10.730
And if you don't do that,
people will not pay attention,

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.130
no matter how strong
that picture is.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:23.620
In Time and the Gelb in take
away Adam in Take a Picture.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:28.940
Bashar. Al.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:55.020
Mahadev. Came out. And NFC and Dabur.
With more 18 Zealand and Son with

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.940
more, I think
Zelena Black and not all.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:03.170
I'm fast enough enough to laugh
though. Had a good Aqua.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.100
Honey.
