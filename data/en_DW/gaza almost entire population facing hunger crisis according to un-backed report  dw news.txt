the risk of famine in Gaza is increasing by the day the Grim assessment of a new unbacked report that says almost the entire population is facing a hunger crisis the warning comes with the UN Security Council expected to vote later on a draft resolution that focuses on the urgency of allowing much needed Aid to enter Gaza a resolution that the US says it is ready to support after days of delay in New York and with starvation now at catastrophic levels supplies of food water and Medicine cannot come soon enough for the people of Gaza signs of starvation are not hard to find in Gaza here in Rafa crowds jostle for what little food is available the despair is evident this war brought an unbearable level of humiliation we struggle so much just to provide lunch life has become so expensive we do not eat drink or sleep properly and nothing is available a United Nations backed report says more than 90% of people in Gaza are facing crisis levels of hunger a critical situation amid Israel's Relentless bombardment in response to the October 7th Hamas Terror attacks un agencies say gazin are getting just 10% of the food deliveries they would usually receive people struggle to find water medicine and fuel what is happening in Gaza is unprecedented both in terms of its scale but also how quickly it is happening you know in the world right now there are about 130,000 people who are in catastrophic levels of hunger meaning they are starving in Gaza more than half a million that is four times more and that is what makes this totally unprecedented Israel did briefly allow Aid through its Kim Shalom Crossing into Gaza this week but an Israeli air strike that hit the Palestinian side forced un staff to stop its pickups there we can still avoid this family but we need to make sure that people have food people have water they have shelter they have sanitation and for all of those things to happen we need water Crossings open so these Commodities can come in the growing desperation for food also means that the limited supplies that do make it into Gaza are often seized upon before being handed out and the UN says it's not just access to Aid that is vital but also its safe distribution across the strip without it they warn the risk of famine and Gaza is increasing every day let's bring in t yarich he's a spokesperson for the World Health Organization one of the agencies involved in putting together this report Tark good to have you with us on DW now this report paints a very Grim picture just how unprecedented is the speed and scale of this hunger crisis unfolding in Gaza well what is really incredible is how fast we got into this situation that people do not have uh enough to eat it just really in a matter of of weeks uh because Gaza is is is is under sort of a Siege where where what gets in is is nowhere enough of of of what people in Gaza normally would would have so so in this quasi Siege situation we are getting to the situation that that that uh and we we are just we have been just hearing from our colleagues on the ground who are trying to bring medical supplies uh to hospitals and what they were saying that people would come to trucks thinking uh that there and hoping that there is a food uh in those tracks uh uh and then our colleagues would say no it's it's Medical supplies but but everyone is desperate and even in the hospitals our colleagues were saying that all patients would just ask do you have do you have some food for us so so really the how fast we got into this situation uh of of food crisis that would obviously uh bring uh more uh uh more suffering due to illnesses because the combination of malnutrition and and infectious diseases being spread is lethal yeah t the US says it's now ready to back a draft resolution at the UN to help allow the delivery of more Aid into Gaza in reality is that going to make much of a difference on the ground what we need is a ceasefire ceasefire is the only solution because as long as people are being bombed there will be more casualties there will be wounded people there will be dead people wounded people who cannot get treatment because there's less and less of Health uh uh uh health facility capacity in Gaza just bringing medical supplies will not make uh hospitals function because these hospitals need need access first of all safety uh to to operate they need also fuel food clean water they need uh uh they need specialized stuff that is no longer there so really ceas fire first uh and then continues and an unhindered access for all humanitarian Goods without exception as long as the fighting continues what options are left for Gins to stay healthy there are very little options can you imagine a 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza more than 300,000 people with chronic diseases and increased uh spread of respiratory viruses of waterborne uh uh viruses of skin infections simply because there is no water because clean water because there is no uh hygiene there is no sanitation so with every day we we we see bombardment and we see this Siege continuing more lives will be lost really that the only solution is stop uh this uh this suffering of people of Gaza by ending hostilities that's tar garovic of the wh many thanks
