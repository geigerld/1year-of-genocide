we start in Israel where prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly rejected calls from the United States to scale back its offensive in Gaza and for post-war Palestinian statehood in a nationally televised address Netanyahu said Israel would not stop its war in the territory until Hamas which is considered a terrorist group by Israel and the US was destroyed in any Arrangement whether there is an accord or not the Israeli state must have security control over all the territory west of a Jordan River it's a necessary condition but that clashes with the principle of Palestinian sovereignty so what can I say I've told our American friends this truth I've also stopped the attempt to impose a reality on us that would harm Israel's security an Israeli Prime Minister should be able to say no even to our best friends no when necessary yes when possible let's get more now from DW correspondent Tanya krma in Jerusalem good morning Tanya can you tell us a bit more about netanyahu's remarks well actually it's not the first time that uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejects the idea of a Palestinian State uh we've been hearing him saying uh that before but of course this comes now after the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin was in the region just last week uh talking about that they needs to be a pathway to Palestinian State he also made remarks at the world economic Forum there was on Wednesday in this regard that Israel cannot achieve genuine security without that pathway to a Palestinian State I think on the one hand uh the uh Israeli Prime Minister wants to assert that it's Israel who sets the tone which sets the tone for what will happen in Gaza after the war ends but also he's addressing of course his domestic audience here there is not uh much talk about you know a peace with Palestinians or a two-state solution at the moment the country is very much focused on um uh the uh you know releasing more hostages that are remaining in Gaza there's a lot of pressure on the government uh from uh the Israeli public and uh there's not so much talk about uh a Palestinian state in that regard rather uh uh more questions about how this war will end and whether uh the goal that the government has set to remove Hamas from Power will actually be achieved but uh this however puts the Prime Minister again at odds with the United States which has also called for Israel to scale back its offensive in Gaza well absolutely uh there are several issues uh where uh both countries very close allies uh differ um one of them is uh of course the course of the war and have been repeated calls by the United States to scale down uh uh the the war uh in Gaza in light of the uh High death toall among the civilian population in Gaza but also the LED in more aid but also when it comes to post war scenarios there's been a lot of pressure on the Israeli government to actually uh Define what a post-war Gaza will look like and one of them is this a goal of a pathway to a Palestinian state state um as Anthony blinkin has said it also in the region he was here last week talking to of leaders also in the region saying that uh also the Arab countries mainly he visited also Saudi Arabia uh which a country uh Israel has no uh diplomatic relations with but of course saying that uh Arab countries would like to see would like to help with a reconstruction of of Gaza uh but also would like to see a pathway to a Palestinian state to uh possibly reintegrate Israel in the region we'll leave it there for the time being but thanks so much for joining us today Tanya ker from
