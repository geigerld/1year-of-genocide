in a joint statement the leaders of the United States Egypt and Qatar are calling on Israel and Hamas to enter ceasefire talks next week in Doha or Cairo and to get the job done no more delays no more excuses they say this could be their final offer to mediate an end to the war and to bring Israeli hostages home patience and time are in short supply on Friday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he'll send negotiators to the talks the top negotiator for well he was killed Last Week Tonight no word on who Hamas plans to send in his place or if they plan to send anyone at all I'm Brent G in Berlin this is the day we begin the day with a major push to deescalate in the Middle East when seemingly all signs are pointing in the other direction in the last week there have been two assassinations a Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and the leader of Hamas in tyan Iran blames Israel has vowed to retaliate putting the entire region on edge now in this Powder Keg A Renewed call for an end to fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza this week the leaders of the United States Egypt and Qatar issued a joint statement as mediators making perhaps their final offer they called on both Israel and Hamas to restart ceasefire talks next week saying there is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay it is time to release the hostages begin the ceasefire and implement this agreement today the Israeli Prime Minister said that he will send negotiators to ceasefire talks next week no word from Hamas its main negotiator and leader was killed last week but the US says that should not stand in the way of ending the fighting in Gaza take a listen look I'm uh not going to negotiate in public at all um but I will say one thing that was true before the death of Hana and remains true today is that senoir was ultimately the decider when it comes to questions on these talks and so whether he is sending messages directly or sending messages through iMed intermediaries he has always been the person who would decide whether Hamas agreed to a cease fire or not and under what conditions they would agree to a cease fire so uh we don't believe that that has changed all right that's the word from the US state department here in the studio with me now is our Middle East analyst shaie rosanis here on a busy Friday evening shaie it's good to see you hi the US state department says that we don't believe anything has changed when it comes to um who within Hamas calls the the shots is that the position of Israel as well yes well they they always thought you know sinir the one in Gaza is the one calling the shots and they were also acting a seem seemingly under this presumption when they chose to go ahead um with the assassination of an presumably Israel is behind that so um the assumption is that has not changed if anything netan keeps you know um saying that it's actually only pushing down on Hamas isolating hania uh sorry isolating inir in Gaza that's what will bring you know uh Hamas to realize that they need to compromise and that will bring some sort of a breakthrough in the talks um the fact of what's happening is that sinir in Gaza is consolidating power he's the you know hania was somewhat of a position they were not on best terms um there was a possibility because hania was living in Qatar for Qatar to have leverage on Ania to have some more you know to work with and now it's all in the hands of one hand basically dug down under the tunnels of the of Gaza and when we look at what is going on right now um Israel is bracing for a retaliatory attack by Iran possibly also by Hezbollah Hamas is not defeated the war in Gaza rages on and now we've got the leaders of the US Egypt and Qatar saying no more excuses make this deal in Gaza happen happen next week why the sudden push now well it's not that sudden push actually what the Americans Qatari and Egyptian think is that they actually have a gift of this week that came you know all of a sudden uh to to to their hands because soon after these assassinations there was a feeling okay this the whole region is going out of spiring this is Ping and we're losing control of what's Happening seeing Lebanon and Iran take their time made them realize okay maybe there was a way in us for us now and it's all intertwined in the sense that um everybody's waiting to see what the else this the other one is doing you know Israel says we will go for the ceasefire as long as there's no escalation in the north the Iranians say we will maybe consider the nature of our response if we see some ceasefire happening Lebanese are not too keen on immediately going all in on Israel and it seems like even Hamas that was hoping or it seemed like you know a few days ago that they're finally getting the you know what they wanted you know Israel fighting as many fronts as possible they realize maybe this is not happening as well so easily so might they might be you know more incentivized in going for a ceasefire but this is exactly what the um the uh the mediators want to do they want to you know tell the size basically this is now a crossroad a critical Crossroad here we're either going to a deal to a ceasefire to deescalation or things might get out of hand very fast yeah the mediators here um in their joint statement the leaders of the US Egypt and Qatar right that this could be their final offer they are mediators they sound like they're running out of patience and time well the Americans definitely they have no appetite for this you know uh they're focusing on one thing and that is November the election in America and know Biden even though he can step back from the race he knows you know he has very little time still in office and this would be for his legacy one of the most important things he want to wrap it up and he also has personal connection to the topic you see how he talks about the hostages how much effort his him personally you know he met with families he sees them it's it's a goal very dear to his heart do you think his decision the not to seek reelection is playing in to to the speed of events that we're seeing definely he knows he doesn't have too much time he knows um he has very little leverage that he can you know use against Netanyahu and more than that everybody you speak to when it comes to the Israeli uh you know Israel is trying to watch the condition of the hostages the little that they do know about them they say we are playing against time those people that are there for almost 308 days now they don't have time um you know they're they're losing you know I mean of course the conditions they're in you know we we know more and more of them are are probably not with us anymore and the longer we wait uh the the bigger the CH size we only be bring bringing back coffins sadly Netanyahu was quick to agree to send the negoti negotiators um next week it makes him look like he's um a natural participant in peace well Nano is important for him to to seemingly you know be interested in a deal and he's been keeping up this um you know line of I am all for it for it you know for at least two months you know it's been Joe Biden has presented this deal to the world already at the beginning of June and nothing has actually substantially changed since if any if you listen to uh high ranking officials in the Israeli defense Ministry and uh other services they say they feel nany is actually trying to keep more and more hurdles kind of trying to change withdraw some of his consent to you know certain parts of the deal while at the same time promising to the world to the families to Biden oh I'm all in so this is a rift growing between netan and the people running the war and the more professional side on the defense levels and you know there's also this distrust that is you know growing within the Israeli public and of course the families of the hostages who are very much afraid that Netanyahu is led by political needs and not much by uh the need to bring back the hostages are you surprised that we haven't seen Iran retaliate already I mean is is there the sense in Israel that Iran is being sucked into the Palestinian cause more than so than it wants to be for for a while it it felt like you know we were on the verge of this is actually happening this is going to be a origional war with Iran is stepping directly in what we've you know the restraint that we've seen seen so far and let's make sure that we we put an emphasis on the so far part in this um maybe hinting to us that you know even October 7th we know was not coordinated with the Iranians they did not know it's about to be launched at that specific date I'm not sure how much they were in the in and outs of the whole plan and and they've been trying to show solidarity same with hasbalah they've been trying to show solidarity with the Palestinians but at the same time keep it at an arms length you know being able to focus on their interests and and this happened Dr as at the inauguration of a new president his agenda had the the sanctions the the you know the nuclear arms many other things uh ahead before fighting the fights of the Palestinians being sucked into that War uh will divert attention and might be very consequential for the Iranians yes let me ask you I got 30 seconds here the Israeli hostages you brought those up earlier are these talks next week the the final chance to bring those who are still alive to bring them home some people will say there are uh let's keep in mind uh Thursday is a long time in the Middle East uh we will have to see if there's any escalation if we will see uh High tensions uh flaming up in the north it could be that this not going to make any progress and this could be maybe the last chance yeah we'll see what happens next week that's for sure shie good to have you in the studio thank you for coming in on Friday night thank you Israel has confirmed that it will send negotiators to GZA peace talks next week in either Doha or Cairo prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that he has agreed to the talks at the request of international mediators world leaders are pushing for talks to restart Hamas however has yet to respond the recent assassination of a Hamas leader in tyan widely blamed on Israel has raised tensions and some fear the operation has hindered peace efforts Hamas was behind the October 7th attacks on Israel it is regarded by many countries as a terrorist organization Aaron David Miller is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace he focuses on US foreign policy and the Middle East and he joins me now Mr Miller it's good to have you with us on this Friday evening um we've heard it before that that hopes of reaching a a ceasefire deal have been revived we're hearing it again now or at least that's what's being implied with this joint statement that was released yesterday is it different this time it may be you know based on my experience 20 plus years and being involved in Arab Israeli negotiations Israeli Palestinian negotiations as well they seem to have two speeds traditional NE negotiations slow and slower th this is not a traditional negotiation the primary Palestinian decision makers in sconed meters below ground in unit Rafa probably surrounded by the remaining hostages those dead and U and those that are still alive live so the real question is the Biden Administration the International Community much of the Arab world um the United Nations everybody's in a hurry to reach a a ceasefire deal between Israel andas the real question which is impossible to answer is whether Benjamin netan and yah senoir the principal decision maker recently elevated to become the political head of Hamas not that he was anything other than that uh making de critical decisions from Gaza before it really rests for their calculations and it may well be that for any number of reasons there's a better chance than ever uh that you could get an agreement at least to get through phase one why do you say that you know I think um time uh and pressure on both parties uh it's clear uh CIA Bill Chief Bill Bill Burns confirmed a month or so ago that hamas's commanders are under pressure from an unrelenting Israeli campaign uh senoir must pay some attention to the devastation and humanitarian catastrophe that he has caused for the 2.3 million people of Gaza as far as Mr neto's concern uh the knesset is in recess it's almost impossible to bring down an Israeli government during that period if he wants to do the deal um he's more he's more or less immunized from pressure from his two extremist ministers so as I mentioned I think there's a real possibility of an agreement but only to take us through phase one which is essentially limited exchange of hostages roughly 30 alive and dead in exchange for an asymmetrical number of Palestinian prisoners maybe 50 Palestinian prisoners for each Israeli a six a six we cease fire and if you could get that maybe and I I'll stress very cautiously and so really maybe you could think about getting to a cessation of hostilities permanent cessation of hostilities but that's going to be a very heavy lift I heard today from several analysts that netanyahu's motivation here is simply um I will go with the good Optics I will send negotiators to these talks next week we will agree to what's on the table it's been on the table since May anyway and as you say after the first phases over then Israeli troops can go right back into the campaign to destroy Hamas in Gaza do you is that what how you see it well I mean that's how I see it in large part because and again it's not oneand clamping Hamas is a key player in this obviously I just don't see anyone that yaka sinir will give up the 50 remaining hostages that he could that he'll hold that is the male uh IDF and civilians that he holds for anything other than a complete cessation of hostilities and as long as Yahya sinir is the leader of Hamas and Hamas appears to be a viable organization there is no way Benjamin Netanyahu is going to agree to a permanent cessation of hostilities their end games are mutually irreconcilable and that's the problem we're going to face there is no strategic solution to Goa we didn't even talk about the the emerging escalation that we may face on the Israeli lebanes border any day now yeah which is going to have an impact on what's planned for next Thursday in either Doha or or kaido yeah we will definitely be watching events next week and as you say um yeah it is a powder KAG every day can change Mr Miller it's good to have you on the show Good to get your analysis tonight thank you thanks for having me as the families of Israeli hostages wait for their loved ones to be freed the people of Gaza are also desperate for the fighting to end the Hamas run Health Ministry there says that almost 40,000 people have been killed in the war in Gaza 10 months into Israel's war with Hamas thousands of gazans are again forced to flee many have moved multiple times to escape the fighting now they're leaving Han Yunis as Israel steps up its attacks once [Music] again there's no safe area I'm telling you we cannot find a place to stay we are thrown in the streets and calling on them calling on them to see us because we are tired by God we are tired by God we are tired it's not just Israel's attacks that shatter any sense of security a lack of food clean water and basic supplies means it's a daily struggle to survive we are tired of this life by God death is better than this let the country see our situation and find a solution we are tired we've died 100 times Israeli attacks have heard two schools in Gaza City in recent days gaza's Civil Defense Agency said more than 18 people were killed the Israeli military said it struck Hamas command centers well I'm joined Now by journalist B slad he's in Tel Aviv this evening B let me ask you the the mediators here the United States Egypt and Qatar they say that they only need to work out the details of implementation of a SE fire that Israel and Hamas need to just get the details out of the way um what are the sticking points for Israel well the sticking points are the same basically the four points that Netanyahu designated as his red lines uh first of all the Israeli presence in the Philadelphia Corridor the uh border between isra between excuse me Egypt and the Gaza Strip in which Israel believes that Hamas smuggles through the tunnels there their weaponry and that's what we are seeing every day by the IDF that exposes more and more tunnels in that area so Israel wants to have a presence there uh that's first the second point is the fact that Israel doesn't want any uh person who is armed uh to go back to the north of the Gaza Strip the area that Israel wants to keep as free of any of the Armed groups in the Gaza trip and maybe the most important disagreement that has no solution yet and I don't think that there will be any solution of it that Israel wants to uh resume the war after the beginning of after the end of the first phase of the uh um the deal and Hamas of course they want Israel to declare that they are stopping the war so they can guarantee for themselves that they keep their position in the Gaza Strip and the day after what is your sense um is Netanyahu is he sending negotiators in good faith to these talks is he willing to sign on to a ceasefire agreement if the sticking points are clarified or is this just more window dressing or buying time for a leader who wants to you know stay in power well um there is political uh um incentive for every every politician out there but uh when Netanyahu send this delegation I don't think that anyone in Israel thinks that we are getting closer to a deal basically a source in Israel said today that uh uh the disagreements are still very wide and uh uh the uh expectation should be limited that nothing will actually it changed yya sinar's position and specifically talking about yya Sinar who became right now the also the political leader of the Hamas movement uh the belief in Israel that he does want to deal right now because of the regional escalation because he wants a regional War at least some escalation that can be a benefiting for him uh for uh the ultimate goal of destroying Israel or at least the continuation of this um ongoing uh um not exactly War but the whole situation between Israel and hisbah and Iran and the other broes okay but we will certainly be following developments as we know you will as well journalist baladin in telis tonight Bing thank you thank you
