the US has vetoed an Arab back resolution in the UN Security Council demanding a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas Hamas is labeled a terrorist organization in many countries the US says it will instead propose its own resolution it's calling for a temporary ceasefire linked to the release of Israeli hostages the Algeria sponsored plan representing several Arab Nations calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire as well as the release of all hostages Council okay let's get more on this from DW's Washington bureau chief inis Paul inis um tell us why the US vetoed this proposal put forward by Algeria Washington said that the Algerian proposed resolution would jeopardize talks to end the war arguing uh that it was not the right time to call for an immediate ceasefire while while NE negotiations between Hamas uh and Israel were continuing Ana I think it's worth to mention here that 13 countries on the 15 member body backed algeria's resolution but the UK abstained and the US vetoed it okay so help us understand the main differences then between the Algerian proposal which was vetoed and Washington's own proposal right so the difference lies uh in the requirements that need uh to be uh fulfilled the draft resolution proposed by the US calls for a temporary ceasefire as soon as practicable and on the condition that all hostages are released um however it is unclear if or when the security Council will vote on the form of words proposed uh by Washington okay and and this is the first time that the US has used this word ceasefire isn't it what does this say about its current relations with Israel right so this really marks uh uh a moment uh the Biden Administration has not only come under immense International pressure uh to use its leverage to reign in Israel's devastating operations uh but Biden uh is also facing intense pressure from members of his own party to speak more forcefully uh on the situation in Gaza and of course for uh in this election year in this election year which is just uh beginning uh he's also risking Biden is also risking to lose important voter bodies uh like young voters or Arab Americans because of his support uh for Israel inis thanks so much for that update that's DW's Washington bureau chief inis Paul now in Israel authorities are working hard to help residents return to areas that were left empty after the trauma of the terror attacks carried out by Hamas on October the 7th last year DW's special correspondent amyan ISF visited the city of stot which is near the border with the Gaza Strip a kindergarten here has now reopened as some families return to the city the voices of children in a classroom it's a sound that had left the city for 4 months around 90% of sto's population fled in the days following the Hamas terror attack even children this young had heard Hamas Rockets fall before the latest War but October 7th was a new kind of Terror for the few families that have decided to return it's an important day it's a kind of routine we're starting to go back to a daily schedule back to sanity after this catastrophe that we experienced on that s day and all those months we spend away from here I call it Exile in Judaism it's called Exile when you're away from your natural habitat and the kids as you can see are having lots of fun being around their classmates again in their natural habitat it's our home after [Music] all the city is clearing the debris of a battle this empty lot was the site of a police station stormed and then occupied by Hamas militants a mural marks the standoff that ensued when Israeli troops destroyed the building with the attackers inside many of the scars that were left by the attack have been patched over but still 2/3 of the city's 30,000 residents haven't come back st's Deputy Mayor expects that it will take another month at least before even half of the residents return you can come if you don't have we are not encouraged we are enabling and this it's a big difference we not call people come here to Theo it's good for you because it's very personal someone that is good for him he will come someone that his child is very afraid and have a post-traumatic Disorder so stay out of the city for a long time but we are enabling everyone to come here to H start again the military has assured him the city is secure and Hamas hasn't launched rockets in this direction in 2 weeks but many say they won't feel safe unless Hamas is destroyed little by little stot is recovering from the horror of October 7th and returning to some kind of daily life the explosions that you hear on a regular basis in this city keep everybody on edge but they know that for now at least it's the sound of Israeli shells hitting Gaza which is just over a kilometer away there it's an active war zone and a return to routine is still Unthinkable and I'm joined Now by DW's amyan ISF in Jerusalem who filed that report for us Ian um you said in your report two-thirds of the city's residents still haven't come back can you describe to us how life has changed in stot since uh the October the 7th attacks what do people there told you well it's completely different I mean for one thing it feels like a ghost town a lot of the shops are still boarded up uh people expect the life to return but it's happening little by little for a lot of people they wanted to move back just to get back to their daily routine um they had to go back to work they wanted to get their kids back to school for others though there's more of a religious aspect to it some people we talk to cited Zionism uh the belief that they need to stand their ground no matter what happens to maintain their claim to the land no matter what happens uh in the face of any kind of tragedy and that was their motivating factor for moving back before they felt completely safe now the city has been traumatized by what happened on October 7th it's uh for a long time been the target of Rocket attacks but nobody had seen anything like what happened uh on October 7th when Hamas militants ran through the streets indiscriminately killing civilians about at least 20 civilians were killed on that day so there is now a sense of Victory after IDF the IDF secured the area and then started its campaign on Gaza where most of the people in Northern Gaza were forced South um and the city there was uh completely bombed it might be jarring to an outsider but there is a sense of Pride that the city is of s stot is opening back up that people are getting on with their lives as much as they can even as their just a few kilometers and some places just a kilometer away from an active war zone I mean you can grab a pair of binoculars go up on a hill and look into uh what is a war zone you can see uh the rubble left behind by the bombing campaign in Northern Gaza I mean of course you reported that many of aot's residents haven't come back so what is stopping them from moving back and where are they right now well for many it's still trauma uh young kids kids uh who are not yet ready to go back there don't forget a lot of the the stot is a city but it's a small City and a lot of people who live there saw with their own eyes what happened on October 7th and are just not yet ready to confront them those memories yet for other people they don't want to go back to a ghost town yet they want to see uh wait and see uh what happens with the city and uh businesses opening back up they want to go back to a lively City and and not be the Pioneers who open that City back up another issue is that the evacuees are getting subsidies from the government they're allowed to live in hotels outside of the city and for a lot of people this just makes a lot more sense than moving back to stot uh at the at the moment so there's a lot of reasons why people um are staying away we went to a hotel in Jerusalem where there was lots of families uh basically holed up uh waiting for the right time to move back um but they told us all that they will eventually move back to their Hometown I mean we'll have to leave it there but thanks so much for that that's DW's am and ISF reporting from
