the United Nations says nearly 340,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in Gaza with fears of a humanitarian crisis growing as Israel continues to launch air strikes against the territory the footage you're about to see was released by the Israeli military Israel says it's hitting targets linked to the terrorist group Hamas in retaliation for its unprecedented attacks over the weekend that killed at least 1,200 people in Israel meanwhile Palestinian author ities in Gaza say more than a thousand people have been killed there from Israeli strikes gazer is also lacking electricity after its only power station ran out of fuel people are using generators to power their homes but Israel's blockade means they too will soon run dry food water and medical supplies are also running [Music] low emergency vehicles arrive nonstop transporting wounded Palestinians to hospitals in Gaza medical workers must act fast to save as many injured as possible while there is still hope for some families that their relatives can be saved many others are left to Grapple with their loss in an effort to Aid civilians trapped in Gaza the Palestinian representative to the UN pleaded for humanitarian assistance we will continue the uh contacts with everyone including the security Council so that the International Community to shoulder its responsibility in stepping to the to the picture and in putting uh an end to this Onslaught against our people but more importantly that would require of course sending humanitarian assistance to the uh 2 million3 uh of Palestinians who live in the Gaza Strip uh there has to be a humanitarian intervention in order to uh to avoid uh a looming catastrophe echon his words the World Health Organization want of dwindling medical supplies we need more trauma supplies uh we need intravenous fluids we need bandages we need anesthetic equipment we need surgical equipment uh and you know all the different supplies uh equipment medicines that you may need uh for for major traumatic injuries whether they be head wounds chest wounds abdominal wounds uh uh fractured Lings uh and burns and so on as diplomatic efforts to open humanitarian corridors to people in Gaza continue There is fear that for many Palestinians help me not arrive soon enough and for more on this we're going to go over now to Jerusalem and talk to shy Lo who is spokesperson with the Norwegian Refugee Council thank you for coming on to the program your organization is on the ground in Gaza what are you hearing from there yeah so I just spoke about 30 minutes ago to my colleague in Gaza uh he said that last night was an extremely difficult night the bombardments were continuing uh all throughout the night he told me of a number of air strikes that resulted in massive Ian casualties uh this morning uh or last night rather uh the house behind where my colleague was staying was hit with an air strike thankfully he and his my colleague and his family were unharmed but because of the blackout uh they were unable to even clean up safely the glass that had shattered from their Windows um because they just could not see in the dark this morning he described to me challenges in just getting around uh Gaza shortages in bread uh being able to to make the way make a make it to be able to to navigate the streets which are filled with rubble and difficult to to navigate the situation in Gaza is truly um unbelievable in terms of the the humanitarian crisis we're facing yeah Shina and part of the reason this is so acute is because it's it's apparent that no Aid is getting into into Gaza because of uh the blockade what do you fear if this blockade continues I mean we are fearing an even larger humanitarian catastrophe than the one that we're already witnessing right now uh the supplies in Gaza are very limited there already was a Siege on Gaza even prior to this total siege that was imposed over the last week and so what we are hearing from our colleagues is that supplies are dwindling food prices are already on the rise bakeries are saying that they have less than a week supply of of material of of uh of food uh and and ingredients I mean this is this is literally going to be 2.3 million Palestinians uh trapped inside of Gaza with no relief in sight uh unless unless there's uh unless there's an opening of humanitarian corridors for the entry of of Aid and other Provisions sh I want us to talk specifically here about the uh the aid that's needed um in respect to the emergency response helping the wounded uh as as the air strikes and the bombardment on the territory uh continues what needs to happen to be able to save civilian lives I mean first and foremost there needs to be electricity restored to the Gaza Strip hospitals are operating on emergency generators and will soon run out of supplies and fuel for those we need medical equipment medical supplies yesterday there was the announcement that all of the hospital beds in Gaza were full um I mean this is a a a humanitarian catastrophe that is happening before us and and there needs to be uh assistance both in terms of restoration of water electricity fuel um food medicine access to medicine and other uh medical supplies they all need to be let into Gaza immediately all right Shina low is with the Norwegian Refugee Council she's talking to us from Jerusalem we appreciate uh you're coming on to the program Shina thank you thank you and now we are going to go to Gaza where hisam Mana is standing by for us he's a Communications officer with the international Committee of the Red Cross joins me by phone uh it's very difficult right now to establish uh good connections um thank you so much uh for coming on to to the program if you can hear me I'd like to start by just asking you what you're seeing on the ground there where you are what we're seeing is absolutely unprecedented we are witnessing a a catastrophe of um of Hope a crisis and the humanitarian situation uh complete shutdown of the sole uh Power Plant of the Gaza Strip that feeds uh households or what's left of the neighborhoods uh uh and the infrastructure feeding them but also um hospitals um across all the G STP are imped the water and water sector is paralyzed at the moment in the vast areas of the Gaza STP this would lead if the situation continues like this to an environmental crisis because sewage is pumped into or mixing with the with the water you know infrastructure um so this is also an imminent risk that we are alarmed by but focusing on the medical situation in G STP which is a catastrophe the Ministry of Health has called for immediate injury of medical supplies equipment and fuel to run uh keep the hospital running and there are hundreds of seriously injured patients uh who are connected to oxygen supply there are newborns who are living inside incubators and one of the hospitals that include that incubators got damaged and that section in specific was partially damaged uh we have witness targeting of medical uh staff yesterday four of the emergency medical team of the palestin chrisan society uh were IMM were like directly targeted and they were killed um while conducting their humanitarian Mission rescuing injuries um the hospitals now are suffering from Fear shortage in the medical supplies many not most of the ham I I just want to to come in there and continue our conversation I'm hearing you say that you you've witnessed um medical staff being directly targeted that would be of course a very serious um allegation over there perhaps you can expand on that but but also while you're at it Hisham what would you say is most needed right now in in in Gaza the most needed thing in Gaza now is strain the escalation and to to allow the humanitarian Aid fuel food and medic and medication into the G St uh this is the most pressing uh need now to continue saving lives and to prevent the humanitarian situation from further deterioration into a complete full crisis and how long how long do you think um what is your assessment about how long civilians can hold on without help there are still families under the rubble uh some of them lost some of their peers like lost hope of of of having them back some are still the unreachable by the civil defense because the lack of equipment and the lack of safe access to to these locations uh so that's one side of the story the civilians in Gaza like entire neighborhoods were asked to evacuate without clear safe passages and some of like hundreds of families have to relocate for two three times in one day seeking Safe Haven uh there's a crisis of Hope and there's absolute um lack of sense of Safety and Security and now families fear for their children if they're going to witness the next morning yeah his what do you need right now from the International Community uh in in in this regard as as you're talking to us hisam we can see pictures of the devastation uh in Gaza we see buildings that have been raised flattened and and you're telling us there are potentially families and under some of this Rubble what would be your message uh to the International Community um from the uh uh uh Red Cross operating in Gaza right now yes uh uh there has to be a full respect of the international humanitarian law that calls for the protection of civilians civilian properties medical commissions uh uh this is uh and also um um infrastructure that's uh important and vital to continue feeding people with water energy uh and medical health care this is uh uh the utmost concern of the rcrc and this is what we have been calling for and this is what we have trying to you know to force with the the both sides of the conflict civilians should not pay the heavy cost every single time and every round of escalation they should be not paying uh you know the prize for the failure of a political solution to end this escalation that has been lasting for decades we have been existing here since 1967 in Israel and the occupied territories we have never witnessed that large scale of Devastation in a matter of a few days so uh what we are asking for is uh full Restraint of violence to to protect civilians protect civilian properties to allow the medical missions to reach safely to those who are injured and most importantly now also to allow the entry of the humanitarian Aid the required food medication to save uh 2.3 million people plus all right that is the voice of Hisham Mana he is Communications officer with the international uh Committee of the Red Cross talking to us from Gaza we appreciate that uh Hisham and all the best to you and your colleagues as you continue the work you're doing in Gaza thank you now many of the hundreds of thousands of displaced people in Gaza are seeking help from the United Nation CW visited a family in one un facility where assistance is certain to be stretched to the limit in the coming days they are 13 in all umani alula and her immediate family they found a degree of safety at a un run school not far from the Egyptian border on the first day of the war we saw missiles flying over our heads our neighborhood is dangerous it's on the Eastern side we were afraid to stay home God knows how we got out but we escaped our circumstances are difficult this is not a solution the children need milk and diapers anra can't offer us anything this is our fourth day at the school I have high blood pressure and diabetes and I can't get medication hundreds of thousands have fled like umani Al gul's family most but not all before their homes and neighborhoods were reduced to Rubble Israel is retaliating for the crossb terrorist attacks and hostage taking by Hamas the Israeli Defense Forces say they they are focused on Hamas related targets unra the United Nations relief and works agency is providing shelter in spaces like this it's tight and getting tighter but for umani Al gul's family it seems safer than their home there are large numbers of Palestinians in unra schools we provide them with Health Care food we provide clean water and also psychological support but the numbers are growing hugely one's capacity is for 150,000 displaced Palestinians and beyond that it is a big problem a financial problem a problem with absorbing all of these people there is also the problem of the people needed to help them Beyond The Limited space in the UN displacement centers each of them is impacted by Israel's Complete Siege of the Gaza Strip it's cut off food water medicines and electricity we were living in a safe place the war broke out the strikes began without warning and we were forced to leave we walked about 7 km until we arrived here hoping to find a safe place it's not like that here and this is not suitable for living there is no water no food the sewage system is broken it's not suitable for living umani alula and her family will have to get by in a six meter wide room as they wait for an end to what could become a drawn out Siege and War well the White House says that the US is working with Israel and Egypt in an attempt to set up safe corridors for civilians in Gaza Egypt's President also says that he's intensifying efforts to contain this conflict the Rafa Crossing on the Egyptian border was the last hope for gazin trying to flee but it is now closed unverified footage from social media which you see right here claims to show a large crowd near the crossing as bombs were falling nearby the United Nations says the bombardment has displaced more than 260,000 Gins but with the crossing now shut there's little chance of Escape for any of the 2.3 million residents of G well AFP journalist bahir Ami joins me now from Cairo B tell us about the situation right now at the Rafa border crossing uh at this moment the latest information we have is that the raah border crossing has remained closed since yesterday after it was hit by three Israeli air strikes within 24 hours um The Crossing as you said is the only access point into and out of Gaza that is not controlled by Israel uh it is the only potential humanitarian Corridor in the middle of what Israel has announced to be a complete Siege uh between Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon uh there were three year rounds of strikes on the Palestinian side of the border crossing which damaged the facility we have eyewitnesses yesterday seeing saying Egyptian employees were evacuated from the area dozens of Palestinian families who had been trying to get back into Gaza were turned back towards the Egyptian town of Alish um Egypt as you said has set it intents to keep the crossing open has pushed for humanitarian humanitarian Aid to get through uh foreign minister SE shuk said today the government is committed to getting Aid through we know there have been attempts uh on the Egyptian side at least one shipment of Medical Aid from the Egyptian Red cresant made it through on Monday before the first air strike um and ever since calls for Aid of multiplied the latest came today from the meeting of the Arab League foreign ministers uh who also called for the seat to be lifted and then again from the United Nations as you said um so there has been this concerted push to make sure that medicine food fuel Emergency Equipment all make it a Gaza but what that will actually look like remains to be seen yeah we know that before the Border closed Egypt was letting in a limited number of Palestinians um is Egypt now fearing Mass displacement of people I mean is Egypt willing to have a ref Refugee crisis come onto its territory um so the situation now is that Egypt has already committed itself on Aid getting through to Gaza but what it has not done is indicate that it will be accepting refugees at all um Cairo is in a situation it finds historically very complex um again this is the only access point to Gaza not under Israeli control there's a push to allow civilians to come into Egypt um the US has said it is coordinating with both Israel and Egypt to gu safe passage for civilians but that's something Egypt has historically not allowed um there have been no official statements from Egyptian authorities but there is something very telling in the statements that state aligned media have been sharing um which cite high level security forces in saying that Egypt stands solidly against proposals of settling the people of Gaza in Sinai which they say only serves the occupation only the occupation only serves Israel's interests um and there is a historical fear I called by Palestinians and a larger a popular discourse that if Palestinians were to leave their homes in search of safety in the case of attack they would lose their homes um at the same time there is a call for those who would want to leave to be allowed to um and now you're seeing sources very close to the Egyptian government saying that Palestinians are being forced to choose between death under Israeli bombing or displacement from their land yeah um but as you say even in times of relative calm Passage through RAF is very tightly controlled it's prohibitive slow it's expensive bureaucratic limited to humanitarian cases um so what remains to be seen was going to happen but president CeCe was also very careful to release a statement saying that Egypt's National Security is his primary responsibility okay AFP journalist B I mean with the ladies tonight from Cairo bahira thank
