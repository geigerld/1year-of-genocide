the leaders of the US Egypt and Qatar have demanded the resumption of talks to stop the fighting in Gaza they issued a joint statement saying only the details of carrying out any ceasefire and hostage release need to be worked out Israel has said it would send negotiators to Doha or KIRO on August 15th Hamas has yet to respond the recent assassination of Hamas political leader in tan widely blamed on Israel's raised tensions across the region some saying it's complicated peace efforts and let's bring in Rebecca riders in Jerusalem we both know how complicated this has been from the start uh Rebecca but what is the likelihood in in your uh in your opinion of these talks actually taking part first of all taking uh Place well I think they will uh they with all likelihood will take place Ben I mean you just said yourself though this region is very complicated you yourself have reported from here and everyone knows that the talks are supposed to take place on Thursday a week in this region is a lifetime and Anything Could Happen of course we're waiting uh for retaliatory responses from both Hezbollah and Iran should that happen then you know it's very likely that the talks will either be put on hold or certainly certainly delayed but but otherwise given given the uh The Joint statement released yesterday and then of course the prime minister's office here issuing a statement saying that Israel will take part in the talks does mean that they are likely to go ahead on Thursday at a yet to be determined location this of course is uh the latest iteration of a deal it's based on the framework uh set out by US President Joe Biden at the end of May and you know both sides Hamas and Israel have been close to agreeing on this deal but there are still sticking points both sides blaming each other for those sticking points we'll just have to see what comes out of these latest round of negotiations next week okay so run us through those sticking points again yeah most of the same issues keep coming up we have been talking about this now for months and at various times throughout all of these discussions these various iterations of various deals uh we have been talking about the same sticking points namely the the the discussion or the talking point around the complete cessation of hostilities that's something that Hamas has been demanding and it's something that Israel is saying is absolutely off the table it wants to have the ability to resume fighting uh after a period perhaps after the first phase of the hostage negot iations is complete and some of the hostages have been released um particularly a sticking point being reported uh in this is something around article 14 which of course I don't expect people to be familiar with but the language is uh around the duration of negotiations that Hamas and Israel are supposed to start during that first phase of negotiations now uh the original language as it stands now is that the US Qatar and Egypt those key negotiating Partners will make every effort to ensure that these negotiations end in an agreement for a permanent ceasefire now Hamas want that language to be changed from uh make every effort to ensure to try and firm up that agreement we've been hearing from the Israeli side that that's something they're unlikely to agree to so of course while we talk about ironing out the finer details these finer details are indeed very important and still mean that both sides are pretty far apart and Rebecca what kind of pressure is the hostage situation putting on Netanyahu to come to any agreement well just after the joint statement was issued Ben we heard from the hostage families Forum as a representative body for the families of the hostages they said the government and the Prime Minister must demonstrate leadership uh and conclude a deal without further delay they have been putting uh ramping up the pressure I could say on on the government and on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu we've been seeing weekly protests even more than weekly uh at times we've been seeing you know them calling in the media that they want this to be the most important thing that the government is pursuing of course is the release of the hostages well uh of course Nyah who is also pursuing his military aims which he says is equally important and that's completely dismantling Hamas uh you know for the families of the hostages it must just be an agonizing I think frustrating uh is isn't strong enough definitely an agonizing weight as they see as they get hope every time that you know the Us and other people say that we're close to a deal and then of course those hopes are dashed when the deal fails uh they have been putting on pressure though I should say for you know the entire time and it still hasn't been enough so whether or not you know they can ramp up the pressure and and affect you know a different response from Israel this time remains to be seen but you know we haven't seen that in the last nine or so months since the last hostage deal we haven't seen another deal so you know the pressure is you know not being ignored by the government but certainly not getting it over the line when it comes to agreeing to this deal yeah definitely 10 months of Agony for the families of hostages in Israel and uh 10 months of Agony for the people of Gaza too Rebecca thank you very much for bringing us up to date running through the prospects gersan Basin is an Israeli Peace activist he operated a negotiating Channel with Hamas for the release of the Israeli soldier gilach chalit whom Hamas held hostage for over five years I asked him what message mediators are trying to send with his new BR of talks well first of all I would caution is speaking about a peace agreement we're not talking about peace we're talking about a ceasefire an end to the war the release of Israeli hostages the release of Palestinian prisoners it's a far call from peace so let's focus on that that needs to be done what has happened with the recent announcement joint Announcement by the United States Qatar and Egypt seems to be some kind of changing of the rules that they've been playing by for the last 10 months it seems that the mediators have come to the conclusion that they shouldn't carry out these negotiations unended that they have said that they are calling for the parties to show up on the 15th of August they are prepared to put bridging proposals on the table which is really the first time we've heard this and it seems to me that they are a strong arming both Israel and Hamas into getting to the talks and hopefully reaching an agreement that will put an end to this war and release the Israeli 115 Israeli hostages who are still in Gaza in hindsight what do you think now of the galit exchange in which hamas's Yahya Sina was released he said to have planned the October 7 attacks on Israel right I I don't think it's really relevant to the discussion but we have to remember that gilad shalik was in captivity for 5 years and four months the Israeli held in uh enemy captivity for longer than any other Israeli the deal that was on the table had actually been on the table 6 months after abduction from an army base inside of Israel it took 5 years until the parties's reached an agreement on that deal it was not a good deal but it was the only deal to bring the Israeli soldier home which is part of the Israeli ethos or what has been the Israeli ethos that we don't leave anyone behind and we're willing to pay a high price for our people to return civilians and military people the problem is not the deal itself the problem is that since he was released in 2011 nothing was done to put an end to the Israeli Palestinian conflict this is our tragedy there is no military solution to this conflict there never has been one there is no military solution for dealing with Hamas there never has been one what we need is a political solution which requires negotiations it requires us to make Palestine real for the Palestinian people for us to turn the two-state solution into a reality it will require Germany for example to recognize the state of Palestine and to call on other nations to recognize both Israel and Palestine the reason I ask you about that deal which you say wasn't good is is is there anything that makes you think this current deal is going to be any better no it won't be better but 115 Israelis are captivity are captive in Gaza for 12 months for 10 months a majority of them are believed to no longer be alive this goes completely against the Israeli ethos they were abandoned by the country they were not defended they were taken from their homes and mil bases from their beds in pajamas and held in captivity by the state of Israel which failed to protect its border and failed to protect its citizens and the government of Israel has a moral responsibility to bring them home no one should be left in Gaza this has to end there is a price for ending that for bringing them home it also has to end because tens of thousands of people have been killed in Gaza most of them non-combatants 2 million people there are homeless their homes have been destroyed too much damage has been done this has to end we're talking about some 40,000 deaths according to the hamus L Health authorities in Gaza um but we've also seen so many hostage deaths as you uh point out how much negotiating power then does Hamas actually have right now Hamas can negotiate forever until they until all the hostage of the dead then even Israel will negotiate for the return of their bodies but we don't want that to happen Hamas is not going to surrender Israel would like to find the Hamas leadership and kill them but there's no guarantee that once they do that if they do that the hostages will remain alive if we want to get these people home we're talking about still some children women elderly people sick and wounded people they have to be brought home there is no way to bring them home without a negotiated agreement Israel has been trying to find them and rescue them for 10 months and in those 10 months we've only rescued a handful of them well let's hope we can uh see a ceasefire soon and maybe even peace at some stage as you underlined earlier Israeli Peace activist and negotiator gersan Baskin thank you very much for your time thank you and as the families of Israeli hostages wait for their loved ones to be freed the people of Gaza are also desperate for the fighting to stop the Hamas run Health Ministry saying almost 40,000 people have been killed as I mentioned 10 months into Israel's war with Hamas thousands of gazans are again forced to flee many have moved multiple times to escape the fighting now they're leaving Han Yunis as Israel steps up its attacks once [Music] again there's no safe area I'm telling you we cannot find a place to stay we are thrown in the streets and calling on them calling on them to see us because we are tired by God we are tired by God we are tired it's not just Israel's attacks that shatter any sense of security a lack of food clean water and basic supplies means it's a daily struggle to survive we are tired of this life by God death is better than this let the country see our situation and find a solution we are tired we've died 100 times Israeli attacks have hit two schools in Gaza City in recent days gaza's Civil Defense Agency said more than 18 people were killed the Israeli military said it struck Hamas command centers
