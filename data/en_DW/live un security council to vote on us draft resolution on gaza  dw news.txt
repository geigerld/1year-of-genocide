the 9,584 meeting of the Security Council is called to order the provisional agenda for this meeting is the situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian question the agenda is adopted in accordance with with rule 37 of the council's provisional rules of procedure I invite the representative of Israel to participate in this meeting it is so decided the security Council will now begin its consideration of item two of agenda members of the council have before them document s224 239 the text of the draft resolution submitted by the United States of America the council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it I now give the floor to those members of the council who wish to make statements before the vote I give the floor to the representative of the United States thank you Mr President colleagues for all the stories that have been written about divisions in this Council and there are many real divisions I believe most of us share many of the same goals first and foremost we want to see an immediate and sustained ceasefire as part of a deal that leads to the release of all hostages being held by Hamas and other groups and that will allow much more life-saving humanitarian Aid to get into Gaza of course we can't just want that to happen we have to make that happen we have to do the hard work of diplomacy I know you've heard me say that a lot and that's because it's the truth a security Council resolution means much less if it is not actually made real on the ground that's why the United States Egypt and Qatar are working around the clock in the region to secure an immediate and sustained ceasefire as part of a deal that leads to the release of all hostages being held by Hamas and other groups that will help us address the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza we believe we're close we're not there yet unfortunately and this moment is one where the security Council has a critical role to play by adopting the resolution before us we can put pressure on Hamas to accept the deal on the table colleagues you don't need me to tell you that every day without a deal meaning every day without a ceasefire leads to more needless suffering for more than 100 hostages including a one-year-old child being held in cap captivity by Hamas and other groups for innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have been displaced who are starving who desperately need peace for Israelis whove continued to face missile attacks from Hamas a terrorist group that set this conflict into motion on October 7th every day without a deal means more needless suffering this resolution will move us closer to securing that deal and help us alleviate that suffering and I urge all council members to vote Yes to vote for a resolution that at long last condemn SAS for horrific terrorist attacks and sexual violence that makes clear that all civilians Palestinians and Israelis should be able to live without fear of violence that demands the protection of civilians in Gaza and stresses that a major ground offensive in Rafa poses a grave threat to civilians even as we still work toward eliminating Hamas from all parts of Gaza that calls on Israel to eliminate all barriers and restrictions to humanitarian Aid especially as the threat of famine looms large in Northern Gaza that condemns calls to resettle Gaza and makes clear that the Palestinian Authority should have ultimate authority over Gaza and that reiterates this council's support for a two-state solution this is a strong resolution it's the byproduct of the exhaustive inclusive negotiations it reflects the consensus of this Council and it does more than just call for a ceasefire it helps to make that make a ceasefire possible it would be a historic mistake for the council to not adopt this text and I again urge all council members to vote yes thank you Mr President I thank the representative of the United States for their statement I give the floor to the representative of Russian Federation Mr President the United Nations security Council has for half a year six months been unable to adopt a document with a demand for a ceasefire in Gaza all of the attempts time and again came up against the resistance of the United States who four times in Cold Blood cast a veto in this chamber in this time we have heard from us colleagues repeatedly their justifications either they were saying that the achievement of a fire is premature in so far as there is a need to give space for so-call counterterrorism efforts of Israel or they demanded for the security Council not to stand in the way of effective diplomacy of Washington on the ground that is a quote or they called for us to wait for the onset of Ramadan when apparently an agreement would definitely be reached for a cease for an end to the violence and now six months have eled Gaza has virtually been wiped from the earth and now the US Representative without blinking has been asserting that Washington has finally begun to recognize the need for a ceasefire sluggish thought process in Washington has cost the lives has been come at the cost of the lives of 32,000 peaceful Palestinians two3 of whom are women and children and even now we have observed a typical hypocritical spectacle when wrapped up in a ceasefire the United States have been trying to sell a product to the membership of Security Council and to the entire International Community they've been trying to sell something completely different namely a d formulation about a about a definition and determination of the imperative for this kind philosophical passages about moral imperatives are seen in limited quantities in the work of Emanuel Kant however to save the lives of peaceful CI Palestinian civilians this is not enough and this is in no way what is stipulated in the Mandate of the UN Security Council Council which is vested with a unique mechanism to demand a ceasefire and were necessary to compel compliance therewith US Secretary of State Antony blinkin during an official interview in jida on the 2th of March with the correspondent Al stated and I quote well in fact we in fact we actually have a resolution that we put forward right now that's before the UN Security Council call for an immediate ceas tied to the release of hostages and we hope very much that countries will support that end quote however in the text of the US draft which has been put to the vote today there is no such quote so what turns out is that either the US representative of the United Nations or the US Secretary of State have been deliberately misleading the International Community distinguished colleagues from the very onset it was clear that the So-Cal negotiations which our us colleagues have been engaged in on this issue have been focused gear merely to drag out the time all of our comments all of our red lines were time in time disregarded as were the proposals of a number of other delegations this was some kind of an empty rhetorical exercise rather than normal work on docum the American product is exceedingly politicized the sole purpose of which is to help to uh play into play to the voters to throw them a bone in the form of some kind of a menion of a ceasefire in Gaza and to establish the US's political Ambitions in the region through the establishment of terrorist labels and to ensure the impunity of Israel whose crimes in the draft are not I wish to draw attention to the following the US tra contains an effective green light for Israel to mount a military operation in Rafa at the very least the authors try to make it to such that nothing would prevent Western Jerusalem from continuing their brutal cleansing of the south of the Gaza Strip and what is Washington actually trying to achieve we have already stated that we will no longer tolerate pointless resolutions which do not contain a call for a ceasefire which lead us to Nowhere this draft should not with the majority of the membership to send a message about admissibility not the paliative but the actual intentions of Washington it would be very strange for us to see that those members of the Council of whom there are a majority who understand this and who persuaded us of the deficiencies in the US draft it would be we be surprised if they now lift their hands voting in favor of it ladies and gentlemen do this you will cover yourselves in disgrace consider once again how will you look before the population in the Middle East in front of your own populations if you support this hypocritical initiative which is designed to disorient the International Community and essentially to undermine the authority of the council uh making sure that it cannot have an impact on the situation on the ground that this Council will not be able to have an impact of the situation on the ground to ensure that it not get in the way of the White House are you willing to play into their hands when it comes to this unsavory spectacle the Russian Federation will not do this as a permanent member of the UN secur Council as one of the founders of the United Nations we recognize the historical Global responsibility we shoulder for the maintenance of International Peace and security we cannot allow the security Council to become an inst instrument in the advancement of Washington's destructive policy in the Middle East if this resolution is to be adopted this would definitively close the door when it comes to discussions about the need for a ceas fire in Gaza this would free the hands of Israel and it would result in all of Gaza and its entire population having to face destruction Devastation or expulsion we are not Guided by what is convenient for Washington and sadle satellites The Satellites who rais their hands following instructions from Washington we do not follow this what we what guides us is what is necessary for the Palestinian people and what helps to advance peace call upon the membership of the security Council not to allow this to occur to vote against the US draft Mr President for the United Nations security Council to ultimately be in a position to deliver upon its mandate for the Mand maintenance of International Peace and security a number of non-permanent members of Security Council have drafted an alternative draft resolution which stipulates black on white the demand for both a ceasefire and the unconditional release of hostages this is a balanced and a a political document we see no reason for which the membership of the security Council for the members of the security Council not to support this unless a ceasefire and the release of hostages is not part of their plans this is an attempt to allow the council to comply with the noble functions that have been vested in it and I call for you not to let this opportunity slip away thank you for your attention I thank the representative of Russian Federation for their statement I shall put the draft I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now will those in will those in favor of the draft resolution contained in document 239 please raise their abstention the result of the Voting is as follows 11 votes in favor three votes against one abstention the draft resolution has not been adopted owning to the negative vote of a permanent member of the council I now I now give the floor to those members of the council who wish to make statements after the vote I give the floor to the representative of the United States thank you again Mr President colleagues today the the United States put forward a resolution in good faith after Consulting with all council members and after multiple rounds of edits the vast majority of this Council voted in favor of this resolution but unfortunately Russia and China decided to exercise its veto and now Russia and China will give you all sorts of explanations for his obstruction but whether or not it will admit it there are two deeply deeply cynical reasons behind its votes first Russian China still could not bring itself to condemn hamas's terrorist attacks on October 7th can we just pause on that for a moment Russia and China refuses to condemn Hamas for burning people alive for gunning down innocent civilians at a concert for raping women and girls for taking hundreds of people hostage this was the deadliest single attack on Jews since Holocaust and a permanent member of this Council can't even condemn it I'm sorry it's it's really outrageous and it's below the Dignity of this body the second reason behind this veto is not just cynical it's also Petty Russia and China simply did not want to vote for a resolution that was pinned by the United States because it would rather see us fail than to see this Council succeed even after inclusive consultations over weeks and weeks even after negotiations and edits produced a draft that received overwhelming Council support and as you saw today nearly every council member voted to put the full weight of this body behind the Diplomatic efforts to secure an immediate and sustain ceasefire as of all hostages that will allow much more humanitarian Aid to get into Gaza but once again Russia put politics over prog o over progress Russia who has carried out an unprovoked war on his neighbor has the audacity and the hypocrisy to throw stones when it lives in a glass house itself so let's be honest for all the fiery rhetoric we all know that Russia and China are not doing anything diplomatically to advance a lasting peace or to meaningfully contribute to the humanitarian response effort colleagues there is obviously another resolution that some of you would like to be considered but in its current form that text fails to support sensitive diplomacy in the region worse it is it could actually give Hamas an excuse to walk away from the deal on the table all of us want to see this Council speak out but we should not move forward with any resolution that jeopardizes the ongoing negotiations and these are not just negotiations that are being carried out by the United States others in the region Qatar and Egypt are engaged on these negotiations so if that alternative resolution comes up for a vote and does not support the diplomacy happening on the ground we may once again find this Council deadlocked I truly hope that that does not come about and so for our part the the United States will keep at it we'll continue to work toward a deal alongside Qatar and Egypt and we will work with any council member that is seriously interested in adopting a resolution that will help make that deal possible thank you Mr United Kingdom thank you president the United Kingdom voted yes on the text before us this morning we voted yes on the need for an immediate and sustained ceasefire to protect civilians allow humanitarian Aid in and alleviate suffering we voted yes on the call for an international humanitarian law to be upheld for the release of hostages to reject forced displacement and to urge a a ground offensive interfa president Palestinians are facing a devastating and growing humanitarian crisis which will not improve until more Aid can get in to Gaza so we are deeply disappointed that Russia and China were unable to support this Council to clearly and unequivocally State the need for an that end through this resolution the security Council would have rightly and for the first time unequivocally condemned Hass terrorist attacks we're disappointed that the council was not able to send this important message due to the vetos cast by Russia and China we welcome the patient and constructive consultation by the United States on this text for our part we will continue to do everything we can to get Aid into Gaza as quickly as possible by land sea and air but an immediate stop in the fighting is the only way to get a into Gaza that is so desperately needed and make progress towards a permanent sustainable ceasefire I thank you I thank the representative of the United Kingdom for their statement I give the I give the floor to the representative of Algeria thank you Mr [Music] President I address to you today not only as representative of Algeria but also as representative of the all Arab world witnessing the in folding tragedy in Palestine our region is devastated by the violence inflicted upon the Palestinian people live scenes of Destruction and killing inflicting profound suffering are not bearable anymore since the beginning of the aggression against the Palestinian people the Arab group have consistently called to put an end to disc carage only by seizing hostilities we can alleviate the immense suffering and ensure that large scale humanitarian assistance reaches those in Need for this purpose we presented last month a draft resolution who garnered significant support within the security Council but it was ultimately VTO it we firmly believe that its adoption could have saved thousand of Life of innocent people it is beyond any doubt that resolution 2712 and 2720 have Fall Fallen short due to the absence of a clear demand for a ceasefire those who believe that the Israeli occupying power will choose to uphold this its International legal obligation are mistaken they must abandon this fiction Mr President since the circulation of this draft resolution over a month ago Algeria has participated actively and in good faith in the negotiation process proposing reasonable idit to achieve a more balanced and acceptable text we acknowledge the effort made by the the US delegation especially Ambassador Greenfield in accommodating some of our proposals however our core concerns remained and addressed despite the many circulated revised versions throughout this process we emphasized relentlessly the urgency of an immediate ceasefire to prevent further loss of life we echoed the demand of millions of people and humanitarian actors for an immediate cessation of hostilities regrettably the draft resolution falls short of our expectations it fails to adequately address these main issues and the immense suffering enduring by the Palestinian people over five months the conflict in Gaza has resulted in the tragic loss of life of more than 32,000 Palestinian lives 32,000 Palestinian lives more than 74 injuries C 74,000 injuries with 12,000 suffering permanent disabilities These Are Not Mere statistics they represent lives they represent dreams they represent hopes who have been destroyed alarmingly the text avoid mentioning the responsibility of the Israeli occupying power these individuals were not lost due to act of self harm they were killed their perpetrators must be held accountable for us in the Arab world in the Islamic nation in the whole world Palestinians lives undeniably matter Mr President the text presented today does not convey a clear message of Peace it tedly allows for continuing civili civilian casualties and lack clear Safeguard to prevent further escalation it is a Le to continuing killing the Palestinian civilian the emphasis on measures I quote on measures to reduce civilian harm from ongoing and future operation and future operation implies a license for continuing Bloodshed in this context we are particularly concerned about a potential military operation in Rafa such a military operation would have devastating consequences Algeria along with other Regional countries has actively pursued reconciliation between Palestinian faction because we trust that United Palestine is essential for its fut future and the future of the peace process we believe that specific provision within the draft resolution geop pariz the future of the Palestinian State and hinder ongoing efforts building a Palestinian State requires the collective effort of all its citizens all its citizens and the SEC Security Council actions should support not impede this process Mr president Ena Ena plays a vital role in assisting Palestinian refugees not only in Palestine but also in Jordan in Lebanon Syria it is a tool of regional stability any resolution and undermining UNAM mandates would exacerbate the already dear humanitarian situation and Rua continuing operation is essential until Palestinian refugees are able to sustain themselves or to return home as stipulated by international law Mr President while supporting parallel efforts to end the Bloodshed this should not prevent the council from demanding a ceasefire a clear ceasefire to alleviate the suffering the security Council duty is by the charter to maintain International Peace security it should be empowered to impose to impose a ceasefire for all this reason Algeria voted against this draft resolution Mr President we urge all security M council members to prioritize the immediate cessation of hostilities the security Council must take decisive and meaningful action to help to all the violence and pave the way for a sustainable peace process in Palestine and also in the wider region it is still within our capacity to act and urgently urgently I thank you I thank the representative of Algeria for their statement I give the floor to the representative of France Mr President thanks the United States for having proposed this resolution and we voted in favor of this Council must continue to act while the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza is worsening imate and unconditional release of all hostes it also calls for an immediate and Lasting ceas we therefore support the efforts of several elected members of this Council a draft resolution along those lines and welcome the fact that resolution unreservedly supports ongoing efforts in unreserved supports call International La this is an absolute requir is opposed to any Israeli offensive in Raa that can only lead to a humanitarian disaster there is also an urgent need for a massive delivery of humanitarian to must be open direct land link from Jordan and all Crossing points in line with our principles France will continue call this Council to condemn the terrorist acts committed by Hamas and other terrorist groups on the 7th of October last o the vast majority of us had supported the Brazilian draft which clearly outlined these acts Comm is and solidarity with the israelian people Israeli people following these attacks these attacks canot justify the unjustifiable suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza France remains committed to a political settlement to the Israeli Palestinian conflict and we recall that only a two-state solution will ensure the security of Israel as well as the legiate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a state it is the of this Council toall this and that is why France will should responsibilities and propose an initiative to the security Council thank you I thank the representative of France for their statement I give the floor to the rep representative of Republic of Korea thank you Mr President the Republic of Korea voted in favor of the draft resolution proposed by the us as this includes positive elements that can plant the Seas for more sustainable peace in Palestine and Israel including support for the ongoing negotiations to achieve the release of hostages and an immediate ceasefire the Republic of Korea reaffirms its firm position calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire objecting to any ground operation in Rafa and stressing the importance of the protection of civilians thus we note with the appreciation that the draft resolution made it clear that in immediate and sustained ceasefire is imperative to protect civilians and alleviating humanit alleviate humanitarian suffering and we complement the efforts by the US government to incorporate comments from the council members this draft resolution proposed by the US contains other important elements including support for diplomatic efforts to ensure ceasefire and release of all remaining hostages clear condemnation of all acts of terrorism including the deplorable Hamas Le attacks of the 7th of October and concern over the ground offensive into Rafa it also demands all parties to enable the full immediate safe sustained and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population throughout Gaza in addition it includes rejections of forc displacement the establishment of so-called buffer zones and new settlements in Gaza as well as a commitment to the two-state solution thus it is regrettable that another opportunity for this Council to forge a favorable response has failed to draw consensus the Republic of Korea will continue to constructively engage with other members of this Council to reach a meaningful outcome in responding to the Grave situation in Gaza I thank Republic of Korea for their statement I give the floor to the China Mr President China voted against the draft resolution that has just been put to the vote and I would like to explain China's vote and relevant considerations as follows more than 160 days have passed since the outbreak of the Gaza conflict in the face of a human tragedy in which more than 32,000 innocent civilians have lost their lives and millions are suffering from famine the most urgent action to be taken by the council is to promote an immediate unconditional unsustained ceasefire this is the universal call of the International Community the decision taken by the emergency special session of the general assembly a few months ago and a solemn appeal by the Secretary General of the UN to the council while invoking article 99 of the charter the council has tracked its feet and wasted too much time in this regard we all recall that the US introduced its own draft resolution after vetoing on February the 20th overwhelming consensus among council immediate over the past month the draft has undergone several iterations and contains elements that respond to the concerns of the International Community it has always evaded and dodged the most Central issue that of a ceasefire the final text remains ambiguous and does not call for an immediate ceasefire nor does it even provide an answer to the question of realizing a ceas fire in the short term this is a clear deviation from the consensus of of the council members and fell far short of the expectations of the International Community an immediate ceasefire is a fundamental prerequisite for saving lives expanding humanitarian access and preventing greater conflicts the US draft on the contrary sets up preconditions for a ceasefire which is no different from giving a green light to continued killings which is unacceptable the draft is also very unbalanced in many other aspects in particular with regard to Israel's recent and repeated Declarations of plans for a military offensive on Rafa the draft does not clearly under equivocally State its opposition which would send an utterly wrong signal under lead to severe consequences any action taken by the security Council should stand the test of History under of morality and safeguarding truth and Justice safeguarding the charter purposes and principles and safeguarding the Dignity of the council and also based on the concerns and strong opposition from the Arab state with this draft resolution China together with Algeria and Russia have voted against the draft resolution Mr President members of the council have now before them another draft resolution that was the result of collective consultations among elective members of the council this draft is clear on the issue of a fire and is in line with the correct direction of the council's action is of great relevance China supports this draft we hope that the members of the council will reach agreement on this basis as soon as possible and send a clear signal calling for an immediate ceasefire and on the end of the fightings like other members China has from the outs called for the immediate hostages a demand repeatedly reiterated in the security Council resolutions 2712 2720 we welcome the mediation efforts by Egypt and others to this end and we hope that will be released at an early date China rejects the accusations by the US and the UK against China's voting position they if the US were serious about ceasefire it wouldn't have vetoed time again multiple Council resolutions it wouldn't have taken such a detour and played game of words while being ambiguous and evasive on critical issues if the US is serious about ceasefire then please vote in favor of the other draft resolution clearly calling for a ceasefire so that a ceasefire can be finally and immediately achieved the Palestinians their sufferings can be alleviated and ended and hostages be released without delay at an early date for the us at the current stage what is most important is not words but their deeds their actions no matter what China will continue to work with council members and the International Community to play a responsible and constructive role in order to achieve SE fire and put an end to the war Implement a two State solution alleviate the suffering of the catastrophe and promote a comprehensive just and Lasting solution to the question of Palestine thank you Mr China for their statement I give the floor to the representative of Mala thank you president Malta thanks the United States for for their efforts and consistent engagement on this draft resolution Malta voted in favor of the text and we regret that the use of the veto has prevented its adoption we believe that this draft would have represented another important step in the right direction and would have continued to build upon resolutions 2712 2720 Malta remains firm in its position that an immediate and permanent ceased fire is the only a venue through which we can prevent a further deterioration and begin addressing the impact of the Israeli Hamas War we support and appreciate ongoing efforts by Egypt Qatar and the United States to negotiate a deal which allows for the release of hostages we will continue to reiterate our call on Hamas to release all hostages safely and unconditionally we welcome that the draft condemned the heus Hamas Terror attacks of 7th October including the taking of hostages and sexual violence committed we recognize that this text emphasized concerns on a ground offensive interfa and the catastrophic consequences this will cause for 1.5 million the majority of whom are women and children however we underline that the council cannot be perceived to authorize and any ongoing or future Israeli military operations into Raa in any way we stress our firm rejection of any ground offensive andaa and believe the draft should have had stronger and more reassuring language on this matter we also underline the fact that a forc displacement of the Palestinian civilian population from and within Gaza would amount to grave breaches of international law Malta continues to be Gravely alarmed at the ever increasing humanitarian toll of this war which also persists during this holy month of Ramadan we firmly reiterate our call for Israel to ensure the immediate safe sustained and unhindered delivery of adequate and desperately needed Aid to the people in Gaza we must do our utmost to alleviate the suffering of the civilians in Gaza we also o repeat our call for the full implementation of resolutions 2712 and 2720 Malta remains deeply concerned about the ongoing situation in the region we reiterate that an immediate and permanent ceasefire remains a priority to deescalate this Gravely concerning spiral of violence and Regional escalation in closing president molta reaffirms its steadfast commitment to achieving comprehensive peace in the Middle East this Demands a two-state solution where Israel and Palestine as two Democratic states peacefully coexist side by side within secure and recognized borders in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions and internationally agreed parameters thank you I thank the representative of Marta for their statement I give the floor to the representative of Guyana thank you m Mr President after 5 months of war in Gaza and the horrific attacks of 7th October 2023 this Council has still not been able to adopt a text that addresses all the dimensions of the conflict in a manner that impacts the situation on the ground and upholds the rule of law while Guyana welcomed the US initiative to develop a draft resolution and the transparency with which the negotiations were conducted we are of the view that given the length of time spent on those negotiations and certain positions consistently expressed by several delegations the draft could have better reflected the broad-based feedback Mr President dear colleagues Guyana abstained on this draft resolution for a number of reasons which I will elaborate first contrary to some media and other reports this resolution does not call for an immediate ceasefire instead we note that it and I quote determines the imperative for a ceasefire end of quote and calls for support for diplomatic efforts that are ongoing outside of the UN while those efforts must be commended given the responsibility and Mandate of this Council Guyana could not support a resolution that does not unequivocally call for an immediate ceasefire nearly 32,000 persons have been killed in Gaza since 7th October the majority of whom are women and children more than 74,000 have been maimed initial un assessments have concluded that it would take years to clear 23 million tons of rubble and unexploded weapons scattered across Gaza the latest IPC report projects famine between now and may 2024 in summary this man-made disaster cannot be halted without an immediate ceas fire and it is this council's responsibility to unequivocally demand one even as it acknowledged the efforts of Qatar Egypt and the United States second the demand for a ceasefire should not be linked to or conditioned on the release of hostages The Taking of hostages is strictly prohibited under international law and their release must be unconditional Guyana reiterates his call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages two wrongs cannot make a right and the Palestinians people should not be collectively punished and themselves held hostage for the crime of others third in our view this text lacked attribution in a number of key areas while the D includes the condemnation of Hamas for the October 7th attacks and demands they immediately Grant humanitarian access to the hostages and rightfully so there is no attribution or demands to the Israeli authorities for what is taking place in Gaza for example who is responsible for 1.5 Palestinians taking refuge in Rafa and who has announced a plant military ground offensive there to whom is the demand and for compliance with obligations on the international law regarding the protection of civilians and civilian objects humanitarian access and the protection of humanitarian relief and medical personnel their assets and infrastructure applicable who has erected and maintained the existing barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale who is responsible for the forcible displacement of the civilian population in gasa who is preventing the use of all available routes to and throughout the entire Gaza Strip who does not respect the confliction and notification mechanisms we know the answers to these questions we have heard briefer after briefer both from the UN system and Civil Society describe the situation on the ground explaining where the problems are and who is responsible for creating these problems why then were the relevant demands in the resolution not clearly addressed to the occupying power not even once was this done indeed if one were to read this resolution without background knowledge it would be difficult to ascertain which party in this conflict is committing the atrocities in Gaza atrocities which necessitated this draft resolution being put forward in a resolution of 41 paragraphs 236 words words the occupying power is mentioned once in the penultimate paragraph fourth preambular paragraph 7 was of particular concern to Guyana this council is the organ with the charter responsibility for addressing threats to peace breaches of the peace and acts of aggression how can we endorse the idea of and I quote ongoing and future operations end of quote in Gaza as long as measures are taken to and I quote again reduce significantly civilian harm end of quote this idea was rejected by several delegations during the course of the negotiations in guyana's view this is in direct contravention of the council's responsibility it would set a dangerous precedent and make the council complicit in the atrocities being committed in Gaza now and in the future Fifth and final we took note of the four paragraphs treating with the Mandate of the senior humanitarian and restruction coordinator for Gaza while we applaud the coordinator's efforts we are off the view that the scale of efforts that would be required in Gaza after the war would warrant a key role for onra given its Decades of experience in the strip and its capacity Vis AES other agencies operating there this Council has heard many times of the indispensability of un ra it is the lifeline for Palestinians we were therefore disappointed that the only mention of onra in the draft pertained to the investigations into the allegations against a small number of its staff Guyana supported by several delegations had requested an affirmation of On's important mandate in the text but this was not taken on board Mr President dear colleagues this Council still has an opportunity to take action to end the suffering of all parties civilians in Gaza need a respite Palestinians need a respite Israelis NE a respite both NE a respite from this continuous cycle of violence and pain that is the real window of opportunity the strong desire by the people of Palestine and Israel for peace Guyana is prepared to work with other council members to respond to their needs and legitimate aspirations including very important the two-state solution this must not be postponed I thank you I thank the representative of Guyana for their statement I give the floor to the President a month after our last vote I will repeat my words we voted for the resolution because the killing and starving of civilians in Gaza must stop and the suffering of hostages and their families must end we voted in favor of the resolution because we believe it is imperative for the security Council to send a clear message that the situation in Gaza is unacceptable we deeply regret the use of the veto by the Russian Federation and China we thank the United States for their efforts on this draft resolution the draft offered the Council an opportunity to follow up on several harrowing briefings that we have received in the last month the resolution didn't include all of the elements that we would have wanted to see in the text however it provided us an opportunity to express ourselves on a number of particularly concerning aspects of the crisis in Gaza and they include the importance of achieving an immediate and sustained ceasefire the need to release hostages a clear stance against an offensive in Rafa and its serious implications for regional peace and security the urgency of removing roadblocks to humanitarian assistance including the need for increased provision and distribution of humanitarian Aid the need for respect of international law on protection of civilians and civilian objects the need for protection of humanitarian relief and medical personnel the rejection of an attempt at territorial or demographic change of Gaza including Force displacement and the commitment of the council to the vision of the two-state solution many of these elements have been extensively elaborated during our numerous meetings and briefings on Gaza as emphasized on those occasions we believe in the complementarity of all efforts bilateral Regional and those of the council we therefore once again thank the leaders of Egypt Qatar and the United States for their efforts in securing a deal on the ground Slovenia is of the view that a strong signal of support from the council to the negotiations on the ground could provide an important impetus to the process and bring us closer to Lasting peace we continue condemning the terrorist attack of Hamas on 7th of October and call for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages Hamas did set this in motion but it didn't have to end with over 32,000 killed Palestinians the rest of them starving and the massive violations of international humanitarian law war with all its tragic consequences is a choice not necessity we underscore the need for accountability and adheres to international law and we would like to once again express our deep concern over the statements of Israeli officials regarding resettlement of the people of Gaza and reject a possible ground invasion in Rafa we regret the council was once again unable to send a clear signal on the need for this conflict to end in order to then continue its work on the political solution and the vision of the two-state solution we reiterate our call for full respect of international law including International humanitarian law and human rights law of the provisional measures of the international court of justice and resolutions 2712 and 2720 the council needs to demonstrate leadership in Pursuit Of Peace Slovenia will continue its engagement with all council members to find a United voice from the council for Slovenian Palestinian lives matter for us Israeli lives matter this conflict must end Slovenia for their statement I give the Switzerland mer thank you States was not ad of two permanent members of the security Council ofation the horrific unbearable suffering on the ground it would have been necessary for the council to achieve a tangible result and to send a signal of an ability to act in clear Unity for the protection of civilians of the members of the ex Council contributed to the numerous consultations on the text put to the vote today and I thank the United States for their effort right up until the last minute however AR content to be clearly to clearly reflect the request made repeatedly by a very large majority of council members for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to be established without any conditions it is high time for anival request for an immediate human ceas to be subject of consensus at this

wor the already catastrophic light of the civilian population and would generate new major obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian assistance this is a prospect that is unacceptable and it cannot be

favor of the draft resolution to demonstrate commitment to achieving a sustainable sensation of hostilities even if incremental in approach and dependent on diplomatic negotiations outside of the United Nations the text placed before the council by the pen holder did not call for an unambiguous immediate ceasefire and an unconditional release of the hostages with unfolding catastrophe tragic and massive scale of killings and human suffering in Gaza seron has committed to support initiatives that will lead to a ceasefire our vote therefore was informed by the need to support actions that could lead to an immediate and sustained ceasefire alleviate human suffering Stop Force displacement of Palestinians and allow for the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance including medical

catastrophic humanitarian situation is to rescue the 177,000 onomy children in the Gaza street over 1.4 million internal internally displaced persons the wounded women and other vulnerable groups from

Liberty to determine their political status and future we emphasize that all engagements regarding reconstruction of the Gaza striet must be conducted in good faith and with active participation of the Palestinians I thank you I thank the representative of sier Leon for their statement I give the e thank you Mr President resoltion which we have just considered we share the need for urgency the counil to act catastropic humanarian situation ofine being forced to go elsewhere vot in favor of a resolution which is the fruit of a lengthy negotiation process in which all members of the council participated it is resoltion which the council determines that immediate ceasefires required but it also contains other elements of considerable importance relev including medium and longterm measures on the P to Lasting peace text also includes explicit condemnation for the Hamas terrorist attacks and The Taking of hostages Equador reates the demand these hostages be released immediately unconditionally Mr President that each of us each member of this text could be improved upon but I'm also fully convinced that we would never agree on which part needs to be improved upon or how to do it in such a complex sit situation a perfect text for everyone is impossible Mr President must not be Hostage to rival we should be a space for building reconciliation in peace framewor of a clearcut mandate received in the UN Char and so once again we regret that the majority decision of the council has not been respected due to the use of the veto thank you I thank the representative of Ecuador for their statement I shall make a statement in my capacity as a representative of Japan over five months have passed since hamas's horrifying acts of Terror took place in Israel which has led to the unfolding of the tragedies the world has been witnessing in Gaza at least 32,000 Palestinians have been reported toly killed by Israel in Gaza most of them women and children farming is on on the brink and the looming Israeli military offensive into Rafa only threatens to deepen the catastrophe this should not proceed under any circumstances given the gravity of the situation on the ground Japan voted in favor of this draft resolution we deeply regret that it failed to be adopted Japan appreciate the tireless efforts of the United States in Consulting with all council members throughout the negotiation process had it been adopted this resolution could have pushed forward forward ongoing vigorous diplomatic efforts in particular the four part the four party Pro talks towards an immediate and sustained cease fire and the release of hostages we believe that this would be a pragmatic approach to improve the humanitarian situation on the ground although we were unable to adopt the resolution the council must put pressure on the parties to conclude the deal as soon as possible those in Gaza and Beyond cannot wait another day I thank council the permanent representative of Russian Federation has asked for the floor to make a further statement I give them a floor Mr President the we have now just heard we have heard hypocritical statements from a number of members of the security Council from some members of the security Council who have been shedding crocodile tears about the Russian and Chinese vetos we explained the reasons behind our not allowing the resolution to pass and it by no means is because of the US what been portrayed by the US delegation not what the US Representative tried to persuade us about I told all of you that you would be covering yourselves with disgrace voting for the US text which for you including those who are vaunting it unacceptable do you want me to tell you how things actually were it's not difficult to see it's not at all complicated your us Lords and protectors Beyond ringing the hands of your leaders in capital they told you that you should not be worried because the Russian Federation would beo this in any way but you would not go against the US text that is that's the whole scenario so don't try to hypocritically tell us that you are now disappointed that Russia and China veto the resolution once again today you have covered yourselves with disgrace voting for a text which you yourselves do not support and did not support I I thank the representative of Russian Federation for their statement I now give the floor to the representative Israel thank you Mr President Mr President I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to the United States of America the United Nations was established in the wake of the Holocaust to prevent such atrocities from happening again Ambassador Thomas Greenfield thank you for defending these values your determination to condemn the Hamas monsters and your conviction that the release of the hostages is not something that can be postponed shows true moral Clarity the American resolution should it have passed would have marked a moment of morality for the UN a place where good is evil and Justice is Injustice it would have been the very first time that this Council or any un body condemned Hamas and their brutal Massacre yet sadly for purely political reasons this resolution did not pass and terrorists can continue benefiting from this Council whitewashing their crimes colleagues how can we explain to children around the world that the body mandated to uphold Global Peace and security refuses to condemn terrorists for the most horrific crimes the council's decision to not condemn Hamas is a stain that will never be forgotten colleagues as Israel defends its very future against those that seek our annihilation all un bodies have dedicated their discussions only to the situation in Gaza and the civilian casualties numbers supplied by the terrorists are thrown around and quoted as if they are word of God yet in essence these numbers are merely the lies of Hamas that the UN is so quick to Parrot the time has come to put an end to this myth Kamas knows that they cannot defeat Israel militarily their goal is to annihilate Israel and their strategy is to terrorize our civilians while weaponizing the International Community to tie our hands in order to ensure their survival and how do they do it they use Gins as human shields in an effort to maximize civilian casualties knowing that it will lead this Council to pressure Israel into ending the military operation remember please remember remember for Israel every civilian death is a tragedy for Hamas civilian deaths are a strategy and sadly you are playing into hamas's strategy exactly as they predicted Israel is a law-abiding democracy we take every effort to minimize collateral damage Israel has gone above and beyond to ensure the safety of civilians we drop warning lifl lets make tens of thousands of phone calls and provide Gins with military Maps detailing safe corridors Israel has taken steps that no other military in any other conflict any other conflict has ever taken all in order to mitigate civilian casualties Hamas on the other hand built for years hundreds of miles of Terror tunnels in which terrorists hide and our hostages are held why do they do it Hamas does exact this in order to exploit gods and civilians as human Shields and to increase the death toll for Hamas more murdered civilian civilians is key to their survival it's their path towards a ceasefire that will keep them in power so ask yourself if you're not helping them with their strategy so Kamas through the Gaza Ministry of Health that it controls provides false statistics Statics which are then parroted around the globe promoting the lies of terrorists by merely looking only looking at the Kamas numbers it is crystal clear that they cannot represent reality a statistic Professor from Warton business school recently released an an analysis of the Kamas uh sorry Gaza Ministry of Health numbers Pro proving that not only are they distorted but they are also inflated they have no possible basis in reality but even if we were we were to take hamas's falsified numbers at face value the non-combatant to combatant ratio in Gaza is roughly one to one this is the lowest ratio in the history of urban Warfare every civilian death in Gaza as I said is tragic but the only party to blame is Hamas yet the security Council refused to hold Hamas accountable for deliberately putting Gins in the line of fire condemn the tunnel under schools condemn the exploitation of hospitals for Terror hold Hamas accountable the same can be said about The lious Narrative of famine in Gaza this too is Hamas propaganda which the UN has chosen to embrace there is absolutely no limit No Limit that Israel places on humanitarian Aid entering Gaza and to date 3,041 tons of Aid on over 18, 283 trucks have entered the strep any country that wishes to provide more Aid is more than welcome and we will facilitate its entry the only reason why any gin lacks Aid is because Hamas loots it and steals much of it for themselves as long as Hamas is in control gaza's economic situation will be in ruin colleagues this Council has expressed its concern over an operation in Rafa but let me be clear there is no country no country that seeks to avoid an operation in Rafa more than Israel is it your sons and daughters that you are sending into battle no it is our children who are making the ultimate sacrifice in defense of their Homeland from the outset of the war Israel's goal have been clear return the hostages dismantle hamas's ter capabilities and ensure that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel so far Israel has succeeded in dismantling roughly 18 of kamasa battalions but there are four remaining battalions in Rafa with around 8,000 terrorists Israel is fighting for her future and if we fail to achieve our goals Kamas will repeat October 7th again and again as they promised publicly not only Hamas by the way Terror will prevail in our region and this will inspire jihadist organizations all across the globe so the only way the only way to achieve a real and permanent ceasefire is to eliminate hamas's capabilities entirely and this cannot happen unless all of their battalions are demolished you cannot extinguish a fire by putting out most of it the fire will grow again and spread this is what will happen without an operation in Rafa Israel sees no alternative the road to a permanent ceasefire passes through Rafa if this Council has any other ideas how to dismantle the terror group without entering GA Rafa we would like to hear them we are open colleagues once Kamas capabilities are dismantled Israel's goal to demilitarizing Gaza can materialize but for a lasting solution between Israel and Gaza there is another requirement deradicalization according to a recent poll by the Palestinian Center for policy and Survey the Palestinian Center research 71% I repeat 71% of Palestinians support hamas's October 7th Massacre it's not only a minister saying this or that as you quote here 71% of the Palestinian people support the massacre and over 60% of Palestinians want to see Hamas in control of the Gaza strep can you comprehend this the vest majority of Palestinians support hamas's Massacre and wish to keep these rapist m murderers in power this colleagues is the root of the problem whoever ignores this deep-seated hatred and makes demands of Israel only Israel by the way is bearing their head in the sand like an ostrich just as the UN has done since Israel disengaged withdrew from Gaza in 2005 for 18 years the UN has turned a blind eye to hamas's bigotry incitement and radical indoctrination to ter that is rampant in schools across Gaza by the way including in unrest schools we hear calls for two states for peace yet the UN refuses to address the underlying issue the vast majority of Palestinians are not looking for peace what is most important to them is Israel's Annihilation at any cost this is why deradicalization is Key by making one-sided demands of Israel without without making any demands of the Palestinian Palestinians to end their culture of hate and incitement a long-term solution will never be possible demand that the Palestinian Authority combat Terror demand that they end incitement demand that they stop paying salaries to terrorists demand that they deradicalize the people the educational transformation that the German people underwent after the Third Reich was toppled is what the Palestinians need to receive so that they finally support coexistence coexistence with Jews coexistence with Israel that's how we educate our kids Mr President the war may be in Gaza but this war extends much much further than our battle against Kamas the true Puppet Master directing Kamas kisala the htis all of them to attack us and their their militias is as you all well know is Iran Iran is the architect of instability and its ambitious of world domination Must Be Stopped the Ayatollah regime is determined to wipe Israel off the map and they are not ashamed to say it publicly tomorrow dear colleagues the Jewish people will celebrate the holiday of Purim and this holiday is a very important message to the murderous Ayatollah regime and the rest of the world 1500 years ago in Persia which is modern day Iran the king signed a disastrous decree a resolution calling to annihilate all the Jews in his Empire following this catastrophic decision the Jewish people banded together and through conviction and Faith they succeeded in reversing this resolution gaining the right of self-defense as a result the Jewish people defeated all those who set out to murder them them and the man behind this evil plot was executed this is the story of Purim our holiday and the holiday slogan is V and the opposite happened those who plotted against the Jewish people had their own schemes turned against them this is the essence of Jewish history the very same faith and conviction that the Jews of Persia displayed has been carried with us to this day this is why we have survived and thrived despite all of the decrees and racist resolutions against us throughout history many have tried to destroy us but all have failed because we will never surrender and we will always fight for our existence members of this Council called for a ceasefire in honor of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan we respect Ramadan but hamas's Massacre was carried out on the Jewish holiday of sim T the holiday where we Mark the completion of the reading of the Old Testament the Tor so today in order of puim the request of the Jewish people is that this Council takes real real and active measures to release all of our hostages and if we are successful if the hostages return home and Kamas is dismantled then just as it says in the meila the text that we read on Purim like the Jewish people had light and joy gladness happiness and honor for us and all Humanity thank you Mr Israel for their statement there are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers the meeting is
