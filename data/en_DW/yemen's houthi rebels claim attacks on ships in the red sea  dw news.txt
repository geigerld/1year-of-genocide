now Yemen's houthi Rebels claimed they attacked two ships in the Red Sea but and Israeli spokesperson has denied the group's claims that the vessels were linked to Israel according to the Pentagon an American warship also came under attack Iran backed houthis did not mention the US vessel but said the attacks would continue as long as Israel continues its war with Hamas the incidents come amid heightened tensions in the Red Sea and surrounding Waters after houthis seized an Israeli link cargo vessel last month our correspondent Janelle Duman in Washington is following those development welcome Janelle what more do we know about the attack on the US warship well the US warship in question is the USS Carney now that is a destroyer it's part of the USS Gerald R Ford carrier strike group now if you remember that was the carrier strike group that was deployed to the region in the aftermath of October 7 when Hamas attacked Israel we know that the attack started at approximately 10:00 a.m. s time it lasted for around 5 hours and the us as Carney reportedly opened in self-defense we've since heard that it managed to shoot down two hooti uh two hooti drones now this incident is thought to be significant because even as we have been seeing a ramping up of hooti attack attacks on vessels in the region this is the first time that multiple vessels have been involved in a single hooti attack saying that however the USS Carney did not sustain any damage no injuries were reported on board analysts seem to believe that this was much more about sending the US Navy a message than causing any real damage however as we have been hearing this is uh just the latest in a series of attacks and there's no reason to assume that it will be the last and so what role is the US military playing in the Red Sea well it's important to note that even before the October 7 attack on Israel the US Navy had already been bolstering its presence in the region we're talking thousands of troops we're talking different kinds of war planes Naval vessels and the reason that Washington has always cited is uh the protection of the free flow of trade and the freedom of navigation this is of course an important Waterway for global trade it's a shortcut between Asia and Europe but zooming beyond that it's become important to Washington to underline its role there as a very important security actor especially because of the shifting relationships in the region between the gulf countries themselves but also with us strategic competitors like Russia and China so it's become very important to Washington to enlarge its presence there to show that it is very much there as a deterrent presence as well and of course October 7 happened and that added another layer of volatility to the region and increased reason for the US to be uh to be active okay thanks for that Janelle at us correspondent Janelle
