well meanwhile Aid has started arriving in Gaza via a US military built temporary floating Pier of trucks with the aid rolled across the pier for the first time into The besieged Enclave as Israeli restrictions continued to disrupt deliveries of vital food and other supplies at Gaza border crossings the US and Aid groups hope to increase deliveries at the pier to as many as 150 trucks per day well despite the efforts the un's food program says the threat of famine has never loomed larger for gaza's 2.2 million people explosions and gunshots ring out in the deserted streets of Rafa the southern city is the latest focus of operations of the Israeli military Israel says hamas's last remaining Fighters are based in Raa along with the group's leaders responsible for the October 7 terror attack so it needs to send more troops there our troops have destroyed several tunnels and will destroy even more soon this activity will intensify Hamas is not an organization that can reorganize it does not have the reserve troops it does not have the ability to produce Munitions it has no supplies the result is we are cutting it off we are wearing it down Israeli tanks have already advanced deep into Rafa's Eastern outskirts pushing into residential areas un says almost 600,000 people taking refuge in Rafa have now left after Israel took control of the Gaza side of the Rafa border crossing supplies and Medical Services have been dwindling so food in which in place already uh in southern Gaza are running out um I think we're we're talking about the the almost none left food in the market very soon uh there'll be none left U medical supplies in the hospitals that remain in the South a couple two or three weeks I think to go perhaps a month eight agencies say a temporary Pier anchored by US troops and regular air drops are no substitute for ground deliveries Palestinians too have been calling for the border crossing to reopen we don't want ships we want the border crossings to open we want safety we want official borders those planes as well with the parachutes they threw food at us like dogs like Beggars that doesn't work it falls on people it brings his problems with most operations disrupted due to the Rua offensive and the humanitarian situation already dire agencies warn gazin are now facing an immediate risk of [Music] famine well for more I'm joined Now by Tess Ingram she is the spokesperson for Unicef in New York and she just spent two weeks in Gaza last month chess it's good to have you with us I I want to pick up on your experience that you had in Gaza so recently um considering that the UN is saying that the the threat of famine remains real and acute for the people in Gaza um is that also what you saw it is unfortunately I think you know our worst fears are being realized at the moment we've been warning for months about the risk of famine in Gaza and particularly in the north of Gaza and when I went to the north I walked around a hospital where I saw many Mal narish children and spoke to their parents it's just heartbreaking to see a child in that condition in so much pain and not being able to receive the help that they need to recover our fear now is that because of the issues with Aid getting in through those Southern border crossings because of the Rafa offensive the already dire situation in the South could escalate to what we saw in the north of Gaza uh in in a very short space of time we do have Aid that is now coming into the territory via this floating Pier that we just reported on um your agency says more than 300,000 children in Gaza are at risk of malnutrition and starvation how then do you decide which children get the food considering that the food is in short supply yeah look it's really difficult um at the moment when the needs are so enormous and the aid is really A Drop in the Ocean compared to those needs as a humanitarian Aid work it's just heartbreaking to know that you cannot serve everybody but UNICEF is there we're staying and we're doing our best to deliver despite these really difficult circumstances and reach the children and families that need us the most we try and plan our distributions based on need but also we're restricted by access um as as we've been saying now for months it's really hard for us to get the safety assurances that we need to move to some of these areas so it's a day by day play at the moment you know more than half a million people have fled Rafa in search of a safer Place Aid agencies say that there are no more safe places left for people to to go to give us a sense of the challenges that Aid agencies are going through to provide help to these people so there are two main areas where people are being asked to move to from Rafa and the estimated number of displaced people that have fled Rafa in the last 10 days is now at about 600 40,000 people so that's about half the number of displaced people that were in Rafa an enormous movement of people in such a short amount of time and what we're trying to do uh to service them in these two areas they're going Al masasi and deala is to assess their needs and try and bring some level of basic service to those areas because in Mal masasi for example it's essentially a sand June there's nothing there uh there are no toilets there are no showers there very little infrastructure for people to build shelters against I walked through that area and it was already busy a month ago so I can only imagine now and I'm hearing from colleagues just how crowded it is but it's very difficult for us to meet these soaring needs when we can't get Aid in so the the aid suppli is almost ground virtually to a halt in the last two weeks yeah and and it seems the world detention is focused on the southern part of Gaza but you know it's not peaceful in in the North in fact fighting continues in the northern part of the the territory what what's the humanitarian situation there so the north of the Gaza Strip has is the area that has been the most affected by the fighting and the has had the least access to Aid consistently over the last seven months it's been very difficult for Aid agencies to get the safety assurances we need to to travel north um we have one colleague uh at UNICEF in the north of Gaza who remains there and I've spoken to her and she's told me just how difficult the situation is there at the moment people are being told to evacuate uh but these are people who've been there now for seven months and have survived serious lack of services including a lack of food and so people are unsure about what to do now whether they really do take that plunge and try and move but the fighting is as you say intensifying in the north as well as the South and we're also seeing strikes in the middle area so right across the Gaza Strip children's lives remain at risk Tess Ingram with UNICEF Tess we appreciate your time and your input tonight thank you and I'm joined Once More by Shina Lo she's Communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council in Jerusalem sh good to see you again Aid has now started arriving in Gaza via the US build Pier can this new Maritime route bring enough Aid into the Gaza Strip no this route is estimated to bring only between 90 and maximum 150 truckloads per day at this point we need to see a flood of humanitarian assistance enter Gaza and the only efficient and cost-effective way to do that is through the crossings that already exist there are literally thousands of trucks lined up on the Egyptian side of the Border waiting to enter Gaza and we need those Crossings to be operational in order for that Aid to get in and help people as quickly as because they need it m those Crossings you mentioned it there they're not operational right now let's talk about the distribution of what is coming in through the air and Via this new pier can the goods coming in realistically reach all the people in need no the the airdrops by and large I believe have been set focused on Northern Gaza it's mostly food and maybe some medicines that have been dropped down we heard yesterday from uh about staff of our in Northern Gaza who are talking about that in addition to the food that they're getting which at this point uh the Convoy is coming in through the the new newly open Northern eras West Crossing is just wheat but people are in need of shelter supplies they're in need of hygiene kits they're in need of other items that aren't entering through these Crossings uh the the airdrops are are not a costeffective way there are lots of ways in which they can cause harm either by Falling on on uh Aid re I or falling into the sea as we've seen and as as the the person in your report said it's not a dignified way for people to receive aid aid should be distributed by humanitarians in an orderly way to ensure that the most vulnerable people are having access to the items that they need all eyes are currently on Rafa home to hundreds of thousands of displaced people now with a large scale military operation they're looming what's their situation what are their living conditions I spoke yesterday to a colleague of ours who is in Rafa she described a a city that is has been largely deserted the UN has said that 640,000 people as of this morning had fled Rafa most are moving as far to the West as they can they are entering Barren strips of land areas where they do not have capacity uh to or the facilities and services needed in order to uh in order to uh meet their basic needs it's it's uh age Aid agencies are overwhelmed trying to respond to the needs but the needs keep on growing desperation is high we've heard that at our own Aid distributions we've had uh Aid recipients uh faint because they are so malnourished we've seen people begging for any uh scrap of assistance they can receive the situation continues to deteriorate day by day now with the situation so volatile how does your organization adapt its operations on the ground well we've been working to get the small amount of Aid that we received right before the border crossings uh distributed to people who are in need but we are quickly running out of supplies and once those supplies run out unless these Crossings reopen we will not be able to provide any much or any response at all to the people who are in need the shine low from the Norwegian Refugee Council in Jerusalem always great to get your insights thank you so much
