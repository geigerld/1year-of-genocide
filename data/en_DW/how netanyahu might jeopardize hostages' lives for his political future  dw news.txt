talks between negotiators trying to reach a Gaza ceasefire have ended in Cairo without a deal the Hamas official said his delegation was leaving for Doha for further consultations Palestinians in Gaza have been pinning their hopes on the outcome of the talks hoping a temporary truce would allow them to return to their homes but in Israel hopes are fading that a deal acceptable to both sides can be reached at all these Israeli protesters are demanding their government push on with its plan for a military operation in Rafa in southern Gaza many of them are relatives of soldiers killed in the war they believe a RFA incursion is the best way to pressure Hamas to release the Israeli hostages it still holds visiting troops in the central Gaza Strip Israeli defense minister yav Galant indicated that he agrees with the protesters there are concerning signals that Hamas is not planning to accept any deal or agreement with us this means an operation in Rafa and in the entire gasa strip in the very near future galant's sentiments were echoed in a video message from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu capitulating to hamas's demands would be a terrible defeat for Israel it would be a great victory for Hamas Iran and the excess of evil it would show great weakness to our friends and enemies bring the next War closer and push the next peace agreement further away for many displaced Palestinians in Gaza the resumption of ceasefire talks ignited their longing to return home there's a great sense of hope and anticipation as we have longed for months for the negotiations to succeed so we and all the place people can go back home we yearn for stability and bringing an end to the war and destruction we have witnessed many hope a ceasefire would end the bombing and allowing in food medicine and other supplies that can save lives Ned al-masri a grandfather has found a cooked meal for his family of 16 the food distributed by the charity World Central Kitchen is helping them survive sometimes we have lunch but we don't have dinner and sometimes we have breakfast but we don't have lunch we must manage whatever food we get from outside is enough we share it among ourselves and say thank God but used to be trucks but now there are no trucks we haven't had vegetables for a month and a half with the UN saying parts of Gaza are experiencing famine the need for a truce is even a temporary one is all the more urgent for more let's bring in German Egyptian journalist Karim El goari in Cairo kareim good to see you again the talks have ended Hamas has now left Cairo tell us what does this mean in terms of now reaching any kind of ceasefire deal well the this negotiations were going on since Saturday for two days and it was negotiations with a Hamas delegation Egyptian mediators and C mediators and the head of the CIA William Burns um not much came out to the public about really what was negotiated exactly in the last two days but now the Hamas delegation is leaving Cairo and CIA head William Burns is on his way toq trying to save what is there to be safe it is difficult to bring a final judgment if this is a failure the negotiations or if they will continue Hamas is already saying that their plan is to come back on Tuesday to Cairo after they consulted with their leadership to continue the negotiations we don't know anything about the Israeli side their delegations was not present here in Egypt because they were waiting what uh result this negotiations will bring we have no idea if the Israeli delegations might then come on Tuesday when Hamas is coming back so it's all a about out in the open but the um this most the biggest sticking point of course is is the following is Hamas is asking for guarantees for a permanent ceasefire um either from the US from the other mediators but at the end of course they have to get this guarantee from Israel itself and they were asking for withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and that is something that is not accepted for netan he says he wants to push on with the Israeli offensive in Rafa and that is the gap that is so difficult to Bridge and we don't know if the nego negations failed or if they just deferred to next week thanks for that kareim that was German Cairo thank you you're welcome well Israel has closed the km Shalom Border Crossing into Gaza after Hamas launched an attack on it Israeli media say several people people have been injured now Israel's military released this footage that it claims shows Hamas Fighters firing at the Crossing the militant group has claimed responsibility for the attack saying it was targeting Israeli soldiers in the area the Kem Shalom Crossing is the main entry point for Aid into the Gaza Strip DW Middle East analyst shenir roosan is joins me now in the studio shenir good to see you is the attack on K Shalom earlier today putting more pressure on Israel to reject the ceasefire deal and go ahead with their plans to launch an offensive in Rafa it definitely helps n remind the people in Israel who he's dealing with you know this is also partially what we're seeing in the back and forth in these negotiations both side are trying to seem tough and to say we are not afraid of War we are not afraid of Confrontation we have seen Nano already yesterday releasing uh messages he's adamant on going into rafar regardless of what happens to the deal this is sort of the Hamas saying sort of Bring It On We're Not Afraid we can still launch rockets at Israel which uh means that definitely uh we're not deterred and we will see more of this back and forth and and we're seeing that both sides are on the one hand signaling the want to cease fire but then on the other hand also trying to say we don't you know we're not desperately wanting it we're willing to go on fighting um how much of it is just you know rhetorics connected to negotiations how much is it really another another step into further escalation in the region we will know very soon Shen there's obviously a broad range of opinions but tell us what do people generally in Israel actually want you know do they want a ceasefire deal in the release of hostages or is there more support for an offensive in in Rafa well the the issue of the hostages which is the heart of the matter now when we talk about why would Israel even want to have a deal that's because of that you know there's 133 officially uh Israelis that are kept in Gaza we don't know the conditions of many of them how how many of them are alive but there are at least several dozens who are alive and there's a need and there's a growing pressure from the families to bring them home and there's there's wide support for that but what matters to Netanyahu is not the wide support in the Israeli public but rather where does his base stand Netanyahu seems to be caring very much for his political future he wants to guarantee the support for the base and there we see a lot of uh support for Rafa offensive even if it means uh that the lives of those hostages might be jeopardized for that reason s now the cabinet of Benin Netanyahu has ordered the qari broadcaster Al jazer to be shut down in Israel tell us why is that step being taken now well that's an interesting and very good question because we know this topic has been coming back and forth you know in Israeli uh media and and discourse along the years and definitely in the last months again since October 7th um it seems like it's either net playing politics trying to seem tougher because we know there's lot been a lot of support from his base and a lot of push from his base to shut down uh the Qatari uh aler Channel which matters a lot to the Qatari as a symbol and who they are it's part of their their soft power in the world um and at the same time you know we know the Americans were against it we also know within Israeli mad um heads you know the head of the Mad were against that in said we don't want to alienate di kataris we need their support in the talk we need their support in leveraging their influence on Hamas and by doing that it's another way of of for netan to toughen his positions maybe and Signal more that he's adant to go further further on with operation you know with offensive ground operation in Rafa more than anything else that was DW Middle East analyst Shen ran Shen thank you so much for that analysis
