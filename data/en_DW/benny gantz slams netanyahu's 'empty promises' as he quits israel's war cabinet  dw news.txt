Israeli Minister Benny Gant announced his resignation from prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's emergency government he did that in the last couple of hours G saying that he's leaving his post with a heavy heart he also called for new elections G joined netanyahu's government shortly after the October 7th Hamas attack in a show of national Unity G's resignation had been expected since last month when he gave Netanyahu an ultimatum to approve a postwar plan for Gaza his departure leaves Netanyahu more reliant on his farri allies all right let's take this now to my colleague Tanya Kramer she's following this story for us from Jerusalem Tanya another busy day for you g says made good on his threat to resign from netanyahu's emergency government what did you make of his statement well I mean as you said it was somehow expected he gave this ultimatum uh like about three weeks ago when he said certain conditions need to be met by prime minister Benyamin netan for him to stay uh in this emergency government now Benny guns is the leader of the Centrist party National Unity he entered uh this emergency government as part of this smaller War cabinet together with uh his colleague number two in the list guardi Eisen cot all both of them you know former IDF officials Benny G was a former Defense Minister and they made uh you know these important decisions for the past uh eight months but he said he wanted to see you know a credible plan to get the hostages back from Gaza he wanted to see a a credible plan as he said for Gaza for the day after that doesn't come forward from Netanyahu until now and also he wants to see one of the six conditions he put uh that the residents uh in the North of Israel that have been displaced after October uh 7th uh because of the Cross Fire between Hezbollah and Israel in the north that they get a certain date until when uh there could be a coming back home but netan has not responded to that and uh the uh Minister Benny gansa said tonight you know they shouldn't be Israelis deserves more than empty promises and there should be a a call for for uh new elections and for a Unity government so what does this mean moving forward for Benjamin netanyahu's government now well this move doesn't really topper his government uh Benjamin Nan has really a solid government still uh in the keset he has 64 seats so this for in the short term at least won't change anything but it might uh you know in the longer midterm longer term it will isolate him even a bit uh further internationally but also domestically Benny gun was always seen from the International Community as a partner and also as a counterweight to the extremists uh in uh Benin netanyahu's government uh like the farri right ministers but also other members of his leud party uh in this government and domestically you know it could and that is still to see also give those anti-government protesters now a push because now the only Centrist voice in this government uh is leaving and that could also of course change a bit uh the situation here but again we have to wait and see uh how this uh will play out Benny gun himself is doing he did very well uh in the polls recently went down a bit but his National Unity party was always now stronger than Benyamin netanyahu's uh liud party so of course going for elections is also something that he would be vying at but at the moment he just clear says this country needs a different path forward GW correspondent Tanya Kramer with the latest from Jerusalem tonight Benny Gant resigning from the government in Israel Tanya thank you
