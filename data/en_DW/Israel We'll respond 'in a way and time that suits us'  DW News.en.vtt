was going to respond and and that there
 

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:15.750 align:start position:0%
was going to respond and and that there
would<00:12:14.040><c> be</c><00:12:14.199><c> an</c><00:12:14.399><c> attack</c><00:12:14.760><c> coming</c><00:12:15.199><c> both</c><00:12:15.440><c> to</c><00:12:15.600><c> the</c>

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
would be an attack coming both to the
 

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.670 align:start position:0%
would be an attack coming both to the
Americans<00:12:16.519><c> through</c><00:12:16.760><c> the</c><00:12:17.120><c> Turks</c><00:12:18.120><c> and</c><00:12:18.320><c> also</c>

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:21.800 align:start position:0%

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.550 align:start position:0%
directly to Israel and I I think if Iran
had<00:12:21.959><c> wanted</c><00:12:22.279><c> to</c><00:12:22.399><c> be</c><00:12:22.639><c> successful</c><00:12:23.199><c> we</c><00:12:23.279><c> can</c><00:12:23.440><c> look</c>

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
had wanted to be successful we can look
 

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.030 align:start position:0%
had wanted to be successful we can look
at<00:12:23.680><c> some</c><00:12:23.800><c> of</c><00:12:23.920><c> the</c><00:12:24.040><c> other</c><00:12:24.279><c> attacks</c><00:12:24.600><c> that</c><00:12:24.760><c> it's</c>

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
at some of the other attacks that it's
 

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.150 align:start position:0%
at some of the other attacks that it's
conducted<00:12:26.040><c> against</c><00:12:26.440><c> say</c><00:12:27.440><c> facilities</c><00:12:27.959><c> in</c>

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
Saudi Arabia
 

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.110 align:start position:0%

and<00:12:29.959><c> they</c><00:12:30.120><c> were</c><00:12:30.519><c> successful</c><00:12:31.480><c> and</c><00:12:31.600><c> so</c><00:12:31.880><c> I</c><00:12:32.040><c> I</c>

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
and they were successful and so I I
 

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.350 align:start position:0%
and they were successful and so I I
think<00:12:32.320><c> that</c><00:12:32.480><c> Iran</c><00:12:33.000><c> was</c><00:12:33.440><c> very</c><00:12:33.760><c> clearly</c><00:12:34.120><c> trying</c>

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
think that Iran was very clearly trying
 

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.269 align:start position:0%
think that Iran was very clearly trying

00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
to make the point that it could respond
 

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:39.710 align:start position:0%
to make the point that it could respond
it<00:12:37.440><c> did</c><00:12:37.760><c> respond</c><00:12:38.639><c> but</c><00:12:38.880><c> as</c><00:12:39.000><c> it</c><00:12:39.160><c> said</c><00:12:39.440><c> now</c>

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
it did respond but as it said now
