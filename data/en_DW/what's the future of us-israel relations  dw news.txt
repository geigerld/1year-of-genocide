Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on his way to Washington DC where he will deliver a landmark speech to the United States Congress ahead of the trip Netanyahu thanked Biden for his contribution to us Israel relations following the president's decision to end his re-election campaign and we also said Israel will be the United States strongest Ally in the Middle East regardless of who is elected in November let's get more on this from DW's correspondent a Ibrahim in Jerusalem what more do we know about netanyahu's visit to the United States well this was a a visit that was obviously planned well before uh US President Biden's announcement to end his uh bid for uh a second term in office um it also comes uh after a time of really Frosty relations between Netanyahu and Biden over Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza and more specifically uh Israel's um incursion on RAF which the United States had been uh quite critical of after uh you know sort of more or less unconditionally supporting Israel following the attacks of October uh uh 7th and now we're seeing Netanyahu strike a more unified tone given um given Biden's announcement he's Netanyahu is expected to address uh Congress and there was a lot of speculation that that speech would try to play up uh uh uh um his perceived uh uh his perceived um lack of support from Biden but we're now hearing that that speech to Congress is likely to strike another uh you know more of the of what we've heard today uh more emphasis on the unity and everything that Biden has done for uh uh Israel at the same time this comes at a kind of more or less a low point for netanyahu's popularity uh the war in its ninth ninth month now and with uh hostages still being held uh in Gaza we even saw protesters at the airport here in Israel as uh uh the Prime Minister was leaving calling on him to try and find another deal that would bring back the remaining hostages and end the war in Gaza so considering all those factors just briefly if you could Aya could you broaden this out and tell us where this leaves us and Israeli relations I don't think this is likely to have a huge effect on Israeli American relations look even though there have been critical statements coming from Washington towards the Netanyahu Administration and the conduct of the war the United States Still Remains Israel's biggest Ally and not just when it comes to providing weapons uh that have of course contributed to the war in Gaza but also providing diplomatic cover for Israel in international forums like the United Nations security Council and so even though there are disagreements I don't think this really marks a huge departure from the Ironclad American support for Israel uh and to a very large extent the war well thank you so much for that that is our correspondent a Ibrahim in Jerusalem
