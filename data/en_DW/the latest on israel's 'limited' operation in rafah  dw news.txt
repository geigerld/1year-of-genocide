the United States is stepping up its opposition to Israel's plans to launch a full-scale assault on the city of Rafa in southern Kaza President Joe Biden now saying that he would not send certain weapons to Israel if it invades population centers and that he regretted that Palestinian civilians had been killed by us made bombs Israel is pressing ahead with its strikes on Hamas in response to the October 7th Terror attacks a limited operation just short of an invasion that is what US officials are calling Israel's actions in Rafa this footage released by the Israeli military on Wednesday shows troops pressing forward with its offensive on Rafa Israel says it's part of its campaign to eliminate Hamas We are continuing on our mission in Rafa as part of the war aims because the last four um the last four battalions of hamasa there we will destroy them Israeli forces have ordered the evacuation of more than a 100,000 Palestinians from parts of Rafa ahead of its operations they've been directed to places like moazi where a squalled makeshift tent camp has been set up the UN says the site isn't ready to shelter people the Israeli military has closed the Rafa border crossing It Now controls all routes in or out of Gaza in response Israel's closest Ally and Main military supplier the US has paused some weapon shipments it's also reviewing other military aid as Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told lawmakers at a hearing that was briefly interrupted by po Palestinian protesters we're going to continue to do what's necessary to ensure that Israel has the means to defend itself uh but that said uh we are currently reviewing some near-term security assistance shipments uh in the context of unfolding in events uh in Rafa the United States is still pushing for a ceasefire deal Hamas agreed to a proposal from Egypt and Qatar this week but Israel says its demands have not been met now that Israeli forces have entered Rafa hopes for a potential pause in the fighting are hanging in the balance let's take a closer look at the situation in Rafa we have Sam rose with the UN relief Agency for Palestinians unra joining us now thank you so much for taking the time um it's really stay or go this is a a tough decision that people in Rafa are having to make once again can you tell us a little bit about what you are seeing there yes absolutely CLA thanks for having me on I mean the situation in Rafa today is as difficult as it's been since the 7th of October people are faced with constant shelling constant bombardments it's a very dist dressed a very vulnerable population both inside and outside of the evacuation zones we have about one and a half million people inside Rafa we estimate that 100,000 of them have already uh up to 100,000 of them have have already moved given what they're they're experiencing so a very desperate situation a very scared a very vulnerable population and just for some clarification for our audience Israel has said that it's evacuating people in the eastern part of can you tell us are people staying put in in other parts of the city for now yeah absolutely I mean Israel has declared an evacuation zone of about 100,000 people we are witnessing people leaving from inside that zone but also people from outside of the evacuation Zone where we are which is about 3 kmet West of the evacuation Zone we see some of the areas thinning out we see some people transiting as well as areas as as t as plots for tents and Shacks open up people move in and then a few hours later as the bombardment intensifies they they move on again so it's people on the Move constantly from inside and from outside of that evacuation area as people fear the worst I want to ask you about the conditions in the places they're heading some of these uh what Israel calls humanitarian zones is it clear from what you're hearing whether there is in fact enough shelter food and water for people when they do arrive there no there is not enough the conditions are are atrocious the conditions are squalid there are essentially two areas that people are being told are safe areas these are masasi the sandunes essentially that aren't fit for human habitation there's no ability to access Water Sanitation you can see the clips on your your screen right now these are desperate desperate areas the other areas that people are being pushed told to go to a conun which has been subject to an intense and Savage bombardment over the past several weeks people there going back to the bombed out ruins of of homes and buildings faced with a high risk of unexploded bombs unexploded ordinance so these are the choices that people are are facing or they stay where they are and they they they risk uh what they've seen happen in other parts of Gaza repeatedly over the past seven months now just before I let you go I'd like to get a update on the aid situation Israel says it opened the K Shalom Crossing on Wednesday and unra initially said that it couldn't receive Aid there because of continued bombardments in the area is that still the case or are we now seeing humanitarian Aid entering there that remains the case in relation to rash Rafa and and Karam Shalom absolutely the crossing the Israeli side of the crossing was open on Wednesday yesterday but it but it wasn't functioning no ability for for for unra the largest Agency for any Aid agencies to enter that area and bring uh and bring those supplies out and two real reasons for that one are the security conditions on the ground this is in the midst of an intense military operation so just the practicalities of doing that very very difficult but the other one and and a point I'd like to leave you with is is in relation to fuel no fuel has come into Gaza since since since the weekend and without that fuel we simply wouldn't be able to move those those goods around but more importantly than moving the goods around it's our ability to power water wells hospitals electricity for health centers and generators so no fuel no Goods coming into Gaza unfortunately again today at least not through Rafa karum Shalom so Rose thank you so much for that update that is Sam rose with onra our correspondent in Jerusalem is Tanya krer we heard there about a suspended shipment of weapons President Biden saying he'll stop sending weapons to Israel if it launch is a full scale assault on Rafa how's that being received where you are I mean this is uh been very closely watched here and one well-known commentator here wrote in one of the main newspapers that this is uh it just shows the magnitude of the crisis between uh the two uh countries now in general uh Israelis see that with a bit of frustration because they say it should not be Israel uh that is not getting the weapons but it should be all directed you know at Hamas they should be the ones uh being uh sanctioned in a way and also it is seen of course that this might create problems for the negotiations that are ongoing uh in kir as it openly questions the relationship between uh Israel and the United States now we've been hearing about this particular shipment we're talking here about 3,500 bombs heavyweight bombs among them these uh 2,000 or 900 kilogram bombs uh uh that are not to be used in such densely populated areas and that is where apparently now the United States they are drawing uh the red line it is it is still unclear you know how much this actually weighs on Israel how much impact that has how much uh the military has weapons of these kinds and its stockpile but it's a very clear red line that the United States are drawing here and Tanya after months and months of truce talks are we any closer on that front well there very mixed messages coming out of Kio and not much coming out of K here these past days and it's still unclear how the mediators are matching those uh different narratives that we've been seeing here in the past days Hamas had said on Monday night that they're agreeing to an agreement and the Israeli uh negotiators had said well this is not the agreement uh that we are agreeing we have agreed to so we understand they're still uh talking but there's a lot of pressure here in Israel especially uh uh from the families and from the supporters of those who want to see those remaining hostages uh being released because every other week There's news of another hostage uh that was killed uh in in Gaza so there's a lot of pressure public pressure on prime minister Benjamin Nano to move forward with a deal but he also has a lot of pressure within his cabinet from the far right constituent mainly to move forward with the rafar operation and part of that deal is meant to be more aid for civilians how much is getting through right now well the situation is unbearable uh for people the Israeli Army had uh ordered people in the east of rafar to evacuate already on Monday and we understand that many thousands of people are on the Move also those who are not in these areas because there's fear that this would you know this operation would widen to other parts of rafar what has happened also in the north you see Heavy air bombardment and then tanks are moving in we're hearing from eight agencies that already um you know fuel is not coming in as rafar is Clos there's also a big question mark about what's happening at Kum Shalom the other Crossing with Israel that had been closed after a mortal attack on Sunday but had been reopened officially but eight agencies saying uh nothing is coming in so for people there it's a very very very desperate situation thank you for bringing us up today Tanya in Jerusalem
