one<00:07:20.039><c> of</c><00:07:20.240><c> course</c><00:07:20.520><c> is</c><00:07:20.759><c> how</c><00:07:20.919><c> much</c><00:07:21.240><c> damage</c><00:07:21.560><c> is</c><00:07:21.720><c> that</c>

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
one of course is how much damage is that
 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.189 align:start position:0%
one of course is how much damage is that
actually<00:07:22.680><c> doing</c><00:07:23.680><c> uh</c><00:07:24.039><c> uh</c><00:07:24.199><c> to</c><00:07:24.759><c> their</c><00:07:25.560><c> operations</c>

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:30.759 align:start position:0%
uh and second L how difficult is it
 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:32.589 align:start position:0%
uh and second L how difficult is it
going<00:07:31.000><c> to</c><00:07:31.160><c> be</c><00:07:31.319><c> for</c><00:07:31.479><c> the</c><00:07:31.560><c> hotties</c><00:07:32.000><c> to</c><00:07:32.199><c> replace</c>

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
going to be for the hotties to replace
 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:35.790 align:start position:0%

it<00:07:33.479><c> because</c><00:07:33.759><c> one</c><00:07:33.919><c> of</c><00:07:34.080><c> the</c><00:07:34.319><c> things</c><00:07:35.319><c> uh</c><00:07:35.479><c> that</c><00:07:35.680><c> I</c>

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
it because one of the things uh that I
 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.710 align:start position:0%
it because one of the things uh that I

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.749 align:start position:0%
think people need to keep in mind is

00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:40.759 align:start position:0%
that as long as the Iranian resupply
 

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:44.510 align:start position:0%

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
continues most of this material is going
 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.390 align:start position:0%
continues most of this material is going
to<00:07:44.680><c> be</c><00:07:44.879><c> fairly</c><00:07:45.560><c> easily</c><00:07:46.560><c> uh</c><00:07:46.759><c> replaced</c><00:07:47.720><c> and</c><00:07:48.199><c> uh</c>

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
to be fairly easily uh replaced and uh
 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.390 align:start position:0%
to be fairly easily uh replaced and uh
and<00:07:48.599><c> I</c><00:07:48.720><c> don't</c><00:07:49.000><c> think</c><00:07:49.560><c> it's</c><00:07:49.800><c> going</c><00:07:50.080><c> to</c><00:07:50.520><c> affect</c>

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's going to affect
 

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.629 align:start position:0%

uh houti operations substantially it's
 

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.149 align:start position:0%
uh houti operations substantially it's

00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to eliminate their
 

00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:59.149 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to eliminate their

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
as well do you see that
 

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.390 align:start position:0%
as well do you see that
happening<00:08:10.520><c> I</c><00:08:10.639><c> think</c><00:08:10.840><c> that</c><00:08:11.039><c> that</c><00:08:11.159><c> would</c><00:08:11.360><c> be</c><00:08:12.080><c> a</c>

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
happening I think that that would be a
 

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.950 align:start position:0%
happening I think that that would be a
