Israel and Hamas are close to agreeing on a deal to release the hostages held in the Gaza Strip that's according to Israel's ambassador to the US Michael Herzog herzog's words Echo those of an earlier statement by the Qatari prime minister at a joined press conference with EU Foreign Affairs Chief Joseph Burell Mohammad Alani said only Minor Details remain to be agreed for Hamas to free at least some of the more than 240 people kidnapped by militants in the October 7th attacks speaking in DOA qatar's prime minister said only minor challenges needed to be settled the deal is going through uh uh ups and down from time to time uh throughout the last uh few weeks but uh I think that uh you know I'm now more confident that we are close enough to reach to uh a deal that can bring the people will uh safely back to their homes whether they are the hostages on Hamas side or whatever the exchange uh uh that will happen will take place from the Israeli side we can now speak to our correspondent Rebecca ritters who joins us from Jerusalem hello to you Rebecca so just yesterday uh Israel's prime minister Benjamin nanahu said there was no deal on the release of Israeli hostages from Gaza what can you tell us about about the status of the negotiations well Mariana this deal has been in the making for some days we've been hearing and you heard from the Qatari prime minister there saying this is a deal has been going up and down and and that's precisely what what has been happening there have been days where we thought oh it's it's getting close to a deal we're going to see some movement and then you know we heard again from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last night that in fact No Deal had been reached we saw some reporting from the Washington Post recently uh They said that the deal was very close sourcing sorry quoting us sources this deal is between Israel us and Hamas it has been getting uh you know closer and closer and it certainly seems that we're at the closest point that we've been so far the deal appears to be for up to 50 uh women and children civilian uh hostages to be released in exchange for a 3 to 5 day ceasefire uh from the bombard in Gaza to allow for human humanitarian Aid to be brought in and to of course allow for those hostages to be taken out Hamas also asking for a prisoner Exchange in terms of uh some women and children that are in Israeli prisons the sticking point though seems to be that ceasefire Israel worried that it will allow Hamas time to catch up to catch its breath and perhaps rearm in this war so when we we we do appear the the the messaging the wording coming out of all from all the negotiators is positive uh and it does seem that a deal is getting much closer but still we haven't seen uh that come to fruition yet and now Rebecca we've also heard that more than 30 premature babies have been evacuated from gaza's alifa hospital what do we know about the operation that made this possible well it was certainly array of good news array of Hope in this otherwise really devastating War uh these babies 31 to be exact have been evacuated from the hospital it's been really uh on top of the priority list for noos and for the medical workers inside the hospital to evacuate those babies once their incubators turned off uh over the weekend because of a lack of fuel to run the generators in the hospital and now we have seen that success that successfully happen it was a a procedure carried out by The Who in conjunction with the Palestinian red president Association uh and of course the military as well the Israeli military needing to oversee that as well to make sure that they were granted safe passage we know now that they're safely in the South or as safe as uh anyone can be in Gaza at the moment the reality that there is no safe place in Gaza but those babies now uh moved to a hospital in the South there is paperwork and Arrangements being made that they will potentially be allowed to cross into Egypt be taken over with some staff and be looked after in an Egyptian Hospital hital there now there are still up to 300 people both patients and Personnel in the hospital very very sick patients complicated uh to have evacuated and that is the next part of the process to make sure that they are able to also evacuate from alifa that was DW's Rebecca ritters reporting for us from Jerusalem Rebecca thank
