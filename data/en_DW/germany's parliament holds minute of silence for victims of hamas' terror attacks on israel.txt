Israel was beginning to forge closer ties with Arab countries under agreements known as the Abraham Accords Palestinians say these ignored their situation and failed to address their conflict with Israel and now there are fears that the fighting could escalate within the region hamas's recent terrorist attacks on Israel have led to questions about how it managed to carry out an assault of this scale and if the consequences could spark wider conflict in the region for many years Iran has been one of the main supporters of Hamas and other Palestinian islamist militant groups providing both arms and financial aid Teran expressed support for the latest attacks but denied involvement Hezbollah the Iran backed and heavily armed organization in neighboring Lebanon is also a supporter of Hamas Hamas and Hezbollah are deemed terrorist organizations by both Germany and the United States among others hamas's latest attacks come as relations have warmed between Israel and some Arab countries the US has suggested the attacks may have been in part an attempt to undermine this process Iran's longtime rival Saudi Arabia had reportedly been close to signing an agreement with Israel it was hoped this could lead to more Arab and predominantly Muslim countries forging better relations with Israel the Saudi government has said it will only normalize ties if there is Major progress towards the creation of a Palestinian State since 2020 Israel has also normalized relations under the Abraham Accords with the United Arab Emirates Bahrain and Morocco they joined Jordan and Egypt in having diplomatic relations with Israel Sudan has also taken steps towards normalized relations for many Palestinians these Agreements are seen as serving only the interests of Israel and as an abandonment of the Palestinian cause by Arab states we wanted to get the Israeli perspective as well therefore DW's Hans brunt interviewed Israel's ambassador to Germany Ron proor here in Berlin this is how that interview went Ambassador proor there are people who say that the events in Israel now are comparable to 911 in the United States is that a comparison you would support the answer is yes from the shock H but you know Saturday the 7th of October will be a day that is going to stay in memory as a black day it's the deadliest day that the state of Israel and the nation state of the Jewish people have ever encountered those images the state state of Israel was basically established in order for those images never to happen we are going to react in such a manner that Hamas is a terrorist organization with a terrorist infrastructure will not be there after we finish turning to the situation now in Israel at the moment the Gaza Strip has been cut off from the outside completely even including water and electricity that is uh impacting more than 2 million people isn't that a little bit harsh against more than 2 million people that live there question I'm going to stop you in me all gloves of off this is you have to understand this is a paradigm shift between humanity and barbarism civilization and beasts this is not a cycle of violence this is not two sides this is one side a terrorist organization that has decided to wage war against Israel and we will go after them everywhere they are in order to eradicate this infrastructure of Terror that basically terrorizes not us only Israel but the whole region but it uh appears to be necessary to take this fight into Gaza that will cause more casualties both for the Israelis and for the Palestinians is that price necessary Israel will pay a high price if we go in because we don't have another Choice with our soldiers with our boys with our girls a price in addition to the price of what we have just paid we're going to do that because we cannot even think of living in this region where the own neighborhood is looking so what about peace what are the chances for some kind of peace between Israel and the Palestinians and for the Middle East as a the whole no one thinks of Peace at this stage we need to make sure that Kamas is taken out believe me when they're out there are many and you've seen that in the region that want peace we want peace at the end of the day we are going to deal with it but now let's go not go back we haven't finished this we're not we're in the middle of morning we are not thinking of anything else but making sure that those who did it to us will not be there but there has been some progress on the Peace front in recent months between Israel and some Arab states and most recently there was talk about some kind of agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia is all that finished now first you understand that it is not coincidential that Iran and Hamas but especially Iran saw this aona with Saudi Arabia and decided to destroy it so it's not coincidential and Kamas at this stage and Iran we are now in the middle of War we may have to make sure that those who did it to us are going to be punished severely after that I'm sure that they're going to be many in the region that are going to move forward in creating a better Middle East and a possible comprehensive peace but now this is not the things that we're talking about Ambassador proo thank you very much for talking to D and mid East analyst Shany rosan has joins me in the studio for more shanni welcome we heard the Israeli Ambassador there speaking very emphatically about going into Gaza in the form of an invasion of some sort how much of that is military necessity and how much of that is political necessity well that's a great question first of all this is the the Gaza Playbook we're almost used to you know we've had so many rounds of uh attacks and counterattacks between Israelis and and and Hamas that always uh many times ended up also with with inv with ground uh operations it's always problematic um so on the one hand Israel says it wants to rewrite the the the the Playbook CU because the old one obviously has been the way they see it has been broken by Hamas but it's not quite clear what is the new one um we know from the ground there's no doubts they are preparing for it we know also they're very much wary of it and it's not clear what shape it will take and netan you were asking about the politics is in a very right-wing government and he needs to of course also the base you see you see the people they want to feel something is happening um he's very much bound to show that Israel is doing something um hopefully we hearing today of a Unity government coming in he might have more balanced uh more balanced voices that might give him away for other maybe alternatives for operation if you're talking about a government that is facing criticism for one of the biggest intelligence failures I think in 50 years there hasn't been an intelligence failure like this and Netanyahu has talked about has compared Hamas to Isis terrorists clearly Netanyahu needs to show something some action to the Israeli people and the Israeli people expect that this the immediate response is of course we've seen The Siege on Gaza we see the the heavy bombardments on Gaza the toll death in Gaza is rising exponentially almost every you know by the hour um it's very much part of netanyahu's need to show here we are doing something I don't know if uh and I think many experts agree that this is not yet the turning point this is not yet giving the effect that will mean that this time things are going to end up differently unlike what we've seen before one can make the argument that the peace process has been dead for quite some time does this completely bury it I think think it's early to to to say and even the Ambassador himself said it might not still be dead in the water it can be that in a few months when this is done in a certain way uh hopefully there's still hope to get some negotiations uh and diplomatic efforts on the you know going and successful we'll leave it there for the time being but thanks so much for joining us in the studio Shan rosanes the terrorist attack on Israel is being discussed currently in Germany's Parliament lawmakers are about to observe a minute silence let's take you straight to the German Parliament the bundist right podium as well as the ambassador of Israel d thank you for finding the time to come here during this difficult time for you we condemn the inhuman Terror attacks on Israel severely since Saturday Hamas and other terrorists have committed horrible crimes against Israel Terror this is Terror like we've never had it before [Applause] online videos show barbaric violence against families small children old people during the holiday at home or in the streets they had gathered against people that were celebrating peacefully at a music festival against um civilian Society against soldiers against a whole country images show murders hostages taken sadistic actions and they also show people who celebrate this perfidious Terror this inhumane brutality shocks us deeply and it has to make all of us ashamed and horrified it cannot be justified by anything it has to stop straight away all hostages have to be liberated straight away and I would like to say very clearly that we do not accept any support of those horrible cowardly crimes accept those cruel crimes against children women and men here in Germany on the streets or online when they are celebrated here do not accept any agreement with those crimes that are being relativized here there is only one possible opinion condemn the Crimes by Hamas and we do not accept any hostility towards Israel and no anti-semitic opinions and now more than ever before we need to do everything we can to protect our Jewish institutions and cens from attacks Israeli security is German reason of state and that's where we are going to debate Israeli security and the situation in the Middle East in the bundestag as well tomorrow morning at 9:00 the chancellor Schulz is going to give a declaration a governmental declaration and our foreign minister analina bbok is uh available for questions from the bundes Israel has the right to protect itself and protect their population and defend itself Ambassador Excellency I can Ure theet the Israeli government and population are full and unlimited uh support from the German bundist tar we are at the side of our Israeli friends and in the name of the German bundist I would like to uh express our deep condolences we grieve together with you and with the family of the murdered in these dark hours our thoughts are with you with the families of victims with the injured and the abducted hostages that are being used as human Shields and with the families and friends that fear for them their unimaginable fear cannot be expressed in words but you can be sure that we are feeling with you and now I would like to ask you all to get up for a minute of solemn silence for the gentlemen those are very moving moments here in the bundus T as full as I've never seen it and president has expressed the solidarity of the German population in the presence of Israeli Ambassador hono who is standing on the panel here next to the German Federal president it's a reason of state and Israel has the right to defend itself and to protect the population Bas has expressed the full support of Germany all all groups were represented here in their full numbers and we can only hope that this is going to continue a of sence the German Parliament just observed there for before that that was preceded by the president of the German bundestag beel Bas uh laying out Germany's position as best as she could she she talked about the inhuman brutality that uh Germany has seen that Israel has had to suffer and that it can't be justified any action such as that she also called for all hostages to be released immediately and she particularly said that uh any celebration of uh these crimes uh will not be accepted in Germany whether in the online sphere or on the streets in uh Germany we are also expecting a statement from uh German foreign minister andelina Bok any moment now that's bbas the German bundist talk president still addressing the German Parliament she also clarified rather announced that tomorrow at 9:00 in the morning we are expecting a so-called government declaration from Chancellor Olaf Schultz and I believe we are going to hear from analena Bok the German foreign minister right now there she is [Music] colleagues given the particular situation I would also like in the name of my colleague Stephy lamp who is also going to be questioned here I would like to speak in her name as well ladies and gentlemen colleagues hundreds of young women and men who were at a music festival celebrating life were chased by terrorists through the desert and killed massacred old people families who were peacefully celebrating Shabbat in their homes were brutally attacked killed mothers and small children were beaten onto Jeeps humiliated and abducted as hostages what Israel has gone through in those last days is barbaric it is unbearable and I believe nobody here in this room can understand the grief the suffering of all those families and entirely the action of cannnot be justified by anything Israel has the right towards their citizens even the duty within international law to protect itself against this horrible Act of Terror for Israel October 7th 2023 is a deep cut the bloodiest day and the history of the country like the German Bund just underlined we the German government are firmly at the side of our Israeli friends because Israeli security is a German reason of state and towards is have promised all our support in all areas suffering of civilians of innocent children men and women is a part of the terror strategy of Hamas Terror strategy suffering of Israeli civilians and mainly by the abducted hostages among which there are some German Nationals and double nationalists this Terror strategy is uh using those lives is playing with them in a very brutal manner is playing also with the life of Palestinian women and children that Hamas terrorists are using as human Shields life is important to me to us in this situation all contributions that we can provide from outside together with our partners and friends in consultation with we are working towards um the to avoid that the terrorist script can become a reality that means to do everything to stop this perfidious game with civilians and I am grateful for the debate that you in Parliament had yesterday on the Democratic parties concerning the question of ongoing support it would be wrong to stop vital humanitarian Aid the provision of food and water for families because that is also part of the terrorist script dear colleagues you are aware that the federal government and the EU commission are sending scrutinizing their aid to the Palestine territories and in this exceptional situation we are reviewing them again including humanitarian Aid in close cooperation with the United Nations it's also very important that together with the UN we are doing everything to create safe spaces for women and children in Gaza different organization ations are contributing to that now but the main priority is the security of the state of Israel and that's the focus of my talks of my work with Partners in the region different partners in the region which we all need now and with the partners in Europe and in the whole world mainly our American friends to avoid that with their Terror can create a fire in the region and to avoid adding fuel to the fire and allow them to play the script of Terror thank you then I would start directly with a questioning making a statement in uh the German Parliament just uh moments back she making she made it clear that what Israel has gone through is barbaric that's the word she used and she also said that the actions of Hamas cannot in any way be justified also clarifying that Israel has a duty to protect itself the comments there from analina Bok German foreign minister we can head over now to DW political correspondent Jula sa Deli who's been listening in as well Jula and Lena Bok also said that Germany is firmly at the side of Israel I'd just like to know from you what is the extent of German support that Israel can expect well Germany is has the security of Israel as a reason of state is one of the founding principles of the German State and that has again been stated by analena Bok just now but also in the past few days from from the chancellor Olaf schz and they have said they were they will stand firmly at the side of Israel uh they have said that Israel has the right to defend itself to protect its territory and its citizens within uh the limits of international law and that uh the priority right now is for Israel to do just that we uh don't know whether there has not been talk of whether uh Germany will provide support in any other way but for now it is uh standing closely by the side of its allly uh the foreign minister has said that she is in close talks with uh Germany's allies but other partners both in the Middle East in the region but also across the world in particular with the us to try to make sure that this conflict does not escalate that there is no fuel uh put on the fire that is already burning and that the situation is uh contained as much as possible as uh things uh at the moment are looking critical both anina babok and bundar president beel Bas talked about uh German hostages that have been uh taken in by Hamas clearly that must be a source of a tremendous worry for the German government how does the German government intend to resolve that situation well we've heard from Andel bebook that uh the they are in uh continuous talks with uh colleagues on the ground but also with actors on the ground who have open communication uh ways to uh Hamas she has said that uh given that Hamas is a terrorist organization uh the communication is not in any way easy and she has also called on countries like Qatar and other uh Gulf States to facilitate communication with Hamas to try uh any way possible uh to get these hostages out we haven't heard of any concrete uh plans or any concrete uh indications that a contact has been established or that uh uh they know exactly where the hostages are and how they're going to get that out but a conversations are ongoing but we have heard from some of the families of the people taking hostage that uh communication with the foreign Ministry hasn't always uh been very good it has taken a while for them to come into communication so uh for now uh all the questions remain open there is one other element that Ana Bok touched on and that was the aspect of humanitarian Aid she did say that it would be wrong to stop humanitarian Aid to the Palestinian territories because that would be part of a so-called Terror script what did she mean by that what she meant is that uh the to ensure that uh the people people uh in Gaza receive the basic care that uh is their right to receive to receive Food to see receive Medical Care it is important that uh Germany uh continues to provide that support many many people a majority of people in the Gaza Strip are dependent on humanitarian Aid and uh were uh this Aid not to continue arriving the a thought is that the terrorist group Hamas could use this as a weapon to incite more hatred to incite more violence what the German state is now going to do is that it's going to review where its development and humanitarian Aid goes to make sure that it does not end up in the wrong hands and that this Aid goes directly to the civilians in Gaza who need it the most we'll leave it there for the time being but thanks so much for joining us today DW's political correspondent Jula selli in Berlin thanks so
