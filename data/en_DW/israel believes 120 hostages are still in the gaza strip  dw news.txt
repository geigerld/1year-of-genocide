and her boyfriend in the October 7 Terror attacks was among the first to emerge three men were also freed in the operation almog mu Jan Andre klov and schoi ziv it's Israel's biggest rescue operation of the war so far Netanyahu vowed to bring the remaining hostages home Israel just carried out a remarkable rescue operation of four hostages held by Hamas this operation required Ingenuity and courage of the highest degree and our soldiers performed in an unmatchable way we're committed to getting the release of all the hostages and we expect Kamas to release them all but if they don't we'll do whatever it takes get them all back home Israel released this footage which it says shows three hostages being freed the news sparked celebrations outside the hospital and was announced to beachgoers in Tel Aviv but in Gaza people are mourning the Dead the Hamas government media office says Israeli air strikes in central Gaza killed more than 200 people hundreds more are injured in the same area where the hostages were rescued hospitals are overwhelmed a resident describes what she saw at the newsat refugee camp people were standing on the road thinking they're safe suddenly a jet struck them now they're dead children were on that street they had nothing to do with this they were innocent the Israeli occupation Army committed a horrific massacre in newat Camp the occupation directly targeted civilians in nerat Market which was busy with vendors customers and refugees Israel says it was targeting militant infrastructure the Palestinian Authority is calling for an emergency meeting of the US Security Council all right I want to bring in our correspondent in Jerusalem Tanya Kramer she's been on this story for us all day Tanya the Israeli defense minister calling this a daring operation that took months to plan what has the army said about this operation well first of all I think it's a very emotional day here in Israel a lot of people were celebrating the news and the Israeli Army said that this was a very risky daytime operation based on intelligence that were supported by you know the uh the air strikes uh and artillery F heavy fighting also in that area and they have been rescuing those four hostages they said they were held in two uh apartment PLS apparently not really very far from each other one of the one of the hostages of a a young woman nor aamani she was held alone uh in one of the apartments and the other three were held together so they managed to uh extract them from there as the Army said under heavy fire and then bringing those to the beach area of Gaza and then take them from there uh with helicopters to Tel Aviv and just a word to Noah aamani she became a bit the face on October 7th she was taken by motorcycle by the militants to Gaza her boyfriend is still in Gaza as hostage his fate is unknown and that also is of course of great concern to Israelis here the 120 or so just remaining there on the ground in Gaza there are reports that more than 200 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes in roughly the same area where the hostages were rescued um what have you heard about that Tanya yeah there were reports early on today uh uh that these air strikes were happening also from eyewitnesses uh in Gaza and uh this happened in narad in central Gaza narad where a lot of displaced Palestinians have taken uh shelter there it's a refugee uh Camp so um we understand from the Ministry of Health there in Gaza uh Hamas saying that 210 people were killed 400 were injured and we've been hearing from medical sources of the hospital one of the last hospitals actually uh working there that they have been taken in many uh injured people there are overwhelmed and there has also been a lot of uh videos uh of the aftermath circulating uh on social media uh uh from uh the day to day there okay DW is Tanya Kramer with the latest tonight from Jerusalem Tanya as always thank you we want to stay on the story of the hostages today I'm joined Now by sahiro Shahar Moore from Tel Aviv his uncle Abraham Mundo is still being held hostage in Gaza so hero it's good to have you with us we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us today I mean four hostages is rescued today um how did you feel when you heard the news overwhelmed with joy I I personally know the father ofu yovani and it it it was great seeing him getting United with his daughter after such a long time and and and so much waiting it it really filled my my heart with joy and we got great news for four families today in Israel that four mothers will hug their their son or daughter amazing amazing news does does this give you hope that your uncle may also be brought home safe and sound one day I'm afraid not not in this way not in a military operation we know that my uncle is is kept below ground and probably much heavier security and um I I don't think there is no possibility of of of a military operation releasing all the 120 ER people that are still kept in in captivity the the the the only way to get them back is signing a a deal there is no other way to get them back well where does that leave then the the your country Israel um tomorrow I mean the Prime Minister this is a good day for him he did not have to answer the ultimatum from Vinnie gun about a plan for a post-war Gaza I mean do you see this as a green light for this war cabinet to continue on with this campaign in Gaza I'm afraid so I'm afraid so I'm afraid that the the the people who see short sight and and see okay we we released four maybe we can release the the rest of them there is no way the only way to release the whole the the whole group of them together uh whoever is still alive of course is is signing a deal and in order to sign a deal the war the fighting must be stopped and this is a price that Israel is still reluctant to pay and this is why Benjamin Nan had his you know day in the Sun so to speak he got a lot of nice photo ops um you know but tomorrow we are waking up to to the same reality that we were yesterday and the day before that there are still 120 people in for less it's it's it's great relief of course for these four families but 120 other families are still in the same situation as they were a week ago a month ago seven months ago but Z do you think that the the public mood in Israel will change enough if all the hostages were brought home on the condition that Hamas is allowed to remain intact in some form I mean is that something that the Israelis are willing to swallow right now I don't see the Israel as willing to swallow something like this but right now they are not the Israelis are not talking about the day after at all so you know it's like um whatever what what will happen after we s we saw that parts of Gaza the northern Gaza the idei to had to come back again and sometimes again because you know after conquering a land you need to give the keys so to speak to someone to to take control to seize power over this uh over this land and if you do not then practically the Kamas is still holding on so uh I think there must be some way to to to negotiate a a something you know like uh um a middle ground you know maybe a a some sort of of a political Hamas I I really don't know but right now this is a very hard pill to swap follow for for most of Israeli public but then again Public Public public view do change yeah well Ziro we we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us and um we certainly wish you and we your uncle all the best zahiro Shahar Moore thank you thank you very much well here with me at the big table now in our studio is our Middle East analyst shaie rosanis shaie that just gentleman there he does not think that the current course of Israel is going to result in bringing all of the hostages back home safe and sound he wants an end to the fighting is that what a majority of Israelis want tonight well that's that's exactly the rift tearing apart the Israel Society for for months now there's the hostages families but not just them a big part of the Israeli Society who support the need for a deal and that and understand that that would probably be the only way to bring uh them all of them or the almost 120 left there especially if you look at the numbers in the last8 months Israel have managed to release or to retrieve alive only seven of those hostages each one we know they're all even now in this case there one of them was kept alone and the three others uh together so just scatter they're all scattered in all many places in in in Gaza Strip and many of them also underground so it's not really feasible that's what a big part of the population said on the other hand more of the right leaning part also the right that is the part that is more important for n as his base there are those who feel like it's only military might and further pressure on Hamas that will bring uh more hostages home and will bring Hamas to make some concessions Hamas says and we were reporting this earlier that um 200 Palestinians were killed today where those four Israeli hostages were rescued in Gaza and you've been working your sources what have you learned well it it's not by accident of course this is all connected the Israeli forces were not operating at the center of narat this morning at broad daylight when this operation started so they had to find their way in probably using some trucks maybe uh we hear some reports from Palestinians that these were actually supposedly Aid trucks if that was the case we might see uh very severe and dire implications for the supply of Aid into Gaza uh in the next days coming from that but aside of that the biggest problem was for the forces once they have taken the hostages to find their way out to find a a way to escape without you know jeopardizing the lives of the soldiers and and the hostages and that required heavy bombardments and a lot of artillery from the Israeli forces and this is where we see most of the P casual you know casualties on the Palestinian side many of them civilians including you know uh Children and Families the way the Israelis say that you know they point the blame on Hamas saying Hamas have chose to embed the hostages among civilians to to operate within very densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip and that you know they should be the one to blame for that if these four hostages had not been rescued today would we be here tonight talking about the the collapse of the Israeli government the maybe the end of Benjamin Netanyahu it seemed to be that case but now he seems to be stronger uh than ever but but you know we've also seen Benny gun the the the centu former General who was uh supposed to set speech today basically quitting his support for this government um he canceled it but he also said that he understand that this is a tactic achievement but it doesn't change the need for a strategic shift in Israel's policy so Israel's problem are very much the same as they were yesterday nothing has you know substantially changed in the situation we will also see the Americans secretary blinkin coming to Israel later this week they want to see progress you know they want to see dramatic strategic shift in the future of Gaza in Israel's conduct with the war and they're still hoping this can be achieved and you know these are live pictures that we're looking at right now you know this is the mass support that we see of many demonstrations today uh this night supporting for the hostages and their release and the deal pushing netan to go forward for the deal claiming this is the only way to actually bring back all the hostages left um without jeopardizing jeopardizing further lives of soldiers and of the hostages themselves and there's also great concern about from these families right now as we speak because they understand Hamas will probably change the way it operates now in Gaza in order to protect the hostages kept in order you know to avoid any Israeli military operations further down the line so many of those soldiers uh the hostages like we were seeing today they were held above ground if any of them are still left above ground many of them are now being you know sent into the tunnels um and there's great fear for their lives if you talk to their family members in Israel shie as always it's good to have you here in the studio good to get your analysis as well thank you you're welcome
