the Israeli government and in particular its prime minister are facing growing criticism over their handling of the aftermath of hamas's terrorist attacks Israel media are reporting that Benjamin Netanyahu is at odds with his War cabinet and Military Generals in the past weeks we've seen the Prime Minister visiting troops across Israel especially the forces massing on the Israeli Gaza border ahead of an expected ground Invasion but sources cited by Israeli media claim that there is growing displeasure at his refusal to engage with milit AR leaders Netanyahu have so far refrained from admitting that he made any mistakes before during and after the attacks by Hamas tonight we saw the first public show of self-reflection Netanyahu is saying that everyone will have to explain themselves including himself citizens of Israel October the 7th was a black day in our history we will get to the bottom of what happened on the southern border around Gaza this debacle will be in investigated everyone will have to give answers including me and for more now I want to bring in DW's mid East analyst shaie rosanis so the very self-aware Benjamin Netanyahu tonight we know that the Prime Minister he's come under criticism um did he deliver the message that the Israeli people may have been expecting well 220 families of hostages were expecting to hear something about the hostages that did not happen but did bring himself to as close as I think we will ever get from him to hear I am responsible I apologize I take responsibility for what happened he said it's clear to him this this has been a great failure and there's going to be a lot of hard questions to be asked and he will be amongst those to be answering them so that's close enough for many Israelis um we need to keep in mind it's been 19 days Nan has not held a single press conference not facing the journalist he's not pressing the facing the Press so he's not really answering the hard questions yet um so far he has support but it he understands that he cannot last for too long military leaders in Israel quickly acknowledge their failure to um protect Israelis after October 7th I mean has there been any admission of political responsibility for the security failures on October 7th well if you want to focus on the security failures that's very easy for the politicians you know to to put this as a failure of intelligence the Army that's a very safe spot for politicians but there is of course the need within Israeli public to look at the broader picture what role did politicians have in their deeds in securing or not securing and in striving or not striving towards a political solution to the Palestinian problem towards you know negotiating backdoor deals through qat with Hamas you know this is something done by the political uh you know level and not by only by by the military so in that aspect um we have not seen enough of the political uh backbone of Israel stepping up and saying you know we also have a a stake in in this failure the consensus now is let's first fight and then deal with everything else um but it's also as we're learning that this fight will take very long um there's also an understanding that maybe harder questions still need to pop up beforehand and we've seen a former Chief of Staff of the um Israel Defense Forces saying that Netanyahu should resign now others saying that the government is dysfunctional I mean it's it's not a pretty picture I mean what do we know about the views of active military leaders in Israel well active military leaders are are silent uh we know about some uh Rifts regarding operational uh issues for example the ground oper you know invasion is it coming when is it coming should we uh have more uh humanitarian Aid coming in or less but when it comes to netanyahu's political future we don't hear anything um of that sort um we do hear among politicians uh even from netanyahu's party more and more voices saying it is clear that he will not be able to stay much longer in his position once the fighting is gone um it's still yet to be seen if they will live up to that or where will he it lead him we've seen Nan uh is masterful in finding his way out even from the most dire crisises do you think he'll survive this War I think this the chances are very slim but I also think that we all know too good in order to be too quick to say that he will not be able to survive that's a very good point I mean he's been written off too many times before let me ask you about um bidy gun he is a member of this emergency Unity government he is a man with a lot of military experience is he crucial to I this war having a successful end he is crucial I mean the the rightwing of part of n was going government they say well he's part of the conception that failed but then we he is quite crucial because this is where we zoom out and we look at the Americans you know linkoln did not make it to Israel before the unity government was announced Netanyahu had you know enlarging the government has helped him gain The credibility from the people but also from a big la like the us we know that when blinkin was around and he was sitting with the cabinet uh the the unity ministers it was important for him to include them in the picture we know that their presence as the more moderate Balancing Act in Net's government is very very important in that aspect of getting control you know getting support for for Net's actions how much of these these problems would you say go back pre October 7th and I'm thinking about Netanyahu pushing for these judicial reforms a lot of people critics even the Biden Administration saying he's attacking the checks and balances system of government well there are PE voices within Israel still in a margin saying that that the enemy that Hamas saw the fragility of the Israeli society and thought it can take advantage of it and we've seen it was quite successful there are these voices so far still in a margins but but it's it and we've seen a an unbelievable Unity among you know from all ranks from Ultra Orthodox and Arab Israelis everybody joining in in these crucial moments in this terrible you know facing this this attack um but we also know this will not last for too long you know uh the Visions are already starting to come uh you know to the surface when it comes to the hosal when it comes to humanitarian crisis when it comes to policy and then you know the Hawks will remain Hawks the does will we know will stay doves and and N is as a hawk and he's surrounded by hawks sha rosanis as always we appreciate you coming in we appreciate your analysis thank you you're welcome all right I'm going to pull in journalist Samy sole now he is in Jerusalem Sammy let's go through this the prime minister is saying that the IDF is preparing for a ground incursion we've heard from French president IM macron he has called that and I'm quoting here an error we've also got media reports that Israel actually agreed to delay its offensive I mean can you give us some clarity here on what the message is yeah well definitely natany is preparing the Israeli public for a long campaign in the Gaza Strip he's preparing the public this is considered to be like a very important speech and this is how it's received in Israel now as to the time clearly it's not going to happen tonight we've read let's say in the Wall Street Journal that Americans have been asking Israel to postpone this kind of ground incursion especially because they want to deploy air defense systems throughout the Middle East to protect American uh sites in places such as Iraq Jordan Kuwait Syria and so forth so the Americans are now preparing for what they think would be a strikes against them by different factions in the Middle East so therefore we're seeing this kind of like postponing Sammy the the Prime Minister also spoke about security lapses that were exposed in the October 7th attacks I mean did he take any responsibility for this and maybe if you could just remind us of what those lapses are yeah well we we did not hear from him the taking of responsibility the kind of statements that we heard from people uh from the uh military Echelon and this was much awaited I think many in the Israeli public they regard Netanyahu as being responsible for at least some of the failure and and we didn't hear that nevertheless he said that in the after the war he will answer questions as to what has happened and of course we're talking about a a failure first on the behalf of the intelligence uh that they did not realize that Hamas has been preparing for many months maybe a whole year such a large scale operation and the Israel that has been boasting of having such a sophisticated intelligence knowing where everything and what is happening it totally failed on this on top of that we had operational failure of the troops and especially we're talking about the towers that were taken down by Hamas drones so there was no proper surveillance and of course the wall that Israel built through along the Gaza Strip that that failed to to to stop the uh hundreds of Hamas people and the air strikes um that are hitting the Gaza Strip they intensify today right indeed we're talking about a a pounding of the Gaza Strip This is what Israel said it would do and it will continue h some are saying that this is why they're not going yet for a ground incursion they still want to bombard the Gaza Strip unfortunately we we seeing casualties civilian casualties um there's a very known journalist from Al jaaz while his wife a daughter and Son were all killed in one of these bombardments and this is going to continue journalist Sammy Soo with the latest tonight from Jerusalem Sammy thank
