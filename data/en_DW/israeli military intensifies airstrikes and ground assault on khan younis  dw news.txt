battles are raging across Gaza as Israel presses ahead with its campaign to eliminate Hamas the Israeli military is stepping up attacks on the southern city of Han yunas where it says key Hamas militants are HED up the militants say they may kill the 137 hostages They seized during their October 7th attack unless Israel meets their demands the US and a number of other countries classify Hamas as a terror organization the humanitarian situation in Gaza is described as apocalyptic with hospitals on the verge of collapse and residents saying there are no safe places the Hamas ran Health Ministry says Israel has killed nearly 18,000 Palestinians mainly civilians in its offensive this father is constantly on the Move in Han yunes going from hospital to hospital in the hopes of receiving care for his two injured Sons he is the only one in his family left to take care of the two boys his wife daughter and father were all killed in a strike close to their [Music] home it's our children's right to live to live in security to live in peace to find food to find medicine to find treatment to have a dignified life but there's no treatment no medicine and no food and if someone doesn't die from the war they'll die from Hunger from the lack of food or from the lack of treatment at Rafa Hospital many families have had to say their goodbyes to loved ones Israel targeted the main city in southern Gaza after Hamas threatened that it would not release any of the remaining Israeli hostages alive if Israel did not release more Palestinian prisoners my aunt's family was displaced from KH Yunis due to the war they came to Rafa which they said was a safe area to my sister's house they were in a safe Zone when it happened the whole family died my aunt her husband their children up in the north of Gaza smoke bombs have been released at the jabalia refugee camp forcing already displaced gazin out of what Little Shelter they have as civilians are desperately running out of options to find Refuge across the strip Israel has again rejected calls for a ceasefire claiming that the end of Hamas is near all right let's cross to DW's funny FAA in Jerusalem funny Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the beginning of the end of Hamas is here why does he say that but first and foremost Israel is under growing International and domestic pressure here on the ground there so many people saying that prime minister netan should end this war there has to be if not a ceasefire longterm but at least humanitarian pauses uh on the ground during Gaza Strip and in the light of those calls of this International domestic calls prime minister netan may have said those remarks that he did which is he claimed that Hamas militants have started to surrender a dozen of them he said without providing actual any evidence on that and there were counter claims made by hammad saying that they have destroyed several military vehicles more than 180 they said and they have also rejected those claims that Hamas militans that the fighters are actually surrounding surrendering to Israeli forces now while these claims and counter claims are being made we have seen really shocking pictures of Palestinian detainees in Gaza Strip there really stripped down to their underwear uh Israel saying that this is a security measure making sure that nobody's wearing explosives but humanitarian Ian organizations have raised the alarm Bell there again saying that this war while it's ongoing has to be conducted in a way that it is in accordance with International humanitarian law Hamas has now threatened the lives of the Israeli hostages it is holding if Palestinian prisoners aren't released what has been the reaction in Israel to that threat there hostages and it's belief that about 137 hostages are still in the hands of Hamas militants have been used basically as a bargaining chip from the beginning from uh by the Hamas militant it's really not surprising that they keep saying unfortunately that they are threatening H the the hostages if there isn't for example a prisoner swap or if the aggression uh by uh Israel is not stopping but uh Israel says that this is not going to happen what they're actually are doing right now is focusing on hanun trying to take out Hamas officials they say as their way or their solution forward Israel keep seeing and repeating to uh both eliminate Hamas but also trying to find those hostages trying to make sure that they're being released but as I'm saying this I've been also hearing that yes an estimated more than 130 hostages I beli to be still in the hands of Hamas but apparently unfortunately 20 of those hostages may have been killed as this war is Raging on funny how concerning is it that Qatar one of the key mediators to a week-long truce we've had has said the window for a second ceasefire is narrowing well first of all it's not just Qatar that is really raising this this this alarm Bell that there must be a ceasefire there must be some sort of a negotiation and the way out of this but internationally we have heard really calls after calls especially by the United Nations uh that really went unheard with regard to the voting in the security Council last week Friday uh that V by the United States to make sure that there is an immediate ceasefire so we have heard it over and over again what Israel says in fact prime minister netan reiterating again yesterday that any call with regard to a ceasefire is inconsistent with their aim to eliminate Hamas having said that it doesn't look like an end of the war or at least the intensity of the war that's playing out right now is going to be H coming up very soon fny FHA in Jerusalem thank you
