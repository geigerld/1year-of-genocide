alarming unacceptable a nightmare just some of the international reactions to a deadly incident in Gaza which saw scores of people die in a chaotic Scramble for food there there are conflicting reports of what exactly happened Hamas Health officials say more than a 100 people were killed after Israeli soldiers opened fire on a crowd near an aid Convoy Israeli officials say most of the Dead were trampled in a stampede more in this report these aerial images have been released by Israel's military it says they show Palestinians in Gaza City running towards eight trucks in the early hours of Thursday morning resulting in a deadly Stampede at 4:45 a.m. a mob ambushed the a trucks bringing the Convoy to a halt as you can see in this video the tanks that were there to secure the Convoy sees the gazand being trampled and cautiously tries to disperse the mob with a few warning shots when the hundreds became thousands and things got out out of hand the T Commander decided to retreat to avoid harm to the thousands of gazans that were there the Israel Defense Forces operate according to the Rules of Engagement and The Intern ational law no IDF strike was conducted towards the aid Convoy the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza has presented a different version of events saying more than 100 civilians were shot dead by Israeli troops while waiting for Aid eyewitnesses said that some truck drivers tried to escape the Israeli fire causing deaths and injuries and some of the Wounded said they were hit by Israeli gunshots after they stopped shooting we went back to get our Aid by the time I got flower and some canned goods and took it down from the truck they shot at us if you want to get us Aid this way then you might as well not bring anything the US says it's trying to establish exactly what happened and that the incident underscores the need to expand the supply of humanitarian Aid into Gaza two things are clear one just from the aerial footage you can look at that and and right away conclude the situation is incredibly desperate and that tells you that we need to do more to get humanitarian assistance in uh and then the second thing is that too many Palestinians died today as has been true far too many days since October 7th and so that's why we continue to push for a temporary ceasefire agreement President Joe Biden has warned that it could complicate the negotiations underway between Israel and Hamas to reach a temporary halt in the fighting as we've heard there the different versions of the events in Gaza here's Jerusalem based journalist Sami Soko with more on this yeah well I think maybe the important part is actually the fact that the Israel Defense Forces they admitted opening fire at the crowd uh they said that there was a tank and soldiers that opened fire at the pal iians they were unarmed if they would have been armed we would have heard about it so we're talking about opening fire of towards a group of unarmed Palestinians and they say that the distance between this force and these Palestinians was tens of meters so they weren't that close nevertheless the IDF said that they posed the threat and so these soldiers we're talking about around 4:00 it was dark it was night conditions they felt that they were under threat they opened the fire and they claim that they only hit 10 but when we go to a shifa hospital we see that the numbers of course are much higher so I think if you would want to investigate you would have to go to shifa and and and see how many were wounded from the from that shooting
