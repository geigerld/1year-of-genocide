we begin with the war in Gaza where there's no sign of a letup in the fighting despite ongoing talks as calls grow for Israel to scale back its military operation inside the territory it has released these images of what they say is a major Hamas Command Center in the heart of Gaza City it's alleged that the network of tunnels was used by senior Hamas leaders including those accused of planning the October 7 terrorist attack gaza's Hamas government says at least 20 th000 people have now been killed in Israel's offensive Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the operation until all of Israel's objectives are met there is no end to scenes like this in the Gaza Street several Israeli air strike hitting the southern city of Rafa survivors rush to barely functioning hospitals with little hope for safety anywhere in the territory all of a sudden the first rocket landed destroying everything by the time the second rocket hit we weren't able to see anything in the house anymore we barely made it out the whole house fell down we found a woman who had just given birth via cesarian and were able to drag her out with her baby girl who was choking she was taking her last breaths there she is over there the UN estimates that nearly 60% of all gaza's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed and more than 90% of the population displaced as the smoke from the latest bombardment fills the sky above rougher some of them share their desperation we came from the north and they said you should head to Rafa it's a safe place they followed us to Rafa and head us where is it safe where should we go I wish for a complete ceasefire an end to the death and suffering it's been 75 days people are still getting killed there's still people under the rubble I don't hear from many people Communications are out negotiations are taking place that could lead to a new temporary truce but many differences still need to be overcome Qatar based Hamas leader isma hania traveled to kir on Wednesday for talks with Egyptian officials the group which is considered a terrorist organization by multiple countries says it only wants a permanent ceasefire something ruled out by Israel with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that is impossible until Hamas is defeated US President Joe Biden says the US is negotiating a UN resolution that quote could be able it might be be able to agree to this comes as the US holds talks with key allies to avoid another veto ahead of a delayed un Security Council vote the council has so far failed to overcome us objections to a resolution regarding a ceasefire the Arab sponsored resolution to Halt fighting aims to get desperately needed Aid into the Gaza Strip the vote has been delayed twice as diplomats have been negotiating with the US on the wording of the resolution the latest version the text calls for a suspension of hostilities France the UK and Germany joined Global calls for a ceasefire over the weekend despite being uh some of Israel's closest allies for more now I'm joined by DW's special correspondent a Ibrahim in Jerusalem Israel's primee Minister says there will be no ceasefire in Gaza until Hamas is eliminated meanwhile a un Security Council vote on a potential pause and fighting has been delayed and no progress has been reported so far in talks that Hamas is holding in Egypt do you see any signs of movement on the Diplomatic or military fronts I mean just listening to all of the various parties that you just listed involved in all kinds of negotiations it's not difficult to see why we're at this uh uh stalemate at this deadlock so to speak I mean the interests of all of these parties are still quite far away from each other Hamas is now saying that they will not um um you know the conditions for releasing more hostages will not be the same as with the previous uh hostage for prisoner exchange deal they actually want a ceasefire to go into effect before they enter talks into handing over more uh um hostages to Israeli uh uh um authorities um and then there there all the various negotiations that are going on in the U uh in the UN and in the security Council in the security Council the United States which has often been accused of shielding Israel from um from uh having to do more to protect civilians in Gaza by vet by vetoing uh various resolutions for a possible ceasefire they're obviously uh you know so far on uh the side of uh of Israel so trying to convince the United States to agree to anything that a country like Egypt which wants um you know to bypass the inspection mechanism for Aid which has to go through Israel uh is is very very difficult so a lot of competing interests right now that feel like they're very very far away from each other yesterday the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin called on Israel to scale back its operation and make its uh its operation more targeted is there any indication that Israeli forces are doing that Aya no I don't I don't think so I think the Israeli government has been trying very hard to show that it is still steadfast in its um in its war and in its goals and also in the intensity I mean various parts of the strip are still coming under constant bombardment including the southern part which again initially was where civilians were supposed to go for uh safety I think the Israeli government and particularly the Prime Minister find themselves in a kind of difficult situation on the other on the one hand they cannot show uh uh weakness uh to uh Hamas so they can't appear to be backing down from their stated goals to eliminate uh Hamas and to bring back the hostages at the same time huge pressure from Israeli Society from the families of the hostages that are still believed to be in the Gaza Strip is rising every day and getting more intense um and so it's it's it's unclear how they can get out of this dilemma so to speak because so far the majority of hostages that have returned back home not in body bags not as dead bodies were released as part of a negotiation and people here are starting to to see that more and more of course the Israeli government will say that the negotiation was a result of the bombardment that the pressure that they put on Hamas is what eventually led to that negotiation uh but it was as a result of a negotiation nonetheless they weren't rescued by uh Israeli military now Israel's military says it has found a major Hamas Command Center in Gaza City a which uh it says was used by hamas's leaders what more can you tell us about that what we know about this is of course what the Israeli uh Defense Forces uh uh tell us we don't have inde independent access uh to these uh uh tunnels or facilities or command centers to be able to verify uh that information coming from the IDF but what it has it says is that it is as you mentioned a major Hub and that it was used to transport uh weapons uh uh for Hamas and support uh uh the group in its operations a thank you very much that was DW's a Ibrahim in
