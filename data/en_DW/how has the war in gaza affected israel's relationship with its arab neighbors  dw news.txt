now Israeli officials say that they are increasing security screening of Aid deliveries Bound for Gaza to enable more supplies to enter the territory the Kum Shalom checkpoint will not reopen but it will be used to check deliveries before they sent through the rougher border crossing that connects Egypt and Gaza two Egyptian security sources said inspections would begin on Tuesday under a new deal between Israel Egypt and the United States I'll senior inter National correspondent funny FAA has more details we're talking about inspections and not to be confused with the Karam Shalom Crossing to be opened which uh is closed since October 10th actually before that hundreds of trucks could uh get in and get out and deliver much needed Aid hundreds of trucks I'm seeing and right now the situation is that the trucks can only get through the rough AB Crossing but really A Drop in the bucket in the current situation with the ongoing War so having said that an additional inspection a a facility basically there at the junction between Israel and Gaza and Egypt and Gaza may start there an additional in inspection that is much needed and it's seen really as a ray of Hope because that would POS possibly mean to alleviate the pressure on uh uh with regard to traffic there really hundreds of trucks there uh uh uh miles away from the Rua border crossing and that would mean that more trucks could possibly get in they still need to go through rougher border crossing but at least there's an additional inspection and there are hundreds of thousands of people really in Gaza desperately waiting for food for medicine for shelter and for protection in fact the UN has already said that with the ongoing War there's less and less uh Supply available which means that the trucks that are going in there risk of being attacked simply by desperate citizens we have all seen those pictures of people trying to come through the rubble underneath a bakery store that was attacked trying to get bre uh parents skipping meals uh in order to make sure that the children are getting food so the situation is really desperate as a result that Crossing even though it's not opening but the fact that more inspection may be possible as a result is as I say array of hope to get at least a bit of more Aid in that was our senior International correspondent funny faar speaking to us earlier from Jerusalem now the fighting in Gaza is being closely watched by Israel's neighbors though relations with countries like Syria and Lebanon do remain hostile there has been a long slow thw with other longtime foes such as Saudi Arabia meanwhile Qatar has faciliated facilitated negotiations for the release of hostages and prisoners during the Israel Hamas conflict let's take a look now at some of those breakthrough moments that show how things have been evolving in the region a simple handshake that speaks volumes Israel's president and the Emir of Qatar at the c28 climate Summit the first image ever to show the Amir with an Israeli official while at the same moment in Gaza the Qatar broken ceasefire collapsed and War started back up after seven quiet days Israel had been developing better relations with countries in the region including the United Arab Emirates and also katar which is both a us and Hamas Ally and has emerged as an effective negotiating partner although it has no formal diplomatic ties with Israel first there was Egypt Israel's neighbor to the South the two have fought several bitter Wars but in 1979 with us mediation signed a peace treaty and Egypt became the first Arab country to recognize Israel's right to exist it's one of Israel's most strategically vital allies especially when it comes to Gaza Egypt helps Israel enforce its blockade and coordinates on security in 1994 Jordan Israel's neighbor to the east signed a peace treaty as well in 2020 Israel signs agreements also known as the Abraham Accords with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain with a blessing of the Middle East Powerhouse Saudi Arabia those were later followed by normalization agreements with Sudan and Morocco the biggest win for Israel will be normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia the US has been encouraging the two to engage in talks one benefit for the Saudis as well as other Gulf States is they would gain an ally against arch rival Iran one of hamas's prime sponsors secret negotiations were reportedly going on and then came hamas's terror attack on on October the 7th Hamas described the impending Saudi Israeli diplomatic agreement as one of its main reasons for the assault now no matter how the war ends it's difficult to see a path for Israel making major diplomatic progress in the region without some kind of a sustainable long-term solution for the Palestinians and for more I'm joined Now by Ahmed abuda an associate fellow with the chattam house Middle East and North Africa program in London Mr abuda thanks so much for your time today has Israel's war with Hamas done irreparable damage uh to its its diplomatic relationships with the with the Arab world I think we are living now the lowest level of any Prospect of relationship between Israel and the Arab uh world since the second in Father uh I think right now any talk between diplomat Ral between Arab countries and Israel will be toxic and very explosive given the the the the grusome pictures coming from Gaza with thousands of civilians are being killed including uh women and children uh but in the long term I think the prospect still in the table Saudi officials said that in the beginning and I think this is the aim for uh those countries who normalize relations with Israel including bahin UAE and and even Saudi Arabia later mhm you've spoken about the Dilemma that Arab states face in having to to balance showing support for the Palestinians with their own uh strategic interests could you explain to us what strategic benefits for Arab states uh a relationship with is Israel offers so before the war we had a reality where some governments in the Arab world so some strategic value in normalizing their relations with Israel and this had two Dimensions the first one is detering Iran and balancing its influence all over the region uh at a time the United States has been seen as pivoting to Asia to contain the rise of China and focusing on the European theater understandably because of the Ukrainian the war in Ukraine um the second dimension is this Tranquility moment that the region was going through and those governments wanted to build a new Regional order based on infrastructure connectivity trade and economic uh integration and Hightech cooperation and even military high-tech cooperation with Israel now the war in Gaza proved that bypassing the Palestinian question and normalizing relations with Israel without having the Palestinians on the table or even some kind of peace between pal Palestinians and Israel is not a recipe for regional uh stability I think normalization now in the short term is seen as a very risky Endeavor and I think it became unattractive in uh option for those countries who didn't um normalize with Israel until now including Saudi Arabia let's take a moment to look at it the other way around how valuable are Regional relationships to Israel well Israel of course prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu made it his ultimate uh objective strategic objective to expand Israel's Outreach in the Arab world and to uh formalize relations with as many Arab countries as possible and of course making Saudi Arabia the ultimate goal which uh in his view would open the Arab and Islamic uh world to Israel and end its isolations uh sort of on the Palestinian question but by bypassing the Palestinian uh cause and not uh having to sit down with the Palestinian leadership to reach uh peaceful negotiations or peaceful resolution in the long term and I think um this would create great opportunities for Israel uh when it comes to security cooperation with these countries which is going on in the secret uh by the way but not in public and of course expanding its economic footprint um and technological footprint all over the middle but it didn't work among the countries that recently nor normalized ties with Israel is Bahrain as part of the Abraham Accords in light of the war Bahrain has severed those ties and recalled its Ambassador but Israel says that their relations are stable you just mentioned the difference between what's going on in public and behind the scenes I mean can we see bahrain's move as more um you know to prove its support of the Palestinians to the world than an actual a diplomatic breakup I think uh Bahrain is a in a more precarious situation that is because uh in Bahrain there is a delicate uh Power Balance domestic one between the Shia and the sunnis uh populations uh I think we've seen uh that the bahini leadership is aware of the rising public anger we have seen the lower uh champer in the parliament in the beginning of the war announcing cutting off diplomatic relations with Israel which has been walked back later and proved not to be true but uh the bahrainis have been uh adopting a low profile uh position towards the Gaza War deliberately and not taking the front seat and focusing on not letting the war causing a widespread discontent in the street and also not letting Iran which has great influence from a Bahraini perspective on the Shia population use the war in its own benefits I did want to mention Saudi Arabia obviously very significant here Riyad has refused to condemn the Hamas um attacks on October the 7th apparently though it's helped Israel by intercepting a missile from Yemen again there seems to be this difference between what's being done publicly and what's going on behind the scenes I think uh we have to understand first what Saudi Arabia wants Saudi Arabia wants to see a permanent ceasefire it wants to see the humanitarian Aid going into Gaza unimpeded and the longer term it wants to see a peace uh resolution uh for this conflict on uh two-state solution basis uh at the same time it wants to use the war to bolster its own Regional leadership and we have seen Saudi Arabia using its uh convening Power in both the Arab and Islamic world now Saudi Arabia has been balance has been adopting a balancing act that is appeasing the rising public anger in Saudi Arabia which is very obvious on social media but at the same time it it it it wanted to adopt a watered down language to preserve its long-term interests whether that is with with Israel or the United States so we have seen on on on one hand the Saudi leadership very aggressive towards Israel even to the to the extent of demanding a weapon embargo um imposed on Israel but at the same time sticking to the status quo language of two-state solution based on the Arab peace initiative which has been seen in some quarters as as not compatible to the exceptional moment the Middle East is going through and interestingly recently we have seen the Saudi official media upping the ATI and being very aggressive in criticizing Hamas and accusing it of causing the agony and pain that the Palestinians in Gaz are going through now so to conclude I think the normalization for Saudi Arabia is still on the table and I think in the long term um it has not been scrapped altogether we are almost out of time but I do do want to ask you in general what would you say the Arab and Gulf States see right now as a best possible outcome in this war in the longer term I mean is is a two-state Sol solution still on the table I think first of all the Arab countries do not want to to see the Palestinians in Gaza being forcibly displaced into the Sinai Peninsula I think um they don't want to see any change in the boundaries of Gaza STP whether that is to create a buffer zone as Benjamin nany has been uh demanding um uh in the longer term I see the Arab uh countries are playing some role in reconstructing and financing the Reconstruction of Gaza but I do not see them wanting to play a central role in maintaining Security in Gaza or running governance after the war in the long term I think they do want to see a two-state solution based on the Arab uh peace initiative or any kind of solution that the Israelis and Palestinians would agree on to be able to live peacefully side by side in the future Ahmed Abu from the international Affairs Think Tank chattam house thank you so much for your time and for your insights today thank you for having me Let's cross over to our special correspondent a Ibrahim in Jerusalem a Israel says that inspections will be stepped up at the Karam Shalom Crossings uh starting today that's supposed to allow humanitarian supplies uh into the into Gaza faster what kind of impact is that likely to have so they won't be stepped up they'll actually be restarted the Kim Shalom Crossing which was actually prior to the war responsible for about 60% of all um Goods coming in and out of the Gaza Strip has been closed completely since October 7th and so far for a to go through the RAF Crossing uh uh between Gaza and Egypt it it has to still be in inspected by Israel because uh even though Israel maintains it does uh not occupy the Gaza Strip and that it has withdrawn since 2005 it still maintains according to the UN effective security control so nothing can go in the strip without Israel's permission and so the Kim Shalom Crossing will be open for inspection as an additional spot to inspect goods and be approved by Israel before they can then be routed to go in uh through Egypt the impact um it will certainly you know alleviate the bottleneck that has um that is an aid groups say has is now happening at nitsana but at the same time we're again talking just about inspection Israel still maintains that no Aid will be coming directly from Israel into Gaza and of course there are the logistical challenges of Distributing that Aid effectively uh having it be secure within the Gaza Strip again cannot be emphasized enough one of the most densely populated spots on Earth for that's under bombing from Air since two months more than two months and with an ongoing ground operation 90% of the Gaza strip's population has been displaced virtually everybody there is in desperate need of humanitarian Aid so the challenges still uh you know will still continue but at least there is that Hope on the horizon with the inspection bottleneck you know hopefully being slightly alleviated in the coming days a how has this war in Gaza affected Israel's relationship with its Arab neighbors well let's start with its uh you know its most immediate neighbors the closest geographically if you will you have Egypt and you have uh a Jordan who have from the beginning been very vocal calling uh for an end to uh the uh hostilities and even though these are you know the two as the report points out the two countries with uh the oldest peace treaties with with Israel um any kind of talk of the mass displacement of Palestinians is highly alarming to the governments of both of these countries and so there's a real sense by both Egypt and Jordan that there's an attempt by Israeli officials to displace the people of Gaza and that they would be the ones that would have to shoulder the burden of that population and so the the governments of these two countries even though strategic partners of Israel on a security level and certainly in to some extent on an economic level have been very wary of this possibility and have pushed back explicitly um against it then of course there the gulf countries which are sort of newer uh to the peace treaty uh uh to you know have their peace treaties have come more recently in the past couple of years or so and they as with Qatar have been trying Qatar does not have a peace treaty but it is you know a gulf country the gulf countries have been trying to play a mediating role to try and bring in end uh to this conflict so even though the Arab world is very diverse different countries with different uh goals there has been an attempt to at least tow uh to find to strike a balance between their strategic interests um and of course the response that they're getting from their populations and there again a very diverse uh region different religions different ethnicities but I would say if there's one issue that is universally emo across the Arab region it's the Palestinian question it's seen as a moral issue it's seen as an issue of justice and to a certain extent also um you know an issue of religious oppression of course because Muslims you know want Palestinians to have access to their holy sites here in Jerusalem as well which have been under restriction by Israeli authorities over the past years and there we've seen boycotts attempts to boycott companies uh sorry efforts to rather efforts to boycott companies that have that are believed to you know um be connected to Israel or sponsor its government in any way anger that that the region has I would say not seen in decades on the Palestinian question which has been to a large extent sort of Forgotten and sort of disappeared into the background giving the turmoil in the region but is now back center stage and is politicizing a whole new generation of people in the region getting them interested again in that question and I think not doing Israel any favors to win hearts and Minds in the region something that the isra Israeli government has long wanted he thank you very much that was our special correspondent a Ibrahim in
