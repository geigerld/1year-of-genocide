Germany's chancellor Olaf Schultz has urged Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas to clearly condemn the Hamas attacks on Israel calling his silence so far shameful in a speech to the German Parliament Schultz also pledged his support for Israel saying Germany's only place right now is at Israel's side he said Israel must have the capacity to defend itself adding that the terrorist group Hamas offers only poverty and misery for the Palestinian people in Gaza Schultz also said that Germany will issue a formal banon activity by or in support of Hamas we condemn the violence of the terrorists and we say very clearly Israel has the right under international law to defend its citizens against such acts of barbarism at the moment there is only one place for Germany the place side by side with Israel this is what we mean when we say the security of Israel is Germany's rra and I'm now joined by our chief political editor Michelle kufner who is at the German Parliament uh today michella overall I mean that we just listened to one aspect uh or one soundbite there from from the chancell but overall that was a very strongly worded speech from the German Chancellor some very strong rhetoric coming out of him today here in Berlin yes and it was um Olaf Schultz spelling out what Germany means when it says it will guarantee for Israel's security this goes back to something former chanc Angela mle said before the Israeli Parliament the knesset in 2008 when she said that Israel's security was reason of State in Germany now in this hour of need Olaf Schultz made clear that that means um backing Israel is with whatever it needs he said he spoke to bamin Netanyahu and um pledged that he would send whatever Israel requests we've learned from the German defense minister that that means ammunition for warships at this moment in time but also he announced a flurry of diplomatic activity high level talks he's due to hold today beginning with the emia of Qatar who is and who was scheduled to come to Berlin even before this attack took place with Qatar being seen as a major financier of ham but also a clamp down on pro- Hamas demonstrations here in Germany yeah michellea there was also uh a word there directed at the Palestinian authorities let's have a listen to that stand by and we'll pick up after this next sound bite from the German Chancellor ladies and gentlemen ham the attack of Hamas on Israel also has repercussions in our cooperation with the Palestine where is the clear condemnation of terrorist Violence by the president Mahmud abas and the Palestinian disgrace and all our development cooperation with uh Palestinians will be reexamined and we will see how our projects can support peace in the region and support the security of Israel so Michela we're hearing there from the German Chancellor that Aid to the Palestinians is now under review tell us more yes this is something that Germany said very early on that it will review any assistance given to Palestinians we also saw him um discussed this with French president Emmanuel marcco earlier in the week when they had a bilateral cabinet meeting in the German city of Hamburg but both also said that that would not mean ending all humanitarian assistance there is a huge distinction between development assistance and humanitarian assistance uh with uh both sides both saying they are aligned with Israel stand side by side with Israel and Israel will have the final say on which Aid goes in and which doesn't it does so in concrete terms anyway because it controls access to the Gaza Strip on the ground but this is something that is also being debated across Europe what that means in terms of humanitarian assistance but also other assistance towards any Palestinian cause now that the terrorist Wing Hamas launched this vicious attack this inhumane attack on Israel michella the we also heard uh the German Chancellor talk about mediation efforts uh today he he referenced countries Egypt turkey and Qatar let's have a listen to what he had to say on that quickly I have very close contacts with Mr alissi the Egyptian head of state and he also has channels of communication with Gaza I'm going to talk to the Turkish president Mr erdogan I am also going to see representatives of Qatar uh they are very important as mediators and they use this capacity all three of us can play an important role in De escalating the situation and the critics of such contacts and those who say we shouldn't be speaking to the actors let me just tell them it would be absolutely irresponsible in that situation not to use all the channels that we can use we do that very close coordination with Israel and we do it for those people who were abducted by Hamas and on the note of those people who were abducted by Hamas the German Chancellor is due to meet uh with the Amir of Qatar to negotiate the release of hostages in Gaza Michelle you're still with us what more do we know about uh these mediation efforts in that regard well these were scheduled as talks which surely were about investment and energy and have now become diplomatically absolutely key um in terms of what Olaf Schultz said there you can also sense the overarching fear that this could become a much bigger conflict he also warned Hezbollah not to get involved and the biggest concern is of course that Iran is involved in this and that there could be a full-scale escalation of this uh involving Iran that's when it gets very dangerous not just for the region but for the entire world so diplomatic activities at all levels the Americans the Germans the Europeans everyone michella Israel has requested military help as well uh do we know if Germany is going to be sending weapons well we've uh heard from the German defense minister arriving at a NATO meeting uh where he said that ammunition would be supplied to the Israelis for Israeli warships there's also reports that those drones that Germany has um leased from from Israel that some of those would be basically left with Israel for their own defense purposes and we have the pledge from the German Chancellor today that whatever Benyamin Netanyahu requests would also be delivered H so um that is not much of an expectation here in terms of Defense capabilities I've spoken to high level politicians from other parties um who do not expect there to be a very long list uh but Germany mapping it out very clearly that solidarity as the Chan to put it won't end with words all right that is DW's Chief political editor Michelle kufner here in Berlin uh of course breaking down for us that speech uh by the German Chancellor in the bundestag today as ever Michelle appreciate that thank
