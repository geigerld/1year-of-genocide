the Hamas ran Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 12 people have been killed in an Israeli attack the spokesman for the ministry said missil struck the Indonesian Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip heavy fighting was heard at the hospital and tanks have reportedly surrounded the facility this comes after Israel's military carried out another night of operations inside Gaza explosions and flares were seen in the south of the region Israel's Army says it's Miss defense system also shot down a number of rockets coming from Gaza tww special correspondent AIA Ibrahim is covering the story for us in Jerusalem and she told us more about the attack on the Indonesian Hospital well the wh the director of the who has condemned the attack saying that it was an appalling attack and we know that or we are told that uh this was a result of Israeli tank fire and according to uh Gaza Health officials in the Hamas controlled uh strip 12 people died as a result of uh that attack among them patients and uh medical staff Israel uh says that uh terrorists had opened fire uh towards IDF troops operating around uh the hospital and that it's uh Israel then targeted the source of enemy fire but that no sh were fired toward the hospital uh uh itself now there have been in recent days warnings uh by the Israeli military uh to people in southern Gaza to leave from there where they had previously been told to move for safety what's the latest on that it's a it's an unclear situation about what's what people are supposed to do exactly what civilians at this point are to do uh Nicole remember Southern Gaza the southern part of the strip is where the the Israeli military had been telling civilians for weeks to evacuate too supposedly because that would uh you know keep them out of Harm's Way and we're talking about one of the most densely populated uh spots on this Earth and asking its population to then squeeze and about half of of that space had already drawn condemnation a huge concern for humanitarian organizations and now over the past couple of days we've heard reports that there are Flyers being dropped on the southern part of the strip asking people to evacuate unclear where they're supposed to uh uh go to exactly as people have already as I mentioned been asked to evacuate South at the same time up until today um the um arabic speaking spokes person for the Israeli Defense Forces been tweeting urging people to evacuate from the north to the South into a safe Zone that appears to be in the southern western parts part of of the strip but it's difficult to imagine how much more people could really squeeze into a smaller uh part uh piece of land with already a a dire humanitarian situation uh that we've you know been that organizations humanitarian organizations have been warning about virtually non-stop for the past month or so US President Joe Biden says he believes the deal with Hamas regarding the hostages is closed do we know any details on what this deal could look like well a deal like that it's not done until it's done we've heard from katari officials um who have been the main negotiators the main mediators in this deal that uh what remains are logistical challenges but remember even with a deal like this even logistical challenges can be uh uh very controversial and take time uh to uh to implement we've been here before it feels like there were a number of deals that felt like they were going to come through but then in the end fell apart but what we are told according to reports again no confirmation that this deal would involve the returning of some 50 Israeli hostages me uh children uh mothers and the elderly and in exchange uh there would be some sort of uh pause of fire for a couple of days unclear just how many this would of course come at as as a huge relief to the families of the hostages who have just been in absolute anguish and Agony since the 7eventh of uh of October but again these are all still reports no confirmation yet and with a deal like this it's done only when it's when it's done and these people are safely back home that was DW's AI Ibraham in Jerusalem thanks for that update as we heard US President Biden says he believes a deal is close to free some of the hostages held in Gaza and temporarily paus the finding to enable Aid deliveries here's what we know about the hostages held by Hamas bring them home that's the message these protesters in Tel Aviv want their government to hear their mothers fathers siblings cousins held by Hamas for well over a month now I expect them to bring them back that's the only goal Nothing Else Matters not politics not wiping out her mass or not none of that matters there were over 200 civilian hostages here they didn't do anything they didn't take part in the war they were taken from their homes heras took about 240 hostages during its deadly crossb border Rampage into Israel on October 7th ranging from 9 months old to people in their 80s dozens were migrant workers from Thailand while many more were Israelis with dual citizenship Russians Germans French argentinians Americans and many more that's created enormous pressure internationally to get a deal done to release them one of the few people to be released so far 85y old Yak liit she described being held in tunnels and large Halls under Gaza others may be held in hospitals or other facilities same H this video released by the Israeli Army allegedly shows one hostage being brought inside a Gaza hospital by Hamas gunman Israel's government says it's doing everything it can we are prevented from discussing details of the prisoner deal that we are pushing for we want them all back whether we do it in one stage or two we will do it in a way that will return entire families that's as clear as the sun Qatar has been the center of negotiations the country has close relations to Hamas meanwhile the US Germany and other countries have set up meetings around the world to keep up pressure on negotiators it's unclear what hamas's demands are Beyond a ceasefire something Israel has until now refused meanwhile a group of premature babies evacuated from gaza's besieged alifa hospital has arrived in Egypt for urgent medical care Medics brought the babies into Egypt bya the Rafa border crossing the only way out of Gaza that Israel doesn't control an urgent evacuation premature babies bundled into ambulances to get them out of Gaza the World Health Organization says all of them are fighting serious infections the babies had been trapped at gaza's largest hospital for days several others died after incubators at alifa stopped working amid power outages United Nations teams helped coordinate the evacuation working with Israeli soldiers to get the tiny patients out of the hospital which Israel claims is home to a Hamas Command Center the babies were brought South some reunited with their mothers I have twin daughters I did not know about their condition today I saw them for the first time since I gave birth to them thank God I was reassured that they were fine I was always communicating with shifa and they told me you can come and take them because their health has improved but I could not reach them waiting ambulance es then whisked them across the rougher Crossing to Egypt taking parents where possible they are innocent children premature babies toddlers I left my three children in Gaza I didn't even get a chance to hug them because I couldn't leave my daughter in this state something might happen to them they could be bombed my message to the world is enough these are innocent children we are just protecting our country our country Palestine the children's agency UNICEF says it's working with Egyptian authorities to find out the circumstances of each evacuated baby including those whose relatives are not with them doctors say they have a long road to recovery ahead with many of them critically ill Ahmed al- mandari is the regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean at the World Health Organization the agency that led this join un mission to evacuate the premature babies from the alifa hospital and I asked him how and where the babies are now those 28 babies in fact shifted to Cairo today morning um 12 of them have been shifted to a hospital in the new capital uh administrative capital in Cairo and 16 of them remain there in hospitals in Alish um so as you said in your report the status of those 28 pap is really very critical very bad MH but not all of the babies that were brought out of shifa Hospital could be moved across the border could they why is that um we moved 31 babies and as you you know mentioned 28 of them moved to Cairo three of to Egypt three of them remained there uh based on the information I received you know recently that their parents their mothers decided to keep them there in the hospitals in RAF so that's why you know we have only 28 babies how difficult was the coordination of this evacuation with you know heavy fighting especially in and around Gaza City right now yeah I must say it was very risky very critical Mission but we decided you know in collaboration with the Palestinian red Cent and other authorities to move forward and bring them from a shifa hospital this is based on the visit our teams made two days back to a shifa hospital and they have seen the critical situation there in the hospital as a whole but definitely for those 31 babies you know in in that hospital lacking the basic health care facilities uh you know risking their lives to to death you know in in in ours if we didn't move them uh you mentioned the the baby's parents were they able to leave with them for Egypt or are they stuck back in Gaza yeah we managed to get four mothers you know joining their babies recently but for the others the Ministry of Health there and the red Cresent Palestinian red Cresent is working hard you know to identify or to approach uh the parents and the mothers of the rest of the babies and I'm sure soon they will be able to join them looking more broadly at the situation inside Gaza and the attack on gaza's Indonesian hospital that we heard of today that is the last one still operating in the north of the strip what are you hearing from your colleagues on the ground uh the teams you know our teams in of of wh are we I just in fact finished a meeting one hour back with with our teams there and they said the hospital is considered as one of the largest hospitals in the north of H which hosts around which serves around 300,000 uh people in that area including 16,000 in gabalia Camp uh it contains currently you know around 700 people including the staff the patients the relatives as well as the displaced one you know using it as a shelter uh it is almost nonfunctioning either due to the direct attack of the hospital and due to the lack of fuel lack of medical supplies so the situation there is really very bad and we are worried we are very worried about those people who are sick admitted in the hospital are your colleagues aware of any Hamas activities in that facility I mean according to the information we are receiving you know from the teams there on the ground and inside the hospital they do not see any sort of military operations by by Hamas you know in that hospital it is full of patients uh staff relatives of the patients and displaced people there are still many sick and injured people inside Gaza close to the Rafa boarding es border especially with Egypt and the who has repeatedly warned about the growing threat of disease spreading there what can you tell us about the efforts that are underway to try and help or evacuate people and help them to leave yeah as I said you know we are coordinating with the Egyptian authorities the ministry of Filth and population here in Egypt as well as the Egyptian red Cent uh as well as coordinating with the Palestinian authorities and the Palestinian red Cresent and other agencies to move those injured patients and they need you know Extra Care and extra services in the Egyptian side and I'm really sorry to say that you know like for example in the shifa hospital there are patients who are injured uh some of them had spinal injuries uh many of them started to have infections in the wounds and doctors cannot operate on those with spinal injuries and and you know because of the lack of the services and the lack of water and and electricity the lack of the medical supplies including um anesthesia and sedating medications so this is exactly happening in in other hospitals in that was Ahmed al- mandari from the World Health Organization in Cairo thanks so much for those insights and for your
