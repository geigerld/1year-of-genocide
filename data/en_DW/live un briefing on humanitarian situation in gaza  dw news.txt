you for joining us today excellencies and distinguished guests welcome to the briefing on the fast changing and deteriorating humanitarian situation in occupied Palestinian territory I'm Lisa Dalton the ocha's director of humanitarian finance and resource mobilization and I'm honored to moderate this meeting today I'd like to remind everyone that today's event is being live streamed on webtv.un.org and has English and Arabic interpretation services in the room online today's distinguished speakers include Mr Martin Griffith the under Secretary General for humanitarian Affairs and emergency relief coordinator who is seated here on the podium and virtually joining us are miss Lynn Hastings the deputy special coordinator for the Middle East peace process and United Nations resident and humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory and Mr Thomas White director of the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestine refugees in the near East affairs in Gaza I'm also joined at the podium by Miss Greta gunas doter director of unra Representative office in New York and Mr Haled Amad chief of ocha's external relations before I hand the floor to Mr griffi I'd like to quote the secretary General's recent statement to the security Council the situation in the Middle East is growing more dire by the hour the war in Gaza is raised is Raging and risk spiraling throughout the region divisions are splintering societies tensions threaten to boil over at a crucial Moment Like This it is vital to be clear on principles starting with the fundamental principle of respecting and protecting civilians so now I'd like to please invite you to have a moment of silence and honor of all of the civilians health and Aid workers including more than 70 unrest staff who have lost their lives and for the hostages still in thank you now invite Mr Martin Griffith under Secretary General for humanitarian to deliver his remarks thanks very much Lisa so thanks for doing this and thank you everybody for for being here on this extraordinarily important issue um I've had the privilege if that's the right word of visiting the region twice in the last eight or nine days and even in a life professional life filled with um scenes of misery and tragedy and hopelessness this particular one I think takes all of us very seriously a back it is quite devastating what we've seen unfold over the last 26 days in Israel and in the occupied territories is nothing short of what I think I would call a blight on our Collective conscience all of us we're all somehow involved in this on the 7th of October and I have had the again privilege of seeing some of the uh recordings of these events Hamas launched an attack claimed the lives of more than 1,400 people in Israel and injured thousands this death doll is more than three times the cumulative number of Israelis killed since OT began recording casualties in 2005 and it was a shocking shocking site 240 hostages remain held somewhere hidden following this attack I would like you to listen to a recording we made of a a conversation I had with um the families the conversations with some of the hostage families can we listen to that on no too difficult no let me carry on I I had the opportunity let me just describe it a little bit in my own words although of course their words are so much more powerful we had the opportunity in Jerusalem to meet the representatives very very young young teenagers people in their early 20s about three or four or five families uh many of whom had still lost many of their relatives and they pointed at me and they said you are also responsible to do something about this to try to find those people we have lost to try to find if those people that we've lost are still alive and to try to find ways of bringing them back you are also responsible and I sat there thinking whether this is the time for me to describe the a mandate or not ludicrously of course I didn't um and we talked about the work of courageous organizations like icrc and msf and others who are doing their best but the truth is these people are still lost and the truth is that we hear news each day of more of them dying or being killed so for those families who I met those young people who I met um each day is a day of terrible anxiety uncertainty a day where the future might stop this is they're right this is a humanitarian issue of the highest importance finding these people and getting them home in 26 days also close to 9,000 Palestinians have been killed in the hostilities in Gaza and God knows how many more there are uncounted under the rubble as we all know from other places that the numbers the real numbers of those dead only emerge much later when the buildings are cleared the rubble is taken away and the bodies of those who have perished become revealed this total of 9,000 is a four times as many deaths as during the 50-day conflict in 2014 where just over 2,200 Palestinians were killed 9,000 Palestinians dead from that early day of October 7th I don't know if we can hear the recording or not of by my discussions with no we can't sorry nobody hearing me should I start again don't worry I spoke to some of the families in Gaza I couldn't get in and out of Gaza um and what you would have heard uh was the story of two families one family um the father of which was a lawyer like me about my age probably very old and his house had been destroyed one midnight and in his house lived the extended family as is quite common in Gaza and as he said he spent that next day or two doing two things trying desperately to find somewhere to live and thank God for anra thank God for anra as we will hear more and from Tom who is there daily bravely working they found some Refuge some safety in a school of un where they could stay the night where they're still living that was the first thing he had to do the second thing he had to do was with his own hands bury 30 members of his family who had been killed that night in the house that now no longer existed and what you would have heard and I'm sure you would have been as affected as I was suddenly an 8-year-old daughter granddaughter presumably suddenly interrupted the call and she said I just don't want to die and end of quote I just don't want to die that's all so we've we have these parallel tragedies and in my world and in my Val Val and I think it is it is true in all our values one death has the value of all deaths and one killing is a tragedy in and of itself and this goes on day by day by day by day and by the end of what of my speech I'm sure the numbers will have changed all for the worst life sustaining connections into Gaza which is what so many of us have been focused on in our negotiations have been all but cut cut off uh a couple of weeks ago there was a full blackout electricity was cut off completely cross Gaza another one I think happened a couple of days ago and we understand that this will happen from time to time 14 out of 35 hospitals within patient capacities those who can take people in aren't not are not functioning as you have heard many of us say unra of course and who and msf in particular the health system is on its knees anra the bul workk the safety net the buffer of of so many people of Gaza for so many years it's practically out of business I pay tribute here as I was going to do later I don't even know the numbers today this morning yesterday it was 72 killed of honorous staff there Brave staff and I had 14,000 National staff in Gaza at the outset said many of them fled but I think 5,000 or so are still working and I don't know how many are dead now we'll hear more probably from Tom one of the terrible things about that those killings are that most of them have happened in the homes of those people and they have been killed with their families I think it's the highest number of un staff lost in a conflict over 60% of the people in Gaza that's 1.4 million people are displaced with nowhere else to go we know they can't get out we know they search for the temporary shelters that unra gives them but are themselves vulnerable to attack um half a million half a million children women and Men crowded into these overcrowded shelters and we've all seen them on our screens we've seen the desolation of a Gaza which reminds me of the early early years of the Syrian War where we saw towns like holes raised to the ground the desolation of those buildings all of which been something to each one of those people who have fled there are intense humanitarian negotiations day and night I've had the Good Fortune to not attender to to to observe this between Israeli authorities Egyptians the United States Thank you Lisa um and the United Nations and I'm grateful to all of those governments and parties and entities for the time put in to those negotiations because those neg negotiations are detailed often produce unexpected results sometimes don't produce results and as of yesterday a total of 329 trucks have entered Gaza since the 21st of October when trucks started being allowed to to move in through Rafa yesterday alone from these negotiations over 100 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies entered Gaza the largest Convoy in this terrible picture this may sound a lot sounds a lot to me when I first heard it but prior to this particular round of fighting of conflict of suffering an average of 500 truckloads needed to enter Gaza every day 500 we're praising where we are happy with a 100 well the people of Gaza are not happy of course with 100 and we've seen how the people of Gaza are taking things into their own hands and who wouldn't under these circumstances so these negotiations detailed and important as they are don't do the business we are not keeping up with the progress towards desolation which is the story of Gaza these days we are not keeping up civil order is random the military operation is continuing people are finding dead bodies where they had thought they weren't have moved to places which are not safe some have managed to get out as we have seen recently but not Garin so we're not keeping up despite the fact that these negotiations continue all hours of the day and night and it is to the credit of those around that table that they do that and they do look at issues like fuel like water like Trucking like access like human rights like International humanitarian law they can't keep up with the needs if I may Lisa if I may summarize our requirements speaking as a representative of the humanitarian community these are simple clear not easy but not unknown firstly respect as ever the first casualty Respect by all parties for international humanitarian law which ICC continually reminds us applies in many different ways in these circumstances that's the backdrop that's not a priority that's an obligation the first all hostages all hostages not just the tragic numbers of children all hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally and indeed is required by International humanitarian law all parties on all sides must protect civilians civilian infrastructure including our humanitarian colleagues and their assets warehouses of which have been have been where the assets have been taken away civilians remain entitled to protection whether they stay or move and they have the right to choose and anyone and anyone who doesn't evacuate mustn't automatically be considered a support the adversary or Target of an attack and it seems benal to say that civilian infrastructure and civilian structures should not be attacked and we say it all the time daily in this building do do we not about so many conflicts around the world Gaza reminds us reminds us why this is so important because it's these infrastructures where people live and die and it's these infrastructures where our colleagues in unra provide temporary shelter and protection number three allow of course essential supplies and humanitarian relief including Fuel and I heard just this morning as I came in that there has been some progress on allowing some more fuel in through these negotiations I hope to see that confirmed during today but thank you if that's the case fuel is essential for the functioning of institutions of hospitals of the distribution of water electricity and we must allow these supplies reliably repetitively and dependably into Gaza and and I think here is my main point as an aid worker these negotiations must continue continue but they are not enough we must have those pauses we must have those pauses if we do not have pauses we will not keep up with the needs of the people of Gaza and the Israelis also caught up in those areas of conflict and then of course Lyn will Lisa will speak to the issue of funding finally Lisa finally from me too long I want to commend I have already commended Andra under the leadership of Philip lazarini of Tom who we will hear from who is their Gaza Chief but we'll also hear from ly Hastings who is our humanitarian coordinator who I commend very highly and who works very hard with our team and the teams of all the agencies Nos and others to try to make a dent in these difficult times thank you thank you very much um I think we have before we turn to Lynn Hastings I think um I thought we had the voices CED it looks like we do not have the voices CED so thank you very much um no okay all right thank you very much so now I'd like to give the floor to miss Lynn Hastings Deputy special coordinator for the Middle East peace process and United Nations res humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory the floor yours thank you Lisa Excellency I can only share us sorry under Secretary General Griff's alarm about this unfolding humanitarian tragedy without a let up in the hostilities in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory the situation will only deteriorate as Martin mentioned 240 hostages remain captive I repeat that they must be released immediately and without condition we welcome all diplomatic efforts to secure their release and demand that in the interim they are treated humanely and be allowed to receive visits from the icrc in Gaza the humanitarian impact has been catastrophic it continues to deepen as Israeli strikes intensifying according to the Ministry of Health and Gaza close to 9,000 people in Gaza have now been killed and more than 22,000 injured more than 2third of those are estimated to be women and children the number of displaced in Gaza stands now at 1.5 million with more than 690,000 Sheltering and lra Facilities and other places people hope are safe including hospitals churches and schools the reality is nowhere is truly safe on the 2nd of November yesterday four unra shelters hosting nearly 20,000 idps were hit and as a result at least 23 people were killed and dozens more injured since the start of hostilities nearly 50 unre facilities have been damaged and as Martin mentioned at least 72 staff killed for the 22nd consecutive day Gaza remains under a full electricity blackout following Israel's halt of the electricity and fuel supply to Gaza meanwhile the backup generators that are essential for so many services including hospitals water desalination plants food production facilities have been relying on the main power are one by one grinding to a halt as fuel supplies run out the health system is overwhelmed with an influx of injuries combined with severe shortages of supplies Personnel electricity and water since the start of the hostilities 40% of hospitals in Gaza that's 14 of 35 which I think Martin mentioned and near nearly 71% of primary health care clinics that's 51 of 72 have shut down only one of three Water Supplies lines from Israel is now operational many people are relying on brackish or sailing groundwater if at all access to food is becoming increasingly a concern people are braving air strikes to line up outside of bakeries to obtain bread a number of which have already been closed down due to lack of fuel cooling chains for perishable Goods have broken down and there's a complete closure of shops and food processing facilities the agreement to use the raff of Crossing from Egypt to get essential humanitarian supplies into Gaza has provided a little relief to people living in these appalling conditions and while we welcome this important development these deliveries which are the result of extensive negotiations cannot cover the significant rise in humanitarian need and most crucially these recent deliveries do not include fuel fuel that is essential as I've said to powering essential services that people need to survive I have to highlight that humanitarian assistance is not enough to sustain a population of 2.2 million people for civilians across Gaza to get access to adequate food water Medical Care and other essential supplies we must be able to scale up deliveries of all these goods and we must be able to replenish fuel supplies to scale we pledge to do our part to ensure these deliveries increase and continue but in no crisis does the humanitarian Community work alone the private sector the NOS they must be protected and it will also be important to over other open other Crossings for for these purposes it is also imperative that the parties respect their obligations under international law and our Collective responsibility to use all our influence to ensure they do so sanity humanity and international law must Prevail humanitarian ceasefires will ease the Epic Su human suffering and make humanitarian access easier and safer next week the human atarian country team will issue the updated flash appeal for the occupied Palestinian territory the cost of meeting the needs of the entire population of Gaza and 500,000 people in the West Bank until the end of the year are estimated to be 1.2 billion our ability to implement even part of this plan depends of course on many things funding our ability to scale up efficient verification mechanisms that take take into account security issues I do want to highlight that this includes the staff many of whom have been displaced themselves and who continue to support the most vulnerable despite unra still facing a very significant phisical deficit which means most of these staff or maybe all of these staff their salaries are still in doubt and this is at a time when we expect unra and their staff to carry almost the entire burden of this crisis on their shoulders thank you thank you very much and thank you for providing us with the situation um on the ground as well as uh the need for financial support uh to support the humanitarian uh assistance so now I'd like to turn to uh Mr Thomas White who's director of uh United Nations relief and work agency for Palestine refugees and near East affairs Gaza the floor is yours thank you very much Lisa uh I'm joining you from the UN Rafa log base uh in Gaza I'm very conscious that you know you meet in New York under the UN flag uh and I'm sure that the flag is uh is flying over the East River there we too have the UN flag here in Gaza there are hundreds of thousands of people who are also Sheltering under the UN flag here but my message is that you know increasingly uh this situation here is pushing us to the brink we don't want to get to the day where the UN flag is not flying in Gaza because really it is the only uh hope for people now uh in Gaza firstly I'd like to pay tribute to my colleagues uh who've lost their lives at last count it was 72 every time I ask for an update I fear in fact I know that that number will grow this is taking an enormous toll uh on so many families uh within the unua uh family but also everybody you speak to whether it be idps uh or people out on the street they all have a story of loss so we very much are part of the community that are grieving but I'd also like to um pay tribute to the unra colleagues but also more broadly you know every Garen who is working as an emergency worker to support their Community they are putting their Community um above their own lives uh they are out there every day in danger providing Services me the majority of the staff in unua uh who are working on a daily basis are actually living as idps themselves having traveled uh the length and breadth of of Gaza in the last few weeks uh it is a scene of death and destruction let's be very clear there is no place that is safe in Gaza right now people fear for their lives people fear for their Futures and now people are fearing that they will not be able to feed their families uh on a day-to-day basis the major challenges we Face are sustaining an aid operation under these circum irst ances operating in a situation where civil order Law and Order is on the brink of collapse and trying to comprehend trying to plan for how we will cope with the potential for another wave of displacement uh into the South I'd like to give you a uh a sense of our our operation right now the first thing I'd like to say is the current operation is a essentially being sustained by stocks that we already had in Gaza prior to the conflict to give you a sense we were already running a food program uh between unua and the world food program that was providing 50 to 60% of the calorific need for 1.5 million people so people were already living on the breadline uh in Gaza and they were supported by the International Community ENT with those stocks we've been able to uh maintain the bread Market in Gaza uh currently we are supporting bakeries about 89 bakeries across Gaza uh aiming to get bread to 1.7 million people we are pushing out about 370 tons of of wheat flour into Gaza the bread anybody buys at a breaker now is essenti uh bread or or or is is made with wheat flour from unua the reality though is that the average Garen is living on one or two pieces of hubz Arabic bread little rounds of bread per day the water situation is of great concern um with the fuel supplies that we've managed to secure from within Gaza uh we are managing to support uh the Coastal Water Authority uh for desalination also to sustain desalination plants that we have in many of the camps and also a lot of the schools that we operate uh but the refrain from from people on the street right now and I we took our commissioner General Philipe lazarini uh into one of the internally displaced centers the other day and everybody was pointing to their mouth and saying my May Maya water water uh so now people are Beyond looking for bread it's looking for water I want to give you a sense of what a shelter looks like now we have you know close to 600,000 people Sheltering in 149 shelters the the reality is we've lost contact with many of the shelters in the north but just to give you a sense of you know the shelters that I'm visiting in the South these are essentially School each school um is designed on any given day to have a thousand students uh attend that school so uh but the reality is now we are we are well over 4,000 or or or an average of 4,000 idps living in those schools we don't have the resources to maintain the sanitation women and children are sleeping in the classroom the men are sleeping uh out in the open the conditions are desperate in these shelters but in many cases they are the lucky ones many people are building makeshift shelters with with whatever material they can find and essentially living in the open the medical situation is dire I've been up to shifa hospital last week the two overwhelming images for me were that every flat uh uh surface would either had somebody who'd been injured or somebody who was Sheltering in the hospital because they thought it was a safe place the other enduring image of of a visit to shifa was standing in the courtyard you could hear the air strikes and see the air strikes coming into the suburbs around shifa hospital and literally on the clock within 10 minutes the ambulan has started coming through essentially uh there were uh bought people just lying very badly injured people lying on the on the floor of the ambulances the triage at the back of the ambulance was who's dead who's alive those who were alive with horrific blast injuries burn injuries uh were taken into an already overwhelmed emergency department uh and the people who were dead were then taken l about 25 M away to an open air morg in terms of protection of civilians people are and I come back to this this idea that people are Sheltering under a un flag the reality is we cannot even provide them uh safety under a un flag we've had over 50 of our facilities that have been impacted by the conflict including five direct hits I think at last count 38 people have died uh in our shelters I fear that with the fighting going on in the north right now that is that number is going to grow significantly these are people seeking shelter under a un flag seeking protection uh under International law I'd Echo lind's comments that humanitarian Aid is not the only solution to the problem here we have to focus on ensuring that uh the um the public and the private sector operate to give you a sense the municipal services in Gaza are the ones who are pumping the sewage out of the Cities right now they're not going to treatment plants it's being pumped into the sea but when you speak to Municipal workers the reality is once their fuel runs out that sewage will flow in the streets similarly we need to be working along the pr alongside the private sector and the example I'll provide here is cooking gas cooking gas is becoming increasingly is increasingly in short supply cooking gas was brought in in a back-to-back operation prior to the conflict from Egypt and the distribution was with the private sector eight organizations such as unra are not going to be able to step in and replicate the network of distribution uh by the private sector for this essential item being cooking gas I I won't comment further on the issues of Convoy and fuel I think Martin um and uh Lyn have spoken to that but in refle my own reflection in sort of 20 years of working as a never have I been working with uh a group of humanitarians who are in fact have had such a large loss of life from within their community and in fact are overwhelmingly uh idps and recently recently displaced uh and never have been in a situation where we are effectively starved of the vital humanitarian supplies that we need uh to provide to people the toughest thing is with our staff who are serving in these IDP shelters is they know what they need to deliver for the people but they just don't have it in their hands pardon me finally We need regular and sustained uh humanitarian supplies and access alongside the public and private sector and finally and this is a call from the people here they need a ceasefire they want a ceasefire now thank you thank you so much for that point in and very Stark firsthand account before I open the floor uh to the list of speakers I'd like to quickly turn back to our under Secretary General please yeah thank you I'm looking at a Sumer actually um I was in Egypt um the other day and had the privilege of meeting uh senior Egyptian officials your foreign minister Secretary General has been in touch with President CCE and Egypt has been an extraordinarily helpful partner uh in under very very difficult circumstances as we all know in this in this moment with the threat of being overwhelmed by numbers of people trying to get into Egypt what what I want to say about Egypt also makes me think about other places I don't think Egypt has refused a single visa for people coming in like visitors like that I think that's almost a unique record so Asama thank you for that it's very important number two Egypt h has indeed worked very hard to craft an agreement um with the uh humanitarian leadership that we have on screen here Lynn and Tom and others to have a presence in Elish the airport not far from Rafa and then possibly moving towards Rafa um and I don't underestimate the difficulty of that decision by the Egyptian government um but I don't underestimate the importance of it for our functioning operations so as some thank you for that as well and then thirdly Egypt through its people through its red cresant who had the privilege to meet the head of your Egyptian red cresant along with the Dr Maran Dr Ramy from the Egyptian red cresant Dr Marwan from the Palestinian red cresant obviously heroic figure under these circumstances we met both of them in Cairo the other day and you know one of the good things one of the very few good things about humanitarian crisis is that you discover where you in a place you've never been before people who share your values as they do ours so Asama we thank your government we rely we rely on you of course as a partner you're fully involved in these negotiations and you've always been very very helpful thank you very much thank you and now I'd like to open the floor to interventions and remind you to unmute your mic when it is your turn to speak and also please keep your interventions to two minutes we are well over time at the moment so please do keep your interventions to two minutes and I would like to First offer the floor to representative from Saudi Arabia followed by Qatar and Egypt so the floor is yours representative from Saudi Arabia thank you very much I will be speaking in Arabic at the outset we would like to thank the briefers for their briefings we express our concern regarding the developments in the humanitarian situation in Gaza we condemn in the strongest terms and we reject any targeting of civilians any violations of international humanitarian law including the targeting of infrastructure and civilian objects for an immediate ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities in Gaza and an end to the illegal blockade and we demand providing humanitarian assistance and basic needs to provide electricity once again and to allow for the delivery of fuel medicine and food to the people of Gaza not only are we saddened by the death of civilians there Ang and disappointed because the International Community cannot even assist with medicine and water because the International Community has been unable to put an end to further killing and displacement even those living and seeking shelter within the United Nations we have launched a campaign for the Rel the Palestinian people in two days were able to Saudi the role of the United Nations OFA is vital to guarantee a safe space for humanitarian work including through humanitarian corridors we stress the need to respect International humanitarian law and international human rights law I thank you thank you very much I'd like to now offer the floor to the representative of Qatar thank you so much uh I would like to as well thank under Secretary General Martin griffi for convening this important briefing and I would like to thank uh both Lynn Hasting and uh Thomas White for their detailed and comprehensive breathing about the uh catastrophic situation in the Gaza St let me Begin by stating that qara is extremely concerned about the cast catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and its vast consequences for the civilian population which which is largely comprised of children and women this underlines the need for the full immediate safe unhindered and sustained humanitarian access which is also called for by the general assembly resolution that was adopted during the emergency special session last Last Friday we have called for the immediate provision of essential goods and services to the population including water food medical supplies Fuel and electricity we stressed the imperative um the imperative under International humanitarian law of ensuring that civilians are not deprived of goods and services indispensable to their survival the state of qar of course strongly condemns uh the Israeli attacks targeting innocent civilians and civilan objects tragically thousands of children have been accounted for either killed or missing buried under the rebel qar has consistently called for an immediate ceasefire the escalation of hostility the exercise of Atmos restrain and the protection of civilians to prevent a wider cycle of violence as per of our humanitarian efforts Qatar recently dispatched three planes carrying food and medical supplies to date qatar's assistance has reached a total of 124 tons a Lifeline for the Palestinian people facing these challenges and devastating humanitarian catastrophe we are committed also to support the cor funding of of $18 million for the years 2023 and 2024 and ready to address the emergency calls as well qara de Crescent Society allocated $1 million from its Disaster Response fund for an immediate emergency intervention plans aimed at providing critical needs of medicine medical supplies and ambulance vehicles um I would like to also acknowledge of course that qar remains steadfast in its commitment to to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people and addressing their urgent humanitarian needs we call on the UN Security Council to take up its responsibility to reach an agreement on a security Council resolution that calls for an immediate ceasefire and an immediate ENT of humanitarian assistance and to as well uh uh put an end for the targeting of innocent civilians in the GP and I thank you thank you very much now I'd like to give the floor to the representative from Egypt thank you very much distinguished moderator us Martin Our Heroes on the ground Thomas Lynn and everyone who's operating to save the Palestinian in innocent lives in in the middle of that crazy war that is ongoing you are kind enough to thank Egypt Martin but it is it's a Call of Duty Egyptians were doing what we we should do and what any country hereid present would have done very proud of of fulfilling our duty but it's it's it's high time for me to thank you personally because I knew what you were doing to to to uh uh make difference on the ground and so on to thank the SG himself he has been there in Rafa Crossing for saying and doing what needs to to be done and you're very right Martin it's it's it's it's those difficult moments show The Real uh uh uh uh values that we all share for for the value of a human spirit and and so on for Our Heroes on the ground putting the UN flag up you should be very proud We we totally recognize and respect your great role and I couldn't agree more with you uh uh Martin on the need for an immediate ceasefire humanitarian ceasefire immediate immediate this is what we were saying last Friday when we voted in the in the the ga and and for those who have voted no or whatever you you're listening to the people on the ground look at the tolls and then you would get to to realize for us as Egyptians we're we're we're working on the modalities to facilitate uh the lifting the suffering of the people to allow uh the the uniform flow last night we have had 102 uh uh trucks so so hopefully we'll maintain that R fuel continues to be a problem water as I understand continues to be a problem and of of course we we need everyone to who who had the resources to help mobilizing sufficient resources for unua and for for o and for all the UN agencies operating on the ground uh uh those who had the political weight to to persuade those who who are who negate up till the moment to agree on a ceasefire to to do such thing other than that you see it's it's shameful so we need to keep mobilizing what I would qualif as the global public opinion to to stop the war invest in peace save lives as we are seeing the the the the toll arises in of the victims in in Gaz this is what I wanted to say in brief thank you very much moderator thank you very much and now I'd like to invite the representative from Jordan followed by Canada European union and state of Palestine so the representative from Jordan the floor is yours thank you I'd like to thank uh us Martin Griffith for his uh briefing and also I'd like to thank uh our colleagues from Anan OCH on the ground Miss Hastings and Mr Thomas White this is very sobering indeed what we heard from you on on on on on the situation in in Gaza it's it's truly a a humanitarian disaster that's Bing before our eyes when you see 67% of the Palestinians killed in Gaza are women are and children for 14 Palestinian civilians are killed every hour six Palestinian children killed every hour four Palestinian women killed every hour uh H how H how long do you have to wait until weact as an International Community when you hear the humanitarian act are pleading with you to to allow access in um and we see that it is trickling down you're talking about 329 trucks so far uh entering Gaza and daily it's around 500 trucks before before this uh situation erupted on 7 October U that's outrageous Egypt is trying its best to allow humanitarian Aid in we know how much they the hurdles that Israelis are putting in this and we see here their ministers talking about how it is transactional we allowed allow Aid in as an exchange for what is required from them to to do uh with regard to the hostages and other detained person that's unacceptable this is is a crime under international law this is a huge crime if you don't call them out for what they're doing and let Aid in they will continue to do so that must stop and the UN narrative must continue as such you are Guided by the ass10 resolution this is how it is we have to to stop the war we have to allow humanitarian Aid in we have to stop the transfer of people this is how it is the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate before our eyes before your eyes if you put it in perspective and I hate to make comparisons in this regard all human lives are important Israeli Palestinian Ukrainian how many children killed in the Ukraine war in 20 months 600 how many children kill Palestinian children killed in less than 4 weeks 3,700 is this acceptable how many ukrainians were killed and I'm sorry to to make the this reference or the civilians killed in the Ukraine war 9,600 as of this morning 9,300 Palestinians killed in 20 days civilians this is outrageous and this has to stop thank from Canada thank you very much thank you I want to thank Mr Griffith for his report uh just say a couple of things uh very briefly first of all I certainly appreciate uh Martin that you paid attention to the situation of October the 7th and the disastrous consequence of that for human life uh for human suffering and a suffering that continues because of the ongoing uh holding of the hostages um I think we all have to understand that that that's true and it needs to be stated um secondly I I think all of us support what you've said about the respect for international humanitarian law by all the actors that includes not putting civilians at risk because of where military infrastructure is placed in Gaza that has to be understood as something that needs to be addressed we all as parties have an obligation to protect human life and we all have an obligation to protect civilian infrastructure uh Canada and this has been indicated clearly by my prime minister and by um the minister are strongly in favor of a humanitarian pause and we need to have a humanitarian Corridor in order to get supplies in we have committed already $60 million in additional assistance we have uh we have Goods foods and other things ready to go and we also very much appreciate the assistance that we have received from the government of Egypt uh from the government of Israel and from the government of the United States in the negotiations around Canadian citizens being allowed to to leave uh to leave to leave Gaza um and we appreciate deeply the steps that are being taken to move that through quickly I think it's important that we understand the full dimensions of this crisis I fully believe that every humanitarian crisis has a political cause and this is a classic example of one of those that does this this is not the time or place to engage in a political debate I have no intention of doing so but I think it's very important for all of us to look for the ground where we agree we agree that humanitarian assistance must be increased we agree it must get in as quickly as possible we agree it must be expanded and we agree that there must be a pause in the hostilities in order to allow that to be expanded to the extent that is required and that's ground on which we can agree and we should be moving quickly to push forward in that area thank you very much thank you very much now I'd like to give the floor to the representative from European Union good morning colleagues thank you very much for for the update and and I just want to say that I think we're all horrified over the plight of the civilians that is currently playing out in front of our eyes I think we're horrified for the lack of ability we as professionals have had to prevent this and now we're horrified by the limitations of assisting people in need and I think it also is horrifying from a human being perspective as well I think we all feel powerless in in front of of this situation but therefore all the more admiration for the work that all of you who have briefed us today in your staff and and great respect and condolences to all the Fallen un staff from unra and elsewhere um we have over the last few weeks spoken about our positions on this crisis um including the absolute respect for international humanitarian law the need for all hostages to be released that all civilians need to be protected and civilian infrastructure that essential supplies needs to be allowed in and in scale as you were saying and that all necessary measures are must be taken in order to allow that be that humanitarian corridors paes whatever is needed we've also stepped up our own assistance uh tripling uh humanitarian support to the Palestinians in Gaza um we've consistently supported unra politically financially we ask others to step up as well especially in this very difficult time um and we've provided for air flights Special Air flights to Egypt to allow for the humanitarian assistance to be provided there uh when the situation allows for that to be then um deployed um so my question is really you know just repeating again and again everything we said and you made those points Martin others have made those points the U the general assembly has made those points what else can we do right now as big donors in our case thank you very much thank you very much now I'd like to give the floor to the representative of the State of Palestine Then followed by Sweden Libya and Pakistan the floor to the state of Palestine thank you madam I just want to be very Frank with you I listened to you in previous reporting whether in the security Council or in other groupings here what I heard from you today lacked the intensity and the humanity that you have demonstrated in previous reporting he did not talk about the huge elephant in the room of the crime being committed against the Palestinian people the children the women the wounded depriving them in a huge Collective punishment of no electricity no fuel no medicine no food no water you describe that situation as a catastrophic situation and many of you said that it is border line of crime against humanity and genocide and the reporting today did not ask for the thing that you asked for forcefully Cease Fire Stop The Killing stop murdering the Palestinians in this massive large number the general assembly adopted a resolution calling for these things and then the reporting today is stale you are officers reporting on the work related to uh the humanitarian field I know the brave Rank and file of your organizations are the brave ones who are really acting according to their mandate and their full commitment to protect the Palestinian people to help the Palestinian people to tell the story story of the devastations of demolishing almost 50% of all of the structures in the Gaza Strip This is what you used to tell us in your previous reporting I think you should continue to be consistence in telling the story as it is not to try to customize the narrative for whatever Reasons I'm speaking to you because it is my duty to tr to transmit to each and everyone one of you the massive pain and horror that the Palestinian civilians especially the children who constitute half of the population of the Gaza Strip We Salute Ona and Ocha and all those who are you know working in the field I saw the tears you know and the eyes of Lynn Hastings in the security Council when we were talking about the numbers of the horrors uh related to to the Palestinian people and of course you know I wanted to see lazarini who went to the field and he saw firsthand inside Gaza the horror and the situation there we are entitled to listen to his reporting and to his you know uh recommendations I listened to him very closely when he spoke in the security Council saying that there is a huge catastrophe unfolding in the Gaz STP it has to stop a ceasefire should be the first the first order of the day now it changed from ceasefire to pauses which means Israel continue killing the Palestinians but give us few hours every now and then in order to get food and other stuff but continue the fighting you are the responsible of Defending humanity and human beings and civil and and civilians you should be saying clearly and loudly in line of you know IHL that a ceasefire should take place saving lives should take place an immediate secession of all of these hostilities should take place this is what I expect from you because you are the responsible individuals and organizations for protecting life when War takes place the first thing that is is needed ceasefire in order to save human beings not to continue the war and to allow for few hours every now and then to allow truckloads of assistance to take place and let me conclude I think the gentleman from honorat when he says that ceasefire that the Palestinian people are asking for are you the officers of the humanitarian field you're not asking for ceasefire only the Palestinian the victims who are being killed and their uh children under the rebels uh are the ones only asking for ceasefire I thought that Mr lazarini and even Mr Griffith himself in the security Council the other day they said the first thing that we need is a ceasefire I am you know sorry for you know being extremely Frank with you because the situation situation of the Palestinian people in Gaza is beyond comprehension and Beyond you know uh uh description and it requires from all of us to do everything that we can to stop it and to stop it yesterday not even today thank you thank thank you thank o and Martin griffi for convening this meeting uh but also uh the other briefers uh not only for your very sobering messages and for bringing us uh from this conference room to the horrendous uh humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza uh but also for everything that you're doing you and your staff uh on the ground uh under very difficult circumstances Sweden is Gravely concerned about the the deteriorating humanitarian situation Gaza we support efforts for Rapid Safe unhindered and sustained humanitarian access and AIDS through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and poses for humanitarian needs Sweden deeply regrets the death of many civilians and the UN Personnel we reiterate our call for full respect of international law and international humanitarian law this year Sweden has already dispersed around 13 million US dollar in humanitarian Aid to Palestine this is on top of our substantial core funding to un agencies active on the ground not least unra who plac a crucial role in extremely difficult conditions Sweden has supported omra with around $40 million us this year we are pleased to see $9 million us doar allocated from the central emergency response fund Sweden has supported surf with around $60 million us this year making us the third largest Doner yesterday Sweden announced $ 13 million us 150 million Swedish kroner in new humanitarian Aid challenge through the wfp P UNICEF unfp and icrc I thank you very Libya and the chair of the Arab group thank you chair thanks Mr Griffith for your briefing and colleagues uh from Ona first of all our condolences uh for the L of lives uh of the UN staff and yes Mr Griffith this number is actually the highest to in a conflict but why is it happening that's question by the time we finish this meeting we know that dozens of other lives will be lost and I want to also remind everyone this is not only happening in Gaza let's not forget what's happening in the West Bank right now against Palestinians where there's no militant act where unfortunately again our the representative ative of Canada keeps putting it a one-sided story and not putting things into context you cannot justify the killing of 9,000 civilians under the excuse of What's called the right of self-defense that's an occupier an occupier doesn't have that right by killing this number there's no place safe in Gaza that's what you director said now from there no place is safe so the claim of having a North place to be evacuated where the south is safe is not true it's false we all have to recall that the targeting of jabalia refugee camp twice is an Evidence of this kind of atrocity that it cannot be silenced anymore therefore I'm questioning where are those human rights Defenders where are those who are preaching us all the time about women's rights children armed conflict where are you where are the special envoys on those matters why are they silent history will not forgive so speak up again Mr Griffith you should not be using the word humanitarian pause in your statements this is not acceptable this is not a movie where we'll be watching and holding a play button then pause and play again these are lives the UN should call for ceasefire not for pauses dehumanizing Palestinian is not acceptable this is not acceptable all lives matter this is a conflict where everybody in the world now is looking into it and seeing the hypocrisy and double standards all life matters depriving more than 2 million citizens civilians from food water fuel is a war crime we have to say that that is a war crime if it's not then what is we as an Arab group have took the path towards pushing for three main requirements an immediate ceasefire humanitarian Aid to be entered immediately and to stop this forced transfer of people you saw the overwhelming support from the ga in the time of failure of Security Council but still we do count on everyone to wake up and translate that overwhelming support that happened to have something happen on the ground we all acknowledge the hard work of the UN staff on the ground and those who are in the front lines but I think we all hold a responsibility especially those who are unfortunately being silent thank you thank you very much and um given we are running over time I would like to to remind all speakers to please limmit your interventions to two minutes now I'd like to turn to the representative of Pakistan followed by United States United Kingdom and the Netherlands so representative of Pakistan please and thank you Madame moderator we are grateful to uh Martin and uh Miss Hastings Mr Tom white for uh providing a briefing on the factual situation on the ground in the what I would call The Killing Zone of Pakistan has provided humanitarian assistance through Egypt to the gazin and we will continue to do our best to provide medicines doctors whatever is needed to help in ameliorating the plight of the people of Gaza what I would like to do at this time is to underline that if humanitarianism is the primary concern for all of us for the International Community and for the United Nations the actions that we need to take besides the supplies that have to flow the actions we need to take have already been approved by the United Nations General Assembly and what is there for us is to implement that resolution of the general assembly adopted with 121 votes this is the obligation of the Secretary General this is the obligation of all elements of the United Nations to seek an immediate ceasefire to seek a continuation of sustained supplies for the besieged gazans and to prevent a further displacement of the people of Gaza everything else is special pleading when my friend from Canada I don't want to pick on Canada again but I'm afraid having heard him again this morning I must say I am amazed that a humanitarian Canada can once again put forward the kind of arguments he did about the need to release the hostages but not the 9,000 Palestinians or 90,000 Palestinians that have been arbitrarily arrested and kept in Israeli prisons talk about that too he talks about calling for a humanitarian truth well the general assembly has called for a humanitarian truth leading to the cessation of hostilities that is Our obligation to do today anyone calling for a humanitarian pause to allow the Israelis to stop for five minutes and then bomb them bomb the Palestinians again I think this is contrary to International humanitarian law to the obligations of international humanitarian law a violation of the obligations that they have undertaken as parties to the to all the international humanitarian conventions a violation by taking that position and also by taking the position that if military targets are placed or suspected to be somewhere that it is all right for the Israelis to bomb them if there was a Target Target in the AI Hospital would it be just for the Israelis to bomb the hospital where does international law justify this International humanitarian law is categorical you cannot Target civilian sites and civilian facilities especially not hospitals even if there was a t a military Target that which is not proven how did the Israelis have the Israelis ever proved that any of the schools that they have bombed any of the hospitals that they have destroyed any of the refugee camps which they have bombarded has has Israel proved that there was a military Target remotely there they are doing this as collective punishment this is unfortunately a people who suffered the Holocaust A people who who suffered the genocide committing the modern genocide and we must call it for what it is let's not mece our words let us as International as the International Community adhere to what the general assembly has said let us adhere to what the international humanitarian law says this is Our obligation we cannot mince our words we have to tell these Israelis stop the genocide this is what we expect from the Secretary General this is what we expect from you Martin this is what we expect from all those who are leading the United Nations all those who are speaking for the conscience of the International Community thank give the floor to representative of the United States Martin for your leadership and many thanks to Lynn and Tom for being with us this morning and for the critical work that they're doing to the unra colleagues we join you in mourning the loss of members of your team we're moved by the dedication of unra and other humanitarian staff who even in the face of their own displacement and danger continue to serve others there is simply no replacement for the critical role of the UN particularly of unra the United States has been clear that the lives of all civilians including un personnel and humanitarian workers must be protected we've also been clear in our unequivocal condemnation of the attacks by Hamas terrorists Hamas has shown absolutely no respect for human life Hamas has killed more than 1,400 people in Israel uses Palestinian civilians as human Shields and continues to hold hostages President Biden and Secretary of State blinkin have underscored publicly and privately that as Israel exercises its right to defend itself it must do so in line with International law secretary blinkin recently said the lives of Palestinian civilians must be protected this means the flow of food water medicine Fuel and other essential humanitarian Aid into Gaza must increase immediately and significantly it means Palestinian civilians must be able to stay out of Harm's Way it means every possible precaution ction must be taken to safeguard humanitarian sites and it means humanitarian pauses must be considered for these purposes these words are backed by actions as we speak secretary blinkin is again in the region his second trip in 3 weeks he is pursuing these objectives including humanitarian pauses to allow Aid to reach Gaza and be distributed and to allow safe passage for civilians which will help people access humanitarian assistance or move to safer locations he also will focus on concrete steps to be taken to minimize harm to men women and children since his appointment as US Special Envoy for humanitarian issues Ambassador David saterfield has also worked to facilitate the flow of humanitarian Aid as a result food water and medical supplies begun to move into Gaza but we know that much more is urgently needed we are working with Israel Egypt the UN and others to expand and sustain these efforts the United States has committed an additional $100 million in humanitarian assistance bringing total Aid to the Palestinian people to more than1 billion do in the last two and a half years we call on others to join us urgently in meeting the un's appeal thank Kingdom thank you sorry excuse me thank you very much Lisa and of course to you under Secretary General uh Martin Griffiths and I want to start um by expressing our deep appreciation to you Martin for your tireless efforts in recent weeks and of course to the work of the UN and all humanitarian partners for their life-saving efforts in such incredibly challenging circumstances and like others I of course also want to share the UK's condolences to the families and friends of all unal colleagues who have lost their lives and to all Palestinians and Israelis who have lost love loved ones in response to this Ute humanitarian crisis the UK has significantly stepped up our humanitarian efforts our prime minister foreign secretary and un Minister Lord ahed have all visited the region over the last two weeks focused on these efforts and on three key priorities first the UK has been clear that all sides must comply with their obligations under International humanitarian law that means that every possible precaution must be taken to protect civilians wherever they are it also means that all hostage es must be released immediately safely and without conditions second the UK continues to call for immediate unimpeded and safe humanitarian access to Gaza so that life-saving Aid including water fuel medicine and food can reach the civilians who so desperately need it piped water supplies and allowing fuel to enter Gaza are essential to allow hospitals and other critical infrastructure to operate and we urge all parties to allow for humanitarian pauses which would ensure safe Aid delivery and critical repairs to key infrastructure including water and electricity whilst we welcome of course the reopening of Rafa Crossing we are aware that this is not sufficient to meet the soaring needs and so we urge the opening of other border crossings such as Kem Shalom as well as increased access through existing commercial commercial routes such as Port Z to enable more humanitarian Aid to reach civilians in need and finally we have increased our funding to the humanitarian response to support our partners and the people of Gaza we have committed a further $37 million Us in humanitarian assistance since October the 16th doubling the UK's commitment to the occupied Palestinian territories this year thank you very much thank you very much and before I Netherlands I wanted to just let you know that we'll extend this session to 1110 due to the number of interventions that we have but I would again remind you to please keep your interventions to 2 minutes please so we can get through the pre-registered speakers list so now I'd like to give the floor to representative Netherlands and followed by Iceland Cyprus and Ireland thank you thank you Lisa and thanks to um um to the the present to presenters the briefers for their um um for the presentations today Martin Lynn and Thomas and I think once again um we cannot be but be shocked by by what we just heard by shocked by the number of innocent lives lost among them as we've heard often many children and shocked by the suffering of many more people and by the number of of un staff that lost their lives and we pay tribute to the brave un staff and other humanitarian workers that continue to work tirelessly under extremely difficult circumstances I'll just make three points in the interest of time first uh we repeat that International humanitarian law must be respected and agree with the Secretary General that every possible measure must be taken to protect innocent civilians to keep un premises safe and to allow un staff to do their essential life-saving work safely and unhindered but and that's my second point I think the truth is that nobody here in New York can even begin to imagine what the situation in Gaza is we've heard what is needed um you know secure safe and unhindered humanitarian action uh ACCESS food water fuel medicine that needs to be allowed in immediately and we thank those that are working to achieve uh that um and as you said Martin also life sustaining uh connections must continue to operate we've heard um the 329 trucks that have entered so far but we also know that it Pils in comparison to what is uh needed and that is an immediate and massive scale up um of assistance and we need to do all we can to make that possible starting with um humanitarian pauses and corridors as you just said we've also heard of course that funding is urgently needed the Netherlands um has already committed an additional 25 million EUR for Urgent humanitarian um relief 8 million of which is for unra and comes on top of our annual contribution of 19 million euros and we um encourage others to do the same but you know the essential thing is we must urgently break the cycle of violence stop the loss of more lives more suffering and more Futures shattered I thank give the floor to representative Iceland my appreciation goes to the briefers and at the outset let me also commend humanitarian actors for their Relentless efforts to ease the suffering of the civilian population in in Gaza we deeply regret the devastating loss of all civilian life in the current conflict and that of stuff my country deplores the immense suffering inflected on civilians and underlines that civilian civilian objects medical personnel and humanitarian workers and assets must be protected international law including International humanitarian law must be respected at all times we welcome that humanitarian convoys have started entering Gaza and thank the un uh for continued leadership in this regard we also join the call for humanitarian Paws and corridors to facilitate immediate safe and unhindered humanitarian access and the delivery of life- saving assistance throughout Gaza and obviously more Aid is urgently needed and at scale in particular fuel water food and medicine now recognizing the importance of flexible funding in these trying times Iceland has responded to the call for Urgent humanitarian assistance with two additional unmarked core core contributions to onra which is our long-standing humanitarian partners that is a total of $1 million us and earlier uh this year we renewed our multier uh agreement with unra for another 5 years for annual core funding and we remain predictable donor to Old salad country based pool Fund in the op and further uh contributions for humanitarian assistance are currently under consideration by my government Cyprus thank you thank you moderator and thank you under Secretary General for the briefing and for the exceptional for your exceptional efforts and work in dealing with this unfortunate crisis as a country in the region Cyprus is fully aware of the scale and potential repercussions of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza the need to urgently address this alarming situation including by ensuring the continued rabi and safe and unhindered flow of humanitarian Aid cannot be emphasized enough Cyprus is in consultation and cooperation with all immediate State quars and other partners in order to practically facilitate facilitate the provision of humanitarian Aid beyond the first response to address the dire humanitarian needs in the Gaza strep and in this context we have proposed the establishment of a maritime humanitarian corot from Cyprus which would effectively contribute to alleviating the constantly increasing assistance Necessities taking into account the need to secure the sustained regulated robust and high volume flow of humanitarian Aid Cyprus has geographical proximity to Gaza as well as existing capabilities places places Us in an optimal position to establish a reliable and viable humanitarian Mari Maritime Corridor both as a meat and long-term necessity for the day beyond which would serve to decompress the Rafa Crossing which with full consideration of the security aspect we will be engaging directly with the UN on the oper operationalization of this initiative I give the floor to representative of Ireland followed by Australia France and then Malaysia thank you moderator and firstly sincere thanks to AA unra and the deputy special coordinator for your leadership for this briefing and for the life saving work your colleagues are carrying out in Gaza we wish to thank you for your sustained commitment during these most challenging of circumstances as we witness a humanitarian catastrophe unfolding before our eyes we are appalled by the loss of life of men women and children and the suffering that we are now seeing in Gaza our condolences goes to those who have lost their lives over the last month including those who died in the appalling uh Hamas attacks on the 7th of October and it's really important to acknowledge that uh but also all those who have lost their lives in Gaza including unra and other humanitarian staff Ireland resolutely supports the United Nations and the important role the ascential role that is now playing in the occupied Palestinian territory and we call upon Israel to ensure continued access for all un staff as you have said the humanitarian situation in Gaza is now critical uh we have condemned the attacks in the 7th of October we also call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages as Martin has said we also call on Israel to act in full compliance with international law and international humanitarian law these laws we uh apply in all circumstances and apply to all states civilians must be protected Ireland Echo the UN secretary General's called for humanitarian ceasefire to allow essential Aid to reach those in such desperate need now there also needs to be an immediate and significant scaling up of humanitarian supplies into Gaza as well as safe and unimpeded access of humanitarian Personnel to where they are no most needed both both into and within within Gaza itself in response to this humanitarian catastrophe Ireland recently delivered additional funding of 13 million euro 10 million for unra and 3 million for AA and this brings our 2023 support for Palestine to 29 million euro it is nowhere near enough we know that and the really important point is that the aid gets in and in scale now the UN General Assembly has given the agency a mandate we must ensure it has the resources to fulfill it we urge other partners to also Step Up including by ensuring un's core functions are supported now and into the future we need to act now and at scale thank you thank you very much now I'd like to give the floor to

the crimes of Hamas we also call for all as hostages to be released immediately the humanitarian a has started slowly to enter to gaza's STP and we all agree it's not enough and that the priority remains to allow more humanitarian Aid into Gaza it cannot wait any longer humanitary access to the Gaza Strip must be fully open without delay I would like to remind that France has already released 20 million euro of humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza since the beginning of this crisis as well as a humanitarian relief plane and a hospital ship to support gaza's medical infrastructure and we
