for 6 weeks now we've been reporting on the war in Gaza and we can only do that because of our brave colleagues in the field who risk their lives to tell the world the facts about what is happening in one of the most dangerous places on Earth right now and too many of them lose their lives in the process the committee to protect journalists says the Israel Gaza War has seen the deadliest month for reporters since records began three decades ago so far 53 journalists and media workers have been confirmed killed of them 46 were Palestinian four Israeli and three were lebanes another three are reported to be missing other reporters have been injured or arrested at the latest addition to the statistic are reporter Farah Omar and Camera operator rabi al- mamari who were killed Tuesday in southern Lebanon together with one other person their employer the Al Maya Dean tele televion channnel accused Israeli forces of targeting them deliberately because of the Channel's Pro Palestinian reporting the IDF says it's looking into the incident Farah Omar and Robie al-mamari were buried today in Beirut we can now speak to Sharie Mansour he's the Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for the committee to protect journalists good to have you on the show I want to start with a case of Farah Omar and Robbie almaari the two media workers killed in southern Lebanon what can you tell us about the circumstances of their deaths well we can tell you that they were uh already reporting an hour before they were strike and they were head and they were wearing press signs visibly and you can also know that this channel mayadin have been recently banned in Israel under a new legislation emergency legislations that basically allows the government in Israel for the first time to conduct outright censorship under vague and suspicious accusation of harming National morale and non harming National Security there was also very similar case Lebanese journalist for reuter correspondent Asama Abdullah was also killed by a shilling from the Israeli side just 40 days ago a week after the war has started and at least six of his colleagues were also injured in the same uh place we have called on the Israeli Army to conduct quick transparent investigation but also we have supported and continue to support International and independent investigation and as we did we also call for the Israeli Army to review their roles of Engagement and reform them in order to respect press Insignia include safeguards for civilian population including journalists we call for Israeli allies the US government and European government to raise this issues directly and publicly with their Israeli counterparts yeah the Israeli military says it can't ensure the safety of reporters working in the war zone do you agree could they be doing more or are they doing all they can to protect journalism in this environment absolutely they cannot evade responsibilities under international law to exercise uh proportional unwarranted use of force against journalists and against media facilities because if they don't do so it constitutes a possible war crimes um the Israeli government have in the past denied responsibilities have used other tactics to evade responsibility including pushing false narratives to try and justify kill the killings of those journalists we want to make sure that live up to their commitments that they've made in the past and they've also are facing those questions um from within Israel and from their our lives about how to reform those roles of Engagement yeah um you have your eyes and your organization has its eyes on many conflicts around the world what makes the war in Gaza so incredibly dangerous for journalists it is the exponential risk that is uh basically uh burned by local photojournalists Palestinian Freelancers who form uh 90% of those who were killed this time and have had the same percentage 90% of those who were killed covering IDF activities and so over 21 years since 2001 we're Palestinian journalists 18 out of 20 that we counted killed in our report deadly pattern that we released in May and we have seen this deadly pattern continue and become more deadly with this war around and it's because those journalists were forced to flee when there was no Safe Haven and no exit the first few journalists who were killed in Gaza were killed near the southern Crossing in Rafa and near the the northern Crossing in Ares and since then they have been killed everywhere in between including in the house in hanun and Rafa City where they were told is going to be safe we don't have too much time but I do want to zoom out for a second because it's not only in Gaza that the daily lives of journalists have become more dangerous what can you tell us briefly if it's possible about what has been happening to Media workers in the West Bank since October 7th we have seen unprecedented uh uh arrests 18 of them so far of journalists local Palestinian journalists uh put under administrative detention in Military persecutions and some of them released under house arrest under restrictive condition that does not allow them to operate we've seen physical assault censorship even cyber attacks to obstruct the vital role journalist in the West Bank and Israel can play in addition to outright censorship when the Israeli government have uh shut down Palestinian uh outlets in the West Bank and also incited against um El jazer and others who provide critical coverage um from the West Bank and Gaza that was of the committee to protect journalists thanks for your time thank you for having
