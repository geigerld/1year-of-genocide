well the intensification of Israeli operations in Gaza is driving the increasing civilian death toll the territories Hamas run Health Ministry says more than 10,300 people have been killed many of them children scenes like this have become all too common in Gaza over the past month children are bearing the brunt of this conflict Israel says it is targeting Hamas militants High among civilians thousands of Palestinians are trying to get away from the combat in Northern Gaza using whatever means of Transport they can find they're fleeing to what they hope is safety but that is far from guaranteed day after day we are hearing from our colleagues that who even those who have fled that the south is not safe uh we've had colle colleagues lose family members in the South including one of our colleagues Amal whose seven-year-old son khed was killed in an air strike on Rafa a couple of weeks ago uh and and what we're hearing in addition is not just is it not safe in the South but similar to the north people now are struggling to find basic necessities uh food clean water um uh even waiting in line five six hours a day just to get half a portion of bread these two brothers survived a blast at a refugee camp in central Gaza in an area where the Israeli Army had advised people to go for their safety forther South thousands of displaced have been Sheltering at this un School we're still headed towards the unknown no one knows where things are going or how long the war will continue we've left our homes our houses have been destroyed and we are struggling in the streets according to the UN almost 1.5 million people have been displaced across the Gaza Strip since October 7th now the aid agency Care International has been operating in Gaza for decades their Regional director for the Palestinian territories hea TV is based in the West Bank and she told me more about the humanitarian situation in the territory um unfortunately the situation we were since weeks uh raising the flag that it is deteriorating unfortunately we confirm that it's already deteriorated um electricity is still cut no fuel uh according to the testimony from my colleagues there they were waiting for the last drop of fuel or the last bottle of gas we unfortunately arrived to this point where they are unable to find any fuel or gas uh they are trying to use for instance wood to bake uh bread but this is also very risky for them because now access to food is extremely difficult and especially uh bread where they are unable to find bread as as per the announce announcement of the bo food program had who declared and announced that out of the 23 bakeries that they used to support only one is working and functioning now the medical system is still under um under serving people because of the huge demand and requirements from from different areas in the South and of course in the north the situation is harder where um where if there is a already huge lack in the South it's and with the very limited uh humanitarian assistance trucks entering to the South it's there are no trucks entering to the north so according to testimonies from my colleagues families and my family they are trying to find food in different shapes and they could not over the last two days right so a desperation A desperate situation just getting more and more desperate um on fuel um Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says no fuel will be allowed into Gaza and there will be no ceasefire unless the hostages are released can you see any way to meet gaza's humanitarian needs without a ceasefire or even a pause in fighting unfortunately everything is arriving to the end everyone now we used to say that we are afraid of uh of diseases spread due to lack of access to water or access to contaminated water now everyone is also very afraid and and according to the Specialists from the different un agencies they also say now we add to the bombs and the potential waterborne diseases the hunger and thirst and and unfortunately even oppose although anything is welcome even aose would would mean that we will have very limited time and very limited amounts of uh assistance that we can distribute to people ceasefire is the only way uh uh where we can also accompanied with consistent amount of humanitarian assistance entering Gaza so far almost 500 something trucks entered which is since October 21st and now and and according to the estimation it represents almost one day requirements for the people to meet their basic needs and adding to that horrific situation we we have the UN saying the number of Palestinians leaving Northern Gaza and heading south is still increasing so I would imagine that influx of thousands into an already desperate situation can only make things even worse it's so true what you have just said is is is also um something that we all know will happen already the shelters are overcrowded the resources are very limited very shrunk uh everything is is rationed and now with the new uh uh with the new numbers new people coming from the north to the South this is going to exhaust the very very rare and few resources that they have we expect more people to be sleeping outdoor more people using and uh contaminated water more people to be hungry unfortunately this is the situation and and if if this is why we continue asking for ceasefire and and facilitation of access of enough and safe distribution of humanitarian assistance thank you so much for uh joining us and outlining that desperate situation so clearly IBA T from Care
