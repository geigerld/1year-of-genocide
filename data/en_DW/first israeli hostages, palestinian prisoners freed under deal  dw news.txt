the Palestinian militant group Hamas has released the first group of hostages it's been holding since its terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7th the International Red Cross confirmed Hamas released 24 people including 13 Israeli women and children in return Israel has released 39 Palestinians it was holding in jails on the road to Freedom the first group of Israeli hostages released by Hamas militants and entered Egypt via the Rafa border crossing from Gaza after weeks of Anguish they are now in safe hands their first stop a medical facility in Rafa the Convoy then crossed into Israel to undergo further medical checks and finally reunite with loved ones among those freed are mothers and their children as well as elderly women Israel's leader says he's committed to bringing home all abductees we have now completed the return of the first of our hostages children their mothers and other women each and every one of them is a whole world but I stress to you for families and to you citizens of Israel we are committed to the return of all of our hostages this is one of the goals of a war and we are committed to achieving all of the goals of war in the occupied West Bank a group of 39 Palestinian inmates were freed as part of the temporary truce those released include only women and miners in ramala large crowds gathered to welcome them home more Palestinian prisoners and Israeli hostages are set to be released in the coming days DW correspondent Tanya Kramer is in Jerusalem and joins us now hello Tanya it's been an emotional 24 hours hasn't it how is the atmosphere inside Israel well I think it has been a day uh on Friday of mixed feelings because on the one hand there was a lot of joy and relief obviously about the that everything went well that those 13 uh Israeli hostages were released alongside 11 hostages uh uh that were uh Tha Nationals and uh Philippine citizen that were also captured on o October 7 they were also brought uh home so uh but again now the focus is already on uh today because uh there's hope that the same scenario will play out again uh Hamas has uh submitted a list uh according to Israeli media here of another 13 names uh of hostages that will be uh released today probably in the same kind of uh scenario so all eyes are on that already uh at the same time of course there are those families who might not have their relatives on that list uh we know that in the next coming days uh for four days there will be uh all in all 50 hostages that will be released under this agreement but there many more of course of the two over 230 hostages that are being held by Hamas and other militant factions in Gaza that might uh might stay behind so there's a lot of concern what will happen with them especially that Israel has said you know the war will continue after this uh truce now in exchange 39 Palestinians have been released from a prison in the West Bank what can you tell us about them yes late last night also those uh 39 uh Palestinians uh that were jailed in Israeli prisons were released we know it was uh there were 24 women and 15 teenagers uh so under the age of uh 18 also their families had prepared you know that they are uh coming home uh there was also a lot of uh you know celebration there we also understand there were police raids at least in uh in Jerusalem with some of the families there were some restrictions placed on the daytin when they come home that there shouldn't be a big uh celebrations but again there as well you know the same scenario today we're expecting more uh uh prisoners being uh released um under the agreement up to 150 as far as we and we understand should be released so uh we're waiting to see uh whether this will happen today as well overall uh Tanya how would you describe the mood on the ground it's a bit Bittersweet isn't it yeah it is I mean uh on the one hand of course you know we are waiting to see whether this very fragile and shaky choose so far it's holding uh will be holding now whether you know all these uh the the the hostages as planned will be released today and tomorrow every day hearing a dozen hostages should be released in exchange for more uh Palestinian prisoners but of course you have to look also into Gaza um what is happening there you understand more humanitarian Aid is going into Gaza right now and More Trucks uh of humanitarian Aid entered uh on Friday through the Egyptian crossing the rafar crossing but again for people their residents in Gaza it's also very um you know uncertain moment because they know for now the CHS were set for 4 days it might be extended if more hostages are released but then you know the the the war might resume so it's a very uncertain and um situation for people there as well right DW correspondent Tanya Kar in Jerusalem many thanks now US President Joe Biden has welcomed the release of the first group of hostages Biden said he hoped more would be released in the coming days he also said he hoped the C 4 days ceased fire would be extended we also look to the Future as we look to the future we have to end this cycle of violence in the Middle East we need to renew our resolve to pursue this two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can one day live side by side in a two-state solution with equal measure of freedom and dignity two states for two peoples and it's more important now than ever hamash unleash this terrorist attack because they fear nothing more than is Isis and Palestinians living side by side in peace Mike Martin is a former British army officer and Senior fellow in the department of War studies at Kings College London hello Mike thanks for joining us the hostage release and prisoner swap seems to have gone smoothly on day one the truth seems to be holding has it been a successful deal so far I I think it has been a very successful deal um I I think the truth is with these sorts of operations is that each time it iterates so the uh Hamas release people and then the Israelis release people it builds up a very low level of operational trust that these sorts of deals can happen and can work um and so that obviously will build on some of the some of the successes that we've seen but at the same time it's very easy to have an accident or perhaps a spoiler to to break these deals apart and so everything needs to be watched very carefully planned very carefully lots of communication between the sides so it's very early but so far so good I mean a bit on what you just said will any of the sites want to jeopardize the situation right now no I don't think they will but the sides are not homogeneous well the Israeli side is much more homogeneous than than than Hamas but within Hamas it uh may prove to be difficult to control absolutely everybody within Hamas and then there are other actors in the Gaza Strip like the Palestinian Islamic Jihad which is another militant movement and they haven't been included in this deal so they may want to Scupper that deal and of course we've got a situation where thousands of people have been killed and so many of their relatives will be looking to perhaps carry out something that that that is not part of this deal so you know it that this is why these sorts of things are so so difficult not because of the people who made the deal but because of all the other people who live and are involved in the area right now as the ceasefire continues what do you think the Israeli forces in Gaza will be doing right now and what will Hamas be doing so both sides will use this operational paes as a way of restocking so getting their Logistics working moving ammunition water food around in case hostilities resume and also both sides particularly the Israelis will be using uh this chance whilst their opponents are restocking to conduct intelligence so they will be trying to look at where supply routes are where dispositions of enemy forces are and what capabilities they have so whil there's no fighting going on it's a great chance to spy on each other effectively is there any chance you think I mean the US uh President Biden hopes that the truce will go beyond 4 days is there any chance of that happening you think my reading of that is you know in addition to what I just said about how these types of deals tend to build lower levels of trust that then can perhaps be built on but I think there's another thing I think that Israel May well be realizing that it actually cannot achieve what it set out to achieve conducting a massive ground operation like it has been conducting and so this truce actually offers a chance to move into a ceasefire while Saving Face to come back from that original aim of eliminating Hamas to a massive ground operation which is very difficult of course I think what we need to see excuse me is a road to bringing all of the hostages out and if that happens day by day more hostages come out if that happens then I think we're in a position where perhaps a longer term ceasefire could take hold okay Mike Martin in London thank you thank you as we heard earlier 39 Palestinians have been released most of those are women with some teenage boys one of the women released is Mara bakia she spent 8 years in jail for a knife attack on a Israeli border policeman when she was 16 years old she's now been returned to East Jerusalem marav Air's mother holds her tight unable to fight the tears it's been eight years since her daughter was jailed in an Israeli [Laughter] prison Mara is now home but the feeling is bitter sweet I'm happy to be out but at the same time it is very upsetting that the price paid for our release is the blood of the people of Gaza Mara was only 16 when she was jailed on knife and assault charges her mother has been waiting ever since for this day she was shot 14 times she needed me it was very painful not having her here similar joy to that of the bakir family was felt in the occupied West Bank as dozens of released prisoners were reunited with their families Palestinian prisoners were paraded in front of euphoric supporters we're beyond words God willing all the prisoners will be released before their release clouds of white smoke filled the air as Israeli authorities fired tear gas to disperse the crowds according to the Palestinian red crescent several people were wounded a total of 150 Palestinian prisoners are expected to be freed in line with the deal maybe more if the truce is extended journalist ham baloa was in Gaza until recently he joins us now from the Jordanian capital man hello ham tell us more about the reaction in Gaza to the release of the Palestinian prisoners in Gaza it's a different feeling different reaction uh people are happy for those who were released in the West Bank but they are not happy for what they have uh have had experienced uh during the Past Times um when the fighting was going on before the bows um and they are not happy for or what they had or have seen um during the the first day of the those more devastating uh areas there many of them they um um made sure that their houses are grounded and and some people are busy of um um taking out some bues they're still under the rle um in the same time they they some of the people they were supporting this um um this deal and the release of the exchange of of prisoners um but in the same time some some of them they were angry and think this is not worth it there are reports that three people in the West Bank were shot and wounded in clashes with Israeli Security Forces does the truth not apply to the West Bank yes um even in in Gaza there were some reports that the two were killed while they were trying to u to go from South to the north um um the agreement is clear is for Gaza um um the the the the the the ceasefire and the bows will will be implemented only in Gaza Strip and to help the hostilities in Gaza Strip nobody or no one mentioned the West Bank or other places even in in Lebanon it wasn't mentioned there that Lebanon going to be included or other places like like Yemen or whatever who was um or whoever was was involved in this fighting so we are talking about Gaza and Gaza STP this agreement between Hamas and Israel to Hal the the the hostilities and to release or exchange of U of prisoners between Gaza and Israel so as as you say the ceasefire is supposed to still be in effect it's supposed to be in effect for 4 days what can we expect from today onwards well um it's in two levels if we are talking about like the ordinary people they they are looking for more peaceful days more quiet days so they can um uh retreat they can they can um have more relief um um they get more more supplies um more more Aid come into Gaza and they need more trucks to come uh in the same time they the people all all the people that I talk to and I seen that they are looking for extension of these days and they um in fact most of the people they want a full ceasefire that to stop all the war and to go back to their homes right journalist ham Bala in a man thank
