00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
answers that um Hamas might be using
 

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.750 align:start position:0%
answers that um Hamas might be using
this<00:20:13.080><c> time</c><00:20:14.080><c> um</c><00:20:14.360><c> for</c><00:20:14.679><c> IDF</c><00:20:15.360><c> it's</c><00:20:15.679><c> of</c><00:20:15.880><c> course</c>

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
this time um for IDF it's of course
 

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.870 align:start position:0%
this time um for IDF it's of course
