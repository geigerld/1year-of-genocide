Israel has allowed trucks carrying fuel into Gaza as fears grow of spreading starvation and disease in the territory Israel agreed to allow two trucks of fuel per day into Gaza after pressure from the United States and dire warnings from the United Nations about the humanitarian situation in the territory the UN says the fuel deliveries are less than 10% of what's required for basic life preserving measures many civilians in Gaza are struggling to find enough food food and water to survive with fuel desperately needed to power generators at bakeries and water desalination plants I'd like to now welcome Martin Frick German director of the UN world food program uh first of all Martin we in the media have been reporting for weeks now that an already dire situation is getting worse by the day tell us what you're hearing from your un colleagues in Gaza well I can absolutely confirm the humanit Arian situation in Gaza is disastrous we are running out of everything particularly fuel as we have just heard now there was a first shipment of fuel which is a drop in the ocean really because it's less than 10% of what we actually would need a day just for life saving measures the Gaza Strip is home of course to over 2 million people and now it's a war zone thousands have been killed tens of thousands injured what's left of the food distribution infrastructure you can basically say that the local market collapsed everything that can be consumed without being cooked everything canned is basically run out bottled water is not available the water sources that do exist the wells are often contaminated and present a health risk so with the onset of winter on top of that we are really afraid of starvation in Gaza of course we understand that fuel is finally getting through you referenced that earlier but I take it that you don't see this as all good news Well fuel is desperately needed fuel is behind everything it's behind the desalination of seawat which is essential for the water supply it's essential for pumping sewage which is you know vital for hygiene and for um Health Public Health but it's also vital for bakeries for example for Mills we still have about 9,000 tons of wheat in Gaza but we can't use it because you can't Mill it and even if you can Mill it you would need water and energy to bake bread we used to work together with 23 bakeries in gasa not a single one is operational anyone and bread of course is the most basic of all stable Foods you said that the fuel that's going to be getting into Gaza is a drop in the ocean how is it that Aid agencies such as the agency that you're working with can can can can bring more pressure to the Israeli government to get the kind of fuel that is essential for your operations well it's slowly starting we now have an agreement to bring in two trucks a day two trucks of diesel which already helps and it's desperately needed particular for the hospitals and for food supply um we could run for a bit of time as we have strategic reserves but by 15th of November our partner organization unra has basically announced that without fuel they have to stop every bit of humanitarian Aid inside Gaza that is uh Martin Frick uh German director of the UN world food program many many thanks thank you and we can now speak to Marina Miron she is a military Analyst at King's College in London uh Marina in the last few hours hundreds of people have reportedly evacuated gaza's largest hospital the alifa medical complex it's a bit unclear now if the Israeli Army actually ordered an evacuation but why would Israel want people out of there especially when for for some patients moving basically means dying good day Nick well that's a good question but we have to see it from a military perspective and from a military perspective it is an obstruction to the military operation to coming the hospital because there is always a danger that a civilian might be caught in crossfire so in order to increase the speed of the operation we know that the IDF has been coming the buildings of the hospital very slowly also because of the presence of of civilians of patients in the hospital it would make the military operation easier and of course we have heard the report that the hospital doesn't have um any electricity to operate any of its equipment so in the long term it might be more beneficial to evacuate the patients as far as possible in order for them to get proper treatment and increase a chances of survival and just to get to why the Army is there for weeks the Israeli Defense Force have claimed there was an underground Hamas Command Center under Hospitals now that they have taken over this Hospital's grounds how convinced are you by the evidence they've provided well I'm afraid it's not me who has to be convinced um I think Israel has created a lot of expectations on what we might be seeing in alifa hospital and the problem is that the IDF has not come through the entire complex so so right now what is happening is that the evidence that the IDF has presented might not be considered as sufficient in order to justify idf's operation in the hospital because um there is a difficult legal situation here the IDF has to demonstrate indeed that Hamas is using this hospital to conduct their operations and that that said they have to demonstrate clearly that they are command head headquarters of Hamas in this Hospital which would then allow Israel to operate on its territory because otherwise this hospital is protected by the international humanitarian law however the expectation of what we're to see uh what kind of command and control center the Hamas is not a regular army so you are not going to encounter a room full of computers therefore um it is possible that Israel will not be able to come up with sufficient evidence in order to support this claim which will Mak the situation even more difficult for Israel and if we could Marina just shift our Focus to the other part of the conflict the Israeli Army says his troops are targeting areas wherever Hamas exists including in southern Gaza how complicated will it be to limit civilian casualties if much of the gazin population has actually fled South it is very difficult indeed because Hamas would um probably even if they don't use humans um as their Shields they might hide in densely populated areas and then it will come down to the decision of the commanders on the ground whether to Target those areas or not so the idea is does the military Advantage outweighs the potential collateral damage that it's going to create such a strike is going to create and that is a very difficult decision which you have to assess on a Case by case basis but it is to be expected that there will be collateral damage however the question here is not whether there will be collateral damage but how much there will be Marina [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] military Analyst at King's College in London thank you so much for those insights thank you for having
