the European Union foreign policy Chief has accused Israel of funding Hamas Joseph Burell alleged that Israel supported the militant group to weaken the more moderate Palestinian Authority in the past Israel's prime minister has denied similar allegations Hamas is designated a terrorist organization by multiple countries Burell did not offer any kind of proof or expand more on his statements which he made at a university in Spain we believe that a two-state solution imposed from the outside can bring peace and I have to insist that although Israel denies it they themselves have created Hamas and yes Hamas has been financed by the Israeli government to try to weaken the Palestinian Authority but if we don't intervene forcefully the spiral of hatred and violence will continue from generation to generation and from funeral to funeral and the seeds of hatred that are being sown in Gaza today will flourish let's talk more about this with Jack parck our Brussels correspondent he joins us now from there uh Jack what can you tell us about the comments made by uh borell at this Spanish University and do you believe he speaking in his role as EU foreign policy Chief there yeah that's really the big question Gart I mean you can see from his outfit that he's not really dressed in the way we'd ordinarily see him delivering press conferences in a in a suit and tie he was there at the University of Alid doid doid dressed up in this sort of uh you know ceremonial gar to speak to the students and delivered this blistering speech against the Israeli government and specifically against prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu where he accused the prime minister of funding H Hamas indeed of basically trying to derail the two-state solution that the EU favors for the last 30 years now we sort of know that these are Joseph Bell's own personal positions on this issue he's a Spanish socialist who are generally perceived uh that political group in Spain to be more Pro Palestine uh than other political entities in the European Union but when you become the EU foreign policy Chief you take on the role that is the speaking for the European Union and you do that pretty much in whatever context you're speaking in so a lot of these comments that he's made will not be going down very well in Israel and we also know uh that here in Brussels uh we've had word from some of his advisers that actually perhaps some of these uh things that he said were not necessarily lines that were approved in the institutions of the European Union Joseph barell is 79 years old he's a veteran politician and he's probably only got about five months left here in the in the his job in the European Union so he's potentially speaking for himself in this instance but when he speaks for himself because of the position he holds uh has a lot of weight and a lot of attention is put on that as the eu's foreign policy Chief our correspondent Jack perck in Brussels there thank you very much let's go on and speak to Hans yakob Schindler he is the senior director of the counter extremism project and joins us from New York now what do you think of the European Union's foreign policy Chief's allegation that Hamas was created and funded by Israel well I mean first of all I do not think that this is the official position of the EU and I'm think he's going to have a bit of explanation to do because he conflates a couple of things clearly there's been some measure of divide and Rule going on by the Israeli government since Hamas was created because it was seen as an alternative in 1988 to the PLO which at that time still denied the existence of Israel as well so it was essentially seen as a competition of two guys who both wanted to destroy Israel now subsequently in the early 90s the PLO became the PNA after the oso Accords and actually recognized the existence of Israel now what he left out in all of this uh narrative is of course that since Hamas was in exclusive control in Gaza in two after 200 they won the election in 2006 throughout fatak by force and weapons um in in in 2007 Israel has attacked Gaza and Hamas pretty much every single year the last attack on Gaza and Hamas positions before October 7 was in May 2023 so this kind of belies these narratives that Hamas was a convenient Ally for the Israeli government or even for Mr Nano um in order to weaken the PNA there was an element of that but Israel very sustainably has has fought the terroristic aspects of Hamas from the GetGo now if that happened in one way or another how did money destined for the Palestinian militant group Hamas actually get into Gaza well there is the inofficial and then there is the official money so the inofficial money that Hamas collected and got from State supporters uh Iran especially but also to a certain extent uh donations from Qatar um that went in various ways with cash being transported cash floated from ships but also money exchange houses several of which had been designated by the US authorities as well as the Israeli authorities over the years and then there was the official money so any humanitarian Aid money there is no banking relationship between Gaza and NS in the world any official Aid money whether it's from the European Union from Israel or from uh the United States had to go first and foremost to the Israeli banking system was then cashed out by Israeli officials and transported into Gaza so in that aspect Mr Bell is right Israel did hand over money to Gaza to to Hamas in Gaza but it did so on behalf of humanitarian organizations and governments that wanted to help Gaza and according to the OS Law Court Israel is collecting taxes for the Palestinian national authorities and that means tax money that went to Gaza and tax money that went to um the pales National Authority in in the West Bank so again Israel paid the money but it was part of the agreement that it did so now why do you think Burell said this and why now I think there's an increasing frustration with Mr Bell in particular um and your correspondent outlined his political background um with the inability of finding a solution for the day after in Gaza um what we are seeing right now um is that Israel with its military operations is buying itself time the destruction of the physical infrastructure the elimination arrest of Fighters uh the destruction of the arms and Rockets and ammunition Dums is all things that can be retrained replaced if there is no sustainable solution in Gaza and so far there has not really been a serious plan on what happens once the Hamas infrastructure in Gaza is uh eliminated and what happens in the long run with the Palestinians because a sustainable solution for Gaza is unlikely to be enough to prevent another extremist movement whether it's called itself Hamas or any other name from emerging again and Israel in particular the Israeli government has been very very hesitant also for internal government reasons because there are extremely rightwing parties in this government that Mr netan has to blate if he doesn't want his government to collapse to address that issue of what happens afterwards with Gaza and what happens with the Palestinians nevertheless I don't think an two-state solution forced upon both parties from the outside is necessarily the most sustainable solution here anob Shin from the counter extremism project thank you very much for sharing your expertise with
