here in Germany clashes have broken out between police and protesters at an unauthorized demonstration in Berlin at least 174 people were arrested and dozens of police officers were injured now some demonstrators used fireworks set fire to barricades and pelted police with stones and Bottles Pro Palestinian protests were also held in other German cities on Wednesday including Frankfurt where police used water cannons and in nurburg now authorities had banned such protests sparked by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas to prevent any possible anti-semitic incidents DW correspondent Hans brand from our parliamentary Studio told us more about these illegal demonstrations happening in Germany yes indeed we've just seen the pictures of those demonstrations which were banned for fear of incitement in in other words for fear of anti anti-Semitism turning into uh calls for violence for instance against Jews or against Israel um and these Bannings led to those clashes um uh now this is obviously an assessment that the police the authorities have to make there have been similar demonstrations elsewhere in Germany that have been entirely peaceful so it's also possibly a situation that is particular to Berlin where um the situation is particularly heated at the moment tempers are particularly heated at the moment there have also been other anti-semitic incidents such as um uh stars of David being sprayed on certain buildings um and there has even been an attempted attack on a Jewish cultural center with Molotov Cocktails so yes these kinds of things have been increasing maybe one should say that anti-Semitism itself is not illegal in Germany but obviously what's illegal is calling for violence or acting in a violent manner Hans brt speaking to us there now one of modern Germany's founding principles is support for Israel and the protection of Jewish people it's one aspect of atonement for the Nazi era Holocaust or shower as it's also known in which some six million Jews were murdered now the recent rise in anti-semitic incidents has prompted concern among young Jewish people here but they say that they refuse to be intimidated this Berlin synagogue could have been set on fire had the molotov cocktails not fallen short and struck the sidewalk in front of the building Deborah kogan is Vice President of the German Union of Jewish students she knows the targeted Jewish Community well I was shocked of course that a synagogue was attacked but especially this one because it is a very small community and I didn't expect something like that you had the feeling of at least being safe here but as we see now that's not the case kogan's impression is that there is now more police presence in front of Jewish institutions still many Jewish people in Berlin are opting to stay at home when I walk by some Jewish institutions sometimes I only see one police officer and I've often notice that they're looking at their cell phones instead of keeping an eye on what's going on around them even if it's still difficult to lead a normal Jewish life in Germany a life in safety long after the shua 20-year-old Deborah kogan does not want her home to be taken away from her we have had over 1,700 years of Jewish life here and I would say that Jews have always been part of Germany many are now considering whether they still have a future here at all it's sad to have such thoughts after all these years after everything we've been through that you life in Germany should end with this Deborah kogan doesn't want to hide in fact she advocates for dialogue even if that seems unlikely at this point in
