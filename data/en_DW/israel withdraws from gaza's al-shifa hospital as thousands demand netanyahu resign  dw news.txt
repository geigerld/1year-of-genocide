Israel's military has withdrawn its troops from gaza's alifa hospital saying its two-e raid was one of the most successful operations in its war against Hamas in Gaza it says it has killed scores of Hamas Fighters as well as Gathering weapons and intelligence in the operation as part of its response to the terror attack on October 7th last year this is alifa Hospital the largest medical facility in Gaza after a 2 we raid by the Israeli Army it is now a shell of its former self situated in a devastated neighborhood strewn with rubble destruction is far and wide in the shifa compound as you can see and there have been many casualties now we will move the sick and the wounded from alifa to the Baptist Hospital which is the only one in the Gaza Strip still providing services for patients the operation described by Israel as one of the most successful of the nearly six month war is now over and the troops have withdrawn the Israel Defense Forces say around 200 militants were killed during the raid and that it seized over $3 million in cash vital intelligence documents and weapons Hamas and medical staff deny that Palestinian Fighters have any armed presence in hospitals the Israeli Army though says the raid was carried out while preventing harm to civilians patients and medical staff however the World Health organization's director General disputes this claim his post on X formerly Twitter paints a dire picture he says 21 patients died during The Siege and more than 100 were still lacking vital Medical Care and while the troops may now have pulled out of alifa what they've Left Behind is a community [Music] in I'd like to welcome Dr Gan Abu a British Palestinian plastic and reconstructive surgeon who spent more than a month working in Gaza after Israel's Invasion he joins us now from London thank you so much for taking the time today I'd like to start by asking what you are hearing from your colleagues at chifa hospital about the state of the facility after Israel's withdrawal so today we received the harrowing news that our colleague Dr Ahmed madma a young brilliant plastic surgeon who had I had worked with during this war at shifa um his body was found executed by the Israelis in the area around shifa hospital he had chosen to remain in Northern Gaza uh and continued to work in the hospitals that stayed in Northern Gaza um a young brilliant surgeon who had won a fellowship from the Royal College of Surgeons his uh life was ended by Israeli sniping and uh with that news came the news of the end of shifa shifa can no longer be repaired and that's 30% of the Palestinian Health System you're describing a terrible loss there I'm wondering if you could also tell us a little bit about exactly what kind of functionalities remain if any at alifa are they able to provide any kind of uh health care at this time no left at shiffer and not just that it's irreparable now it's irreparable in terms of the ability to fix it it has to be demolished and rebuilt from scratch and that's the devastating thing this is 30% of the Palestinian uh Health System this means that if there was a ceasefire tomorrow we will be years away from rebuilding a replacement for shiffa hospital and that was the aim of this rap to ensure that Gaza remains an uninhabitable place so that the ethnic cleansing continues well after the ceasefire well Israel says its military campaign is in self-defense uh aimed at Hamas and that it does take measures to ensure that it minimizes harm to civilians uh in Gaza and after this particular raid it says it has killed senior Hamas operatives uh and others who' regrouped their after a previous read They're saying approximately 200 militants in the area of the hospital and that they've detained hundreds of other people I'd like to ask based on your experience how plausible you find their claim here so I will I'll be sure to let Dr Ahmed mad's young Widow and his two little children both under the age of five know that the Israeli Army has done its utmost to protect civilian life but more importantly as someone who was in shifa from the very beginning of this military campaign it is not just that the Israelis are part of this genocidal project that narrative the militarization OFA narrative highlights the fact that there is a system of genocide enablers that extends into the Western media that have perpetuated this idea that it was acceptable to attack shifa under all of these pretex I need to jump in and to provide some context here um indeed Israel has been accused of genocide at the international court of justice uh by South Africa this is a case where we're awaiting a verdict and it remains a contested term but I'd love if you can for you to uh paint a picture further of of what this means uh both for the immediate Healthcare needs in Gaza of Palestinians there but also looking ahead in the Years or decades to come in terms of where people might seek medical attention well 30% uh of the health system is now in Ruins uh and so one of the few functioning or partially functioning Health Facilities that existed in Northern Gaza to provide services for the 600,000 Palestinians still in the north has been wiped out and if there were to be a ceasefire it will be years before a hospital of this size can be rebuilt and refurbished making Gaza uninhabitable for the next several years our correspondent Rebecca ritters has more on the aftermath of Israel's two week long raid at the alifa hospital in Gaza the Israeli military have called this a very successful operation they also called it a Precision operation though that may not be the first word that pops to mind when you see the pictures of the hospital now uh the Israel saying that at least 200 terrorists as they call them were killed during this operation that 900 people have been um arrested and interrogated of that 900 500 have been identified to be partnered with Hamas or Islamic Jihad and that the others uh they're still trying to identify as you rightly point out they also say they found weapons and um Intelligence on the site uh and that it was very successful the most successful in the operation so far um they say that they needed to go in because they had evidence intelligence that Hamas and Islamic Jihad were using the hospital as a base that they had regrouped there since the last raid earlier on in the conflict that the Israeli military conducted on the hospital and that they were using it to regroup and resupply uh parts of the northern strip so yeah shears have seen sheer Devastation this is a hospital uh the biggest health facility in Gaza and it's been rendered completely unusable I'd like you to ask you to stay with us because meanwhile in Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under increasing pressure we've seen tens of thousands of people turn out for Mass protests calling for his resignation and also a long Brewing political fight over conscription for Israel's Ultra Orthodox Jewish minority coming to a head that of course in addition to these Street protests let's take a closer look Fed Up and Furious Israelis taking part in the biggest anti-government demonstration since the October 7th terrorist attacks demanding that Benjamin Netanyahu quit and for an immediate deal to get Israeli hostages back it's all people isra will St Minister and move and make some of them want a election now Yahoo has pushed back on the grounds of National Security the calls for elections now during a war right before our Victory would paralyze Israel for at least half a year it would paralyze the negotiation for the release of our hostages it would end the war before its objectives are completed and the first one to benefit from this would be Hamas protests not just over the war and hostages over the weekend military veterans Tangled with ultra orthodox Jewish men over their exemption from army service netanyahu's government faces a Monday deadline to come up with a plan to reform conscription with overwhelming public opinion in favor of forcing the ultra Orthodox to serve Netanyahu relies on Ultra Orthodox parties to keep him in power they've threatened to drop out of his Coalition if young Ultra Orthodox men lose their exemption but if it continues he will likely lose Centrist members either way it spells trouble for the coalition government the turmoil inside his cabinet reflecting the frustration outside where protesters say they'll take to the streets again and again let's get back to Rebecca in Jerusalem Rebecca can you tell us a little bit more about why these protesters want to see Netanyahu step aside well CL as you heard in that report they are predominantly angry with how the Prime Minister and the government have handled the hostage negotiation talks uh since the October 7 uh terrorist attack and and the negotiations that have continuously failed to bring home their loved ones this protest movement or protest group are many is made up of many of the the same groups that were protesting before the war last year we were covering them uh a lot last year these weekly protests against the government and they is basically a Resurgence of the same groups that that are now changing in flavor or F if you will because they're they're even more angry and more devastated even traumatized you could say uh about the situation with the hostages uh many of the family members of the remaining hostages and some of the released hostages of joining in these protests they'll be going for this particular one be going for 4 days here in Jerusalem outside the knesset um you know they're really angry they they blame Netanyahu for many of the things that led up to the October 7 at and say that he simply hasn't done enough in the aftermath Sami sakol is a journalist in Israel and joins us from Jerusalem welcome Sammy why are these protesters angry with the Prime Minister yeah well this is anger that has been building up now for quite a while uh already before the 7th of October uh there was a strong protest movement against Netanyahu and these people people felt that during the time of War it is better that they would sit at home uh rather than H going out to the streets but as the months are passing by and since there is no breakthrough in the war in Gaza it seems like it's a war with no end the hostages have not been released and um there is a strong demand that Netanyahu resigns both for his uh failure on the 7th of October both for his failure to release the hostages and of course because of the corruption H cases that are against them and what has happened most recently is that the families of the hostages they've decided to join this protest and to De demand the resignation of the prime minister so Mr Netanyahu of course is saying I won't go he says that an election now would paralyze the country and help Hamas is he the only member of this fragile Coalition that's saying that he doesn't need to go at this stage yeah well of course the members of the Coalition they want to stay in power they're not interested in any elections since according to all the polls if there would be early elections uh they would find themselves in the opposition today you have 64 members out of the 120 seats in the Israeli Parliament that is support Netanyahu and there hasn't been one poll that showed that this Coalition would be able to succeed in next elections so they all clinging to each other hoping that the election day will not come it's seems like quite a strong argument though doesn't it we're in the middle of a war now is not the the time for an elections what is the protesters response to that yeah well you know uh the protesters they don't have much Faith or trust in Netanyahu uh they think that for him it's just another trick uh to stay in power and they will also tell you that that Israel already had elections uh quite recently Municipal elections during the War uh when the situation was even worse uh when it comes to the front with Gaza so technically it is possible to have elections it has been proven and this is what the majority of the public wants and I wanted to come to that because clearly we have these loud these noisy demonstrations in the streets calling for Netanyahu to to to go but is there wider public support uh for him to go or they are they just a loud minority well surprisingly enough the Israeli public even those who identify themselves with a Centrist or even white right-wing positions they're not backing Netanyahu uh they think that Netanyahu fa on the 7th of October they want to see a different leadership and the majority of the public today in Israel wants early elections they want H to change the politicians they want to see a a change so if that change happened what would happen to Benjamin Netanyahu if he were to uh to lose power yeah well netan would find himself in the opposition uh because according to all the polls Benny gun his rival would be able to form a coalition with other political parties uh which would put netanyahu's party and the ultra Orthodox parties in the uh opposition and this would mean that Israel would have um the uh the far right in the in the opposition uh so uh it doesn't mean that we're going to have peace in the Middle East and one has to remember that most of the public does not support say a two-state solution uh which is what the International Community is expecting uh to see uh after this war is over but still they do not want to see Netanyahu just just so zooming out from this and a final word how much is cooling diplomatic relations with the United States uh fueling these protests well I must say that the impact is not very strong Israelis are used to having these kinds of conflicts with the Americans and so far there has been some rhetoric on the behalf of the administration there has been some criticism uh We've also seen uh the vote the exstension in the security Council but after all the Americans are still sending their Munitions uh to Israel they're still backing Israel militarily uh so the Israelis still feel that they have the back of the Americans and this is not really the thing that's pushing people into the streets in fact even most of the public is Support also an operation in Rafa thanks for that Sammy as ever Samy sakul in Jerusalem thank you so
