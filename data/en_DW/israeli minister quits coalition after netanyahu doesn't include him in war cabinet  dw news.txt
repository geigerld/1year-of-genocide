meanwhile veteran Israeli Minister Gideon s has resigned from Benjamin netanyahu's emergency Unity government Mr s said he'd taken the decision after he was not included in the highest level War cabinet he was one of several opposition lawmakers who joined the unity government to help manage the war in Gaza after hamas's October 7 terror attack let's get more on this from journalist Samy sakol in Jerusalem uh welcome back Sammy will Ben in Netanyahu regard losing Gideon sa as significant yeah I mean for him it shows that he doesn't have control over the uh political theater he tried by various means to convince Gideon SAR to be an observer in this war cabinet he he told him that he would be able to come every once in a while uh and attend the meetings of this war cabinet but gon was adamant that he has to be a full member in this war cabinet and this would have caused a great problem for the government because if gon sah would have been a member of this cabinet thenar Ben and and smotri the Finance Minister who both belong belong to the far right they said that they would also want to be members of this uh War cabinet uh so he could not accept this Demand by gon sa okay but talk us through the timing because the war cabinet was established uh months ago why is Gideon sa only resigning now for not being included okay so gon s historically he was a member of the liud party uh he holds a rightwing uh positions uh as an example he opposes any involvement of the Palestinian Authority in ruling the Gaza striet in the day after he is against uh trucks bringing in food to the Gaza Strip uh so he has this position that the Israeli right and the far right support which is starving the people in the Gaza Strip and he's trying to disassociate himself from Benny gun he ran together with him in an attempt to topple Netanyahu in the previous elections and he's already thinking about the the day after in the next elections so he doesn't want to be together with Benny Gans and he rather would like to establish what he already said would be a right-wing party that would not be under Netanyahu so he's he's trying to carve his way through Israeli politics and there those who believe that the Israeli public has been shifting to the right but nevertheless is going against netan because of his responsibility for the 7th of October Fiasco so there is room for these kind of right-wing politicians to get support from okay so we have Gideon SAR a member of leud um Mr netanyahu's own party leaving his government are we St do you think that this will be the only resignation I wonder if we're starting to see the splintering of this this Coalition that's been held together by by just the the meest of things no and gonar is not going to topple this government he's just saying that currently he's a minister without portfolio in the government uh which means that he doesn't have much impact on anything and the decision making is not being made in the government so rather he says that he wants to step aside it doesn't mean that he will vote against the the government or that he will try to topple the government uh By Any Means uh he's just uh trying to kind of build his Niche within Israeli politics looking at the day of the elections okay that's very clear thank you for talking us to that Sammy Sami sakl in
