meanwhile elsewhere in Berlin Police were clearing a pro Palestinian protest camp set up outside the German Parliament building police dragged away demonstrators the group who set up the encampment more than two weeks ago said they wanted the German government to stop sending weapons and Military Support to Israel here's what protesters and police had to say so we've been here what is this now uh 15 16 17 days just over two weeks and we've been peaceful and we've been harassed by the police every single day they have given us like just the stupidest restrictions they have forbidden us from using languages that aren't German and English they have criminalized us they have criminalized our prayers our songs our workshops um and now they are their official reasoning for evicting this Camp is that we had a sofa and that we are protest Camp is trou the protest Camp has been prohibited because there have been repeated violations of the rules for public assembly and criminal offenses committed the protest leaders did not intervene to prevent this from happening so the protest has been deemed a threat to Public Safety there are no milder measures to prevent more crimes like incitement to hatred let's bring in our political correspondent Simon young Simon Pro Palestinian protesters in Germany say their movement is being unfairly Criminal alized how are the authorities dealing with these protests yeah well as you saw in this particular case uh the police said there had been criminality and violence around this Camp uh and I think probably they were also a bit concerned because uh it was located right in the heart of the government District here in Berlin uh but more generally I think it's fair to say that police have often felt they needed to uh police these kind of Palestinian uh demonstrations that we've seen over the last few months uh pretty closely in some cases breaking them up uh there is this uh allegation of incitement that coming from these protests in some cases uh and uh the use or in particular of banned slogans uh and banned uh images and so on is a is a problem it can be difficult for the police to decide exactly when the law has been broken for instance uh with the uh slogans that are are chanted in uh in Arabic or in other languages uh you know that may be difficult for the police or in some cases for instance when maps of the region of the of the Middle East region are held up in the Palestinian colors there may be problems sometimes they've taken a sort of precautionary approach pulling people out or in indeed closing the demonstrations down and leaving it of course in the end it's the courts that decide when the law has actually been broken mhm we have seen Pro Palestinian protests spreading on University campuses in the US lately how strong how big is the movement in Germany well I think it's fair to say that there have been many pro Palestinian demonstrations both before the 7th of October Hamas attacks against Israel and even in in more concentrated forms since and some of them have attracted thousands uh in some cases even tens of thousands of participants not in every case have they complied with the police requirements that such large demonstrations should be registered in advance and as I say there have been the concerns about uh breaches of the law about anti-Semitism uh and so uh you know there is a polarized atmosphere I I think around many uh of these demonstrations but the police of course and the authorities generally always say as well that they are concerned about uh freedom of speech just as much as uh freedom to demonstrate uh freedom of expression is as important also as making sure that nobody breaks the law tww political correspondent Simon young thank you Simon
