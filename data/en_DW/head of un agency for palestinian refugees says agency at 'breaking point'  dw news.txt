well the head of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees says that the situation has quote reached a Breaking Point Israel has accused several unra workers of directly participating in the October 7th Terror attacks the UN responded by launching a probe into those allegations the head of the UN agency says that the accusations have caused 16 major donor countries to suspend $450 Million worth of funding that could severely hamper operations in Gaza as soon as next month a recent us Intel report said that some of the accusations were credible but could not be independently verified while also C casting doubt on claims of wider links to militant groups let's get more on this we are joined Now by Tamara alifi she is a director of communications at the unra the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestinian refugees thank you so much for your time this afternoon um tell us a little bit more about the agency's current capabilities on the ground to provide humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza if we're talking about Gaza in particular the agency is stretched to the max because of the ongoing uh fighting and hostilities and air bombing and our very restricted access to most of the Gaza Strip and the concentration of people 1.5 5 million people in RAF today at the southernmost uh tip of the Gaza Strip and also because of the restrictions on humanitarian Assistance or Aid trucks food trucks coming in but the bigger picture is a b is a picture of a lot of um political and financial pressure on unwa that affects its ability to continue working not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank including East Jerusalem Syria Lebanon and Jordan where we run 700 schools for half a million children 140 medical centers and many more programs that are today at risk can you put that into context for us because um you know we've heard um from your director about how serious the funding crisis is what is the real world impact on the cuts that you are experiencing on on the civilians who are on the ground we're experiencing to date a free ing of funding that affects almost half of our budget requirements for this year in numbers this means that maybe already at the end of March beginning of April half a million girls and boys who go to 700 unra schools may not be able to continue learning it also means that if we don't get the funding back 2 million patients all Palestine refugees who get up to 8 million medical consultations per year in our 140 Health Centers might not be able to get their medicines for diabetes high blood pressure and other long-term diseases but mostly it means that more than more like almost the entire population in Gaza that today relies on Ona's food distribution and shelters might no longer be able to rely on unra if we cannot continue our operations so I'd like to ask you a little bit more now on the background as to why these funding cuts are happening you know we have these allegations from Israel that Hamas has infiltrated unra uh Israel has named a number of employees that it says were involved in the October 7th attacks um it's a shadow over your agency's reputation and it is not the first time that the agency has faced criticism how are you you and how can you regain the trust of donor Nations let us start by saying that many many donors and governments still trust unra and still trust our ability to deliver uh humanitarian assistance in Gaza and schooling and other services everywhere 16 donors decided to suspend their funding to the agency on the basis of allegations allegation is the operative term here every agency every workplace every Bank every institution every media institution May face allegations of corruption mistrust uh or even criminality there is a very serious investigation going on commissioned by the UN Secretary General Mr Antonio gutieres the allegations are around 12 staff members out of a staff core of 30,000 30 30,000 and we are facing allegations against 12 every allegation is extremely serious but we cannot jump to conclusions before an investigation is over and when the investigation concludes then there are sanctions against those who are credibly believed to be implicated for now we already terminated their contracts we already have an investigation and we even have an internal review of all our rules and regulations related to staff Behavior here by three credible yeah oh sorry I didn't want to interrupt you there but um my understanding is that Israel has actually named additional names since then in addition to those 12 that that you have mentioned what more can you tell us about the un's investigation into these allegations and the sort of timetable on which it is going to happen um and the circumstances under which you're going to get to the bottom of this especially considering that right now you are operating in a war zone in Gaza I actually want to say that Israel shared with unra 12 names that is all Israel has shared with us no evidence no circumstances no details nothing everything else we've been hearing from the news like the rest of the world so we have not been in the possession of any evidence but in all cases our call is to Israel or to any entity that claims to have information to submit it to the investigation the investigation is ongoing it's the highest the most authoritative investigating body of the UN from our headquarters in New York the the uh Secretary General of the UN promised a preliminary interim report within a month of the be of the beginning of the investigation so early March having said that we at unwa are looking forward to not only the results of the investigation but also the um recommen the recommendations to improve our own internal systems tomorrow refi unfortunately we have to leave it there we've run out of time but we thank you so much uh for joining us to share that perspective and um to share the view of of what your organization how you are proceeding and what you're currently going through with uh the current circumstances we appreciate
