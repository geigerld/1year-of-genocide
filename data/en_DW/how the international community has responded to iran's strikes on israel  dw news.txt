the United States has underlined its support for Israel while making it clear it does not want to see any more escalation in the region here's what National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told the US broadcaster NBC what Israel demonstrated last night was an incredible ability to defend itself just their own military superiority was quite uh remarkable yesterday uh I mean very little got through and the damage was extraordinarily light and also I Israel demonstrated again as I said that they're not standing alone that they have friends uh so the president's been clear we don't want to see this escalate we don't we're not looking for a wider war with Iran um I think uh I think you know the coming hours and days will will tell us a lot tww reporter in Washington Stephan Simons has this assessment the US has no interest for Israel to take any action which could possibly escalate the situation from where we are right now or where the us or where is Israel and Iran are right now um the US is assessing or the white house administration um is assessing the situation as actually quite dire that if Israel is pushing this further this could really result in a regional conflict nobody wants the Biden Administration doesn't want however of course we all quoted this many times the Ironclad support for Israel that is there the administration is adamant about repeating in this that there is absolute um support for Israel in any defense defensive manner if you will um that means if Israel is attacked Again by Iran or anybody else the US will stand by Israel helping to defend them however no such support supp uh promised by the us if the Israel if the war cabinet if Benjamin Nano should decide to go on the offensive here and retaliate in a way or at all perhaps uh towards Iran which would escalate the whole situation so this is a little bit the if you will thin line of of rope uh the US is trying to balance in here uhuh and the war in Gaza has already hurt Biden politically hasn't it of course it has um Biden's standing with uh whatever happened in or what all happened in in October at October 7th La uh last year hasn't been improved moved or getting better to the contrary he is under a lot of pressure from Arab Americans who want to see Biden administration's efforts to increase and to intensify when it comes to a sustainable peace agreement or truth agreement between Israel and and Hamas in Gaza the release of the hostages and more Aid humanitarian Aid into Gaza now the Biden Administration has worked on this there is a deal on the table for Hamas to accept for the release of hostages and four more eight and for a six way six we truth but according to reports Hamas has rejected that and that means for the Biden Administration back to square one a regional conflict would really cause trouble for the Biden Administration um we have a presidential election year uh so any conflict outside the US of that magnitude uh does not look good on the president no matter what he does or doesn't do and the president's hosting a G7 meeting uh not only has he said uh pledged his clad support as you put it like he did only days ago uh he also talked about wanting to coordinate a United diplomatic response what are the Diplomatic options here well the Diplomatic options as you know the US has no direct uh diplomatic relations with uh Iran the Swiss handled this for the United States however the US still understands and sees itself as the leader of the PC when it comes to organize diplomatic respons economic responses to any threat uh scenario Iran or anybody else poses uh for the region remember we're talking about the Middle East so we're talking about Oil we're talking about uh uh freedom of movement of ships etc etc Iran could play a role there so this G7 meeting uh which is handled like a zoom meeting remotely uh will probably discuss possible sanctions or sanction scenarios um but it is foremost about really uniting a front of Partners and allies of the United States in their diplomatic efforts to uh impress on Israel not to escalate this now with a disappropriate response to what happened and to impress on Iran to um not do anything further uh I think that is uh that is definitely of of the most importance for the United States right now leading this or asking for this G7 meeting and organizing this this diplomatic response and pressure on all parties involved there back here in Europe German Chancellor Olaf Schultz has responded to the Iranian assault but he's on a trip right now to China where he'll be meeting with among others president XI Jin ping here what he had to say a short time ago we strongly condemn the Iranian attack and warn against any further escalation Iran must not continue down this path at the same time it's absolutely clear to us that we stand in solidarity with Israel which has every right to defend itself we will do everything we can to prevent further escalation and will therefore continue to pursue our current course we can only warn everyone especially Iran against continuing down this path to look at the intern implications of the Iranian attack on Israel I'm joined by uh Richard Walker our international chief editor tell us more about Schultz and his meeting with Xi Jinping on Tuesday he's hoping to get help in avoiding further escalation but they get that yeah so I mean it it it's really quite fascinating to see Ola Schultz of course on the other side of the world at the moment I mean he's just been in chonging we just saw the pictures there from the the city in China where a German company has a hydrogen facility and he's been Touring that and you might think well he's he's got other things on his mind today than looking at a hydrogen Factory but I think that the Germans are saying that the fact that they get to talk to XI Jin ping the Chinese president on Tuesday really makes this trip worth it even from the point of view of the this this new risk of escalation going on the Germans were briefing before this trip that they would be going and asking the Chinese for help to try to keep a lid on things and this of course is particularly with respect to Iran where China has a close relationship and as a sign of that it's interesting to see so Tony blinkin The American Secretary of State spoke to Wang Yi his Chinese counterpart um just a couple of days ago um and the Chinese foreign Ministry spokesperson said that China uh condemns the attack on the Iranian Embassy in Syria so so China very much kind of taking Iran's side uh in what the backdrop to to what's happened here this this attack on the um Iranian facil ility in Syria so indicating that the Chinese feel kind of that the Iranians were you know had every right to retaliate now the question will be well you know do do the Chinese really want to risk a major escalation what could that mean for them and if you look at the Chinese economy it is very dependent on oil imports from the Middle East so any kind of major war that could cause disruption perhaps to oil exports through the Straits of Horus for example that could be very disruptive to China especially at a time that its economic economy is weak so I think Schulz would be appealing on those kind of self-interested grounds as well as uh on grounds of his own commitment to Israel's defense and you're saying that because it could cause some sort of unrest back home in China well well well China is struggling with its economy um the kind of disruption that could happen to oil markets um if there were a major conflict that that shut down the straights for moose that would affect China as much as any it would affect any other oil importing country at a time when the Chinese economy is in trouble so so I think these are some of the undercurrents I think Schultz will certainly be appealing on I think now the German foreign minister analena Bok said today that the Middle East was on the edge of a precipice that Iran had almost pushed the region into chaos let's listen in the Iranian regime has clearly led the entire Middle East to the brink of the Abyss Iran fired over 300 Rockets drones and cruise missiles at Israel last night we condemn in the strongest possible terms the direct Iranian attack on the territory of Israel Germany's full solidarity extends to Israel a stark warning there from bear Bach Richard yeah I mean I think reflecting just this level of concern which we've seen back to October 7th and the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that that really set off the this this new stage of instability in the Middle East um that there's been this concern that there could be a major escalation and particularly a war between Israel and Iran and this is the closest we've been to that yet as we've been hearing you know that this term unprecedented you know it hasn't happened before that Iran has directly attacked Israel nobody really knows how that is going to change the dynamic in the region yet so I think we got clear concerns here in Berlin and a flurry of international diplomatic activity of course will this be able to stop any potential escal yeah so we've got the UN security council meeting uh in the afternoon New York time today of course the UN Security Council has not shown itself able to really deal with the major conflicts Ukraine Middle East or others at the moment because it is so kind of deadlocked uh amid the the greater kind of great power competition going on between the Western powers and and Russia and China on the other hand so there it's quite possible that that will just descend into a kind of a Blame Game the G7 will also be talking we've heard about that already already I think the Western Powers will want to be sending messages of reassurance to Israel that they have its back but at the same time wanting to try to work on Israel to to to try to persuade it not to retaliate in a major way to what has just happened so that's the delicate balance the Western powers are going to be trying to walk at the moment and let's bring in farers jeder a professor of Middle Eastern politics and international relations at the London School of Economics now of course we're talking about limited damage but how surprised were you by the scale of Iran's attack on Israel I was very surprised this was a significant uh unprecedented attack by Iran at the first time ever in history uh 300 drones ballistic missiles uh cruise missiles um and I think what Iran uh was trying to do is to deliver the message uh and the message was delivered loud and clear it's all about uh restoring the terror for Iran um Iran did not really want to trigger all out war with Israel or with the United States and that's why it was telegraphing to the world uh in the past 10 days that it's intent to retaliate uh and the fact that the United States moved major air defense capabilities to the area and United Kingdom and France it tells you a great deal that the Strategic goal of Iran was not to really do a lot of damage or kill Israelis but rather to deliver the message that it's willing to stand up and basically retaliate for attacks by Israel against its sovereignty um and in particular against its Consulate in Syria okay well if this is all about deterrence and the message was heard loud and clear what sort of response do you expect then or reaction from Israel first of all I I was actually I disagree with your correspondent because General Gan said and this is an usual for Israelis he said we will respond at a time of our choosing what he's really is saying is that Iran used to say the same thing in the past few years um it tells me um I I don't know I could be wrong that obviously President Biden has impressed on Israeli Prime Minister the need to deescalate um and I think yesterday Israel and the top leadership came to realize that its security depends on its superpow pattern in particular the United States and Britain and France and a regional Coalition I mean let's look at what what Jordan did Jordan uh basically played a major role in destroying tens of drones uh over Jordanian territories so my hope the Iranians said today uh the matter is concluded uh they have no plans to escalate um I take it that if Israel does not really respond in the next couple of days I think the Middle East uh basically uh would have been or could have been saved from a major um explosion I mean a allout regional War I'm not suggesting the risk is not there but the next couple of days are really critical uh to see whether uh the region itself will step back from the brink or we'll see further escalation between um Israel and uh Iran and their allies local and international allies so far was what sort of steps need to be taken in those next days uh to ensure deescalation well I think first of all I think it all really depends on adults in the room uh because I think what we are seeing now is that there are very few adults in the room uh in the past 6 months uh despite everything that the Biden admin ation has provided for Israel I think President Biden has failed to exercise influence or leverage over netanyahu's War cabinet it seems to me what we might be seeing is a game changer um in the sense or at least I hope that not only the United States now will exercise influence over Decisions by Israel visis Iran but at least bring about the end of the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is far the release of Israeli host hostages and the release of is Palestinian prisoners uh this really could basically begin uh I mean the beginning of the end of the catastrophic situation in Gaza and the region as a whole okay positive note there to finish on with far Jes from the London School of Economics pleasure talking to you thank you
