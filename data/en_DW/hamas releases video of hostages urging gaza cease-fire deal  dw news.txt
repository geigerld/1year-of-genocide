the release of a new video by Hamas claiming to show two hostages being held in Gaza is renewing pressure on Israel's government to secure the release of all those still being held Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz has suggested that a planned assault on Rafa could be suspended if a hostage deal can be struck with Hamas which carried out the October 7 terror attack and there are reports that such a deal may be close as public anger grows a sea of white and blue flags on the streets of Tel Aviv thousands of Israelis demanding that the government bring their compatriots home but after almost 7 months of war and with no hostage deal in sight many are turning their fury on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government families of the hostages we gathered to call upon the cabinet members get out of government if you can't secure a deal now this is job number one of the government of Israel job number one and they failed dramatically they should go all the governments all the 64 members this protest was further inflamed by a video released by Hamas that appeared to show two hostages taken during the October 7th terror attack Netanyahu and his government insist that securing the release of all hostages is their top priority but many are losing faith that Israeli leaders are really doing all that they can I want for elections to be held not in a year or two but right now as soon as possible I want all the hostages back because I can see the government does not want them back they want to make this war go as long as possible we've been terrorized by our government by our leadership for more than 6 mon they they they haven't been doing whatever they needed to do as Hamas considers Israel's latest proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza negotiators have hinted that a hostage deal might be close but that's a message these protesters have been hearing for months and their patience is running [Applause] out DW correspondent Rebecca RS is in Jerusalem for us Rebecca hi there Hamas released a new hostage video on Saturday it's the second this week what can you tell us about that and how it might be influencing the debate over a ceas fire deal in Israel well Jared it is the second that we've seen this week and I think the timing is no coincidence it's the Passover holiday here uh one of the highest holidays in the Jewish calendar time when families gather to discuss uh you know the year and of course this year the events of October 7 will be very present at everyone's mind as as will the hostages uh now Israel maintains that these videos are psychological warfare you don't see them played on the media here in Israel they are no doubt an attempt by Hamas to try to put pressure on the ceasefire negotiations but just how effective they are compared to all the pressure that Israel is already under when it comes to securing a ceasefire agreement is difficult to say but it no doubt adds to the noise and after this video was released we heard a statement from uh in response from the hostage family saying the government has to decide between Rafa an incursion in Rafa in in southern Gaza and the hostages so you know you know can of hear the the the underlying statement in that and we saw as you just saw in that report there tens of thousands of people taking to the streets consecutively for another week of anti-government protests calling for more to be done putting more pressure on the government to come to some kind of deal or back face elections now Rebecca you mentioned Rafa Israel's foreign minister has held out the prospect that the planned offensive there could be suspended or postponed if a hostage deal is indeed reached with Hamas what can you tell us about the likelihood of that well I think if a deal is reached Jared then it will have to be in conjunction with some plan to hold off on the raffer offensive so yeah I think Eva deal is reach then we will see a suspension to those plans I think the question is whether or not a deal is going to be able to be reached and of course that's a lot more difficult to answer uh we've seen a Revival of these ceasefire talks in recent days with Egyptian officials here in Israel to discuss them with Israeli officials now we know that a counter Israeli plan or offer has been taken back for Hamas officials to to look at and and consider but we're seeing both sides still very much kind of digging down in their in their sides and and creating that stalemate that we've been seeing for months now Hamas calling for an all out permanent ceasefire withdraw all of Israeli troops and the allowance of people from the South to be able to relocate back up into the north of Gaza that is something that Israel has said is an absolute red line and it will not agree to so whether or not these talks bring any fresh you know agreement or or movement of course remains to be seen and we'll just have to see in the coming days how Hamas respond to this current uh proposal that's on the table that was our correspondent Rebecca rers in Jerusalem Rebecca thanks a lot for that
