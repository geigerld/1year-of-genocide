well Israel has wrapped up its defense against accusations of genocide on a second day of hearings at the international court of justice in the ha the defense team strongly rejected the case brought by South Africa it told the court that Israel was not seeking to destroy the Palestinians but to protect its own people in its war against Hamas uh which many countries classify as a terrorist organization of children T Becker is a legal adviser for Israel's foreign Ministry and in court he attacked South Africa's handling of the case the entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated decontextualized and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities South Africa purports to come to this court in the lofty position of a guardian of the interest of humanity but in delegitimizing Israel's 75-year existence in its opening presentation yesterday that broad commitment to humanity rang Hollow it is unsurprising there that in the applicant's telling both hamas's responsibility for the situation in Gaza and the Very Humanity of its Israeli victims are removed from view the attempt to weaponize the term genocide against Israel in the present context does more than tell the court a grossly distorted story and it does more than empty the word of its unique force and special meaning DW's correspondent Lucia Shulton is at the icj in the Haag as she's got more about Israel's defense against the allegations of genocide brought by South Africa two days of hearings have ended here today in the heg on the second day of the hearings Israel got a chance to make its case and defend itself against the allegations made by South Africa South Africa is saying that Israel breached the genocide convention by acts and omissions that are genocidal in character Israel strongly rejects this and says that South Africa is distorting the facts Israel wants to see the whole case rejected and also does not want to see provisional measures being put on it South Africa has asked for these provisional measures and among them are for example the quest that the court orders Israel to end all military operations in the next step the court will have to decide whether it brings forward any kind of provisional measures or not this is expected to be relatively quickly the main case the question whether Israel has indeed breached the genocide convention or not this is expected to take years tww special correspondent AIA Ibrahim joins me now from Jerusalem AIA yesterday we were reporting on South Africa's arguments uh in bringing these charges of genocide against Israel at the icj and today was Israel's turn to defend itself how did it present its case well this was an almost 3-hour hearing and it so it's difficult to really uh summarize uh all of the arguments but a couple certainly stood out to me there's uh the fact that uh Israel claims that South Africa's entire case is uh not factual that it takes statements out of uh context Israel's counterargument also hinges heavily on the accusation that Hamas is actually uh to blame for all of the atrocities that South Africa accuses Israel of committing uh because Hamas embeds itself among the civilian population essentially saying well yes conflict uh means civilian casualties but really it's hamas's fault because hamas's strategy is designed to maximize civilian casualties that's the Israeli claim um they also the Israeli team also says that um while civilian casualties certainly are U you know tragic uh fact of conflict genocide the genocide convention is not the correct framework to address what is happening in Gaza but uh more the laws of armed uh uh conflict but I think what uh the you know perhaps the strongest challenge to South Africa's case that was presented today was the question of intent genocidal intent yesterday South Africa laid out its case uh with a lot of quotes from Israeli officials that have in one way or another uh said that this war is meant to or that the goal is to uh destroy or um you know remove uh the Palestinian population in uh Gaza the Israeli team today says well these officials are not part of Israel's uh War cabinet they're not um uh they're not uh their statements essentially that their statements do not um comprise official Israeli policies and then they then they quoted other Israeli officials who then said that there is no intention to destroy the the Palestinian population and that there's no um uh that there's no intention to uh forcibly remove them from uh the strip so they're saying yes these were Israeli officials but that uh they're not the Israeli officials whose opinion really uh matters and so they're trying to challenge the the the claim of intent um with uh with these counter quotes among others from the Prime Minister himself well thank you so much for bringing us up to speed that is our special correspondent a Ibrahim in
