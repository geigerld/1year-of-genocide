Israel is pushing on with its military operation in Rafa in defiance of international condemnation and an order from the international court of justice it struck the alasi camp in the south of Gaza on Tuesday the Hamas run Health Ministry says at least 21 people were killed in the area designated by Israel as a humanitarian Zone the Israeli Army denied hitting the area adding that it is targeting Hamas militants there are also reports of Israel tanks in the center of Rafa this after 45 Palestinians were reportedly killed in a separate strike on a refugee camp on Sunday Israel's prime minister called it a tragic mistake and we can now bring in Sam Rose he's the director of planning at unra and joins us from Rafa now um Sam you're on the line there with us we're getting reports that Israeli forces have reached the heart of Rafa what can you tell us about the situation there absolutely look we thought the situation was bad yesterday when the uh the horrific incident involving the strikes on on attented Camp uh inside Raa took place but over the past 24 hours bombardments have continued that they've intensified and we understand from our staff and other people on the ground that indeed Israeli troops have pushed further into the center of of RA I've not seen them myself but those the reports that we're hearing what I can tell you without any doubt is that the bombardments have intensified and intensified in areas to the west of Raa including on the coast where I am right now gazin officials say more than 20 people have been killed in an Israeli strike on a displacement camp near Rafa today do you have any independent information to support that claim I don't know I mean I'm in my residence it's dark now so we're not able to go out heard the same stories I've heard the same reports it certainly wouldn't surprise me if if if they were true given the bombardments that we're hearing but no I can't independently verify it at this time now knowing what you know is there any place left in Gaza that is safe no absolutely not we've been saying this it's become a bit of a cliche over the past eight months but it's uh I mean it's a death sentence for Palestinians who are constantly forcibly displaced from one location to another location to another location we've lost countless how many times many of our staff members have been displaced the women children the civilians horrifically killed in the incident a couple of nights ago have been forcibly displaced from other other parts of of Gaza they were an authentic camp that they believed to be saved but like many people in Gaza they go to bed every night Under the Stars not sure whether or not they're going to wake up in the morning we're almost eight months into this war much if not most of Gaza you know the situation a lot better than than we can grasp it here has been reduced to Rubble you know hundreds of thousands you mentioned it there have been displaced over and over again you've been in touch with people there you've been trying to provide aid for them what's the most common questions you get when you you talk to Goins who are trapped there I mean people say all all sorts of things a few weeks ago when we go to the north of Gaza people would would want food but the most common refrain that we hear from from everyone is just stop the war stop the war stop the war the the the people of Gaza can't understand why or how the world can witness every day what's happening to them these scenes of of Bloodshed and horror and brutality being played out on mobile phones media and social media around the world they can't understand how the world can see this going on and and yet it's powerless or unable to do anything about it so they feel a real sense of Abandonment from the International Community and a real sense of hopelessness for their situation is there anything you can tell them to provide some sort of comfort when they come to you with with that kind of you know desperation no I mean we can provide some kind of Sucker uh on on a very human level on on an individual level we spend a lot of time talking to our staff members they up that we them up but all that we can do when people come to us in those situations is be be very human with them and give them a bit of bit of human contact reassure them that we do care that the world does care but in terms of material support in terms of real assistance no we're powerless to stop that and we're very regretful of the fact that we do appear to be powerless to to stop this so the people of Gaza I'm a representative of the United Nations my organization is a United Nations organization and people struggle to understand how it is that the United Nations this this uh famed and this acclaimed and this important and aere international body appears completely powerless in the face of of such a brutal conflict that's that's you know that's grabbing the of the world but it's it's such a small Geographic space that was Sam Rose director of planning at unra thank you so much for your time and and please be safe thank you during a state visit between France and Germany in M German Chancellor Olaf schz weighed in on Israel's offensive in Rafa is isra needs to abide by international law it needs to allow humanitarian support for the people suffering in Gaza it's a responsibility of Israel to ensure that necessary Aid is delivered yesterday we heard of a terrible tragic attack in Rafa a refugee camp was hit many people died this case shows once again why Germany and so many other states have been against a major ground offensive in Rafa because there isn't sufficient protection of civilians and it's not possible yesterday's incident clearly shows this French president Emmanuel MC also reacted to the recent attacks by Israel in Rafa the situation in Rafa is extremely worrying and as I already said yesterday the Israeli operations in Rafa must end we must stand by Palestinian civilians the international court of justice has already called on Israel to stop its operation in Rafa immediately to protect civilians our position has been clear right from the start we have condemned in the strongest possible terms the Hamas attacks we support Israel's right to defend itself but we need to ensure its response in Gaza is in line with international law corespondent in Jerusalem Rebecca wrs as following the developments for us Rebecca what can you tell us about the situation ation in ruer right now well Anya we know that the Israeli military continued their operation in ruffa overnight as well as along the adelfia corridor that's a strap a scrap of land between uh Egypt and Gaza and it's a a key position for the Israelis we also had reports in the early hours this morning that air strikes uh had begun in the rougher area and we also had reports this afternoon uh that air strikes were also targeting the almaas uh Elma wasi are area it's west of Rafa and it's where many uh civilians have gone to take shelter we were hearing from the gazen health Ministry uh Health Ministry rather reports of around 20 dead though we have not obviously been able to confirm those numbers and we've heard no word from the israelian military on that uh latest strike we do know as you were saying uh in your lead and we have been getting reports also uh of tanks in the center of Rafa uh so we we also haven't heard from the Israeli military on that point but we've been getting eyewitness accounts of tanks in the center of Rafa and we've seen some images from the aler network that appear to show or alleged to show these tanks reportedly in the center of the city now the question uh regarding that is of course going to be around whether or not tanks in the center of ruer constitutes uh what's known as a full scale incursion of that City and that's something that was a red line by the US prior uh to the attack on Rafa that's something that they said that they wouldn't get behind that they wouldn't support and they urged Israel to go for these more targeted and small a smaller operations so whether or not the position from the US will change now of course is a big question on the lips of many now the Israeli military has given an update on its uh investigation into the air strike on Rafa on Sunday uh more than 40 civilians were killed in that what did the uh Israeli military say in that update yeah well a little while ago we heard from the senior military spokesman Daniel hagari he came out with information from a preliminary investigation he said that uh that in fact this strike was carried out 1.7 kilometers from the so-called safe Zone there was conjecture and questions as to whether or not this strike uh that happened on Sunday sparking this huge uh fire and killing as you say some 40 more than 40 people was within that designated safe area now he says that this preliminary investigation proves that it wasn't he said that small Munitions were used the smallest that they're able to fire from these Jets were used and that those Munitions were not able or wouldn't have been able to spark the kind of fire that we saw in the aftermath so suggesting that the strike potentially led to to something else exploding and then sparking uh that fire that we saw um he he suggested or he said as one of the possible options might be that there was a Hamas weapons uh Depot nearby and perhaps that caught fire though they offered no evidence for that and they said the investigation of course is ongoing Rebecca RS reporting from Jerusalem Rebecca thank you so much now US President Joe Biden had previously said that attacks on populated areas in Rafa would be a red line for him I asked Ian Bremer president of the us-based Pol political risk consultancy EUR raazia group if that red line had been crossed it's pretty clear uh that that red line uh is being routinely crossed uh even if uh not as soundly or strongly uh as as prime minister Natan yahu had said it would uh and and the point is that the United States isn't doing very much about it this is America's most important Ally in the Middle East Biden has both privately and publicly warned the Minister and the entire War cabinet in Israel to uh support a two-state solution they refuse it uh to allow more humanitarian Aid in they've refused it to be much more careful about the civilian casualties that they are allowing even if they're not directly targeting they've refused to do that um and now we see them proceeding with these bombings um into Rafa and whether or not the Prime Minister refers to it as a mistake uh or the the point is that the United States looks incredibly weak um in in being incapable um of of restraining um it's much less powerful uh and longstanding Ally of the Israelis well what are Biden's options at this point Biden had threatened to suspend weapons deliveries to Israel do you see a scenario emerging where the US would actually cut back support to its Ally there have been some uh suspensions uh of of military shipments we've seen a little bit of that it certainly would not be in any circumstance cutting off the majority of Israeli defensive Aid that's well over $3 billion a year in addition um to the over 10 billion that was just approved uh in the in the recent bipartisan uh legislative Aid and support bill um I don't see any of that I see the possibility of cutting off some offensive Weaponry for a period of time uh it certainly would not make Biden's Democratic supporters feel like he was pressuring or constraining Israel uh meanwhile it makes the Republicans and of course former president Trump uh be able to say that he's not being the strong strident Ally to Israel that he should be Biden is in no man's land on this issue he's making nobody happy um and this is of course only a few months before a general election in the United States right what are where do you see the risks in that election that is just looming as as you say um well I mean the risks for the Middle East are that uh you know the the United States is uh not seen as an effective actor um on the ground is not able uh to to push forward policies that its Gulf allies certainly want I mean Biden has spent a lot of time trying to get an agreement with the Saudis that's all but in but you have to have a two-state solution that the Israeli government again America's top Ally refuses to support now if Trump comes in and his president um he's going to be just as Pro Zionist as Biden um but I I it's hard to imagine in this environment that any American president is going to be effective uh in bringing this war to an end
