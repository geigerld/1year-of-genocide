US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is on his way back to the Middle East to present a new plan for a ceasefire in Gaza he says the new proposal has input from Qatar and Egypt and addresses some of the key concerns of both Israel and Hamas the plan initially provides for a complete and unrestricted ceasefire of 6 weeks Lincoln's trip comes after a hmer spokesperson said that signs of progress after two days of talks in Doha were an illusion and after another wave of Israeli air strikes in central Gaza backto back Israeli strikes on an apartment Block in central Gaza after the dust clears people bring out the dead and injured not far away a house and a warehouse destroyed in an overnight Israeli attack the Hamas Raza Health Ministry said over a dozen people were killed most from the same family they were asleep in their beds kids and babies then three missiles targeted their home the place is well known Abu chat is a fish and meat Merchant with their targeting Merchants who else is next the Israeli military said it had struck militant Targets in an area where Rockets had been fired at its troops it has also called on residents in parts of central Gaza to flee ahead of a new military operation there is great suffering how can we move from place to place without money I left home I didn't know where to go I swear to God that people gave me five she to go to the hospital to treat my son the latest strike came hours after mediators including the usq and Egypt expressed optimism that a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas could be imminent the mediators have submitted an important proposal there is communication between the Israeli and Palestinian sides and if the intentions are sincere and if there is political will then a ceasefire can reached we're looking at ways to close any remaining gaps Hamas did not participate directly in the first round of peace talks in Doha and it cast doubt on the prospect of an agreement meanwhile cousins are keeping their fingers crossed for a potential breakthrough in the upcoming negotiations which are set to resume in Ciro next week journalist bik sardin joins us from Tel Aviv could some part of these talks pave the way for a ceasefire or could you envisage the actual signing of a deal at this point in time well that's definitely what the Americans and the other mediators are hoping for we are approaching a dramatic week there are still some gaps uh according to what we've heard uh and the delegation that came from Cairo on Friday told the Prime Minister and that's according to the prime minister's office that there is some uh uh uh cautious optimism as the statement from the prime minister's office states which means that there could be some of the um issues that remained unsolved specifically the Philadelphia Corridor and the narim corridor which is the corridor that splits the Gaza Strip into two uh and the Israeli side is still asking for some sort of a system or a method way to monitor who goes back from the gazans from the south of the strip to their homes to the north of the strip according to the framework that President Biden puts out uh um on excuse me last uh may he said that only civilians will go back to the north of the Gaza Strip and that's an issue for the Israelis and the prime minister is still asking for a way to ensure that specific thing now uh this week uh the um there is a delegation that will go to Cairo in order to deal with the Philadelphia Corridor issue and secretary blinkin is said to arrive to Israel today and meet with Israeli officials including the Prime Minister tomorrow in order to discuss uh the remaining gaps specifically that narim Corridor issue that I just um um said blink's been back and forth time and again during this war how do you think his presence during these negotiations could change things well this is I guess it's his 10th or ninth visit to the region and he always comes here after uh some more development is has been made uh now Lincoln knows and that's what the President also said uh that the Israeli side will not uh give up on the Narin issue and also the Philadelphia Corridor issue and that's why uh blinkin is said to come to Israel in order to put more pressure on the Israelis but I'm not sure exactly how because the only way that the Americans has putting pressure on the Israelis is by withholding some of the ammunition specifically the heavy bombs that uh uh the Administration has uh yet to deliver to supply to Israel and that uh has been uh since I guess April or May so we're not talking about anything new news that could put more pressure in the Israelis maybe all to convince them to avoid a full-blown out war with the Iranians because the Americans are hoping that if we proceed to ceasefire deal then will that will deter the Iranians and hisbah from attacking Israel you heard it from journalist bik stin in Tel Aviv thank you very much for being on DW news
