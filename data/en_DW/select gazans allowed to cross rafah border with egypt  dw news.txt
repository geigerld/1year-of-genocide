gazin are waiting for the Rafa border crossing to open to allow some severely wounded gazin into Egypt where they will receive treatment with foreign Nationals hoping to leave Gaza the Rafa Crossing has been the only means of getting crucial Aid into the strip Egyptian media have reported a deal to allow 81 injured people including children to cross in the coming hours information from Gaza has been all but shut down by a mobile phone and internet at blackout let's bring in Alona sienko here she's a spokesperson for the Red Cross and joins us from Jerusalem uh we understand that the Rafa border crossing May well open briefly today in order to allow some people to leave and cross into Egypt what more can you tell us about that well uh just like everybody else we are following the situation and we're waiting uh what's going to happen and we we hope that people who want to evacuate they can reach safety but for us as the humanitarian organization working in Gaza on the ground the main priority is delivering humanitarian assistance to hospitals in Gaza because they are running a critically short on the Essential Medical Supplies uh last week we managed to bring uh some of the trucks in but this is infinitely small compared to the massive scale of the needs that we are seeing so Alon are you expecting then that that opening of the if that crossing the Rafa Crossing between Gaza and Egypt does open today are you expecting more humanitarian Aid to flow into Gaza it's too early for us to tell uh we are in con we are in constant dialogue and negotiations trying to uh bring more supplies in uh that we have ready and preposition we now have our surgical team uh that arrived in Gaza and started operating so yes we are constantly calling on uh safe delivery of humanitarian need on safe humanitarian access for our colleagues to be able to uh do their work and also for the necessary supplies to be able to reach the people who are now in a desperate situation as you know Communications have been cut off to Gaza how is your staff with the Red Cross coping with this situation on the ground well uh yesterday last night uh I was still managing to reach and speak to our colleagues in Gaza uh we Tred to be in contact with them all the time because it is an extremely difficult situation for them just like for the all the other civilians who are there with uh um Relentless sounds of explosion shelling it's uh uh extremely difficult uh I haven't been able to speak to them this morning we are of course uh extremely worried uh because it's important for us to be able to reach our staff to uh carry out our work uh it's impossible to put up a large humanitarian response without the functioning telecommunication lines but also just for the for civilians people need information about how to reach safety they need information about where to get clean water uh need to be able to contact their families so uh the humanitarian impact of uh telecommunication blackout is uh and could be very serious what about the limited Aid that is getting into Gaza it's simply not enough to go around the needs are so great and the supply of Aid is so small how do you prioritize who gets that Aid how do you distribute it how do you make that decision well for us right now the priority is uh medical uh supporting hospitals and uh because what we have seen after we have visited hospitals around Gaza in different areas uh was horrifying we have seen medical professionals who have now been working for weeks in a row without any PS uh mer many of them they're also in very distressed psychological State because they don't know uh if their own family members are safe and sometimes they find their own family members among the victims that they have to treat uh the people are Sheltering in play in place also in the hospitals looking for safety so supporting hospitals amid this massive humanitarian crisis is the number one priority so we managed to send our Surgical team and they started working and uh we brought some surgical supplies but we need more supplies and yes prioritizing uh in a situation when needs are so staggeringly high and keep Rising it's it's a very difficult uh task I agree with you Alona thank you very much for taking time to talk with us today that was Alona sienko spokesperson for the Red Cross in Jerusalem thank you
