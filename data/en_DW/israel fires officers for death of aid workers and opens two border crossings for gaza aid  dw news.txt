Israel says it has fired two senior officers and reprimanded three others from Monday's air strikes in Gaza that killed seven Aid workers an inquiry carried out by Israel's military found that its forces made quote grave mistakes when they attacked the world Central Kitchen humanitarian Convoy but the UN says the findings don't address the underlying cause of Civilian deaths here at Israel's ashod Port AG shipments Bound for Gaza will soon be accepted and further south The era's Crossing will be reopened says Israel it used to be a pathway for people to cross the border until Hamas militants used it as an entry point for their October 7th Terror attacks now Israel will reopen the checkpoint temporarily as well as the Kem Shalom Crossing into Southern Gaza Israel's about face comes after pressure from its closest Ally the US on a tense phone call President Biden told prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the US would review its support of the war if changes weren't made a reprimand that appears to have spurred Israel to action pardon me did you threaten to stop military aid to Israel I asked them to do what they're doing Israel's about face on Aid follows International outrage over an air strike earlier this week that killed seven Aid workers in the Gaza Strip after a swift investigation the Israeli Army fired two officers and reprimanded three senior commanders the inquiry found they had attacked the aid trucks after misidentifying the vehicles as having Hamas gunmen inside Israel has expressed quote deep sorrow for the incident and made a commitment to protect Aid workers the UN however is demanding an independent investigation the Israeli government has acknowledged mistakes and announced some disciplinary measures but the essential problem is not who made the mistakes it is the military strategy and procedures in place that allow for those mistakes to multiply time and time again your tool of last nearly 200 humanitarian Aid workers have died in Gaza Strip attacks since October 7th according to the UN and as the war nears its six-month Mark several Aid agents has warn that more than half of gaza's population is on the brink of [Music] famine our correspondent Rebecca ridders in Jerusalem told us more about Israel's inquiry into the strike that killed seven Aid workers on Monday the results came out just a few hours ago here in Israel from the military from that uh so called independent investigation though it is an internal investigation done by a separate Branch within the Israeli military and the basically identified uh that this these strikes were carried out in serious violation of military protocol protocol and it says they were carried out due to misidentification that in fact the the the military thought that there was a threat they thought that somebody thought that they saw a gunman uh on this humanitarian Convoy that was going uh this was earlier before the firing actually happened it was going to this warehouse and that they thought that that gunman then proceeded to go with this Convoy uh and that's of course what why they're saying that the the Convoy was then fired upon uh you know we as we know from the reporting of the incident the the the Convoy was fired upon the first car the first um vehicle was fired upon then the people tried the people that were still living were tried to get out go to the second and the third uh and they were you know was continually fired at so uh that is being identified as a misidentification and in direct violation of military procedure as you've mentioned we've got two uh senior military personnel have been dismissed and uh some have been reprimanded including the head of the Southern command that looks after uh the military that that is basically carrying out the operation in Gaza uh It also says that this is a breakdown in the chain of command but we've been reporting on this week week from internal uh internal reporting that's been done here in Israel by magazine called uh 972 or plus 972 that there in fact is a is a gross breakdown of the chain of command in the military and there has been throughout this in fact that AI Machinery has been used to identify targets and in fact there is very little in way of chain of command so if that is indeed confirmed that could potentially go some way to explaining how something like this could happen so Israel trying to explain what happened in the killing of those Aid workers um we're also seeing Israel opening up Pathways for more Aid to get into Gaza Let's cross over to Aaron David Miller Senior cour uh senior fellow at the carnegi Endowment for International Peace focusing on US foreign policy good to have you with us we're now seeing Israel opening up more Pathways for Aid the Netanyahu government seems to be responding to pressure from Washington following months of international press pressure so so what changed I think the administration's uh view of the situation and their willingness uh I think to make it unmistakably clear that unless certain policies pertaining to humanitarian assistance were changed then the administration although they haven't um publicly articulated what the or else would be uh I think the administration um hinted that um there could be um serious costs and consequences imposed uh on the government of Israel and I think uh the Prime Minister understood that he had pushed his um a political campaign hoping to run against the United States um us pressure too far and the president who doesn't want an open breach with the Prime Minister uh essentially put uh netan on probation and gave him a test that I think should be relatively easy for the Israelis to uh to pass months ago they could have improved um focusing on facilitating humanitarian assistance as a priority they didn't uh and as a consequence um International pressure Rose and anger and frustration from the United States right so so the threat of consequences from the US could this be a turning point in the could David Aaron David are you still with me could this be a a turning point here I'm here you kind of went uh went quiet there for okay we're we're asking if if this could be a turning point in the war with the US putting more pressure on netanyahu's government a turning point in the war would mean that uh you'd reach a an agreement between Israel and Hamas in phases to free hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners to create at least a six week ceasefire uh and finally to create predictable and reliable corridors in which to Surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza no the Turning Point involves both hands clapping that is to say Israel and Hamas are going to have to agree these are the two major combatants these are the two parties that have determined the tactics the strategies the periods of escalation and deescalation and we're now in the sixth month of this war we often forget we default somehow to the fact that the International Community or the United States somehow will figure out a way to fix all of this and whether it's Sudan or Ukraine or Syria or Yemen I mean the list goes on and on Aaron David Miller thank you so much to external pressure Aaron David Miller Senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace thank you so much and I'm now pleased to welcome ahud Almer he was Israel's primee Minister between 2006 and 2009 welcome back to the show prime minister it's a pleasure to have you on now International pressure on Israel is mounting and the Netanyahu government seems to be responding do you think this could be a turning point in the war I hope so I actually hope that that the war will be stopped at this point now there is no purpose I don't see any Merit in continuing the War I think Israel to the extent that you can win Wars like this against terrorist organizations we won the war we have devastated the Hamas we killed so many thousands of the Hamas Fighters we uh destroyed completely their uh command positions the bankers the many of the tunnels we have won the war I don't see any advantage continuing the war now it has to be stopped and to the extent that the president and the American leadership and the European leadership advises the Israeli government to do so I think they giving a good advice do you think that prime minister Netanyahu shares your assessment that this war is already won I don't know exactly what his uh assessment uh I draw a distinction distinction I think more many do between his um possible assessments or the the assessment of most of the Israeli uh people in the uh command position and the government and their personal needs of the Prime Minister and I believe that uh unfortunately not always the decisions um that are carried out by the Prime Minister are necessarily compatible to the interest of the state of Israel it seems like it's more in the interest of the Prime Minister himself which is different Joe Biden also asked for an immediate ceasefire there will be new negotiations this weekend it was just announced do you expect to see a breakthrough there I thinkk you know I'm not in a position to be able to give an assessment about what may happen between prime minister and of Israel and Biden President Biden uh I as I said I I think that the war has to be stopped now I don't see any Merit to Israel I'm not I do not think about Kamas I don't think about the Palestinians I think about my country I don't see any marry to continue this war now they uh every day that it continues causes a great damage to the state of Israel uh to the uh image of the state of Israel to good relations between Israel and many of the countries which we care for without any any a positive outcome to the interest of the state of Israel now uh if we kill U 20 more terrorists that will not make any dramatic difference in a basic balance where we are but if a thousand more civilians will be killed it will be terrible for the state of Israel for the image of the state of Israel so at this point I think that we has to stop we have to stop I hope that the Prime Minister will do it I I doubt he will do it but I hope he will do it and I hope that his Partners in the coalition will squeeze him and will Express their opinion and will put will use all their power ofation in order to bring about an end to this war yeah we are six months into this war Gaza has been reduced to Rubble pretty much 33,000 Palestinians are dead and 130 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza do you think the government is doing enough to free them no I think this uh observation is shared by first of all the family families of the hostages and by many thousands of Israelis who are rioting and demonstrating in the center squares of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem 100,000 yesterday both in Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem which I think is just uh I think good uh evident to the uh extent that people are unhappy with the way that the government is handling this uh the precondition in my mind for the return of the hostages will be an end to the War uh I I can't see I almost can't see that the Hamas will agree to release the hostages they are they are doing the most atrocious things to the hostages hostages are tortured are are raped or harassed in the most terrible way but what would you do differently than than the Netanyahu government you've been in a similar position um you've had to negotiate um hostage releases um with with Hamas what would you do differently if you were in netanyahu's position well I would have done different in 2011 when he released and thousand more terrorist of Hamas for one Israeli soldier there was a tragic AK perhaps a mistake which has exposed the weakness uh and the personal emotional instability of prime minister netan and which may have triggered the greater Violence by the Hamas and the other terrorist organizations now now when 134 Israelis are held hostage by the Hamas we have to make and to pay anything in order to release them because they are not soldiers they were not soldiers they were not captured by the Hamas in the battlefield they were taken from their homes from the living rooms because the Israeli government and the Israeli Army deserted them we left them undefended and now it is incumbent upon us to bring them back at any cost therefore in the past would have been I would have dealt different than than netan with regard to Kash and now I would have dealt in a different way than Netanyahu is doing yeah you've said several times that netanyahu's days are numbered pressure is growing now internally and externally how much longer do you think he can hold on to power well I think that his days are numbered I think that uh he will erupt I can't tell you you know in a week in two weeks in three weeks in a month but they uh public rage the discontent the bitterness the disappointment of the majority of the of the Israelis will erupt like a volcano and will sweep everyone that will stand in its way so I think that n days are numbered the sooner he he leaves I think the better it is for Israel that was former Israeli Prime Minister ahud Almer thank you so much for your time thank you
