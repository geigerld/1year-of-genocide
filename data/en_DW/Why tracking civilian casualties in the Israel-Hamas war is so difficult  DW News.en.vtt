just take us a long long time to do that
 

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.710 align:start position:0%
just take us a long long time to do that
process<00:09:23.200><c> in</c><00:09:23.320><c> general</c><00:09:23.640><c> what</c><00:09:23.760><c> about</c><00:09:23.959><c> the</c>

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.910 align:start position:0%

will<00:09:31.720><c> take</c><00:09:31.839><c> a</c><00:09:31.959><c> long</c><00:09:32.160><c> time</c><00:09:32.320><c> to</c><00:09:32.480><c> make</c><00:09:32.640><c> full</c>
