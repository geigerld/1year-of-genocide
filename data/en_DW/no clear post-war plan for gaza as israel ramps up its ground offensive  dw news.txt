and to Gaza now hundreds of thousands of evacuees have fled rafar as repeated international calls urge Israel to exercise caution before launching a ground offensive on the city Israel has been fighting Hamas across Gaza since the militant group carried out the October 7th Terror attacks on Israel but now Israeli soldiers are returning to the north of the strip where Hamas forces have regrouped in areas Israel said it had cleared the rush to get water in central gaza's dear albala is desperate supplies here were already low but the arrival of thousands of evacuees from Rafa means there is even less to go around in dear alala people are now on top of each other people are walking on each other it's very crowded there's no empty space those who are staying in houses have some 10 displaced families staying with them for myself I was staying with my children and my wife in a tent I now have five or six families staying in the tent with me it's very crowded once deemed a safe Zone around 1.4 million people sought shelter in rougher in recent months now they're leaving as Israel ramps up its attacks fleeing families have been forced to uproot their lives again and again I was suffering is continuous we're tired of moving from a place to another and those places are not near each other from a city to another so we need Transportation we're tired how long will we have to stay in the situation the United States has repeatedly cautioned Israel against expanding its offensive into ruer but Israel insists the city is a Hamas stronghold and that has to drive out militants hiding there despite more than 7 months of War Hamas remains active across the territory this week Israeli soldiers return to the north of Gaza an area it claimed to have captured months ago well for more on this Let's cross over to DW's tanyaa in Jerusalem Tanya if the Israeli Army is targeting Northern Gaza again what does this mean for the operation in the South around rafar well all we can say at this point is what it means means is that Israel is fighting again with its ground forces in on all fronts in the Gaza Strip and we have seen also heavy uh air bombardment across the Gaza Strip now in the north uh Israeli troops were sent in again to places like jabalia jabala refugee camp zun which is in the western part in the eastern part of uh Gaza and also other parts in the northern Gaza Strip now Israel withdrew from that area uh some months ago but intense fighting has now been reported there also reports from ambulances not being able to go into certain areas now the internal messaging here is that this was plan uh part of the plan all along that the Army withdrew but then also is able to go in whenever uh they need to go in but there's also a discussion and criticism here saying that this is also a problem because there is no plan for the day after and that Hamas is able as the Israeli Army said to regroup uh in such areas but we've just seen the tramatic scenes in the report what's happening in the south of Gaza but also of course there have been people they remained in the in the northern uh part of Gaza and those people as well they have been told to uh to relocate to evacuate they're forced to go to some other places to Western uh uh parts of the northern Gaza Strip and of course this is Northern Gaza where in the past month we've been talking about not enough Aid and goods have been coming in so the situation uh is of course also extremely difficult for people there now Gaza has been left without functioning government does Israel have any clear plan for the territory when the war is over there has been no real official plan that has been publicly at least shared there have been some strategy papers some announcement made by by politicians we know more about what uh the Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu doesn't want uh to see in Gaza he said that the Palestinian Authority that's the entity that is uh governing uh uh parts of the occupied West Bank in a very limited rule there uh he doesn't want to see them uh back in Gaza and he's backed up by this by his far right cabinet members so all of this also is of course now another question looking at uh the rafar offensive there we've heard it from the United States as well they have said there needs to be a discussion uh what will the day after look like because you know this not just about um you know all the civilians that there is no credible plan uh to evacuate uh the civilians but what will happen afterwards because uh prime minister Benin Nan said time and time again that he needs to go or the military rather needs to go into rafar to eliminate those four battalions of Hamas and then uh that would enable Israel to achieve a total Victory but apart from that of course there's also a question will the Palestinians be asked what they will want to see uh who is governing uh Gaza at the end of the war thew is Tanya there reporting from Jerusalem thank you very much Tanya meanwhile Sirens have sounded across Israel in somber ceremonies to Mark Memorial Day this year's commemoration was dedicated to the more than 1,00 people killed by Hamas last year as well as the soldiers who've died during the war in Gaza over seven months on Israeli citizens are still struggling to deal with the Fallout of last October's attacks DW's Israel correspondent T Kramer met with two of them for this next report Israeli photographer edes kaganovich shows the faces of those who survived the Hamas terror attack and those who helped others on the day that changed the country I want to commemorate The Bravery and optimism and sense of resilience that I saw from the Israeli citizen it was amazing to see how they actually respond to the horrendous terrorist attack on October 7th there were so many amazing stories of people who you know woke up in the morning and and they decided to Rose up to that moment and to save so many lives one of them is Ramy davidan a farmer from a village in southern Israel he and a group of friends rescued hundreds of mainly young partygoers at the Nova Music Festival Ramy and erz returned to the site of the Rave today other portraits stand here in Memorial to those killed and those abducted to Gaza by Hamas militants Ramy answered a call from a friend and raced here to help despite the risk of Rocket attacks and running into militants words spread quickly as worried parents sent him locations on WhatsApp to get their children to safety after I rescued the first group they circulated my phone number to other groups and this is how the name Ramy and my number spread like a bushire because they had no one else to turn to he became a hero to many Israelis and is often recognized but he says coming back here is not easy nothing will ever be like it was before that day for me Everything Has Changed I have nightmares and flashbacks of the hores I've seen and my body is failing on me I'm not the same Ramy I'm no longer a happy person personal stories like ramies are at the heart of the exhibition but they also highlight a deeper change that took place on October 7th one that many Israelis are still struggling with actually what happened on October 7 is that something very essential broke on that morning and when you grew up in Israel you grew up with a sense that no matter what it's going to happen the IDF and the Israeli government will do everything in their own power to actually to to safeguard the Israeli citizens but on October 7th we realized that the Army wasn't there and the government wasn't there and people were left to their own destiny despite the suffering that people experienced that day edes kaganovich wants the stories behind these photos to resilience and optimism for people to look forward I'm joined in the studio now by our Middle East analyst shaie rosanes shaie good to have you here again now Memorial Day is always a very emotional affair in Israel this was the first time it was being marked since October 7th how was this year different well it's probably the most dire that Israel has seen in the last 50 years um you could feel the atmosphere was heavy uh the ceremonies were you know everything is over clouded by the trauma of October 7th which is still very much alive in Israel's uh National psyche people's memories you know many Israelis are still on October 7th those who have lost their loved ones those who still have hostages kept in Gaza October 7th is still very much alive uh for Israelis and today of all days you know trying to you know Memorial Day tries to maybe close a circle try to move on you know commemorate and maybe talk about the resilience about you know coming from the ashes it's still very hard for most Israelis who still are very much feeling those wounds very deep yeah something we've heard time and time again since October 7th and in this report again is that it was an event that kind of shattered people's trust not only in the security that Israel as you know as a safe haven for for Jews from around the world promised but also in in the IDF and in the government how has that changed well there's no different no doubt Israel is a different country after October 7th and and to the very most fundamental elements of the trust in government and people's you know connection with their with with the with the government with with the entity that has called the state of Israel some has grew stronger in their connection to that and to the ideas leading it some have been pulled apart we need to remember this is still happening you know for Israel is this war is still ongoing you know the world rightfully so focuses on Gaza but there's still a very active uh going also in the North of Israel where there's been shelling on and on and on no end today we've also seen you know Israelis have counted more people wounded there you know they still Israel is still feel under attack and this ongoing um challenges that the Israel and the you know Israeli government and the Israeli IDF are experiencing in protecting Israelis and bringing this war to an end it's becoming very uh you know grinding for Israelis they're starting to slowly realize that this cycle this you know you know that they thought would be quick and done is far from being over and there's more and more Despair and fear for what may come that is slowly crippling in let's look at Prime Minister netanyahu's role in all of this because he was already under intense pressure before October 7th how do Israelis feel about him today you know it's it's it's a mixed bag you know many times in a war you see a lot of people you know come around their leader come together trying to sort of overcome the hardship netan has always been a very divid figure you know and especially after you know the backdrop for for the attack was you know uh the attempt for a a reform in the judicial system who basically tore Israel apart these these uh tears are still there uh even though you know October 7th kind of brought everybody together for a short while the issue of netan himself is still very much on the on the table and we see Nan himself this this Memorial Day and also in the tomorrow will be Independence Day in Israel he's going to be very much uh reserved you know he already announced can canceling his participation in some of the lead events of the day that were usually the the prime day for the prime minister to be taken uh to take part in and and there's this fear now or there's these rumors that he's basically hiding from the future he's afraid of the scrutiny he's afraid of the criticism and he's uh we're seeing a very unusual uh behavior for when it comes to netan it's still too soon to say if that will lead to any political circumstances because we have not seen him take full responsibility for his role and the government's role he's still talking about the need for everybody to be examined and not only him and his role in it so that anger that criticism there still not uh being seen as bringing leading to any changes on the ground in Israel yet October 7th LED then to the incursion into Gaza and that campaign has drawn increasing International criticism are Israelis as divided about what's happening in Gaza as the rest of of the world well unfortunately Israelis are not very much aware of what happens in Gaza the Israeli media shelters Israelis from seeing the the hard unbe terrible uh photos that are coming from Gaza from realizing the magnitude of of of the tragedy and and the and the and the and the killing in Gaza and Israelis are also not feels like feel like the national mood is such they cannot contain that anymore there is a big debate on whether fighting until the erosion of Hamas is achieved which is the goal that the government has set himself is still an achievable goal and is it still worth fighting even in the price of losing the lives of the hostages keep in Gaza this is a very big issue still tearing Israel apart uh but um but the faith of the Palestinians Gaza is not on the agenda for Israelis DW sh rosan is always great to get your insights thank you so much thank you Nicole
