after 8 and a half months of war in Gaza the Israeli government still says it plans to destroy Hamas but there was a remarkable quote from the spokesperson of the Israeli Army in an interview rear Admiral Daniel hagari called into question the Israeli government's goal of eliminating Hamas Hamas is an idea whoever thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong I am not referring to the Alternatives the political Echelon has to decide on that and the Israel Defense Forces will implement but this bu of destroying Hamas is simply throwing sand in the eyes of the if we don't bring something else to Gaza then at the end of the day we will get hus I'm joined now from Washington by Aaron David Miller a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former US Government adviser for Arab Israeli negotiations a very warm welcome how do you interpret those comments from the IDF spokesperson Daniel hagari that that Israel saying it will make Hamas disappear is growing sand in people's eyes I mean on the analytical level I think it reflects what the Israeli intelligence community and Senior IDF officials have bleed for quite some time and it it brings to mind Kissinger's quip in 1969 at the hi of the Vietnam War the Guerilla wins if it does not lose the conventional Army conventional military loses if it does not win and the reality is um yes the Israeli have done Grievous damage uh to hamas's organized military structure its command and control it's uh rocket launch facilities its Laboratories uh but the reality is uh Hamas will maintain a military capacity maybe 10 to 15,000 Fighters and it will endure either as an Insurgency or alternatively given the weakness of the Palestinian national movement specifically the Palestinian Authority it will remain a potent Force able to influence politics in Gaza either through intimidation co-optation or both do you think that is just becoming clear to the IDF at this stage at the start of Israel's invasion of Gaza after the October 7th Terror attacks experts did warn of essentially Hagar's point that Hamas is an idea that can't just be Stamped Out by killing its supporters so why do you think we are hearing this from him now well because I think after almost nine months and it's hard to believe next month will be the ninth month of this war the ID IDF and not the political establishment Mr netan and his right ring government are doing most of the fighting they understand how difficult it is for the IDF to operate they understand that every time there's a strike which kills Palestinians or or worse a mass casualty event that the war loses legitimacy uh particularly in the United States but in in Europe and other places as well and they understand that the only way to if if in fact it's even possible to defeat anos is to create an alternative structure an alternative uh set of governing principles to to facilitate security and prosperity uh which Gaza has lacked under hamas's rule since 2007 and the current government of Israel um simply has no intention of engaging either the Palestinian Authority or creating any sort of hope uh in the form of a political Horizon to to the establishment of two states for example so I I think by and large the IDF is uh not breaking so much with the government but making it quite clear and I think it will become an effective pressure point I suspect in the days and months ahead on the Netanyahu government do you think there is a part of prime minister Netanyahu that also understands this and understands what the IDF spokesperson is saying here there's absolutely no doubt except the Prime Minister now the longest governing prime minister in the history of the state of Israel key domestic constituency isn't the Israeli defense FES it's number one his right-wing Coalition and the maintenance of uh his prime minister because if he no longer is prime minister we should have elections if elections were held in Israel uh today um most probably Mr Netanyahu would not be able to form a government and on trial for bribery fraud and breach of trust in Jerusalem District Court he faes the prospects of a conviction or alternatively a plea plea bargain uh to avoid jail time which would mean the end of his political career so no staying afloat C catering to the right wing uh seems to be his uh his Mo and and the canessa adjourns on July 25th if he makes it to that day ganessa doesn't resume again until two weeks before the American elections and he'd be in a position then as prime minister to make a judgment on who the next president of the United States is going to be and adjust his tactics accordingly I suspect barring some uh event that we can't Divine or foresee um with respect to his political future we're probably talking sometime next year well thank you so much for sharing your insights with us today that is Aaron at David Miller with the Carnegie endowment we very much appreciate your time let's follow up on that and get AC cross to Israel and journalist by League SL joining me from Tel Aviv so more than eight months into this war we've heard Israel has not achieved its goal of eliminating Hamas at this point do most Israelis believe Israel can in fact destroy Hamas well it depends who you ask after all um today a poll showed that only 36% % of all Israelis believe in that absolute victory that benj is talking about but it depends how do you you find victory over Hamas because after all you can destroy hamas's mil military Wing you can also find an alternative for Hamas to govern Gaza or other places but uh the ideology just like Daniel hagari has said is something that you cannot defeat so if the absolute Victory is defeating the ideology then I don't think this is something that is possible it hasn't be possible with Isis hasn't been possible with other um armed groups or terrorist groups in the past so this is something that will um keep in being present in some way or another but it's absolutely um possible to defeat the military Wing at some point and that's something that most Israelis do believe that is possible and if you frame the question as whether the military should continue the operation until reaching Victory or defeating Hamas then I think that most Israel Israelis will agree polls show that as well the even don't agree that we should go for ceasefire in order to free the hostages this is something that is debated in Israel I think the um numbers are shrinking but there is still a majority that believe that defeating Hamas as a military Wing is possible let's talk a little bit more about that and the hostages Israel recently freed four hostages in a big military operation but has cautioned that that it won't be possible to free many other hostages in this way after statements like this from hagari do you think pressure has been growing among a certain sector to reach a ceasefire and get hostages home that way through through negotiation well definitely yes but I don't think that hagari gave anything new because everyone knew that it's not possible to actually free 120 hostages just this way especially if we're talking about 40 or 50 of them are still alive Hamas is absolutely um putting guards beside them and whether when excuse me the military getting closer to them they will shoot them or um disappear in some way or another in the tunnels uh so this is not a new statement andless this is not a new idea and the pressure is coming from now from the families of the hostages that are saying that the only way to see the hostages back is a deal that has been proven to be the safest way to bring the hostages back and I think that many Israelis I wouldn't say a majority believe that it's a price that we can pay a ceasefire in order to reach a point where the hostages will be free this is a huge issue of course for the Israelis we've also seen lots of uh big anti-government protesters demanding a change of government how effective do you think those have been in exerting pressure on the current government to hold new elections well um uh pull just a couple of hours ago from a leading Israeli media said that 54% of Israelis do support these protests do support these protest to support um um investigating what happened in October 7th um something that of course many Israelis do uh support but when it comes to the question of Effectiveness this is another issue because after all Netanyahu has 64 members in his Coalition and I don't think that any of the parties there is willing to sacrifice themselves in order to uh go for a new cycle of election that they will absolutely lose it even if it's not losing it as um a government maybe the government will continue because I don't see I don't see the opposition forming any other government but they will not be itar Bing will not be a minister in any other government than n's government and also for example would get what they are getting from nanyu from anyone else thank you so much for joining us that is journalist by Le sadine in Tel Aviv
