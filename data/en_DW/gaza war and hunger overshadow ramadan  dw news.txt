efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza before the start of Ramadan have stalled war and hunger are overshadowing the eve of the Muslim holy month eight agencies say International efforts to ramp up deliveries of humanitarian supplies by air and now by sea are not effective enough in parts of Gaza Ramadan decorations and food are still available but not at prices most people can afford there are no jobs left no water and no electricity people are selling their belongings to live and Ramadan is very hard on us for most Palestinians food to break ramadan's daily fasting will be hard to come by we rarely eat whether it is Ramadan or not and we always remain hungry in Rafa parents are getting creative to help children celebrate Ramadan Ramadan is very different this year we're not in our homes we're intense but we insisted on putting up decorations and celebrating we just pray that by the end of Ramadan we'll be in our homes others find the fighting between Hamas and Israeli forces too much to bear children reportedly injured in an Israeli bombing are rushed to the hospital in the central Gaza Strip ongoing Israeli air strikes are taking a psychological toll we are tired I swear please feel for us please we want to ceasefire and an end to this what do we have to say we'd thank God for anything without a ceasefire in time for Ramadan and an Israeli ground assault into Rafa still a possibility the suffering of ordinary Palestinians continues without belief in sight our correspondent Felix tams in Jerusalem told me about Israeli concerns about Security in the run up to Ramadan well Security Forces here have been on eye alert over the past uh 24 hours uh Israel has been PR preparing itself for the holy month of Ramadan which will start tomorrow as confirmed by Saudi Arabia in recent hours and I think what everyone's uh the day which everyone is uh worried about is mostly Friday having said that uh given the fact that the Israeli government uh will allow um Arabs and Muslims with a palestin with an Israeli passport to uh go and pray um without any restrictions um the Israeli authorities will hope that it would help at the same time it needs to be said that Hamas and other groups uh have been calling for uh unrest to take place so um I would say that security forces here in Jerusalem are indeed on high alert and they're going to stay like that in the coming days at the very least speaking of Hamas what about the talks between them and uh and Israel on a ceasefire well um we can say that the isra the Israeli intelligence the mosad released a statement yesterday saying that Hamas uh are unwilling to reach an agreement uh when it comes to the to a new hostage deal which would inevitably which would probably uh include a ceasefire uh to a certain extent uh at the same time we have Hamas officials saying that they it's of their interest to reach to reach such a such an agreement uh what's clear to everyone is that such a Swire is very unlikely at this point um and um developments uh are highly unlikely until the beginning of Ramadan tomorrow meanwhile US President Joe Biden has criticized Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu again what's Biden saying and how's it going down with the Israelis well the rhetoric when it comes to the Biden Administration has been um intensifying when it comes to their critique not necessarily of Israel as such but of Netanyahu on a personal level we had um President Biden saying that uh netan is hurting Israel more than helping it we had vice president Harris saying um that there needs to be a distinction between the Israeli government and the Israeli public um just in the past hour we've seen a response from netan saying that the the Israeli public is behind his policies um but at the same time you cannot ignore the fact that the rhetoric when it comes to the US Administration has been going a certain way and I think everyone in Israel is expecting it um to follow this line in the coming days at the very least okay uh we'll have to leave it there Felix tamet thank you for that from
