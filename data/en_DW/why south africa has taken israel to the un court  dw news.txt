the international court of justice in the Haag has begun hearing accusations of genocide brought against Israel by South Africa and the case could take years but today South Africa has been asking the court to order Israel to immediately halt its military operations in Gaza the hearings this week will focus on that request for emergency measures to be imposed much sooner South Africa has long supported the Palestinians linking their struggle to its own history of fighting a parthe Israel for its part has strongly denied the claims are calling the accusations baseless Israel says it is doing all it can to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza as it responds to hamas's terrorist attack last October but South Africa alleges not only is this untrue but that Israel's campaign is targeting Palestinians with the aim of wiping them out as a people in its more than 80 page filing to the world Court in the ha South Africa argues acts and omissions by Israel are genocidal in character as they are committed with the requisite specific intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as part of the broader Palestinian national racial and ethnical group it goes on to say this constitutes a breach by Israel of its obligations under the genocide convention a document drawn up in 1948 in the aftermath of the Holocaust which both Israel and South Africa have signed Israel though says it has a right to self-defense after the bloodiest attack in its history its officials have reacted with anger to South Africa's filing pointing out that Hamas continues to call for the destruction of the Jewish State Israel says it will fight back in the court the state of Israel will appear before the international court of justice at the hag to dispel South Africa's absurd blood liel how tragic that the rainbow nation that Prides itself on fighting racism will be fighting pro bono for anti-jewish racists Palestinians in Gaza and the rest of the world would be looking closely at the Court's response to South Africa's request a provisional ruling could come within weeks but any final judgment is expected to take years and I'd like to get into the details with Kathleen Powell associate professor of law at the University of Cape Town as she's an expert on International organizations and the interface between law and politics in the international Arena perfect person to speak to about this uh now I understand that you have been following proceedings in the ha today do you think that South Africa has a convincing case here good afternoon yes I have been following the proceedings and I also read the 84-page application that South Africa sent in in advance and I think it makes an extremely strong case um and certainly the legal argument this morning was superb uh each member of a very impressive uh legal team dealt with each aspect that had to be proven before South Africa can get provisional measures indicated against Israel and in fact it's also asked for some original measures against itself to stop the military Onslaught in Gaza to preserve evidence and to ensure that uh gazin are given the ability to survive uh in that food water electricity gets restored and that medical help and humanitarian Aid is available let's speak a little bit more first than about these provisional measures I understand the icj is expected to decide within weeks uh including whether there will be an emergency suspension of of Israel's campaign in Gaza what will the court be basing its decision on well there four things that the applicant states of South Africa has to prove in order to get provisional measures one is that the court has a primia case of jurisdiction so not whether it has jurisdiction per se that is a decision that gets taken later on when the merits of the case get get considered but just that there's a plausible case it's been made for jurisdiction that's quite easy in this case because both South Africa and Israel are parties to the genocide convention which gives the icj jurisdiction if there are disputes about whether a state is responsible for genocide so that's quite easy um then South Africa has to show that it has a right to bring the case and it's done this on the basis that it's a party to the genocide convention and that it has an obligation under the genocide convention to prevent genocide not just not to commit it and it relies there on the case of Gambia versus Myanmar where the icj allowed an African state to bring a genocide case against a state on another continent So that's its its second hurdle that it had had to meet then it had to show that it the subject matter of its complaint relates to the genocide convention and it did this by giving a brief overview of the facts both the genocidal acts that it's complaining of so the destruction of most of Gaza um and the displacement of 85% of its population and then a separate section on genocidal intent where it quoted members of the Israeli government members of the CET people connected to the military making statements such as wipe guysa off the map um if you have an Arab neighbor go shoot him now so then there was a section showing that I just want to jump in there because that does speak to the wider case doesn't it this these allegations of genocidal intent you said they they're going to be looking at statements from Israeli politicians uh how else will they try to make their case here I think that uh the case is going to turn on genocidal intent because uh Israel has already argued that it's acting in self-defense and you mentioned that in your introduction to to this discussion um and although that is a difficult call to make given how disproportionate the damage has been in Gaza um that has been the strongest case that Israel has made so far but if and this is what one of the council pointed out this morning in the in the case before the hake if the intention behind all the destruction is not to defend Israel but to destroy a people in whole or in part then you've got genocide so I think a lot of the um the case is going to Center on genocidal intent that's all you need for genocide you need the acts and you need the intention but the intention is very specific uh and bear in mind that the intentions got to be to destroy a group in whole or in part and that group's got to be defined as National racial ethnical or religious and go I'm sorry to jump in because we're just running out of time but I'm curious if you could before uh before we move on um how would you rate their chances of success in proving this I think they're very good at getting provisional measures uh and the arguments this morning made clear that the court has granted provisional measures when the Prejudice that the that was threatened was being threatened the harm to human beings was a lot less than what we're dealing with now so I was explaining earlier on what the requirements for provisional measures are the fourth one is Prejudice and it's clear from the president from what the icj has done in the past that it's prepared to issue provisional measures when there's a risk of prejudice and in this particular case you've got the Prejudice already happening and ongoing so I think the chances are good whatever arguments Israel brings tomorrow U may have a a bearing on the merits of the case which gets considered later but on whether you're going to have provisional measures or not I I think it's unlikely that Israel can prevent them well thank you so much for sharing your insights with us I'm afraid that's all we have time for for now that's Kathleen Powell associate professor of law at the University of Cape Town and let's get the view from Israel with DW's correspondent Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem Rebecca tell us more about Israel's reaction to South Africa's claims at the un's top court today well Israel is obviously going to get its day in court tomorrow Claire as we've been hearing to defend uh the allegations put against it and these are allegations that Israel vehemently denies and have vehemently denied uh all across the board the whole way along Israel insists that it's acting uh in self-defense against what it says a genocidal acts by Hamas carried out on October 7 uh and in the following days it insists it maintains that it is doing everything uh that it can to prevent civilian casualties and in fact blames Hamas for the high death toll saying that the the group are using uh you know civilians as human shield now just before South Africa took the stand we heard from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu he took to X formerly Twitter to basically reiterate uh those claims saying that you know Israel has no desire to to reoccupy Gaza that it it has been acting within international law uh he didn't mention the icj ruling directly but it was a very significantly timed statement in the aftermath we haven't heard any specific statements from Israel but we know that Israel are basically called have called South Africa criminally complicit with Hamas and they're saying that they're basically the legal arm of Hamas so you know some very statements coming from Israel very clear what their point of view is there is now it's going to be very interesting to hear just what the defense has to say uh tomorrow given the as you just heard there the very strong case put forward by South Africa and looking even a little bit further ahead I mean we've heard that South Africa is asking the court to impose these binding preliminary orders on Israel including a halt to its operations in Gaza How likely do you think is is would be to abide by the icj's decision that's really really difficult to predict CLA I mean iccj rulings are legally binding but they're very very difficult to enforce they can be ignored and we saw that with Russia uh in the case in 2022 when it was the ruling the icj ruling was for Russia to cease hostilities in Ukraine now uh that ruling and the fact that Russia ignored it showed some of the weaknesses of the icj and it's for that reason that some experts are saying that the icj may this time not take it to that length it may not go all the way calling for a full cessation of hostilities that it may give a more nuanced approach or a more nuanced ruling calling for more Aid to be led into Gaza for Israel to hold up its obligations and that kind of thing now if that's the ruling we may well see Israel comply by it but if the ruling is that that Israel has to completely cease hostilities you know it's very likely that Israel could ignore that but it's just too soon to say Rebecca thank you so much for that update that's Rebecca Ritter for us in Jerusalem and Germany's economy Minister and vice Chancellor Robert HCK is on a trip to Israel where he hit back against the genocide charges that have been brought by South Africa my personal and political opinion is that one can criticize the Israeli military for using harsh measures in the Gaza Strip however that does not constitute genocide those who would commit genocide or desire to do so if given the opportunity are Hamas the annihilation of the state of Israel is on their agenda so we can understand the slogan from The River To The Sea as not meaning that Jews should leave Israel by boat but as an Extinction fantasy accusing Israel of genocide is a complete Distortion of victims and perpetrators in my you and it is just wrong and Germany's economy Minister and vice Chancellor Robert habc is on a trip to Israel where he hit back against the genocide charges that have been brought by South Gaza Strip however that does not constitute victims and perpetrators in my view and
