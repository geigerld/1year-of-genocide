00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:09.090
As the world’s attention is set on the Israel-Hamas
war in Gaza, violence has been escalating

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.700
in the occupied West Bank, with Israeli forces
carrying out raids – and a spike in settler

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.250
attacks against Palestinians.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.630
Even before the October 7 terror attacks by
Hamas militants, existing tensions meant 2023

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.539
was already set to be the deadliest year on
record for Palestinians in the West Bank.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.380
Since the attack, things have escalated sharply.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.210
Israeli forces have been conducting a widespread
security crackdown…

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.430
Bolstering forces in the area and carrying
out raids and operations across the West Bank.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.280
So far, they say they’ve arrested at least
800 people - 500 of whom, they say, are affiliated

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.280
with Hamas.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.300
They’ve also carried out two airstrikes
in the last week, on what they say were Hamas

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.020
and other militant group targets.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.460
Israeli settler violence is on the rise too.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.030
That means Israelis who live in settlements
inside the occupied territory - considered

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.300
illegal under international law – are carrying
out attacks on the Palestinians there – entering

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.380
villages and expelling, and even killing,
Palestinian civilians.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.689
According to UN figures, attacks have more
than doubled since the Hamas terror attacks

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.890
– with settlers vowing revenge.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.610
Eyewitnesses say in some of the cases the
settlers have been wearing military style

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.939
uniforms or that the military were even present
during the attacks.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.630
So far, the UN says more than 90 Palestinians
have been killed in the West Bank since October

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.630
7.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.740
Many Palestinians I have spoken to say they’re
too scared to move around, for fear of being

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.740
targeted.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.219
The political situation is increasingly fragile
too.

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:49.540
Protests have been erupting all over the West
Bank – and not just in solidarity with Gazans.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.930
People here are also angry at their leaders.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.390
Hamas doesn’t control the West Bank, the
Palestinian Authority does.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.430
Many protesters have been openly calling its
leader President Mahmoud Abbas to step down.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.299
And support for Hamas appears to be growing.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.500
One protest I went to in Ramallah – the
West Bank’s biggest city and a stronghold

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.319
of support for the Palestinian Authority – people
flew Hamas flags and openly chanted support

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.440
for its wing commander Mohammed Deif, a man
at the top of Israel’s hit list.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.020
Hamas has called on its supporters in the
West Bank to get involved in fighting Israel.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.690
So far we have not seen that happening.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.040
One of the many questions being asked here
is not JUST what Gaza will look like after

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.879
all of this,
