I'm B pan welcome we start in the gazan city of KH yunes where authorities say a school Sheltering children has been damaged after an Israeli air strike video obtained by the Reuters news agency shows the moment of impact sending sparks flying and clouds of smoke belowing into the night sky Witnesses say the blast shuttered windows and tore through walls in the neighborhood in the neighboring building a school run by the UN Refugee agency unra currently housing displaced people a resident said people Sheltering there had received a call moments earlier warning them of the strike giving them just enough time to get to safety there are no reports of casualties and after 8 and a half months of war in Gaza Israel still says it plans to destroy Hamas but there was a remarkable quote from the spokesman of the Israeli Army in an interview Admiral Daniel hagari told Israel's Channel 13 broadcaster and I quote to say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes if we don't provide an alternative in the end we will be left with Hamas he further said Hamas is an ideology we cannot eliminate an ideology unquote now Hamas is classified as a terrorist group by many Western countries in addition to its military wing it has governed Gaza since 2007 and is a political Force as well let's take a look at what's left of the group and the danger it could still pose to Israel Hamas Fighters firing rockets at Israel from Southern Lebanon where it cooperates with other militant groups Air Aid alarms are frequent in Tel Aviv well within those Rockets range this is something Israel's military wanted to stop with its war in Gaza yet it's still happening there are no precise independently verified figures available about hamas's strength in numbers of Fighters or its stocks of weapons Israel estimates that Hamas had more than 30,000 Fighters at the time of its Terror attacks on October 7th last year and that between 12 and 14,000 have been killed in fighting since then however Hamas may be able to fill its ranks with new recruits quickly Israel has also seized stores of Weaponry including Rock rocket launchers missiles and guns an Israeli military analyst told DW earlier this year that 70 to 80% of hamas's Arsenal had been captured or destroyed but about half of hamas's tunnels are estimated to still be intact allowing the group to hide regroup and potentially rearm itself through its smuggling Network then there's the group's leadership which has largely survived Yaya sinir the group's leader in Gaza still runs operations from hiding and the group's political leader ismaa is in Qatar the leader of the military Wing Muhammad da is thought to be hiding in Gaza as well Israel did Kill Dave's Deputy Marwan Isa but that is the closest it's come to taking out the senior leadership as Israel reckons with a war that could go on for months to come pressure for a ceasefire is growing otherwise its forces may be overstretched and less able to react to other threats [Music] let's get more on from Middle East expert Daniel Gall who joins me now from Tokyo Daniel good to see you Israeli military spokesman Daniel hagari says and I quote to say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes unquote what has the Israeli military been doing in Gaza if not trying to make Hamas disappear yeah um the problem is that sometimes numbers become meaningless when there's no political strategy and I think what Daniel hagari and also uh Chief of Staff her Levi wanted to say and they've been trading let's say uh unfriendly words even with the Netanyahu government for a few days now is if there's no political strategy the military cannot be expected to achieve political goals and the future of of of the administration of the Gaza Strip is a political not a military issue Hamas has a military Wing but uh the problem is that Israeli forces upon uh like command of uh of their political leadership targeted everyone who was affiliated with Hamas um and that could that pertains also to people who do policing and to uphold Administration in a certain degree of public order so if you destroy all of this then you can say of course you have killed many Hamas people and some estimates like let's say optimistic cynically said estimates of the Israeli armed forces that they had killed up to 15,000 Hamas members that they had killed like half of the B commanders of the 24 battalions but nevertheless there is still uh there is still an infrastructure in place and there's still a lot of people affiliated with Hamas so if you don't have a political strategy how to deal with this issue other than military then of course this is doomed to fail and then what we see is that political leadership tends to accuse the generals of weak performance um I think the Israeli forces are not to be blamed for that at least the IDF was working on the government's orders are you saying that the government and the IDF are not on the same page anymore well there are clear signs for this you can you can see that in the past you know Israel has a democratic system and a democratic Army in a sense so though the armed forces have been heavily infiltrated and undermined by nonsecular right-wing extremist uh forces and that also of course has an impact on the General on the leadership in the Army the Army tries to tries to still you know keep some reason here in the place and though the Army has been accused I think rightfully in part of not exerting the the the the the the necessary control of also allowing war crimes to happen um the Army tried to achieve a military goal which is the destruction of Hamas now we even see that the Army is no longer uh pursuing the goal of liberating the hostages at least that might be the task of a few Special Forces of the Border Police uh but not uh the the the core uh let's say Target of the Army operation in the south of the Gaza Strip and I see I see a lot of disagreement between the netan government and the Army but the only problem is netan is is is in this situation willing to accuse everyone of treason to attack everyone around him even those that have been serving him uh quite committedly Daniel hagari was also talking about providing an alternative to Hamas uh in the end is this the military also saying that this is something that the government is ignoring well it seems so um let's remember that uh Minister of Defense yav galand said that weeks ago and he cannot be accused of being you know ill loyal to the government he was like uh hardcore he was really like um like like adamant when it comes to the destruction of Hamas but he told netan and he said it publicly you have to come up with a plan and you have to probably also reach out to the Arab states if you want to settle this issue and you have to do it while the war is ongoing it doesn't make sense to hope for an end of the war and then deal with the issue uh you had um opposition politician Benny guns who left uh the war cabinet a few days ago and ultimately the war cabinet was resolved upon an ultimatum that had expired that he had said to Netanyahu asking him come up with a political plan nanyan netan has done nothing of that and of course we hear here and there scenarios and plans uh like trickling down but in fact there is no tangible issue and you cannot expect any Force let alone the Arabs to join and to support you on whatever Endeavor it is to secure the future of the Gaza Strip if you don't have any political scenario for the future of it and then you have members of the government who say we need to resettle the Gaza Strip we need to send uh you know establish settlements in the Gaza Strip and Annex it forever and of course that is not very encouraging to anyone who wants to play a conducive role to peace and security Middle East expert Daniel gak there thanks so much for talking to us today I joined here in the studio by Gil musano he is the CEO of midv that's the Israeli Institute of uh for regional Regional foreign policy uh Gil let me just quote here to say that we are going to make Hamas disappears to throw sand in people's eyes how important is this statement coming from uh one of the Israeli military's uh most important spokes people indeed quite a rare expression of protest coming from the professional level in Israel from the IDF in many ways expressing or reflecting a great frustration by the IDF we are talking about the idea of reaching a certain level of military achievement when it comes to reducing Hamas military capability but with a clear understanding that from now now on the real operation of defeating Hamas is more of a political diplomatic Mission than a a military Mission Al together but many many people have said that from the beginning you cannot completely destroy Hamas and yet the Israeli government and also the military has said we will destroy Hamas doesn't all this come a bit late well I think that right now when we speaking about defeating Hamas we need to speak specifically about the goal of H basically removing Hamas as a governing unit in Gaza on the day after and therefore the major discussion is about an alternative creating alternative to Hamas and this is a political discussion that mainly refer to the return of the PA now the Israeli government because of its own political limitation has been unable or unwilling to even discuss the option Netanyahu was talking about not replacing hastan with fatan with the movement that abuan is leading at the moment but when we speak about defeating Kamas there's also a very uni unique opportunity at the moment because it's also about defeating the purposes of the 7th of October Massacre by Hamas and that was mainly about stopping Israeli Saudi normalization so the chance is there right now but again with a political Paralysis on the Israeli the current Israeli government hands you cannot really move to the second to the next phase and I think that's mainly the goal of the agari statement to actually approach the Israeli public in order to create pressure on the political leadership to create any kind of a political directive for the day after so what has then the this offensive in Gaza this war in Gaza what has it achieved well currently I think that you can you can discuss the reduction of Kamas military cap capabilities I think the last asset military from a military point of view was to take over the Philadelphia line the specific Buffa Zone separating Egypt and the Gaza strep the main site of smuggling of weapons uh so the military whatever the military could actually achieve uh to reduce the the the military force of Hamas was achieved but the military action has somewhat exhausted itself and we also have to relate to the fact that everything that happens in Gaza right now connects to the major threat at the moment or in the north of a war between healah and between Israel now Hamas Hamas is more than just militants uh with guns um it also was the whole Civic administration of the Gaza Strip uh what's going to happen to that well I think there's a discussion today about differentiating or somewhat learning some lessons from the US experience in Iraq in other places and providing some kind of an amnesty to the civil servants understanding that we are talking about governing units and separating the so-called suicidal wing of sinir from the civil servant servant and so on but all of it is part of a reconstruction process that could only be initiated if it is connected to a broader political initiative we spoke about who's going to govern Hamas in the day govern Gaza in the day after instead of Hamas we are talking about a multinational Force the involvement of regional actors they won't come and unless it's with Palestinian invitation that's what we are hearing for them so it's all in the end this entire crucial reconstruction phase connects with the broader political initiative now you have called Israel's handling of the Palestinian issue a strategic asset for Iran can you elaborate on that oh indeed I think that you know we we always used to speak especially in Israel about which threat is more severe for Israel future the Palestinian or the Iranian and we were all wrong they are interconnected when we speak about areas of chaos if we are not moving forward reconstruction in Gaza the great starvation and destruction that we see today in Gaza the Iranians has excelled themselves quote unquote in entering chaos in Yemen in Syria in the civil war in Iraq and Gaza in this situation can provide them with the best conditions unless we create something else and we also relate to the offer made by President Biden to build to build an alliance of moderates mainly to contain Iranian growing a regional influence that can only work again if we create some kind of a common ground with the Palestinian issue so you see how those two topics are intertwined and the current paralysis by the Israel government serves the Iranian strategic goals Al together thank you very much gilana there of the Israeli Institute for regional foreign policies thank you for sharing your Insight and I'm now joined by Andreas kek from the school of security studies at King's College London now what's your assessment of the state of Hamas military structures at this point in the Israeli campaign well I mean to to be honest it's kind of meaningless to discuss how many fighters have been killed how many tunnels are still intact because as the idea spokesperson rightly said this is an idea it's a movement and that IDE idea of armed resistance has been fueled by the war so the war in many ways has been counterproductive the estimates that the US intelligence has published suggests that maybe around a third of the tunnels were destroyed but we're looking at 500 km of tunnels a third of them being destroyed means it's not really strategically viable in terms of making a difference on the ground and in terms of estimates of how many fighters were killed we're looking at uh 30% 35% of Hamas Fighters but obviously at the same time we've seen Hamas being able to restock most of its fighting battalions with new recruits and hence here is where the problem comes in I think Israel has fundamentally misunderstood the source of power for Hamas which is the idea of armed resistance and while Israel has failed to provide a strategic alternative to Hamas politically um it has created a thrust and a kind of a polar attraction to the movement and to the idea of armed resistance because the desperation of people particular in Gaza who've been hit you know entire generations of people have been annihilated half of infrastructure has been destroyed in Gaza that has fueled the kind of Attraction of the idea of armed resistance because people have no alternative and if before the 7th of October Israel had any sort of idea or any Prospect of potentially uh working with Palestinians that Prospect has now disappeared Palestinians will now when left with a choice between Israel and Hamas will site with the Hamas not because they like it but because Israel is the worst of two choices now how unified is Hamas are there differences between the leadership in Gaza and leaders in Exel for example oh absolutely uh so we've seen that from the beginning the leaders in particular in Katan and also in Egypt um those and or in Lebanon have very little in terms of popular support on the ground because they've been out of the picture for many years they have been living quite comfortably while the leadership on the ground particular D and sinir have been embedded more or less within the population on the ground even if they're underground um but for the most part they have actually provided a a degree of attraction to to people in in in Gaza in a way that people in Exile have not and that's kind of the difficulty so uh negotiating with Hamas in qat for example doesn't necessarily mean that what is agreed will be one toone uh translated to what's going on on the ground because there's been disruption within the movement um as a whole now you've touched upon this but how much support does Hamas really have among the civilian population in uh in Gaza and also in the West Bank so here again very difficult to have opinion polls in times of War uh what we do see is a slightly different picture between the West Bank and and Gaza obviously people in Gaza are suffering um extremely I mean this is one of the worst if not the worst humanarian situation anywhere in the world um and while it is being caused by Israeli bombs and Israeli destruction there are a lot of people in Gaza who are saying the root cause of that at least uh is the 7th of October for now um and uh as such there's a lot of people in Gaza who are blaming Hamas on the other side you have people in the West Bank who are not suffering that much at the moment at least from Israeli occupation and they feel the only way to fight back is to support Hamas in uh in in EN countering what they see as Israel aggression and in in Gaza the pictures again it's it's slightly different so I would say that Hamas is losing some support but again it's a people in Palestine are left with a choice between a pest and Kera between Israel and Hamas and since Israel hasn't offered a viable solution out of desperation and that would have been an opportunity here an alternative to Hamas people will sight with Hamas because they have no other choice now if the total defeat of Hamas is not possibly uh not possible what is the alternative for the IDF then well the IDF is in a difficult situation and we're seeing increasing ruptures here between the IDF leadership and the political leadership in Jerusalem um this right-wing government of bib Netanyahu is not pursuing a viable political strategy it's relying entirely on the military and the IDF is now coming out more and more saying saying there is no military solution to the problem we need a strategic Pathway to self-governance to provide Palestinians with a viable solution to self-governance not just in the West Bank but also in Gaza and the pal and and the Israeli government is doing everything to undermine this by you know empowering settlers by empowering Now new governance structures Israeli government structures in the West Bank that further undermine the Palestinian Authority so what needs to happen is Israel needs to think about a strategic solution it needs to attack the root cause of the conflict which is occupation which is the the lack of a viable solution and Pathway to a two-state solution um and that has to fundamentally Israel has to fundamentally change its its approach to that both means both ways and also its ends I don't see that happening because netan in particular and his right-wing government have no real interest to provide Palestinians with any incentive they want to pursue a politic of uh a policy of Iron Fist and that is going to fail Andreas Creek there King's College London thank you very much
