Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will not withdraw its troops from the border between Southern Gaza and Egypt known as the Philadelphia Corridor he said those troops would remain until there is a guarantee the corridor could never be used as a smuggling route by Hamas which was behind the October 7th Terror attacks Netanyahu stressed that controlling the corridor was a condition for a permanent ceasefire he said that Israel will not get it hostages back if it relieves pressure on Hamas these are the terrorists that Iran implanted next to our border as elsewhere and we're committed to deeding them to extricating this evil from our midst I want to talk to you today about some of the things that we must do to achieve that goal including the questions of the Philadelphia order for more let's get across to journalist bik sadine in Tel Aviv I'd like to start by asking first a little bit about why we saw this conference from Netanyahu in the first place do you think it is a sign that he feels Under Pressure to justify his government's approach well he definitely Under Pressure both from inside and from outside that the whole issue about the Philadelphia cdor is taking a lot of attention more than it should be actually and now everybody is thinking that the Prime Minister he is the only one that is insisting with the Philadelphia Corridor and it's the only obstacle to reaching a deal which is not actually and he was asked about that and he explained about that so he needs to explain why Israel needs to stay in the Philadelphia Corridor he basically gave the same speech or the same press conference that that he gave a couple of days ago to the Israeli media now he gives it to the international media in order to explain the importance of the Philadelphia Corridor he of course repeated his apology to the families of the hostages and also said that Israel cannot after such an incident decide to um give more concessions because that will be assign for Hamas to uh actually kill more hostages in order to gain more concessions and he asked the International Community right now to put pressure on Hamas and not on Israel actually to reach a deal because Israel as he says already accepted the deal that President Biden proposed in May the uh fixed deal in August and he repeated his um commitment to bringing back the hostages as soon as possible okay so something very much tailored toward an international audience here Netanyahu also said in this in this conference that until Israel gets a guarantee that the Border area uh between Southern Gaz and Egypt that it can't be used to support hamasa Israel will not withdraw its troops what do you think an acceptable guarantee would look like for Israel well if I want to repeat what Netanyahu said he said that we don't want people to just say that we will actually control that area and prevent Hamas from smuggling weapons because we've heard that before we've heard that from the Egyptians before there has been an international um um mission to the Philadelphia cdor years ago and and now he says that no one has proved that his um policies are effective or his presence is effective and we need to be there basically I would say that Netanyahu knows what he is saying that in the second phase of the deal when Israel asks for someone to take care of the Philadelphia Corridor he basically says that um he knows that no one is standing in line no country is standing in line to go and put its troops in the Philadelphia Corridor and take that mission on itself in other words he means that we will stay in the Philadelphia Corridor in the near future um and only Israel can actually guarantee that that Hamas doesn't smuggle weapons and doesn't rehabilitate itself through that Corridor well thank you very much for speaking with us that is journalist bik sedine thank you
