meanwhile Pro Palestinian demonstrators have staged a protest outside Chicago's United Center on the last night of the Democratic National Convention demonstrators including some party delegates call for a pro Palestinian representative to be allowed to address the convention they say convention organizers rejected their earlier request the demonstrators have been calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and for an arms embargo on [Music] Israel DW reporter Stefan Simons is at the demonstrations outside of the convention cter in Chicago stepan welcome tell us more about the demands of the protesters well the demand is that the US will immediately stop supporting Israel in its war effort in Gaza meaning no more ammunition more more uh guns deliveries money uh for the IDF the Israeli Defense Forces and for Israel in that sense however those protesters here they feel not hurt by the Democratic National Convention and it's just about a half a mile away from here they still feel that there are worlds between what they stand for what they want and what's actually happened in the United Center where the Democratic National Convention is happening however this last uh protest here is um the grand finale for the protesters for the organizations here 250 plus organizations combined in one Coalition they of course not all here but they're hoping for a uh massive show of people yesterday there was a protest the day before there was one and on the first day of the convention was one it was all about let's say from a th000 2,000 people uh now they want to go to 5 to 10,000 people is this going to happen we will see Stephan we know that over the past four days Democrats have been trying to send out a message of unity they've been trying to show that there is incredible support for kamla Harris how dangerous could this descent in in the party the issue of Israel how dangerous could it be in the coming months of this campaign well the Israel Gaza war is a big issue it's it's a foreign policy issue yes and this convention here is focusing on domestic issues predom predominantly but it is a problem for the Biden Administration who is working at that is working on on a ceasefire it is therefore a problem for Cala Harris it is a problem because those people here even if it's just a few thousand represent a much larger group of people who are not inclined to vote for Joe Biden then and Camala Harris now why because they think and they say uh the Harris campaign is not taking them serious at all and doesn't hear them so CA Harris and the campaign has to prove that they're actually hurt number one number two the problem is that as long as substantially nothing happens in the view of those people they will not make their check mark on the ballot pole for Camala Harris and that can be a problem because everybody every expert every pollster tells you it's going to be a nailbiter at the polls in November it's about a few th000 maybe 100,000 votes maybe less even who can decide which can decide this race those people are going to be critical for that Stefan Simons covering those protests outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago thank you inform
