we start in Gaza where more than a million people are facing what's being described by the UN as an impossibility the Israeli military has given them just 24 hours to flee their homes As It prepares for an expected ground Invasion hamash which Hamas which controls the territory has told residents to ignore the warning but many people have already decided it's time to go dawn breaks in Gaza to a wave of aerial bombardments a barrage of explosions destroying buildings in the region and today the attacks came along with an official warning as the Israeli military continued amassing tanks and troops near the gazen border ahead of an expected ground Invasion it called for the some 1.1 million people located in Gaza City to relocate to the South within 24 hours this involves a journey across the W Gaza Wetlands the river dividing the territories north and south and so the Exodus begins gazan civilians and un staff alike started moving as best they could out of Harm's Way today we do not know where to go there is no safe place we do not know where our children are and we do not know what to do we have no food or water I'm appealing to the United Nations in front of the UN building where do we go where do we go the UN said moving so many people in such a short period of time within one of the world's most densely packed areas would be impossible quote without devastating humanitarian consequences but the clock ticks on the World Health Organization called for humanitarian access to Gaza to be resumed it warns the Israel's total blockade and continual bomb bombardment pushed the health system to Breaking Point lacking essential supplies and electricity and we need a corridor to provide medical services and and so on that's what I would I would ask ask for one is to protect civilians and second to provide them with the support uh they need be it food Medical Services supplies Israel continues to insist that it is doing everything it can to minimize civilian suffering but for the people of Gaza time is running out as well as safe places to go well leftenant Colonel Peter lner speaks for the Israeli Defense Forces welcome to DW why have you told more than a million people in Gaza to leave well over the last couple of days you've been asking us uh what should Palestinians do in order to safeguard themselves and what we announced today is actually a humanitarian gesture so that people move from H's way you know we are in now day seven of the aftermath of the brutal Massacre of Israelis in their homes uh just across the border in southern Israel and in that reality what we did immediately uh after the attack was Evacuate the people from their houses we took people and evacuated them throughout the country and what we did this morning is announced to people who want to take um care of their lives what they want to take care of their families indeed this is a place you need to move because we are increasing our activities against Hamas this terrorist organization cannot be permitted to use the Gaza Strip as a stronghold and a staging ground for attacks against Israel so are Israeli troops now are preparing to move into Gaza so the IDF has over the last few days recruited some 300,000 Reserve uh soldiers and officers um for all of our Arenas because we realize that there is a lot of tension across the ground so yes there is a lot of forces now um St in staging grounds around the Gaza Strip potentially preparing if the decision and the instructions comes from the government to mobilize on the ground operation in order to defeat and Destroy Hamas from ever being able to attack us again what does that look like you say uh the purpose will be to defeat and destroy Hamas what will success in that endeavor look like well the success primarily will be that this terrorist organization cannot govern the Gaza Strip as a staging ground for terrorism um that is why we are targeting their institutions their leadership their terrorist infrastructure everything that they have utilized in order to build this terrorist compound from in the Gaza Strip which is where they came from last Saturday you know we've been focused very much on the over the last 48 hours on the NBA Force which is the Commando unit of Hamas these are people that have gone through highly milit High military training you specializing in close combat specializing in explosive these are the people that actually breached the fence and butchered people in their kitchens these are the people we are after I think it's really important the people of Gaza are not the enemies of Israel Hamas this terrorist organization are the enemy of Israel how do you defeat and Destroy at Hamas at in Gaza while preserving the lives of gazans because what it sounds like and I'm happy for you to to uh tell me I've got the wrong end of the stick what it sounds like is that Israel is about to level at Northern Gaza well Phil you asked me what is the purpose of evacuating people and that's exactly what we're trying to do is tell people Safeguard your lives move from areas where there could be potential an increase in in hostilities and in in and in our operations Hamas has a responsibility to the people of Gaza Unfortunately they have failed them miserably in by putting them in direct threat but we know what they do because you know another strike over the last couple of days that we've conducted is against their drone capabilities you know how they Place their drones they Place attack drones which are effectively suicide drones to swarm locations hous military compounds and they plac them on the roofs of of houses we've distributed and we're happy to share it of course to DW that you show where they're putting these houses where the where they're putting these drones on the houses of people they have no regard for people the people living in those houses they put them on the on those houses making them a Target sacrificing the people so when we are telling people go to the South it's in order so that we can operate against Hamas who are the enemy of Israel but they're also the enemy of the people of Gaza understood we have one of the world's most densely populated areas this narrow strip of land it's already suffering a humanitarian crisis now it is being uh bombed uh by Israeli troops and you're telling more or less half of the population to move from there to an already populated area an already uh dramatically populated area because no one can leave leave the territory so we we know that Hamas terrorists killed more than 1200 Israeli uh civilians in this brutal attack on Saturday does that legitimate the state of Israel now ordering an attack on one of the most densely populated areas on Earth and inflicting even greater suffering so are you suggesting that we don't protect our civilians because they're hiding behind theirs well this is a ridiculous question know let me just interrupt you there because I'm not suggesting anything I'm not suggesting anything what I'm asking you to do is to provide the for our listeners and and for me as well just to explain what is the legitimation for doing this because it does sound like you are inflicting um what the UN has described as collective punishment on garans so my question was does what Hamas did legitimate the state of Israel acting in this way and if you like a yes or a no will do um I don't like and what I'm trying to explain is when Hamas turns the people of Gaza as hostages to their terrorist activities by putting rockets in their schoolyards by putting drones on their roofs by tunneling between beneath their mosques and putting everybody at risk so I'd say yes when we tell people to move to the South it's we are taking care of the people of Gaza more than more than Hamas so I would say yes we have now the responsibility to restore Safety and Security to the people of Israel who were butchered in their bedrooms and that is something that we will not accept ever again Hamas cannot rule Gaza and expect to come out and and for for Israel just to turn another page we have that responsibility our military is in charged with the defense of the state of Israel when the Hamas terrorist organization broke down the fence charged in 20 different 20 different locations across into our communities killed butchered abducted and took back over a hundred people into the Gaza Strip they could they they basically said we don't care this is the situation what are they trying to achieve for the people of Gaza our responsibility and our government and our operations and our military operations most importantly are conducted within the laws of un conflict specifically in order to safeguard civilian life and even when there is a risk to to civilian lives so I would say yes we have the right and obligation to operate and to alleviate and remove that threat completely it cannot be happen ever again we won't let that happen and that is why we are embarked on this Mission and and and quite frankly the the the whole line of this Inquisition against the right to self defense you know when you're charging Israel with the responsibility for all of the people of Gaza and not asking Hamas why did they sacrifice the people of Gaza in such a ruthless way that is where we're missing the point the point is this is a terrorist organization that established a terrorist front hold and stronghold within the civilian Arena specifically so that you would ask these questions but they are responsible and they need to be held accountable we will not allow them ever again to threaten the state of Israel okay thank you for joining us leftenant Colonel Peter Lerner of the Israeli Defense Forces thank you Phil I want to bring in the military expert Frank ledridge now he's a senior lecturer in strategic studies at Port Smith University and a former UK Military Intelligence officer he is joining me from Oxford it's good to have you on the program Frank so Israel's now given people in Northern Gaza 24 hours to leave and head south um does that look to you uh as though that ground invasion is now imminent yes I think we can be fairly certain of that Christine the preparations are visible to everybody whilst there may may be an element of surprise to this there's no doubt at all that they're going in I think we can with respect to the orders given by the israelies and the controversies around it perhaps one reference point might be what happened in mosul in the fight fight against a similar terrorist group is where refugees were allowed to leave they were vetted to some extent but look that's that's a separate issue they answer to your question is yes I think they'll be they'll be going in at some point uh in the next few days they may not do uh sort of fullon full panoply uh assault may it may indeed form a sort of Patchwork of assaults but we'll see that's speculation Frank as you're speaking we're actually showing live images um and and and we can see what looks to be tanks over there um as you say they're they're likely going in so what does that look like then what kind of warfare can we expect you when those Israeli troops enter Gaza right again look back uh both sides will have learned from this the operations against is in Iraq and Syria is what it's going to look like except I think what you have here is Hamas is far better prepared better armed equally motivated as as as then Hamas has uh has in terms of their Arsenal has drones it will have prepared tunnels fortifications strong points killing zones and all the rest and all that will be fully cognant the Israelis will be cognizant of all of that in their planning from the Israeli perspective uh they have some very effective countermeasures not least excellent armored vehicles you won't be seeing tanks in the streets but you will be seeing a lot of equipment perhaps we haven't seen in action before and something plenty that we have it's going to be really tough the urban fighting and don't forget the tunnels issue that's what's really going to be concerning the Israelis I think Frank um around 300,000 reservists uh have been mobilized on the on the Israeli side but there is also uh in addition to of course this this this Invasion into Hamas we know that Israel is also facing this threat from Hezbollah coming from the north I guess I'm asking you is Israel essentially prepared here for for a a multi-front war the answer to that is yes and they will have exercised that both at the highest command levels and down to the down to the Brigade that's to say the units of 3,000 or so Israel has dedicated brigades that know the north that are that are directed that way the reserves in those particular units will have been deployed there in the past and regularly during their their periodic training so yes they're prepared for for Hezbollah and indeed it's worth remembering that Hezbollah is considered a far more formidable adversary than Hamas and they are the only Arab Army that's defeated the Israelis uh I'll be at at a sort of strategic level but nonetheless they're very formidable and the Israelis will be more than aware of that all right that is let's leave it there Frank that is the military analyst uh Frank Leed talking to us there thank you so much we appreciate that um and I just want to point out to our viewers that while we were able to show you pictures uh of what is happening uh with the IDF in Israel we are by no means indicating that that ground of invasion has begun we have not re received official confirmation that that ground Invasion has
