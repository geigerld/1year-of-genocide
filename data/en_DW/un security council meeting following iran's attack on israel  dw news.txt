strongly condemn the large scale attack on Israel launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran yesterday we resolutely deplore this serious escalation as we have done in the case of the attack on the Iranian consulate last week the sequence of these events threatens to accelerate the spiral of violence escalating into a broader conflict of unpredictable scope it is crucial for all involved parties to recognize the severity of the situation and immediately seize hostilities we call on all countries to respect and act in accordance with international law we once again underline that the same standards apply to all member states and all of us have the obligation to uphold the UN Charter first let me underline Our concern over the regional escalation and its spillover effects we share the concerns of the Secretary General that the danger of a devastating region-wide escalation is present it is imperative that every action taken by the involved parties be measured and deliberate to avoid further escalation since any miscalculation can lead us to the point of no return the situation is highly alarming deeply worrying and it's extremely volatile second Slovenia has consistently called for deescalation unrestraint today we repeat our call to All actors in the region to show maximum restraint we call on countries with influence on State and non-state actors to exert that influence and prevent prevent the worst from happening we urge everyone to choose the path of dialogue and diplomacy and refrain from further retaliations we therefore welcome today's meeting as a step towards deescalation and the peaceful settlement of the dispute thirdly we have been witnessing the significant impact of the devastating situation in Gaza on the region including along the Blue Line in the Red Sea and elsewhere it is our Collective responsibility to take immediate action by adopting resolution 2728 we took a step forward forward in addressing the crisis however our failure to ensure its full implementation represents a critical setback Slovenia continues to believe that a ceasefire in Gaza would have a calming effect on tensions in the region every moment we delay the risk of a broader conflict increases Madame President in these chaotic times another major military confrontation in the Middle East could lead to devastating consequences for the region and the world placing the interest of the people in the region and International Peace and Security First Slovenia calls for restrain by All actors and return to diplomacy as a security council member we are ready to fully engage in a comprehensive response to the crisis in the region thank you I thank the representative of Slovenia pass the floor to the United States thank you Madame President for bringing us here today and thank you uh Secretary General Gutierrez for your briefing the United States condemns in the strongest terms the unprecedented attack on the state of Israel by the Islamic Republic of Iran and its militant proxies and partners Iran's intent was to cause significant damage in death in Israel it launched over 300 Munitions including more than 100 ballistic missiles and land attack cruise missiles at Israel as well as explosive unmanned aerial vehicles Iran's Reckless actions not only posed a threat to populations in Israel but also to other UN member states in the region including Jordan and Iraq the security Council has an obligation to not let Iran's actions go unanswered indeed for far too long Iran has flagrantly violated its International legal obligations notably through the actions of its Islamic revolutionary guard Corps or irgc by arming hisbah in violation of Security Council resolution 1701 by arming facilitating and enabling houti attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE and more recently Merchant and commercial shipping in the Red Sea in clear violation of resolution 2216 and in defiance of resolution 2722 and of course Iran transferred Shahed oneway attack drones to Russia the same drones it used in last night's attacks against Israel at a time when such transfers were in clear violation of resolution 2231 in recent years Iran has also repeatedly violated international law by targeting with mines and seizing commercial ships in international waters of the Persian Gulf and surrounding waterways just as it did on April 12 when it seized a Portuguese flag ship near the straight of Hormuz Iran continues to detain both the ships and its crew comprised of citizens from five countries including Russia Iran was also in a broad sense complicit in the October 7 attack on Israel because it has provided significant funding and training for the military wing of Hamas this Iranian support contributed to the current crisis in Gaza colleagues these and other Reckless Iranian actions are not inherently defensive actions against other member states given the threats Iran's aggressive actions posed for International Peace and security we have a collective responsibility as members of the security Council to ensure that Iran complies with the council's resolutions and ceases its violations of charter in the coming days and in consultation with other member states the United States will explore additional measures to hold Iran accountable here at the United Nations more immediately the security Council must unequivocally condemn Iran's aggressive actions and call for Iran and its partners and proxies to cease their attacks the United States also supports Israel's exercise of its inherent right to defend itself in the face of this attack and as President Biden stated we will remain in close contact with Israel's leaders and let me be clear if Iran or its proxies take actions against the United States or further action against Israel Iran will be held responsible we note Secretary General guer statement warning that the region is at risk of plunging into a deeper and wider war on multiple fronts the United States is not seeking escalation our actions have been purely defensive in nature the best way to prevent such escalation is an unambiguous condemnation from the council of Iran's unprecedented large-scale attack and an unequivocal call on it and its proxies and partners to refrain from further violence our goal is to deescalate and then get back to the issue at hand securing an end to the conflict in Gaza by getting a ceasefire in Gaza through a hostage deal as well as surging humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in need thank you madam president I thank the representative of the United States and pause the floor to Ecuador pres thank you Madame President I wish to thank the Secretary General for the information provided I also welcome the presence of the permanent representatives of Iran Israel and Syria the attacks carried out yesterday by Iran constitute a grave threat to International Peace and security and to the much desired Regional stability my government has strongly condemned the attack against Israel and has called for an escalation of the conflict to be avoided such an escalation could have unpredictable consequences including a configration that could affect the whole of humankind Ecuador adds its voice to the widespread call for tensions to be reduced and for threats to be avoided threats which keep civilians in the Chokehold of insecurity and anguish I conclude by urging all to exercise the utmost restraint and to prioritize diplomatic and political instruments for the resolution of conflict I also call upon all to consider good faith supporting the United Nations Regional bodies groups of countries or countries with a view to easing this alarming situation which as has as the Secretary General has stated could lead to military conflagrations on a large scale in the Middle East thank you Algeria sh thank you Madame President at the outset I would like to thank the uh Secretary General Mr Antonio gues for his thorough briefing the security Council meets today uh in the wake of the developments in the Middle East yesterday that actually create a threat for a very dangerous escalation that could bring the region and the world to an even more dangerous stage where things get out of control and whose results cannot be predicted my country Algeria is following these developments with utmost concern and interest and wounds against grave consequences should the circle of conflict in the Middle East broadens that's why we call upon all parties to practice self- restraint and avoid escalation would like also to reiterate what the SG has said and I quote that neither the region nor the world can afford another world and of quot and we have warned during the security Council session that have discussed the attacks launched by the Israeli occupation forces on the Iranian Embassy building in Damascus at the beginning of this month uh we have warned against the aftermath of not putting an end to this arrogance and behavior of the Israeli occupation in the region and we have always emphasized that this could bring the whole region into conflict and today you can see that our point of view was correct and our warning was honest that's why the Middle East is undergoing very critical circumstances that makes it incumbent upon all International actors to listen to the voice of wisdom so that we can all uh sail to safety together while emphasizing that International Peace and security could not be observed without uh giving the utmost priority to the principles and targets of the United Nations Charter the policy of double standards and adapting and tweaking uh and focusing on the contradictory interpretations of the international law as perir whims and desires of some would undermine our International order today we are at a Crossroads either we hold tight uh to the international law without any adaptation or cajoling or blandishment or we risk being submerged into chaos and lack of stability the uh crisis in the Middle East are part and parcel of each other and they are all uh interrelated and that's why the root causes should be addressed and the root cause is the Israeli occupation the recent developments cannot overrule or cover the central question which is the aggression on the unarmed Palestinian people in Gaza and at the same time we can never uh use as a pretext or recover for to launch a land attack against RAF we would like to reiterate that it is totally rejected if and we need to avoid any attack on raah because its ramifications in the region would be catastrophic we would like to reiterate that uh deescalate the deescalation things in the Middle East on the short term would have to go through reaching a ceasefire in Gaza and also to put an end to the heinous uh killing machine uh and the collective punishment that's being out against the Palestinian people uh uh sustainable peace and security region would only be attainable through empowering the Palestinian people of its legitimate rights and inable right uh as well and to put an end to isra occupation across all Arab territories and that's why the security Council should rise to the occasion and deliver on its functions on the protection of International Peace and security and uh prevent any further deterioration and therefore to work afterwards seriously on establishing the independent Palestinian state with Al Sharif Jerusalem its capital and to put an end of the Israeli occupation of all Arab territories thank you mad president than the representative of Algeria and pass the floor to Japan thank you Madame President I also thank Secretary General for the for his timely briefing on this urgent matter we are now witnessing an extremely dangerous situation that that could cause catastrophic consequences for the whole region and the world Japan is deeply concerned about the attack by Iran against Israel using numerous drones and missiles which put huge population in the in real danger and could further aggravate the current turmoil in the Middle East Japan strongly condemns such as an escalation we are seriously concerned that this large military action will increase the already extremely heightened tensions in the Middle East and lead to a wider and more serious Regional confrontation with Global Security and economic ramifications it is imperative for the security Council to address this matter as a United body responsible for International Peace and security to contain the risk of the region plunging into an abys Japan has been strongly urging the parties concerned to calm down and deescalate the situation and exercise Max maximum restraints as the Secretary General just mentioned Japan reiterates its

unprecedented attack that was launched by Iran against Israel yesterday and which threatens to destabilize the region the Secretary General also condemned this attack that attack was a serious and major threat to International Peace and security and in particular to stability and Security in the region in deciding to undertake such an unprecedented Act Iran crossed a new threshold in its destabilizing action and is risking a military escalation for which it would be responsible we call upon Iran and its allies to at long last and without further delay cease their destabilizing activities throughout the region France expresses its solidarity with the Israeli people and recalls its commitment to the security of Israel of our partners and to Regional stability we welcome the fact that very fortunately indeed Israel was able to successfully repel that attack that made it possible to avoid the worst and spare many civilians France is working towards deescalation with its Partners in the region and we call for restraint president of the Republic Emanuel mcon and the minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Stefan S are working assiduously on that task France is fully mobilized to find a settlement to the crisis besetting the Middle East for deescalation and to enforce the principles that underpin our International order in Lebanon we've made proposals to the two parties with a view due to reaching through dialogue a cessation of hostilities in Gaza France is striving to bring about the immediate and unconditional release of hostages and to bring about an immediate and Lasting ceasefire it is High Time 6 months after the terrorist attacks of October 7th and the beginning of the war in Gaza to lay the foundation for a lasting political settlement to this crisis by tackling the root causes of the conflict that is what is proposed by the resolu the draft resolution that we have proposed to this Council we call upon all members to support it we must no leave no stone unturned in avoiding a new war in the Middle East thank you United Kingdom thank you president and thank you Secretary General for briefing us today the United Kingdom condemns unequivocally Iran's Reckless attack against Israel which risked thousands of Civilian casualties the scale and nature of Iran's heinous assault the first direct attack from Iran on Israeli soil poses grave risks to the security and stability of citizens across the Middle East the United Kingdom has long been clear that Iran plays an unacceptable role in destabilizing the region and that it also Bears responsibility for the actions of groups it has supported militarily financially and politically over many years through this attack Iran has once again demonstrated that it is intent on sewing chaos in the region as we have demonstrated the United Kingdom will continue to stand up for Israel's security and for that of all our regional Partners including Jordan and Iraq we welcome the actions of our allies to deter the Iranian threat no one wants to see further Bloodshed the United Kingdom is also continuing to work urgently alongside the International Community to stabilize the situation and prevent further escalation it is vital that all parties exercise maximum restraint and refrain from any action that may heighten tensions further in the region we also call on Iran to release the MSC Aries and its crew unconditionally and without delay Iran's actions do nothing to advance the prospects for peace in Gaza as set out Security Council resolution 2728 the United Kingdom remains resolved to work with International Partners to secure an immediate pause in the fighting in Gaza to get Aid in and hostages out leading to a sustainable ceasefire without a return to destruction fighting and the loss of life thank you madam president I thank the representative of the United Kingdom and pass the floor to Mozambique thank you Madame President we thank malta's president for convening this urgent meeting we highly value the insights provided by his Excellency Mr Antonio gues Secretary General of the United Nation on this crisis Madame President precisely two weeks ago when discussing the Israel air strike on the Iranian diplomatic mission in Damascus we raise serious concern that the incident could escalate Regional tensions and could potentially lead to retaliation and heighten the conflict between Israel and Iran regret uh regrettably our concerns have materialized yesterday we w w witnessed a serious of military strikes on the Israeli soil carrying out by the Islamic Republic of Iran invoking self-defense under article 51 of the UN chter we express our deep concern on the yesterday's Iranian strikes a it for forat cycle of mutual aggression is not consistent with the logic of peace and peaceful coexistence between states it leads to more depth suffering and misery it will further exacerbate the prevailing t in the region and may trigger more conflict potentially involving other countries with Unthinkable implications we strongly believe that it is crucial for all parties involved to exercise restraint and approach the situation with prudence and wisdom careful consideration of risks and extended consequences is therefore essential during this critical moment Madame President in light of the current situation it is imperative that all parts involved Israel and Iran in particular strictly abide by the charter of the United Nation that compels all member states to refrain from the threat of use of force in their international relations stability in the Middle East is vital for the security and development of region and Beyond it is ENT IAL that states in the region and their allies pursue policies that promote peace and stability with due regard for a balance of interests to that end we council members individually and collectively must actively engage all concerned parties to prevent and miscalculation that could lead to broader conflict in an already volatile region such escalation would have devastating consequences for civilians who are already suffering in Syria Lebanon in the occupied Palestinian territory Israel and the broader Middle East we appeal that we strive for peace understanding and cooperation in the Middle East acknowledging the legitimate concerns of all involved parties is a crucial step towards fostering stability and Harmony in diversity and let us remind ourself that the central issue in the Middle East is the materialization of a two-state solution whereby Israel and Palestine can live together side by side in peace and security as two independent and sovereign states I thank you Madame President I thank the representative of mozambik and pass the floor to the Republic of Korea thank you Madame President I thank secret General Kus for his important briefing on the gra situation in the Middle East including yesterday's attack by Iran against Israel the Republic of Korea is Gravely concerned about the current situation in the Middle East exemplified by yesterday's attack by Iran against Israel using numerous drones and missiles the Republic Korea condemns these large large scale attacks which are not in compliance with international law to make the situation worse freedom of navigation is now being threatened not only in the Red Sea but also at the straight of hormud which cannot be justified regardless of any excuse since the outbreak of the horrendous terrorist attack by Hamas against Israeli citizens on the 7th of October last year and subsequent military operation by Israel in Gaza and in in humanitarian catastrophe the International Community including the Republic Korea has repeatedly wared against the possibility of increasingly dangerous spillover in the Middle East earlier this month when we witnessed the incidence at the Iranian consulate that resulted in casualties in Damascus Syria the Republic of Korea expressed its deep concern that additional violent instance could escalate into new tragedies in the region unfortunately what we are seeing we are now seeing this even more dangerous tension surging in the Middle East amidst the worst escalation in the Middle East where the entire region stands at risk of being engulfed in the Flames of War what is crucial is finding the most effective solution to East tension rather than finger pointing and debating over who and what trigger the current situation thus the secret Council should gather the wisdom of all its members we can still step back from the brink the ongoing escalation of the already dire dire tension in the region should immediately stop any Regional escalation should be condemned and the regional actors should exercise full restraint in order to prevent any additional spillover thus we take note that the permanent of Iran expressed in his letter to the Secretary General yesterday the position that Iran does not seek escalation or conflict in the region and we hope that this affirmation can be realized with actual compliance the Republic of Korea is monitoring this situation with deep concern and once again calls on all parties to exercise restraints in order to prevent further escalation of the situation let me conclude by reiterating again what Secretary General gutterz point out yesterday in his in his statement and today in his briefing neither the region nor the world can afford another military confrontation immediate the escalation is as everybody understand an urgent Collective need at this critical juncture I thank you Madame President I thank the represent of the Republic of Korea and pass the floor to Switzerland mer Madame thank you Madame President we welcome this with convening of the security Council and we thank the Secretary General gutterz for his statement detailing the events of the recent events and we underscore our common responsibility Switzerland firmly condemns the coordinated attacks by Iran on Targets in Israel last night these attacks are part of a spiral of violence which is already dangerously underway in the region as we also saw with the air strike against Iran's Consulate in Damascus on the 1st of April an attack that Switzerland also condemned each of these attacks increases the risk of further escalation in the region we also note with concern the seizure of a the MSC Aries a Portuguese flagged Ship by the Iranian armed forces in the straight of Hormuz we have repeatedly warned against the risk of accelerating the spiral of violence in the region it is imperative that all parties in the region and those with influence over them exercise the utmost restraint to avoid a further endangering the people of the region we call on all parties to an armed conflict to respect their obligation to protect civilian populations and infrastructures we repeat once again our appeal this spiral of escalation must stop immediately the region must not be plunged into an even wider and deadlier conflict at a time when we are facing a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and when tensions and exchanges of fire at the blue line between Southern Lebanon and Lebanon uh Lebanon between Southern Lebanon Israel are at an old time High we call for full respect and support for unifil Mission and other un missions in the region deescalation must be the priority this includes the implementation of resolution 2728 an immediate ceasefire in Gaza is urgent as is this sensation of attacks by armed groups in the region we take note of the Declaration by the Iranian authorities that they do not wish to continue their operation we recall in this context that any recourse to the use of Force must be in strict Conformity with the charter and that International humanitarian law must be respected by all parties in such situations dialogue is essential the council and all states must fully play their part in facilitating deescalation to this end Switzerland is ready to bring its contribution I thank you representative of Switzerland and pass the floor to the Russian Federation Madame President we listened very closely to the statement made made by the Secretary General and we also noted um um Secretary General the fact that yesterday you instantly publicly reacted and condemned the actions of Iran it is regrettable that unlike the meeting today you did not propose to break to brief the Council on the 2nd of April where upon Russian initiative an emergency briefing was called to discuss the Israeli strike against the Consular premises and Damascus we would like to also see a greater activity on your part so as to convey to members of the council information on other no less turbulent uh topics for the Middle East today for example about the um now regular attacks by Israel against neighboring Syria and Lebanon um if uh such um attitude uh will such things will continue unnoticed then your appeals to restraint by all parties which share can become futile distinguished colleagues when we met in this chamber on the 2nd of April so as to discuss the strike by Israel against the Consular premises um of the Islamic Republic of Iran Damascus we warned that what was needed was a strong and unified signal by the council that such actions were unacceptable and not only against the sovereign states of Iran or Syria and not only in the Middle East but anywhere in the world we called upon the colleagues of insecurity Council to clearly une unequivocally condemn such Reckless steps to make sure that they don't get repeated we also warranted that otherwise the risk of a repeat of such acts and the general escalation in the region would grow manifold we even proposed a draft press statement by the security Council and this was put together on the basis of of standards for CH cases depoliticized language and what did we hear at that time from our Western delegations they said that for them not everything was clear and obvious and uh what was necessary was to assess and see whether such a signal from the council will help stabilize the situation in the region the United States UK and France there essentially declined to confirm that the basic principles of international law about the inviability of de diplomatic and Consular facilities which are enshrined in the Vienna conventions on this issue apply equally to all states and um the outcome is now clear for everyone to see you know very well that an attack uh against a diplomatic representation is a kazus belly under international law and if a western representation had been h you would immediately have rained down reprisals and would argued that you were right about this in this very chamber and this is because for you everything that has to do with Western representations and Western citizens is sacred it needs to be protected but when it comes to other countries their rights including the right to self-defense about their Nationals well that's a different matter as you like to say what happens then um is you activate your favorite argumentation about lack of information you start doing legalistic care splitting Etc and today the security Council we're witnessing is a display of hypocrisy and double standards which it's almost embarrassing to watch um Russia has warned on many an occasion that the fact that many crises in the Middle East are unsettled first and foremost in the area of Israeli and Palestinian conflict which are frequently fueled by irresponsible unilat Al provocative acts will lead to a growth of tension in the whole region we have stated on many occasion that no country in the Middle East or northern northern Africa should become an arena for regional or International confrontation or an arena for settling political scores what happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a in a vacuum the steps undertaken by Iraq became a reaction to a disgrace ful inaction by the security Council um and a reaction to an courageous attack by Israel against Damascus and not the first one because Syria is constantly being bombarded by Israel many of you today did not find the courage to State clearly that the Outburst of escal violence in the Middle East is developing against the background of an operation which is lasting more than 6 months is unprecedented in terms of the number of victims an operation conducted by West Jerusalem in Gaza and West Bank and this is despite an unambiguous demand in 2728 to cease fire immediately such silence uh about the deep root of the crisis is unacceptable we think especially against the background of um the um tension surrounding Iran which is fueled by the Us and other colleagues and the fact that Israel is not uh complying with the Security Council resolutions is an obvious disrespect shown to the council to all of you who are here in the uh members seats and a complete disregard to the decisions made by the security Council and non-compliance with Security Council decisions is not something that one should get away with and it's fraud with sanctions against the Violator Madame President we recall very well the dangerous escalations in January 2020 when the region was on the brink of a conflict as a result of an legal elimination by the United States on Iraqi territory of Kasam suani and a number of um other Iraqi officials but Washington did not draw appropriate conclusions from that and as a result The Reckless acts undermining stability security and sovereignty of regional neighbors of Iran are continuing we call on all involved in the incident all parties involved in the incident to um to exercise restraint under the extremely tense situation on the ground in the Middle East and and the obvious risk of the cons of the conflict growing and becoming a re region-wide we expect and that Regional States will resolve all of the issues they have using political and diplomatic means only we also think it's important to make sure that the constructive International Players assisted in this matter this B level conference ation and bloodshed Must Be Stopped we think it's urgent for the entire International Community to undertake all efforts necessary to deescalate the situation otherwise the region could become drawn into a vicious cycle of mutual attacks and violence in this regard we note the signal sent by tyan that they do not seek a further military escalation against Israel and we urge West Jerusalem to follow suit and reject the practice of Prov ative use of force in the Middle East as they are fraught with extremely dangerous risk risks and consequences for the whole region which is already destabilized as a result of intensified Israeli Palestinian confrontation I thank you I thank the representative of the Russian Federation China Madame President I thank secr General Antonio gutes for his briefing I look forward to hearing ing the statements to be made by Iran Israel and Syria respectively on the evolving situation since the Gaza conflict began the International Community has deployed the unacceptable humanitarian catastrophy in Gaza and made strong demands for an immediate ceasefire to end the hostilities it has also expressed grave concerns at how a prolonged conflict would exacerbate the tensions in the region with serious compounding spillover effects on the 1 of April Iran's diplomatic premises in Syria were targeted in an air strike resulting in multiple casualties on the Iranian side and serious damage to the set premises this incident was a serious violation of the UN Charter and international law as it violated both the sovereignty of Syria and that of Iran it was of a most egregious nature a moment ago Secretary General garish briefed us on the escalation that happened on the 13th of April which China finds highly concerning we have also noted that according to Iran its military action was in response to Israel's aggression against its diplomatic premises and the matter can be deemed concluded China calls on the parties concerned to show maximum calm and restraint and resolve their differences and disputes in accordance with the purposes of the UN Charter and international law to avert any further escalations Madam president this round of escalations is the latest manifestation of the Gaza conflict spilling over to the wider region it serves as another reminder that the Palestinian question remains Central to the Middle East issue and bears on the peace stability and long-term Security in the region if the Flames of the Gaza conflict are allowed to continue raging then the adverse spillover is set to spread still further making the region even more unstable countries and peoples in the Middle East have no desire for nor can they afford a larger conflict or War therefore the top priority at this moment is an effective implementation of 2728 to bring about an immediate ceasefire in Gaza ultimately there is no alternative to the full implementation of the two-state solution the only way to end the vicious circle of the palestini Israeli conflict once and for all we call on the International Community especially countries with influence to play a constructive part in the maintenance of regional peace and stability I thank you Madame President I thank the representative of China I will now make a statement in my national capacity I begin by thanking the Secretary General for his briefing the Middle East is experiencing one of the bleakest and most volatile periods of modern history which risk spiraling out of control if all sides do not take a step back this was a point that Malta stressed on 2nd April following the deplorable attack by Israel on the Iranian diplomatic premises in Damascus on 1st April we had stressed the need for deescalation and for maximum restraint to be exercised by All actors in the region regrettably these calls for caution have been disregarded given the recent developments we emphasize our deep concern about the significant escalation posed by a large scale attack consisting of of drones and various missiles launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran against Israel we are also concerned with Iran's seizure of the container ship MSC Aries The Vessel along with its crew must be immediately and unconditionally released at a time when our focus should be on diffusing tensions and reducing conflict induced by advoc including by advocating for an immediate and permanent cease fire to the war in Gaza facilitating the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and ensuring the delivery of sustained humanitarian Aid throughout Gaza all we are witnessing are steps in the opposite direction Iran's direct targeting of the state of Israel risks Regional catastrophe with innocent lives bearing the Brandt of all hostilities we stress that international law including International humanitarian law must be respected at all times once again we reiterate our call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint including in their messaging to deescalate and pursue peaceful and diplomatic solutions to all disputes let us be clear the region finds itself in turmoil and stands on the precipice of unimaginable hostilities and suffering as the Secretary General outlined and I quote neither the region nor the world can afford another War I now resume my functions as president of the council I now give the floor to the representative of Israel thank you Madame President Madame President yesterday the Ayatollah regime in blatant violation of the UN Charter and Inter and international law attacked attacked the state of Israel and launched 70 uavs 120 ballistic missiles and 30 cruise missiles carrying 60 tons of explosive materials at Israel this attack was launched from Iranian soil as well as from Lebanon Yemen Syria and Iraq colleagues from the moment I began my tenure here in every speech and in countless letters I ran the warning Bell regarding Iran I called on this Council to take concrete action against the Ayatollah regime I made it clear that Iran and its hegemonic Ambitions of global domination Must Be Stopped before it drives the world to a point of no return to a regional war that can escalate to a World War sadly no action was taken and last night the world witnessed an unprecedented escalation that serves as the clearest proof for what happens when warnings aren't heed Israel is not the boy who cried wolf we have been screaming from the rooftops for years trying to wake up the International Community but to no avail if only this Council would have inter internalized my words it would not have needed the bone rattling explosions of last night's attack to wake it up colleagues last night Iran proved again that it cares nothing nothing for Islam or Muslims the Iranian attack seriously injured Amina eloni a seven-year-old bedwin girl in Israel but look at this video that shows how Israel intercepts Iranian drones above the Temple mount in El AA mosque [Music] here you can look at it this is the AA musk to Iran Israel's Annihilation and igniting the region is more important than Islamic holy sites the Ayatollah regime in its plot to impose a global Shiite hemony throughout its proxies through its proxies has even attacked Saudi Arabia as we all remember aramco oilfield the United Arab Emirates and anyone anyone else they view as an obstacle I ask the Algerian representative here how this make you feel is this a price you support attempting to blow up mosques and murdering Muslims yet while this direct Iranian attack on Israel was the first of its kind it is just the most recent chapter in a blood soaked Saga that started from the moment the Islamic revolution reared its head the Ayatollah regime is a clear plan its goal has been and continues to be World Domination by exporting its radical Shiite Revolution across the globe I assume you all know it the Islamic regime of today is no different than the Third Reich and aay is no different than Adolf Hitler Hitler's thirdd Reich was envisioned to be a Thousand-Year Empire stretching across continents just as Kam envisions his radical Shiite haimon to stretch across the region and Beyond this is why Iran arms themselves with intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms Iran and Israel are on the same continent you are next the Ayatollah regimes acts like the Nazi regime and their army includes Hamas Palestinian Islamic Jihad kisala the hutis the Revolutionary guard and other Savage jihadists instead of shouting SE H these radical Nazi islamist scream death to Israel death to America death to England just like the Nazi regime the Ayatollah regime SS death and destruction everywhere it touches for the past years Ukrainian civilians have been killed from disguise with Iranian weaponary president zalinski in condemnation of Iran's attack last night said and I quote the sound of Iranian Shahed drones a tool of Terror is the same in the Skies over the Middle East and Europe this sound must serve as a wakeup call to the Free World listen to president zalinski and wake up just like the ever reaching hand of the vermak Iran struck Albania with cyber attacks and launches strikes against Kurds in Iraq we all remember the 2021 attack on the oil tanker Mercer Street in which British and Romanian crew members were killed and just yesterday yesterday Iran seized a Portuguese cargo ship the crew be being held right now by Iran includes Indian Filipino Pakistani and Russian Nationals Iran threatens Global Maritime trade Iran is not only a terror State Iran is a pirate State colleagues just this week the court in Argentina held Iran directly responsible for the 1994 terror attack in Bueno Iris on the Jewish Community Center which killed 85 people and wounded 300 and just like the Third Reich and their brutal SS officers the Iranian regime not only spreads evil abroad but also torments and murders their own citizens in 2023 alone the Ayatollah regime executed 834 Iranians the regime oppresses women while murdering them for not wearing their hijab properly when the Iranian people peacefully protest this brutality they are suppressed by live ammunition hundreds of protesters were killed and thousands have been arrested this is a regime that allows its own people to die of thirst in Isfahan while it funds Terror around the world with billions of dollars what have you done to defend the world from Iran seriously the entire Globe is suffering from Iran including the Iranian people please defend them for years the world has watched has watched the rise of a Shiite islamist right yet just like during the rise of Nazism the world has been silent definitely silent Mr Secretary General Iran has been violating Security Council resolutions and the un Charter for years they Supply kisala with weapons in violation of resolutions 1559 and 1701 they Advance weapons proliferation in violation of resolution 2231 they violate resolution 1540 and 2216 why have you not used all possible means to condemn Iran and demand compliance why have you instead rolled out the red carpet for these genocidal jihadist why do you treat them as if they are interested in deescalation when you know that the opposite is true colleagues Iran's strategy has been Crystal Clear arm fund and train Terror proxies across the globe to carry out Iran's murderous scheme of domination but today the mask of Iranian deniability has been removed no more hiding and no more bluffing no more sh king of responsibility Iran has attacked Israel from its own Sovereign territory publicly and proudly the mask is off Iran the number one Global sponsor of Terror has exposed its true face as the de destabilizer of the region and the world and now right now is when the world must stop ignoring Iran's crimes and take action as Iran's mask has fallen the world's comp complacency Y Must also fall The Mask comes off and the gloves must come on the snooze button is no longer an option the only option is to condemn Iran and utilize every means necessary to make them pay a heavy price for their horrible crimes Iran and its AES of supporters must be shown that the Civilized world will no longer stay stand idle while many countries immediately condemned the attack those who did not must ask themselves how do you want history to remember you council members last night's attack was a blatant violation of international law and the UN Charter it was an act of utter escalation that can drag the entire region and world into war but can you imagine if the attack was carried out under under an Iranian nuclear umbrella or if or if some of the Iran's of Iran's missiles had nuclear warheads the regime that launched an unprecedented strike on Israel a fellow member state of the UN is baring towards nuclear capabilities this is a terror State responsible for Global destruction and soon they will have nuclear capabilities you all know that Iran is systematically violating the jcpa and has enriched uranium up to 60% Purity and even more Iran's breakout time to produce an arsenal of Nu nuclear weapons is now weeks mere weeks no concrete action has been taken and the IAA inspectors have been kept in the dark Iran is on the verge of becoming a nuclear power it should terrify every member of this Council take a moment to think what would happen if a could have launched a nuclear bomb last night is this the world we want to live in so to the jcpoa signator as I say initiate the Snapback mechanism today initiate it impose all possible sanctions on Iran before it's too late we need a world led by Churches not chamberlands colleagues on October 7th Hamas with Iranian funding with Iranian weaponary with training carried out the most brutal Massacre of Jews since the Holocaust they slaughtered our children they burned entire communities they raped our women they took families hostage and are abusing 133 hostages Bala with its Iranian arms and sponsorship have fired thousands of rockets into Israel since October 7th decimating towns the houis with Iranian weapons and instructions and intelligence are firing at every Merchant vessel that is suspected of having ties to Israel and then Iran who directs and pays for all of this violence carried out an attack of epic portions on Israel colleagues we are being fired upon from all fronts from every border we are surrounded by Iran's Terror proxies the war in Gaza extends far broader than Israel and Hamas all of the terror groups attacking Israel are tentacles tentacles of the same Shiite octopus the Iranian octopus so I ask you and be honest with yourselves what would you do what would you do if you were in Israel's shoes how would you react if your existence was threatened every single day while the aah regime thinks they only think that Israel is a frog in a boiling water that we are becoming accustomed to the threats on our survival and won't won't notice until it's too late they are wrong you are wrong this attack crossed every red line and Israel reserves the legal right to retaliate we are not a frog in boiling water we are a nation of lions following such a massive and direct attack on Israel the entire world let alone Israel cannot settle for in action we will defend our future colleagues despite the magnitude of the attack 19 9% of Iran's uavs and missiles were intercepted by Israel and our allies I wish to take this opportunity to thank the United States and our partners for standing with us in defending Israel against the Ayatollah regime indiscriminate attacks yet the fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of the Iranian attack Iran can no longer hide behind its proxies it has now exposed itself as the terror export exporting Pariah state that it is and it must from now on be treated as such it's not enough to remove Iran from the UN Commission on the status of women Iran is the world's worst human rights violator and such a regime cannot hold any un position no more red carpet treatment here at the UN no more appeasement today the council must take action condemn Iran for their Terror trigger the snapack mechanism and reimpose crippling sanction designate the Iranian revolutionary guard Corp as a terror organization action must be taken now not for Israel's sake not for the Region's sake but for the world's sake stop Iran today thank you Madame Israel I pass the floor to the of Iran thank you in the name of God the compassionate the merciful Madame President as we informed in our letter last night in response to the Israeli regime recurring military aggression particularly its armed attack on 1st April 2024 against Iranian diplomatic premises a defense of article second of the charter of the United Nations the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran carried out a series of military strike on Israeli military objectives with thousands of missile and drones Iran's operation was entirely in the exercise of Iran's inherent right to self-defense as outlined in article 51 of the charter of the United Nations and recognized by international law law this concluded action was necessary and proportionate it was precise and only targeted military objectives and carried out carefully to minimize the potential for escalation and prevents civilian harm Madame President we thank those members of the council who condemned the Israeli armed attack against our diplomatic premises in Syria regrettably in this chamber certain member of the council including the US UK and France has chosen once again to turn a blind eye to reality and Overlook the root causes contributing to the current situation in hypocritical behavior these three countries falsely blamed and accused Iran without considering their own failures to uphold their International commitment to peace and Security in the region they made unsuccessful attempts to use lies manipulate the narrative spread thisinformation and engage in a destructive blame game all the while they deliberately disregarded Iran's inherent right to respond to the violation of a fundamental principle of international law the inviolability of diplomat IC representative and premises moreover they ignored the underlying root causes of the current situation in the region for over 6 months now these countries especially the United States have shielded Israeli from any responsibility for the Gaza Massacre while they have denied Iran inherent right to self-defense against the Israeli armed attack on our diplomatic premises says at the same time they shamefully Justified the Israeli Massacre and genocide against the defenseless Palestinian people under the pretext of self-defense they made cynical attempt to justify and cover up the atrocities of the Israeli regime against the people of Palestine by arbitrary and misleading interpretation of self-defense Madame President following the Israeli regime cover ly terrorist and armed attack against our diplomatic premises in Damascus the Syrian Arab Republic on the 1st of April we notified the UN Security Council and Secretary General of such International rful act as well as of Iran's inherent right under international law to respond to such terrorist armed attack also in a phone conversation with the UN Secretary General on 2nd April Iran foreign minister discussed the situation and called for taking appropriate action and a strong condemnation from the International Community for this horrific crime we call upon the security Council to strongly denounce this unjustified criminal and terrorist act taking decisive and appropriate measure to bring the perpetrators to Justice swiftly and prevent the requirements of the such horrible crime against the Diplomatic premises of any member State regrettably the security Council has failed in its duty to maintain International Peace and security Russia proposed a press statement to denounce this atra atrocious act which was backed by China Algeria and many members but was blocked by the US UK and France faced with such circumstances the Islamic Republic of Iran had no choice but to exercise its inherent right to self-defense under international law Madame President the root cause of the current situation are clear to all from the start of the Israeli war against Palestinian people in Gaza more than 34,000 civilians two3 of them children and women have been killed all civilian infrastructures have been targeted and destroyed by Israel even humanitarian workers have not been immune from the military attacks of this rough regime the absence of accountability and conil in action fac with the Israeli genocide and war crimes against the Palestinian people has only emboldened this regime to continue its violation unchecked the US and its allies have blocked the security Council for our 6 months protecting Israel from accountability for the Gaz massak they not only avoid condemning Israel for these atrocities but also actively try to cover up them their sole priority is supporting and defending Israel regardless of the consequences and at all costs despite International pressure and un Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire Israel has defied this resolution rather it Focus remains on committing more atrocious crime showing no regard for international legal obligation Madame President this Lawless regime has committed many atrocious crime against our people this regime Bly and openly admitted its responsibility for the terrorist and destructive operation committed against against Iranian officials scientists and civilians and sabotage against our peaceful nuclear infrastructure in recent year this Israeli regime even made explicit threats to use nuclear weapons against a sovereign member state of the United Nation this terrorist regime is responsible for all criminal and terrorist act committed against Iran and must bear the consequences the Islamic Republic of Iran has warned time and again about the repercussions of the malicious activities of the regime on Regional and International Peace and security Iran has exercised maximum restraint now it is time for the occupying regime to Bear full responsibility for its consequences this regime cannot Aid accountability Madame President Israel ongoing destabilized and respons action and atrocities against the nation in the region are a real threat to Regional and International Peace and security the Israeli Prime Minister's policy seeks to expand and escalate the conflict in the region to stay in power the member of the security Council must not allow such an August body the security Council to be held hostage to the Ambitions of such a beligerant regime it is time for the security Council to shoulder its responsibility and address the real threat to security Council must promptly fulfill its Duty under chapter 7 of the charter in response to Israeli Reckless Defiance it must take urgent and punative measures to compel this regim to stop its genocide and Massacre against the people of Gaza and uphold its oblig ation especially fully implement the UN Security Council resolution and legally binding orders of the international court of justice the main and longstanding threat to the peace and security of our region is well known to all and the attempts to conceal it through disinformation a smear campaign or Bas accusation against others are pointless and unfunded Iran is never seeking to contribute to the speel of of the conflict in the region nor does it to escalate or spread the tension to the entire region contrary to unfounded claims Iran has no proxy in the region no individual group or country act at the Iran behest the US and Israeli regime attempt to label the resistance group in the region as the Proxes or terrorist their Sinister aim is only to just justify and legalize their malicious and the stabilized activities in the region the resistance group are not Proxes or terrorists they are legitimate and are only fighting against occupation and agression of Israel in Gaza and occupied Palestine territories and of the US in the region international law recognized such legitimate rights against any occupation and ation instead the US and the UK are fully responsible for all its decades long aggressions and other crimes and unlawful measures in our region furthermore they are responsible for all crimes of the Israeli regime as it cannot commit any of such Savage crimes in Gaza without the consent order and all out political financial and Military support of and collaboration with the United States and the UK we reject the allegation made by the Israeli regime at this meeting such false and unfounded claims don't Merit to response Madame President as a responsible member of the United Nation the Islamic Republic of Iran is committed to the prose and principles enshrined in the charter of the United Nation reaffirms once more its commitment to the maintainance of Islamic Republic of Iran retraced its consistent position that it does not seek escalation or war in the region while warning about any further military provocation by the Israeli regime the Islamic Republic of Iran reaffirms it unwavering determination to defense its people National Security and interest sovereignty and territorial Integrity against any threat or act of aggression and to respond to any such threat or aggression regly and in accordance with international law the Islamic Republic of Iran will not hesitate to exercise this right when required Madame President excellencies Iran has no intention of engaging in conflict with the US in the region we demonstrated our commitment to peace by exercising our restraint about involving the US Army in intercepting Iranian drones and missiles Bound for military Target in the occupied Palestinian territories this underscores our dedication to De escalating tension and avoiding the expansion of conflict however if the US initiate military operation against Iran its citizen or its security and interest Iran will use its inherent right to respond proportionately I thank you I thank the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran and pass the floor to the Syrian Arab Republic thank you Madame President Madame President what our region witnessed yesterday is a natural and inevitable outcome of repeated aggressions and Grave violations of international law and the United Nations Charter perpetrated by the Israeli occupation authorities on the territories of my country Syria and other countries in that these authorities were taking advantage of the support offered by the US Administration in this Council and elsewhere this American support this blind and unlimited American Support has led the occupation author ities to mistakenly believe that they are above the United Nations and above international law and above the conventions and the resolutions that were adopted by our Organization for decades the support LED these authorities to believe that they can continue perpetrating their crimes and their escalation of the situation in our region with no response and no consequence my country the Syrian Arab Republic has warned the security Council and the Secretariat repeatedly in official letters warned of the dangers of an escalation of the explosion that the Israeli occupation authorities are trying to spark to cover up for their military failure in Gaza and to find justifications for it to continue its genocide and other atrocities against the Palestinian people and the accompanying hysterical attacks on countries in the region in our letters we have repeatedly called upon the United Nations and the security Council to take immediate action in accordance with their mandate however the US Administration and a number of its allies have obstructed any Movement by the security in the maintenance of International Peace and security and put an end to Israel's crimes and holding it accountable the behavior of these countries is nothing new these countries have prevented for over 7 and a half decades the United Nation from shouldering its responsibility to put an end to the Israeli occupation of occupied Arab territories and to return legitimate Arab rights that are inherent to those who hold them and in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions at the Forefront of which are resolutions 242 338 and 497 these resolutions are the basic foundation and the ENT the essence of a resolution to the Arab Israeli conflict and the best means to deal with the repercussions of the Israeli occupation on the region including the crisis and challenges that it entailed Syria holds the Israeli occupation authorities and the US Administration fully responsible for the Israeli attacks and any additional escalation that threatens peace and Security in the region Syria stresses that our region has suffered enough from the violations perpetrated by the Zionist entity and the US Administration and its allies violations of the international law and the principles and purposes of the charter the time has come to take Serious action where these states reconsider their destructive policies in our region and against our peoples the time has come for the states to immediately and unconditionally Rectify these policies including through imposing an immediate halt to the Israeli aggression on the Palestinian people and countries in the region the states must guarantee full and unimpeded humanitarian access and they must put an end to the intentional starving of the people of Gaza moreover there must be an end to the illegitimate military presence of US forces on the territory of my country Syria we must put an end to the systemic Looting of our national wealth we must put a stop to the sponsoring of terrorist organizations and and separatist militias we demand a full and unconditional removal of the unilateral coercive measures which in themselves are a form of economic terrorism and Collective punishment that the Syrian people must be freed of Madame President we have listened to the statements delivered by some Western delegations which have once again expressed their approach of hypocrisy and double standards some members of this Council have grown used to offering their own interpretations of the charter and use them to serve their own goals and greed including article 51 which guarantees a basic right for all our states namely the legitimate right to self-defense the United States of America and Britain and France have launched repeated aggressions on my country country which are which is thousands of miles away from them these attacks these three attacks these three countries attacked my country collectively and individually based on a distorted interpretation of article 51 and flimsy claims that are no more than baseless lies they did not stop at that rather they prevented the security Council from discussing these attacks and from taking any action to uph hold the principles of the charter that these states are trying to replace with what they call a rules-based order what the Islamic Republic of Iran did yesterday is a sound and practical exercise of the legitimate right to self-defense as envisaged by the founding fathers of our organization and as guaranteed by article 51 of the charter the Iranian response was an urgent necessity imposed by the Israeli occupation authorities persistent crimes and hostile Behavior it was imposed by the fact that the three Western States who are permanent members of the security Council have continued to obstruct the security Council from taking any action to put an end to these uh violations or even simply condemn them this was clearly manifest in the fact that the United States France and Britain obstructed the issuance by the security Council of a press statement that condemns the Israeli terrorist attack against the Iranian Consulate in the Syrian Capital Damascus which was a clear violation of all International conventions and rules which guarantee the inviability and Immunity of diplomatic premises and personnel and what else is to be expected from those who along with their allies in the NATO barbarically shelled the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999 in closing Madame President on the 25th of April 1945 the San Francisco Conference inaugurated its proceedings laying the groundwork for the United Nations and the charter which is the guiding star for our Collective action and in the Charter were basic principles that confirm the need to respect sovereignty and equality between member states regardless of their size today and more than ever before our countries must uphold these principles because upholding them means the success of the United Nations and its mandate and violating them means dismissing the rule of law and replacing it with the law of the Jungle with war Wars and within stability Syria is a founding member of the United Nations and continues to believe in this organization and its principles and its purposes and we wish for it to undertake its role in maintaining International Peace and security and in dealing with the root causes of the challenges that our country is facing namely the Israeli occupation which is an impediment to the peace and Security in our countries and the prosperity of our peoples I thank you madam president I thank the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic there are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers
