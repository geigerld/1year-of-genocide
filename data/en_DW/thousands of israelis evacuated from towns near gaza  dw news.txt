we can join Rebecca Rus who's near zikim in southern Israel close to the border with Gaza welcome Rebecca what's happening well just prior to coming on air actually Phil there was another small volley of rockets coming from Gaza uh that were intercepted here in our area uh but earlier today uh just around 5:00 p.m. local time uh Hamas attacked the city of ashalon now they sent a message warning that they were going to carry out this large attack warning residents to evacuate because they were going to attack that City uh they did so and there was one hit a hotel was hit we've had no uh sorry the cries of somebody who can see Rockets but uh there doesn't appears to be a false alarm um uh and the hotel was hit but we believe that there wasn't anybody in the hotel at the time uh we have colleagues that had tried to stay in that hotel and they were told that the hotel was uh not open at the moment had been closed because of what's going on so uh no reports of casualties but at the hotel what the city was hit um what's happening around this area in particular and I as as far as I'm aware all along the border with Gaza is a really significant troop buildup and Hardware buildup now we don't know exactly what the plan there is but it does appear that uh Israel is readying itself for what looks like a very big offensive uh everyone expects it to be a big ground offensive and and certainly that's what it looks like there is big heavy machinery about 100 m 150 m in another area over there I can see some Rockets low can you still hear me there Phil yes absolutely are you able to see those locket we can see those Rockets but if you need to end this at any point then obviously just do so I'll let you know thank you but that's been happening basically um all day all afternoon uh at at relatively regular intervals um and of course the air the air strikes are continuing on Gaza as well the Israelis have been pounding uh the Gaza Strip pounding those Hamas there's the siren pounding those Hamas targets as they say the civilian death toll will be rising significantly in fact Rising so quickly that the health authorities are not able to keep up with the numbers so I have no uh new numbers for you Phil from behind from behind very close I think we do have to take cover now Phil I'm afraid all right thanks for that so that's Rebecca RS near the the near in southern Israel near the border with Gaza right we're going back to uh Rebecca Rissa uh near the border uh with Gaza now um Rebecca when uh when we when we left just a couple of uh minutes ago there was rocket Fire in the Sky um things are calming down yeah that has passed now but the the reason I thought we perhaps better take cover is it was actually quite low much lower than we have been seeing in the last couple of days uh we where we're positioned actually uh the the Rockets and the the missiles then they they rarely make landfall in this area but what we have to look out for of course is the falling trapnel from the interceptions from the Iron Dome um so excuse me uh but that has been basically happening all day that's what's going on here back and forth uh pretty much all day but as I was talking about before we got cut off was of course the troop buildup that is happening and what seems to be Israel's next move which looks to be like it's going to be a very big offensive potentially uh a ground Invasion that's what everyone's expecting of course we have no official word of what they're going to be doing but by the looks of the hardware buildup uh that we're seeing in the area it definitely seems as though they're preparing for something very big and what what sort of Hardware are you seeing I I appreciate you're not you're not a military expert but you're seeing what tanks and lorries we tanks we're seeing anti-mine uh tanks as well we're seeing these really big diggers that are anti-mine diggers it looks like they're to maneuver uh to bulldo potentially houses potentially buildings I'm not exactly sure what they used for but all of these machines in great numbers and we're also seeing of course a huge troop buildup we know that 300,000 reservists have been called up uh that's no small number though they do have a large area to cover we're looking at a potentially multif front confrontation here we've we've seen this afternoon also some more Rockets coming in from Lebanon now they were intercepted they were no casualties reported but it is keeping tensions it's keeping definitely the military establishment very much on edge they're really looking towards the northern border as well and looking towards uh anything that might happen within the West Bank uh so you know the 300,000 troops being stationed all across the country but many of them you know most of them I I haard to guess would be stationed around here and are preparing for what Benjamin Netanyahu promises as a very strong Counterattack and could drag this could drag this war on for many weeks okay thanks that Rebecca and Rebecca aritas in southern Israel well Carlo Masala is a security expert and professor of international politics at the bundes University of Munich welcome to DW let's talk first of all about uh Israel's response is it likely to be limited to air strikes or are you expecting a ground war no I expect the ground war in the in the next hours in the next days to come because the declared goal political goal is the destruction of the military wing and the political party of Hamas and this can only be done by uh Ground Forces so therefore we will see a massive ground invasion in the days to come so a ground war in a very in a small area a particularly densely populated area this is not going to be a traditional war is it this is going to be Urban uh Warfare absolutely this is going to be Urban Warfare this is a three-dimensional War what I mean by this is uh I mean you have to expect that the enemy is attacking you from above from below from uh from the front and uh from behind you can't enter with mechanized vehicles uh you have to go in by infantry and you have to fight basically for house and house uh it's going to be a long War it's going to be extremely bloody and messy so Israel has said that it is not targeting ing uh civilians but given the density of the population there it is hard to see how civilians can avoid being hit and one wonders then if if if this is all preparation for the ground war if you level enough um uh blocks of of flats to give the enemy nowhere to hide then if you're sending troops in uh on the ground not in tanks but on on on foot that makes your job much easier no I mean it doesn't make your job much much easier the the the air campaign is a preparation for the ground war Israel has asked all civilians to leave Gaza um as far as I know Egypt will only accept 2,000 per day and uh there are 2.2 million people living in Gaza so uh it won't be possible that all the civilians are going to leave uh will be able to leave Gaza before the ground Invasion starts and then secondly we know from previous campaigns that um Hamas is using civilians as a kind of human Shields so therefore the the ground invasion is the alternative to bombing uh from above Gaza into rubbles so which means basically the chances for civilians to survive is much higher than if uh Israel would rely on a purely a air campaign but definitely we have to expect that also civilians are getting killed in this ground invasion is there more bearing in mind that this this ground invasion is still theoretical at this stage hasn't hasn't begun yet is there more that isra Israel could be doing to um uh prevent against civilian deaths well actually Israel did what what it could do uh to prevent a massive civilian casualties I mean asking people to leave Gaza um in in the framework of the air campaign doing uh roof knocking which basically means that you drop a small bomb on on the roof of of of a skyscraper or a house not causing much damage but basically alerting the civilians to leave the building because a quarter after that the real bomb will uh come into this uh house um sending uh short messages uh to um the civilians in Gaza where they can go in order to survive I mean places where the Israeli Air Force doesn't attack there is not much more Israel can do to prevent casualties uh civilian casualties uh once the ground Invasion starts and bear in mind Hamas will prevent civilians from leaving Gaza because they need them as human Shields as you've been speaking uh we've been looking a at live pictures of the destruction in Gaza let's take a step back now and the question that everyone is asking is how did Hamas manage to launch attacks and incursions on such a massive scale undetected by us or Israeli intelligence well this is I mean this is the the $6 million question for the time being I don't think that the Israeli uh Security Services didn't notice that there were some that there was something going on but I think that they uh took the the wrong conclusions or even worse they alerted uh Israeli politics and they ignored uh the advice of of the security service or basically the the analysis of the security service one way or the other this is a massive political failure and the massive failure of the Israeli Security Services and the other end of that question of course is how did Hamas manage to build up the resources to launch this unprecedented attack what how did they get how did how did they get hold of of the the the weapons in order to achieve this well first of all we haven't seen from from what we know from pictures and videos we haven't seen any weapons used in this attack which uh we didn't know that they are in the possession of Hamas so usually they get their weapons through tunnels smuggling mostly through Egypt provided by Iran but this is something which goes on for decades so we don't know about any new types of weapons they used so the weapons they used were the weapons we know Hamas was in possession with uh of but what was surprising was the coordination um of this attack because this attack happened from uh land from from air and from sea and the interplay between those three dimension is something which is usually unknown for Hamas right let's zoom out now is there a risk that the severity of Israel's response could draw The Wider region into this conflict well I don't think that uh this uh will depend on the severity of Israel's response I mean there there there might be the open I mean to save Hamas there might be the opening of a second front in the North of Israel by hisbah and then Israel will will face a twoof front War which uh will pose enormous challenges uh for Israel secondly imagine that Israel is able to crash Hamas and to defeat hisbah there might be an Iranian reaction and then we are in an uncontrollable situation in the whole region so this conflict has really the potential to to spill over to more uh uh to more actors in the region to more players in the region and become a kind of uncontrollable it's very clear good talking to you thanks for talking us through that Carlo Masala from bundes University Munich you're
