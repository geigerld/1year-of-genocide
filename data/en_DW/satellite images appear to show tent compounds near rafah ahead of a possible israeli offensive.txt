well Israel has said that it's preparing to evacuate Palestinians from the southern gazen city of Rafa and launch its Long awaited offensive there the Israeli government claims that the bulk of hamas's remaining forces are hiding out in Rafa the islamist militant group Hamas carried out the October 7th Terror attacks that triggered the war over a million internally displaced gazin are now living in Rafa media Reports say Israel has erected 4 ,000 tents to accommodate those who will be forced to move again once it begins its assault but this has yet to be officially confirmed satellite images show collections of tents that were not there earlier this month and let's pick up on that with our correspondent Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem Rebecca there are reports that Israel is now planning to carry out an offensive in Rafa in stages does that mean Israel is scaling back at original plan for a fullscale offensive that's very difficult to say Israel not giving away exactly what they plan to do but it is indeed all indications point to Israel pushing ahead with its planed offensive of Rafa they've said so themselves yesterday the Israeli military confirmed that the at least the two battalions two Reserve battalions that were called up to prepare for this imminent offensive that they were indeed ready and they were just waiting for a political green line night there are also reports yesterday that some very senior Israeli officials were in Egypt to talk to their Egyptian counterparts about this planned offensive obviously ra Rafa's proximity to the Egyptian border makes it slightly different to some of the other offensive we've seen in Gaza so far uh and so they were reportedly there to discuss their plans with the Egyptian authorities um when you talk about this phased plan that is what we're hearing although as I reiterate I'll reiterate that we don't have confirmation from Israel exactly what their plans are but this is what we're hearing that there is a kind of planned phase we know that the US have been putting on pressure for weeks particularly but also others including Germany uh to try to prevent the worst of a humanitarian catastrophe that would come with going in to in a into a rougher in a ground offensive with more than a million people Sheltering there uh so it does certainly appear and that's what we're hearing that this phased uh this phased you know plan phas bed offensive is to try to evacuate many of the civilians that are there we're hearing that it could take some weeks so though this offensive is due to begin is largely expected it could take some weeks yet Terry now satellite images are circulating that show new tent encampments in southern Gaza would those tents Rebecca be enough to accommodate an evacuation of Rafa well we think we talking around about 40,000 tents that's because we've heard that Israel have procured 40,000 tents they haven't uh given any acknowledgement or they haven't commented on whether or not these tent encaps that we're seeing uh via the satellite imagery is is their work we're also getting reports that they're being erected by Egyptians in the UAE uh but of course you know with the the approval and the you know coordination of the Israelis um you know we're talking about 40,000 T so far we're talking about a million or more than a million people in Rafa um I'll leave you to do the maths on that one I don't think we're going to see a full evacuation of Rafa but also we're getting a lot of reports on the ground that people civilians who were just exhausted from having moved sometimes up to five six other times in as they gradually have come down the strip from the north being evacuated into various different positions that they're just exhausted and they simply you know we've heard from so many people saying that they willing to just die in rougher that they don't want to evacuate anymore so we are hearing that this is going to be a slightly different offensive than the ones that we've seen perhaps more targeted in order to try to comply by those Us and other Allied demands uh to not um cause such a humanitarian catastrophe and to try to keep Cen casualties to a minimum but as I say you know this could take some weeks we are talking about more than a million people uh and just where they're all going to go really remains to be seen Terry Rebecca thank you very much as always our correspondent Rebecca ritters there in Jerusalem
