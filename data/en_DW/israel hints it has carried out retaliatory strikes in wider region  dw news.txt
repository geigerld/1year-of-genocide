Israel's defense minister says his country is facing a war on as many as seven fronts yav Galant says Israeli forces are responding to many of them Iranian back militias have stepped up attacks against Israel in response to Israel's efforts in Gaza to wipe out Hamas a group also linked to Iran and designated a terrorist organization by many countries on Monday a suspected Israeli air strike killed a senior Iranian General in Syria Iranian State television interrupted regular broadcasting to report the strike and the high ranking General's death security insiders say Sayad razi musab was responsible for coordinating the military alliance between Iran and Syria Iran backs a network of proxy militias across the Middle East to advance its interests and pressure its sworn enemy Israel mavi was killed in a suburb of the capital Damascus in a building allegedly used by Hezbollah an iran-backed militia that has been fighting Israel for decades Israel neither confirms nor denies having killed mavi I do not comment on actions according to foreign Publications any action in the Middle East obviously the IDF has a role to defend Israel's security interests the Iranian broadcast ended with the logo of Iran's revolutionary guards with a voice threatening retaliation on Israel for more now let's bring in Benta sheller she is the head of the Middle East and North Africa division at the hinish B foundation in Berlin thank you very much for joining us on DW first let's talk about this air strike what significance do you put on the killing of the Iranian General in Syria well apparently it has hit a really high ranking Iranian General this time but it is not that special we have seen many Israeli a strikes in Syria before and we have seen a list of really high ranking Iranian Personnel killed in Syria so it is one of the serious so to say right which brings me to my next question Israel and the United States have made a number of tit fortat strikes or what appear to be tit fortat strikes on a variety of targets we're talking about Syria Iraq the Red Sea do you view these as isolated incidents or are they part of some kind of larger strategy well I think we can see a pattern here first of all of course we know that Iran has expanded its role in the Middle East over the past decades and it has many proxies so we see here strikes on Iranian proxies what is obvious is that it is hitting Iranian targets that are outside of Iran because that avoids a direct and escalated confrontation with Iran itself but it sends messages we will hit your personal wherever we find them so you just mentioned the key word escalation do you view uh what we're seeing as a widening or an escalation of the fighting how big of a risk uh of that do you see well we can never be sure that there is no risk but I think that all the messages that we have seen from the other states in the region are not prone to escalate the situation if we may look at hisbah for example which is maybe the mightiest power directly on Israel's borders they have practiced considerable restraint there have been skirmishes there have been attacks across border however I think we see really a strategy of Hezbollah and Iran not to escalate but yeah from Israel's rhetoric we understand it sees itself in a war at seven fronts and that of CH meus because confrontations are not unilateral so we might see an escalation here also from the from the Israeli side and what about from the Iranian side because they I can imagine have to say face they are seen as this sort of powerful protector of a number of various uh interests across the Middle East just how much power do they have right now well they really have a vast network of proxies who can act on their behalf some of them however are also considerably independent hisb for example is also independent of Iran in many regards so I think Iran has the potential to manipulate powers that are outside of its borders but then can enhance the tension with Israel but I think allout confrontation is not in Iran's interest Israel has the might to hit Iran in a way that really would hurt and harm the Iranian potential and so far I don't think that Iran wants to risk losing all that and the United States they're also in a very delicate position supporting Israel opposing Iran not interested in escalation either what is the US role here in kind of balancing all those various uh pieces so to speak well for the US I think their interest has has been in the past years to stay out of the Middle East as far as possible but now let they see after the October 7th massacres Israel under threat I think they feel they need to engage they don't want to engage in Gaza obviously and so I think they take care of Targets in the region where they also see their own interests at stake and that is mainly Northern Syria North East Syria where they still have troops as well as Iraq where they feel a certain responsibility after the withdrawal that they should keep it calm in their own interest and this is why we are seeing them engaged here okay B to sh there with a view to the Middle East from the hinish B foundation in Berlin thanks very much thank
