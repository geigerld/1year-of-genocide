well Israel says it has killed one of the Hamas commanders that it targeted in an attack on a humanitarian Zone in Gaza on Saturday he was Rafa Salamar commander of the KH unun Brigade of the militant group Hamas which carried out the October 7th Terror attacks the Hamas run Gaza health authority says at least 90 Palestinians were also killed and hundreds more injured in the Israeli air strikes many of the casualties were Sheltering in a designated safe Zone near hunas Scott Anderson from the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza anra was at Nasa hospital where casualties were taken I mean very simply it was a scene of chaos a scene of Despair and a scene of not having enough aid for everyone that needs it uh Nasser hospital was just reconstituted not long ago after an operation in conun uh the hospital has 38 emergency beds and they already had 40 patients before the incident happened so they were very quickly overwhelmed uh over almost another 150 patients showed up at the hospital and as I said it was just very chaotic uh saw parents trying to find children children who didn't have parents um and it was very uh moving but not necessarily in a good way what we saw at the hospital yesterday they were trying to clean up blood water because they didn't have disinfectant so it's just a very difficult very difficult time for everyone and describe to us who these patients were who were being brought in um the patients that I saw were very much uh but look like innocent civilians there were a lot of children um I saw children as young as two years old and you know really up to 17 18 years old I saw children that were double mutts um I saw the 2-year-old child I saw they didn't know where her parents were her grandmother had found her um two girls I met were par ized I met one family and talked to the mother three of her children were impacted by what had happened uh one was paralyzed one was killed and one had no injuries at all um but everybody had very much same thing to say uh they went somewhere they thought they would be safe and unfortunately for them they were not and they were taken somewhere where it sounds like they can't be given proper treatment yeah that's correct I mean I think what they're basically doing is basic wound management and basic pain management um there doctors there have the technical capacity to do more including things like spinal fusion and and other things to try to you know mitigate the effects of back injuries but what they don't have is the equipment they don't have the Prosthetics and they don't have enough really of everything as I said they're missing disinfectant uh fuel shortages have been prevalent across Gaza and even though we prioritized hospitals unfortun fortunately there's not always enough fuel to go around so it was also very warm um as I said the the whole thing was very difficult and you know talking to the doctors they find it very frustrating because they've trained to be able to provide care for people like this when these sort of incidents happen and it's their people in many cases it's their families or their extended families uh but because of the circumstances that they find themselves and they're unable to provide the care that we would expect and we're talking about a dire situation here at these hospitals how long can this one keep operating in the very basic uh situation that it's operating under I mean I think it'll keep working as long as they can as long as they have any supplies to try to treat people um they were trying to expand the bed capacity last night by setting tents up outside in the parking lot uh just so everybody could have a bed um I mentioned the limited capacity in the emergency room and you saw people or patients really anywhere and everywhere on benches on anything that they could be laid on some on the floor um so the doctors are doing their very best to try to make it work um they were close to being overwhelmed uh but they will continue to do everything they can to provide care for the people that come there as well as the other hospitals that are operating in Gaza the other thing I wanted to ask you was uh the tally at the moment Health officials in Gaza say over 38,500 people have died in this war how are they actually managing to put a number on that I mean I think it's not particularly scientific um at a macro level I think they do know everybody that has lost their lives uh the details of are they women are they children men ages is is much harder to gather and in many cases you know an apartment building could have been uh could have suffered from an attack or been bombed or collateral damage and there's people still trapped inside so they go based on who they think is inside and they do try to verify as we move forward um but I think at the macro level the numbers are close but at the micro level at the granular trying to figure it out you're not sure um you know the one thing I would say that is needed desperately in Gaza is a ceasefire results in the return of the hostages respit for people in Gaza and a chance for them to begin rebuilding their lives thank you very much for the insights H Scott Anderson and uh good to have you on the show again thank you
