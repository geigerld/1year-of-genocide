We Begin this Monday with increasing international calls for Israel to scale back its assault on Gaza and that includes from its closest Ally the United States us defense secretary Lloyd Austin was in Tel Aviv on Monday to talk to Israeli leaders about how they could better protect civilians in the war against Hamas a group considered a terrorist organization by numerous countries now according to the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza the death toll in the Gaza Strip has now surpassed pass 19,400 shocked and in grief these people in Gaza Central City of derel Bala mourn the loss of their loved ones and as in many of the past Israeli strikes many of those hit are children scenes like these are increasing pressure on is to protect civilians a call also echoed by the US defense secretary Lloyd Austin protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral duty and a strategic imperative so we will continue to stand up for Israel's Bedrock right to defend itself and we will also continue to urge the protection of civilians during conflict and to increase the flow of humanitarian Aid into Gaza that's important as Israel fights to dismantle the Hamas ter ter is infrastructure in Gaza Israel says it is targeting Hamas militants but the fighting has led to one of the worst humanitarian crisis ever in Gaza food and clean water has become scarce for the strips over 2 million people and according to the UN 90% of the population has been displaced I brought some water from our neighbor over there I brought the water and we needed dough we don't have a single drop of water left there is nothing at all the head of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees has warned that gazans could start dying of hunger disease and weak immunity along with the eight entering Gaza through the Rafa Crossing trucks have also started entering from Israel via Karam Shalom but the UN says the conditions on the ground are unsuitable for delivering humanitarian supplies many see a halt in fighting as the only solution an urgent call that's now being echoed by many of Israel's allies all right for more now we want to cross over to journalist Sammy soal in Jerusalem Samy you followed that press conference what more can you tell us so uh secretary Austin was talking uh not only about the uh humanitarian Aid that has to go into the Gaza Strip and not only about the Palestinian lives but he was also talking is specifically about the surgical strikes that Israel has to adopt surgical strikes uh there have been close talks between the the parties and they went into details of how the next stages should be at the same time Austin was saying that he doesn't give Israel any deadlines and this was also reiterated by yav Galant himself is that he was saying that there's no ticking clock and that the Israeli operation will continue but they have agreed to further have a closer coordination with the continuing of the campaign he said that America is giving advice to the Israelis and galand was saying that they're listening to the advice so they're listening to the that advice are you seeing then Samy any signs that Israel might be looking at changing its strategy in Gaza well I must say that on the ground you really don't see it and you know today there was a Human Rights Watch report talking about Hunger as a strategy and they talking about the severe situation in the Gaza Strip the strikes are continuing inside the the Gaza Strip and uh it's not clear yet when this actually will materialize into a change in the way Israel is waging its campaign in Gaza this might be something that will take time the Prime Minister we know that he is under a lot of pressure from outside of the country what about domestic pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu yeah what we've seen following the killing of the three hostages that there is a surge of anger among the families of the hostages among those who were released uh they were saying that what happened there is actually a reflection that the military operating in the Gaza Strip is not focused at looking for hostages uh but rather focusing on a different Mission which is a Revenge Mission targeting Hamas and we've seen these kind of demonstrations at the same time I must tell you that many people in Israel believe that netan is committed to continuing this war and he's attaching his political future with the extension of the war as this is something that can play for him since the failure of the 7th of October is very much identified with him a victory over Hamas could be saving him politically in the Israeli internal Arena journalist Samy soal with the ladies tonight from Jerusalem Samy as always thank you Tanya K is the W's correspondent in Jerusalem and earlier I asked her whether the growing International pressure on Israel is having any effect on the government there well there's certainly more International pressure but it doesn't seem to have a visible impact yet on uh the Israeli government here or their decisions we've actually heard again from prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu over the weekend uh saying that for Israel to achieve its goal uh it needs to keep up the military pressure uh to um uh topple Hamas uh to dismantle their military capabilities and also to uh release potentially more Israeli hostages that are being held in Gaza now we're expecting also uh in this regard the US defense secretary Lloyd OS arrived in Israel now uh to talk about this he said uh that he will uh talk uh with his counterparts about the Ironclad commitment of the United States to Israel uh in its War efforts but he also said that there needs to be more uh done to protect civilians in Gaza and that more aid needs to be flowing into Gaza now we've seen Israel has uh some sort of reopened one of its crossing the Kum Shalom Crossing at least uh to uh for some more trucks to go in there but on the ground uh uh humanitarian organizations are saying in Gaza the situation is as dire the impact is not that felt because over 1.9 million uh people gazans residents they have been displaced most of them multiple times uh during this war mainly now to the South the Aid distribution is very uh difficult and also the death toll is mounting every day a un Security Council vote on a ceasefire resolution for Gaza set to take place on Monday has reportedly been postponed to allow further negotiations as Israel continues its war against Hamas in the territory Human Rights Watch has accused it of using starvation as a weapon the Rights Watch Dog says that it has evidence that Israel is deliberately starving civilians and blocking deliveries of food water and fuel into Gaza Israel denies the accusations and has accused the group of anti-Semitism my next guest is Bushra khi she is from Oxfam and she joins us from rala in the occupied West Bank it's good to have you with us this evening um Human Rights Watch watch accusing Israel of committing war crimes saying that its forces are deliberately blocking the delivery of Aid such as water food and fuel what's your take on this accusation um it's important to differentiate the Mandate that Human Rights Watch and Oxfam have where a humanitarian organization we deliver Aid we work within an international humanitarian law framework we don't make determinations of war crimes or investigate human rights VI viation we monitor them so that they inform our policy position but from what we know before October 7th we know that Israel was in great violation of its duties and responsibilities towards gaza's population as the main as the occupier um it occupies Gaza it controls Gaza it controls all the borders of Gaza um it controls how much goes in and comes out of Gaza whether that's people or goods and that's before the 7th of October that Siege was tightened uh on the 9th of October um in response to the atrocities of the 7th of October um switching off electricity water uh restricting Aid um and preventing fuel from entering Gaza is collective punishment and that does amount to war crime um and using stration as a weapon of War we also you know have evidence from um crops being completely destroyed uh the wheat Mill not able to the only wheat Mill in Gaza not able to operate um and currently we only have 5 to 10% of needs being met with the delivery of Aid inside Gaza all of this points to grave violations violations of international law where we have people literally almost starving to death in Gaza right now and let me ask you too Israel says that it is doing everything in its power to protect civilians in Gaza is that the impression that you and your team on the ground are getting well that was another point I wanted to answer in my in your prev previous question is another thing that points to um war crimes are the indiscriminate nature of the attacks uh we have seen an entire Health Care System collaps we're talking about a c a city of 2.2 million people this is a large city it's very densely populated there's over 30 hospitals um most of them are are barely running uh if running at all in the north it's the situation is even more frightening we have the situation at Kamal adwan um uh hospital where it's been besieged and have people inside trapped um we've heard horrific reports from what's happening in the north uh we know that women are you know I mean we have a complete Health Care collapse there's no there's been tar targeted um attacks on un shelters on bakeries on solar panels um uh so all of this points to the indiscriminate nature of um the attacks over the course of the past two and a half months in Gaza Miss KH let me ask you too about um some videos that serviced on Sunday sh Palestinians chasing after um climbing onto moving Aid trucks at the Rafa border crossing I mean this looks like the picture of desperation how would you describe the current situation on the ground in Gaza I'd like to if you permit me read a quote from my brother-in-law who I spoke to yesterday and I transcribed the conversation with him um if I may okay we've hit a point of complete exhaustion there's simply nothing to eat even if the war were to stop right now it almost feels meaningless life itself seems meaningless we're like the walking dead devoid of Life Aid is scarce where I'm staying now we have nothing no food no electricity no water the effort to find and break wood for fire just to eat something is backbreaking even basic needs like using the bathroom becomes a challenge without water the Relentless task of maintaining a fire is the most draining thing I've been using garlic cloves to treat my fever and flu because medicine is nowhere to be found the constant Buzz of the drones is unbearable you don't understand it eats in my bones it's so loud constantly interrupting sleep and conversation yet we find ways to cope we we joke and we sing we still have hope but we need to conserve energy of what comes next you know what they say the Afterparty Bu khi from Oxfam we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts and to share the thoughts as well as others about the situation on the ground there in Gaza thank you than you thank you for more on the situation in Gaza we can now talk to Juliet tumar she's a director of communications for the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees and joins us from the Jordanian Capital Aman which borders Israel jilad Human Rights Watch accusing Israel of committing war crimes there saying its forces are deliberately blocking the delivery of Aid such as food and water has your agency seen anything that would confirm those very serious accusations look while we are not at all in a position at onra to determine whether um it is a war crime or not what I can tell you for sure is that food fuel water and information they've all been used as weapons of war um during this um brutal brutal uh 70 days if you recall for the first two weeks since the war started there was a total hermetic Siege on the Gaza Strip and nothing has come in including food or water so do you confirm then the allegations that uh human uh Rights Watch level at Israel like I said I'm not in a position uh to confirm that I'm here to give you the latest on the ground and what has been happening since the beginning of the war and there there has been serious restrictions on access uh of humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip that also included um food Fuel and water and since then there's been very very little um of these critical supplies allowed into Gaza and not enough and um do not match at all the overwhelming humanitarian needs on the ground now Israel says it's doing everything in its power to protect civilians in Gaza is that the impression that you are your team on the ground are getting currently well 136 um under colleagues have been killed so far uh we have also reports that 70% of um those killed in the Gaza Strip since the war started are believed to be women and children when it comes to United Nations facilities Andra where I work where I work we have recorded more than 170 hits on our facilities including those who uh we were using as as shelters and in those uh incidents uh we had uh at least uh 1,000 people injured nearly 200 people killed and these facilities are United Nations facilities and they need to be protected at all times including in times of conflict by all parties now the UN Security Council will vote on another resolution calling for an urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities in Gaza short of a ceas Fab do you see any other option to get Aid into Gaza there needs to be a ceasefire a humanitarian ceasefire that will also allow the United Nations and other uh humanitarian agencies to bring in much needed supplies without conditions uh with a regular flow of basic supplies I mean look we're talking about the basics here people are coming to anra and saying to us what am I going to do with a can of beans because this is all I have for the coming three days for me and my children we are down to delivering one bottle of water and a can of tuna to a family of six or seven it's that bad Julet tumar there director of communications for the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees thank you very
