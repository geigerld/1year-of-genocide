more than 200 people kidnapped by Hamas on the 7th of October are still being held hostage yarden Roman is one of them she was visiting family in kabot bear with her husband Alo and three-year-old daughter geffin when the militants attacked her brother Gilly Roman has been in Washington seeking support from senators and representatives DW's Washington bureau chief inis pole reports Gilly Roman has been at the Holocaust Memorial Museum before this time the German Israeli didn't come to Washington to learn about the past but to fight for the future of his sister yarden Roman on Saturday morning we all got into the shelters I got to the shelter in Tel Aviv she got to the shelter in B next to Aza so I asked like which teddy Bear got into the shelter which teddy bear was left out and she was kind of frustrated that the favorite teddy bears were were kind of neglected outside and the GE and my my nie may be upset with her and I said leave it she will meet the teddy bears you will be okay yarden hit with her husband Alon and GTH but it wasn't going to be okay the shelter wasn't a safe place they were taken uh the three of them inside a vehicle with four armed terrorists towards Gaza and at a certain point next to the Border they decided to escape they ran out side jumped out of the moving car Gan was holding gean in her hands and there was started running towards the forest like a small Forest trying to find shelter the tourist noticed them started to run after them shooting at them trying to either kill them or capture them again then y then found understood that she cannot run fast enough so she just gave the most pressure thing in her life to the hands of her husband alone and he managed to run away really fast and fight a hiding spot where he was hiding with geen until dark dark time more than 12 hours with no food no water nothing then they started to slowly get into the Kut Jewish groups here in the US are financing Gilly Roman's trip to Washington so he can meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill it's crucial for us to convey the message that time is running out and we have to be vocal and we have to act and we need them to stand with us to express this message on the senate floor to ensure that people do not forget that there are still over 200 people alive that can still be saved today tomorrow if I could speak with you then right now and to deliver a message to her it's clear that the first thing that I would tell her is that GE and her daughter is alive and the brave act that she has done to run away and to give Gein to her husband alone was worthwhile and Gein is safe and happy and and secure with us back at the Holocaust Memorial Museum Gilly Roman lays out the connections between then and now our family story comes from what we are seeing here from the Holocaust that my grandmother my German grandmother managed to run away just the day afterr all of her family except from her brother has died there and she taught us how important it is to have a state and to have a secure Homeland for ourselves un fortunately it's not completely secure if my sister had to to run away also from people trying to kill her just because she's Jewish and trying to shoot at her and her innocent child but it's crucial for us to keep this security and to have also Germany by our side that with us so we have to have a safe space in this world well gersan Basin is an Israeli Peace activist who helped negotiate the release of Israeli soldier gillad shalet who was held hostage by Hamas for more than 5 years welcome back at to DW um you've been in direct contact with Hamas at quite a senior level for some time now but now when perhaps such communication channels might be particularly valuable you've broken off contact tell us why no I haven't broken off contact I'm still in contact with some Hamas members they have gone silent over the last days which is usually an indication that something serious is going on at least that's what I hope I broke contact with the main interlocutor who I've been in contact with for 17 years the person who was on the other side of the negotiations for the release of gilat chalit and 1227 prisoners Dr AI hammed who until recently was the minister of social Affairs in Gaza and a member of the poit bureo making decisions in Gaza he actually left Gaza about two months ago and he's been in Beirut and he has acted as the primary spokesperson defending Hamas and legitimizing the terrorism that they did in Israel on October 7th in a recent interview that he gave in Beirut in Arabic he declared that Hamas was justifying in what it did and will continue to do it and wish that there will be many October 7s and said that Israel the state of Israel needed to be annihilated it was an unjust and illogical State and he crossed the line when he denied that they did what they did and said that they would redo it again and again this is no longer someone who I can have any respect for and see as a potential interlocutor in a very difficult n negotiation to save human lives and you wrote an open letter in which you said I think you have lost your mind and you have lost your moral code I never want to speak to you again very personal words yeah went I went deeper and I explained what I was talking about and also the context of having a relationship with this man for 17 years and having succeeded in negotiating several ceasefires and even on the day that gilad sharit was released together with the Palestinian prisoners at 7 o' in the morning he called me and said to me next time we'll negotiate peace for the last years we've been talking about the relation of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers in Gaza and two civilians who are alive in Gaza and we've talked about possibilities of long-term understandings and ceasefires but something happened to this man and he is not the same person that I've known we've met four times face to face we've talked about life we've talked about our families we've talked about religion everything that normal people talk about but he has become a monster and defending the acts of monster and on the the the hostages who are still being held should we believe Hamas when they claim that Israeli hostage were killed in Israeli air strikes we don't know I wouldn't believe a word that they say as I caution everyone everything that's said around the issue of the hostages by Israel by Hamas by Qatar by Egypt by anyone is all part of the negotiations the release of the videotape of the three women the release of two women and then another two women this is all part of a framework of negotiation of creating an environment of pressure on on the government of Israel on one side on Hamas on the other side the Israeli incursion into Gaza not going all the way and not yet going into the tunnels is aimed at putting pressure on Hamas with regard to the hostages I think that we have to be categorical here and we have to say that the hostages must be freed the women the children the infants the elderly the sick and the woman have to be released and released without a payment because it's not only against international law to to do this to hold them cast captives they're innocent non-combatants it's against Islam it's against the Quran it's say specifically that you don't attack women and children and elderly and you certainly don't hold them as hostage and it's interesting that you you talk about um uh all of this as as part of the negotiation as as part of the the game if I can put it that way when when Hamas released four hostages and what they said were humanitarian grounds last week in in two sets what was that about then what what what pressure was releasing part of your leverage uh putting on presumably on the Israeli government it wasn't a Hamas strategic decision to leas release them we need to see The Wider context the first two hostages who were released are American citizens they were specifically named by President Biden and secretary blinkin to the qataris and the and the Americans put a lot of pressure on the qataris to pressure Hamas and they delivered this was a sign of Qatar being a serious partner in these negotiations despite the problematics of Qatar involved in these negotiations several days later the Egyptians managed to release two other hostages who were not American citizens in fact only had Israeli citizenship and they were released directly by the Kasam forces the military wing of Hamas and this was essentially the competition between Qatar and Egypt showing who's a better negotiator who's more important here where should the emphasis be placed who should the Americans support um as a peace activist you you have said in the past and I'm I'm quoting you now I have called Israel's bombing of innocent civilians in Gaza a war crime um do you stand by that I Do I Do stand by that I think that there's a human catastrophe taking place in Gaza the numbers of innocent non-combatants being killed is intolerable and and Israel should be fighting its battles without endangering so many civilians so many citizens in Gaza I want to say though that I think it's completely Justified for Israel to say no ceasefire without hostages being released in fact even humanitarian Aid going into Gaza should be linked to hostages being released the pressure should be applied on Hamas and not on Israel with regard to humanitarian Aid in fact I have said that Israel should announce that Israel is willing to bring humanitarian Aid of its own water and food and medic supplies to the Innocents of Gaza but Hamas must be pressured to release hostages immediately time is running out that's very clear thank you so much for for joining us former Israeli hostage negotiator aoson abaskin thank you let's hear from Galia gam Mahi now she was born and raised in Israel now lives in Los Angeles in the United States she sadly lost two family members in the Hamas terrorist attack and four of her relatives are still missing in her cousin nadf and his 20-year-old daughter were murdered in the Hamas attack on their kibuts on October the 7th nf's wife Chen their teenage daughter aam and their small Sons gal and T are believed to have been kidnapped by Hamas Galia welcome to DW how did you find out your family was among the victims um on the day the attack happened uh I was here in the US uh preparing for my flight um back home and um we have a WhatsApp group where we're all connected and it was a Jewish holiday and very early in the morning Israel time we started getting the messages that the kabut is being attacked and my cousin and his family uh took refuge in their safe room in the house um after about 20 hours or so we lost contact with them and we started fearing for the worst fast forward into Sunday and Monday um um we uh learned that uh um from the IDF that were able to go into the house that they suspected that there were four bodies uh in the room uh where they were hiding and that two Miss are missing and in those first few hours we had hoped that maybe the little boys tal and gal were managed to escape uh there was a lot of confusion there was a lot of fighting it was an active uh fighting area and we were getting conflicted information um into the second week of the war um we were able to get concrete information that there were only two bodies in the room that were my family members it took many days to identify them because they were dismembered and burned and we were able to confirm that it was my cousin naav and his 20-year-old daughter because she had a butterfly tattoo and he recently had surgery um and he had Stitch es and he had a metal plate um he had a bicycling accident and he was recovering uh so we were able to figure out that it's him and then the four the wife and other children were missing for a long period of time missing meant two things they were either in a pile somewhere I hate to say it unrecognizable or kidnapped uh there wasn't any evidence as to where they were and um last week we got concrete evidence from the IDF intelligence community that they have confirmation that they were indeed kidnapped that day and that's really all we know at this point so you know nothing about where or how they are no so that is that is the agony and the anguish that we're facing right now is that we don't know where they are we don't know what condition or if they were injured uh in the process C of being kidnapped we don't know if the mom and the kids are together we don't know if they're um held in the tunnels below ground in the dark as some witnesses have told us from the recently um liberated umap piece or they're in a home somewhere um we haven't slept all we can think about is are they hurt uh how are the little boys are they with their mom or not did the boys witness their father being killed um what did they see on the way how was their Journey um there have been no to any of the hostages not just my family there's been no proof of life there's been no uh videos uh no Red Cross uh delegation that was able to go into Gaza to see you know what's happened to all of these people we're in the complete darkness yeah and it has been terrible terrible ter terrible to to just speculate and not know what's happened to our family it sounds like an absolute nightmare you say you went back to Israel shortly after the attacks how did that feel how was that for you I just didn't think about it I just started I booked a flight um I also heard that there was a lot of distress and there was because of the attack was so sudden and the Army was calling a lot of reservists to come and help in the fight they were um short on a lot of supplies um so my husband and I took three extra suitcases we had a friend who's in the Army and we brought with us um cell phone batteries and little LED lights for helmets and any supplies that we could to to help people um and then I just got on an L flight the only Airline who was flying 14 hours uh in fear and in sorrow um and from the minute I got there it was a Non-Stop um action um a lot of Sorrow um you know attending funerals uh talking to family members and just really being immersed in in like what's happening in Israel um at the moment part of why this was so shocking to people in Israel is that the country was built on a promise of Safety and Security for the Jewish people will your home country ever be the same to you after this so thank you for asking that um I think we're currently in National trauma and I think really World trauma right I mean the things that we've witnessed the eyewitness testimony that we've heard the video we've seen I don't think our brains or human beings were created to even process these kinds of thoughts or these kinds of images um I think that we will uh overcome this um but we're never going to be the same yeah Gia I I don't know if you're even in a place to think about politics right now but do you think Israel is doing everything it can to get the hostages released so um you know it's a complex question I would tell you that um I have confidence in the conversations and the back channeling that has happened my family stances when they're asked do you know more are you not sharing uh what the Army told you or what the intelligence have have told you our stances even if we knew we're not going to say because we don't want to sabotage the chance of getting them back I would say that um I think there in there's the American intelligence community and other nations uh are helping um and and I would like to have faith and trust in the system that everything is being done to get innocent civilians back yeah um there is a political divide um I will not deny that the attack caught us by surprise that there was a delay in response right internal um forces took a long time to get there and to protect us and these are things that will be addressed and will be uh looked at when this is done yeah but right now everybody's very United in the National Focus to get peace and to get everyone back no matter if they're Israeli or not all nationalities all human beings who are held in captivity need to come back home to their loved ones thank you so much for speaking to us today Galia for you know sharing your story and that of your family and we're really hoping for some good news soon thank you so much I really appreciate the time and opportunity thank you thank you so
