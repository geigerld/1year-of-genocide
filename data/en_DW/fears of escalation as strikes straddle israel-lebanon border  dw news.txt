and there are also mounting fears of an escalation in the conflict on Israel's border with Lebanon Lebanese officials say four civilians including three children have been killed in an Israeli air strike near the southern town of inata the Israeli military says it is examining the incident lebanon's Hezbollah militant group has responded by firing rockets at the northern Israeli town of Kat scha let's speak to DW's special correspond Aman ISF joining me from the Lebanese Capital Beirut Aman Lebanese officials have said that four Lebanese civilians have been killed in an Israeli air strike what more can you tell us well authorities in Lebanon say that this was a strike from an Israeli drone it seems like it was a direct hit on this car that was carrying uh three young girls aged 10 12 and 14 their mother and their grandmother the grandmother also died as well as these three children the mother uh was uh severely injured but she was pulled alive from the from the car by her brother he was a Leones journalist who was driving in front of that car in a sort of Caravan uh he said that uh there was no other possible targets for Israel in the area and a lot of Lebanese are speculating that he was himself the target he um Israel has also killed a Lebanese joural journalist very early on in this latest con conflict Hezbollah the militant Group which is backed by Iran and basically controls the south of Lebanon said that is going to uh that it has retaliated um killing one Israeli but no word yet if that is a civilian or uh military personnel now these incidents sound certain to raise tensions um are there signs of further border with Lebanon well the Lebanese government seems to be going the official route they said they're lodging a complaint an urgent complaint to the UN against this strike on a civilian Target by the Israeli military but don't forget that it's not the Israel not the Lebanese government that has control in the South but rather Hezbollah which is the largest party but it's backed by Iran and and operates somewhat autonomously in the region there uh they said that Israel has to pay the price for this attack and we have to see in the next few days what exactly they mean by that now the leader of Hezbollah Hassan nasala said last week basically that he doesn't intend to change the status quo that all of the actions there are uh being calculated but one wild card here is the presence of Hamas in Lebanon now Hamas is a Palestinian party it doesn't have that much power in Lebanon but there are 250,000 Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon and since the uh Terror attacks on October 7th and the resulting attack on Gaza which has killed thousands of civilians Hamas has started to gain a lot more popularity among these Palestinians I went to one of the large refugee camps here just south of Beirut and you can hear what they told me Crossing into bour alaraj Palestinian refugee camp Giants of the Palestinian cause watch over you some say that 20,000 people live here in less than 2 square km that would make it as dense as Gaza City the similat ities between the two places are hard to miss makeshift block houses narrow streets un facilities providing Aid every street here is strung with this mass of wires and water pipes they were actually built by the residents themselves with the help of Aid organizations that's because this Camp isn't serviced or inspected by Lebanese authorities it's kind of a world apart a little Palestine where residents are basically sitting and waiting to go back to their original homelands deep inside the maze of streets we meet an elderly woman who was born in Taria in present day Israel but was forced to flee in 1948 when she was just 2 years old she's lived her whole life as a refugee in recent weeks she's done little but watched the news and grieve I've been watching from the first day of course I have it's my family and my friends of course I've been watching my dear May Muhammad protect all of the people of Gaza and with the help of Muhammad we'll all return to our country the militant group Hamas has never had much of a foothold here in bourj baraji but its name has appeared scribbled on walls in recent [Applause] weeks some people celebrated the Hamas Terror attacks on October 7th in these [Music] streets now they're furious at the Israeli response imod was born here he got a degree in business management in Beirut but because he's a refugee he's barred from most jobs outside the camp so he sells flavored ice from a motorbike I do feel a very strong connection with Gaza I feel like one of them when I see a building collapse or a child dying I get goosebumps and I feel anxious and angry about it so if a war starts in Lebanon I would join the resistance to defend Palestine my family and my kids are not better than the ones dying in Gaza I ask him if he condones hamas's killing over over 1,000 Israeli civilians in October he denies without evidence that they were the targets of the attacks there's an increase in violent anti-israel sentiment here as the news of Civilian deaths and Gaza plays on TVs across the camp but at the same time there's a growing fear of what might happen if Hamas and its allies were to draw Israel into a wider War the Palestinian guys if you see here in the camp like my brother or my men cousins they are able to have a gun and go to the borders to to to kill the Israeli and this is our land and we want it back do you think that it's wise to not provoke Israel so that Lebanon stays out of the war as you see the building in the camp they are not well maintained they are not so it's one bomb they will let the camp fall down so I will die so for sure I I I don't want war and I think no one in Lebanon wants war and we don't also want peace with Israel so that's it dreading War unwilling to accept peace it's a contradiction that runs through this camp Aman thank you for that report and we saw there those examples of support for Hamas within that refugee camp I'm curious whether you felt that Hamas is gaining more of a foothold in Lebanon as a result of the war I don't know if it is gaining a permanent foothold uh that is to say that fat is still the dominant political uh Power in these refugee camps don't forget fat is uh more moderate uh Palestinian party secular uh believes in a two-state solution this is what Mahmud Abbas is from uh so this still remains in power there uh and tamas doesn't really have a foothold in that sense but in terms of popularity they've certainly grown a lot more popular since October 7th you saw the celebrations in the streets there and a lot of people grieving what's happening in Gaza now with the Israeli bombardments there's been a kind of radicalization going on you could you could see playing there's news playing on TVs in almost every corner Non-Stop and they're getting a kind of filtered version of what's happened uh especially on October 7th people I talked to denied that civilians uh were the targets of the Hamas Terror attacks because they're getting videos that uh don't explicitly show that um that isn't to deny that there is a certain violence a swell up of violence in these Palestinian refugee camps a lot of people there uh uh have the feeling that something has to change don't forget that we're almost in the fourth generation of refugees has been living in Lebanon uh as refugees meaning they can't really work in most jobs they're contained to these camps for four generations without prospects of a future and for a lot of them uh having a two-state solution or going back to uh their grandparents homelands is an existential question for them and so in a very tragic way any kind of movement on the Palestinian Israeli question is uh some kind of hope for them and uh they see that in what is happening uh in the in the region right now despite how tragic it is uh so I wouldn't say that Hamas has a foothold necessarily but certainly people are watching this and saying perhaps something is moving now despite all the violence that is going on Amy and thank you so much for your insights that's DW's
