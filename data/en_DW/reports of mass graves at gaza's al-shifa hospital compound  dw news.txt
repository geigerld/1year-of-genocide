we begin at gaza's main hospital and reports that officials there have dug a mass grave to bury scores of bodies with refrigeration out for days morg staff say that they had no choice Israeli forces are said to have surrounded the alifa complex Israel says that Hamas militants have their main command center underneath the hospital doctors have been left with no electricity and very little fuel but the World Health Organization says that doctors are still doing all they can to care for their patients filmed just a few days ago this video apparently shot inside gaza's alifa Hospital gives a sense of just how many people have been crowded inside and according to medical staff at the facility dozens of newborns have now been removed from incubators and placed together on beds in the open so they are literally in in a very bad situation where you slow kill them unless someone interferes to adjust or to improve their situation but these are very critical kind of cases where you have to be uh very sensitive in dealing with them you have to take care of each of them in a very special way but currently they are all in open space they are all with each others with no infection control measures Israel's ground offensive has been moving ever closer to the gates of Al for hospital in recent days with the US president joining the growing international calls for restraint well uh you know I have not been reluctant in expressing my concern what's going on um and is my hope and expectation that uh there will be uh less intrusive action relative to the hospital the hospital must be protected Israel's military has accused us Hamas of using hospitals to hide command centers and weapons and it's now released footage of what it says is a children's hospital in Gaza the tunnel is Led down more than 20 M down the robot found a door a door that is bulletproof it's a it's explosives proof alleging Hamas had held hostages in rooms beneath the hospital now we are now in the area of the basement of the hospital along with a cach of weapons and explosives the hospital I want you to understand this kind of gear is a gear for a major fight these are explosives these are vest vest with explosives yeah it's a body vest for terrorists to explode on forces among hospitals among patients hospitals are given special protection during times of War but Israel argues that hamas's use of medical facilities as cover overrides any legal safeguards as it intensifies its ground offensive inside the Gaza [Music] Strip well I'm joined on the phone now by Dr Maran abusada he's head of surgery at alifa hospital in Gaza doctor we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us again today we have reports of mass Graves being dug at alifa Hospital what can you tell us about that H yes yes the people the medical staff here decid to bury the dead bodies here because because around more than 100 dead bodies are in the open space and they are a source of outbreaks and infection so we succeeded this morning to open a big hole as a mass grave and we bur till now 82 dead bodies in that grave so and tomorrow we'll continue the work still there are huge number of dead bodies are outside in the open space and some of them they are in the refrigerator but unfortunately the refrigerator is not functioning because of lack of electricity yeah and dror the the World Health Organization it says that your hospital is still somehow functioning um help our viewers understand how in the world is it possible for you to to doctor people in such conditions yeah okay we are we are Prov here the minimal care for our patients yes we don't have electricity we have a Darkness yes but we are depending on solar energy so we can Prov provide some solar energy today we performed some surgeon yesterday we performed 15 surgery for our patient without oxygen what is called in total IV anesthesia and using the air bumping the air normal air air not the oxygenated air for the patient especially for ad adult it is a risky to give it for the children and to the new but for the adults it is acceptable in this condition this is not the ideal condition what we working it but we can provide this and also for the babies we still are keeping these babies in the open space it's not put atmosphere to to raise and to take a care of this things but okay this is what we have because we are we are run out of oxygen and also we run out of electricity so we are keeping in one big theater in our uh our theat operating theater what what about the we hear that um there are dozens of babies whose lives are at risk what are you doing to to keep those babies alive I mean if you don't have electricity I'm assuming you don't have incubators for the babies no yes we are putting in a bed we are putting a heat blanket sheet beneath them and we are covering them with a Sullivan paper and we are heating the room inside in the the room the atmosphere of the room is hot but we are afraid sometimes we run we have electricity for especially for designated electricity for this room so to keep the environment in this room hot and not to have not these babies to have a hypothermic and so and we feed them and this is under the control of consultant in neolog the head of department and we have staff to take a care this is the this is the only solution but the best solution for that is to provide the fuel and to repair the oxygen generator and we can place this patient these babies in our inal IU really we are fortuned to have incubator but we cannot replace them in this room because we don't have the oxygen for them and so on okay doctor do you know has anyone been able to leave have they evacuated from the hospital or is it simply too dangerous for anyone to leave the grounds of alifa no as a person as a medical person I cannot leave this hospital and to live to to live this Hospital 50 patient in this Hospital aart of them we 600 injured we have around 45 patients within the stage R Al Fara who are in in hemodialysis they have to have hemodialysis unfortunately for the days they did not perform any kind of hemodialysis and they are going to die if we not perform this is kind of hemo dialis for them they are a resent they are captured inside the hospital they cannot move anywhere so this is the issue for this people Dr Mar abusada head of surgery at alifa hospital in Gaza doctor we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us tonight thank you thank you byebye we're from Gaza to Israel I'm joined Now by Sami so he's a correspondent covering the story forest from Jerusalem tonight Sami US President Joe Biden he has urged Israel to protect civilians at alifa hospital and to use and I'm quoting here less intrusive tactics is that likely to influence Israel's milit AR operations I can tell you that the Americans are also suggesting that there will be an evacuation from the uh shifa hospital that will be done by a third party that means that there will be some International force that will come and solve this uh problem because Israel is determined and the Israeli military is determined to take over the Hospital IDF spokesperson and Minister of Defense theyve all been saying that the shifa hospital and under the shifa hospital is where you have Hamas Fighters and they're talking about the network of tunnels that exist in the Gaza Strip that are used by Hamas and that are linked together with the shifa hospital and they View shifa Hospital as a military Target and we just heard the the other day the Israeli foreign minister saying that it believes that there will be International pressure on Israel in two or three weeks that means that until now Israel does not really feel that there is pressure on it and and Timmy do we have any idea who that third party would be that you mentioned no I mean this is just a kind of like a new new suggestion that is being bounced but we're talking about a party that is is clearly not Israeli or Palestinian International uh maybe the World Health Organization but I think that at this stage Israel is not too keen on having any kind of foreign intervention and it wants to have a full control of what's happening on the ground and Sammy what about the hostages being held in Gaza what is what's an update on efforts to release them or to get them released well there's a a cabinet meeting uh and this cabinet is have to make a serious decisions as to the kind of deal whether Israel will go ahead and agree to the kind of deal that's being discussed with the moderation of katar of course also the the Egyptians are also involved we have the head of the shinb the Israeli Security Services is now in Egypt but it seems that Kat is playing the leading role in these negotiations there different kinds of formulas according to one formula the first wave of hostages that will be released will be a children so all the miners from Gaza will be released and Israel will also release Palestinian miners in Israeli prisons and then we're talking about the release of women and elderly people and of course the question will be Israel what will it return and there's also a debate on how long will the ceas fire be whether it will be five days or a shorter period which is what Israel would like to see journalist Sami zoko with the latest from Jerusalem tonight Sammy thank you
