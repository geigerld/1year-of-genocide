Israel says waves of its war planes have carried out preemptive strikes against Hezbollah militant Targets in Lebanon where authorities reported three deaths Hezbollah says it has launched drones against Israel in retaliation for the recent assassination of one of its commanders early morning in Northern Israel the Iron Dome Springs into action as Hezbollah begins what the militant group calls phase one of an attack on Israel hundreds of rockets and drones fired towards 11 military sites retaliation it says for the killing of one of its commanders in Beirut last month Hezbollah says it struck a military base near Tel Aviv a claim Israel denies hezbollah's Chief cites the Gaza ceasefire talks as the reason for their delayed response to their Commander's death in a televised address they started saying that there will be a stop to the aggression and that there was going to be a ceasefire and to hold off and that's why we took our time we didn't tell anyone we would take our time but honestly we did to give room for these negotiations he warned that hezbollah's response may not yet be over Israel says it began preemptive air strikes on Sunday against Hezbollah Targets in Lebanon after they detected PL plans of an attack against its territory the IDF claimed 100 fighter jets have struck and destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels aimed at Israel it also released these images it says are of a Hezbollah drone being intercepted Israel's prime minister issued a warning after an emergency National Security cabinet meeting we determined to do everything to protect our country return the residents of the north to their homes and continue to follow a simple rule whoever hurts us we hurt them Sunday's escalation further heightens tensions as talks to reach a ceasefire and a hostage release deal in Gaza continue in Gaza Hamas militants say they fired a rocket at Tel Aviv Israel says the rocket landed in an open area in Rishon leion a city located just south of Tel Aviv Sirens rang out in the area as the projectile crossed from Southern Gaza into Israel according to Israel's military Hamas is designated as a terrorist group by many countries and organizations and journalist balik sladin is in Tel Aviv where he joins us now balik what's the latest you can tell us yes less than an hour ago the s went off in recently as you said it's a city just south of Tel Aviv and according to what hamas's military Wing as Kasam just said that they launched an M90 rocket which is a long range or it depends how long it considered long 90 kilm range toward the city of Tel Aviv it fell in open area just outside of Rion according to ma which is the Israeli Health authorities there were no casualties or no damage as a result of that attack apparently and according to what some reports are saying there were two rockets that were fired from Han yunes which is south of the Gaza Strip one of them fell in Gaza so in the Gaza Strip and the other one crossed into Israeli airspace again open terrain no casualties and no damage and how does Israel see the fact that Hamas is still able to fire rockets at Tel Aviv well since the beginning the estimation was in Israel that until the end quotequote Hamas will try to launch rockets against Israeli targets especially in Tel Aviv area because of the fact that they want to preserve this image of being or keeping their capabilities even though that the Israeli um operation is continuing so right now we're seeing that as long or as the Israeli military advances into new areas for example in and recent couple of days Hamas will launch rockets that are left there that's what the estimation Israel is and on the other hand while we are seeing that hamas's military ring is taking responsibility for that it's very probable that in the coming hours or maybe even in the coming 1 hour we will hear new instructions from the Israel uh um from the Ida spokesperson excuse me telling the uh um areas in which the uh rocket was launched from to evacuate everyone from there because of the Israeli operations expansion toward that area that has been the case that has been the normal uh in the recent couple of months and that's why uh it's very probable that we're going to hear new evacuation orders for the population that are in that area as well all right B sliding in Tel Aviv thank you so very much well Laura Blumenfeld is a Middle East analyst and former adviser to the US state Department's Israeli Palestinian negotiating team she joins me from Washington DC welcome Laura uh let's talk about these attacks between Israel and hez bolot do you think this is just a brief escalation or are we looking at more to come in the next days and weeks um look it was a significant escalation but it is the the Middle East there were bombs in the morning and by the afternoon in Israel and Lebanon the beaches were open and in Egypt the ceasefire talks could continued um you know it's Middle East math there are many open accounts so I do think to answer your question there will be more unfortunately and as prime minister Netanyahu himself said this is not the end of the story that was his quote I mean there's still you know open account with the houthis there's more potentially with Hezbollah the Israeli civilians return to their homes which are ghost Villages right now in the north a school is starting it'll be the second year that Israeli children aren't able to attend school in their hometowns along that northern border and and of course there's Iran hanging out there so I I'm I'm sorry to say at the start of our week that this is not the end now let's just talk a little bit about the timing of the Hezbollah attack on Israel Hezbollah says it was retaliating against Israel for the killing of one of its commanders last month uh but they didn't launched their Massive Attack until Israel attacked Southern Lebanon why do you think that they waited well part of it I do take it face value what Nala said I mean the ceasefire talks there's been no breakthrough but they have had a breakdown and he certainly doesn't want to be part of that kind of blame game while they can't agree on the end game uh between Israel and Hamas part of it is you know a bid for World favor another thing is you know as the head of the mosad once told me but I think Nala is following the same rule when it comes to retaliation you choose the timing you choose the method and you choose the battlefield and part of it is by making making your opponent wait is the kind of psychological head game right where where you know the Israelis have been on edge so have the Lebanese for that matter but the the Israelis have been uh you know in in sort of deep angst mode um the economy is suffering and all that is part of the pain it's part of the punishment and talking about waiting for retaliation let's just talk about Iran briefly they vowed revenge on Israel for the killing of hamas's political Chief is hania in tan last month so far they haven't attacked Israel what do you think's going on there well I think Iran for for sure is playing the long G the long game there is a clock ticking down um in Palestine square into Heron which is a Doomsday Clock which supposedly is going to uh you know countdown to Israel's Annihilation um they do want punishment I do believe there is a sort of need for blood blood for blood um and it could potentially show the form of some kind of terrorist attack abroad perhaps but in the meantime you know the United States has sent two Strike Force carrier groups and that submarine that they sent is not a defensive weapon it is an offensive submarine and I think that they're getting that message loud and clear Middle East analyst Laura Blumenfeld thank you for your insights thank you
