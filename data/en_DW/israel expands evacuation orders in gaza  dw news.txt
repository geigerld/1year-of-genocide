Israel has called on Palestinians to evacuate parts of Rafa in the South as well as two Northern Gaza neighborhoods more than 110,000 people in Rafa have already fled the area as fighting between Israeli troops and Palestinian militants intensifies there heavy clashes have left crucial Aid Crossings inaccessible meanwhile Israel's military has also deployed forces north of Gaza City where the army says Hamas Fighters have reorganized residents of the city of jabalia were told to evacuate in preparation for renewed combat Tanya Kramer is following developments for us from Jerusalem and she joins us now for more good to see you Tanya so are these renewed evacuation orders for civilians in Rafa a sign that Israel is indeed about to launch a major offensive in the area and that's despite international calls not to do this well absolutely I mean the uh Israel military still says it is a limited operation but uh on Thursday the security cabinet has actually green lighted the expansion of this uh ground offensive so we don't know you know how far um they they will go right now but we are seeing more evacuation orders now for the population there still in eastern Rafa but we've seen and we've talked to people in RAF saying you know many of those who are not in these specific areas but also in other areas they're fearing and they're very worried about and they they people who can leave I mean there's always those vulnerable people that cannot leave um that you know they are leaving right now and the numbers were given by the United Nations agencies working down the ground over a 100 thousand others have put the number much higher of those people uh that are leaving so this is Eastern RAF and as you said there also evacuation orders for people again in Northern Gaza in B lakia which is in the northern part of Gaza City and the town of B hanon which is in uh the Northeast uh potentially indicating that Hamas is regrouping there uh although Israel has said it is there mostly under control now what does it mean for the people on the ground they have to leave in the southern parts now uh to an area either going further up north to Yunis where there's mostly rubble and and ruins but also they were asked to go to alari which is on the shorer on the coastline of Gaza but eight agencies have said you know the area there is highly inadequate for so many people it is without electricity uh without uh uh you know running water sewage system and people have been displaced now many times over and over again and all this is of course happening while while the bombardment is going on and also in this evacuation are we seeing this since Tuesday is the Rafa Crossing which has been uh closed since an a agencies are warning uh that not enough Aid is coming in anymore although Israel says some Aid came came in but there's a dispute over how much Aid is actually reaching people because the south of Gaza was mainly where AID organizations uh were still working uh in the past months well Tanya in a separate development the us says Israel may have breached international law with American weapons in Gaza has there been an official reaction from Israel to these allegations we don't we didn't see it an official reaction to this but it's very uh closely watched because the report says that Israel's use of Us weapons is uh likely to be inconsistent with international law but that it lacks you know the evidence in specific cases now human rights groups would argue that they have documented cases where uh the force being used is disproportionate where they more uh this you know in in the light of the so many civilian casualties now Israel has rejected uh those accusations all along it says it does enough to uh protect civilians but this comes of course amid a a deepening Rift between uh the US Administration and uh Israel about the shipment of arms and we have to see you know how this Rafa operation now comes into play in this because uh the US has always said said don't this is a red line for them if Israel goes further deeper into rafar but you know what will they do and what will other countries do if Israel is expanding its ground offens of there that was ew's Tanya Kramer reporting from Jerusalem Tanya thank you so much
