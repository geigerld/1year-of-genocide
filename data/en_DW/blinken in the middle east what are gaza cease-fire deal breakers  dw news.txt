US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is in Israel to push for a ceasefire deal in Gaza after talks resumed in Doha last week in a meeting with Israeli president Isaac harzog blinkin said the negotiations are a decisive moment in the war and may be the last opportunity to get Israeli hostages home but Hamas which carried out the October 7th Terror attacks has said any signs of progress are an illusion the group says Israel has added new demands in the latest talks and has refused to consider withdrawing all of its troops from Gaza which is a red line for Hamas get theages home let's hear some of what blinkin had to say at that meeting with the Israeli president this is a decisive moment um probably the best maybe the last opportunity to get the hostages home to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security uh I'm here as part of an intensive diplomatic effort on President Biden's instructions to try to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line uh it is time for it to get done uh it's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process to get and while Israeli negotiators have expressed cautious optimism about reaching a ceasefire deal prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu accuses Hamas of dragging its feet Hamas remains obstinate it hasn't even sent a representative to the talks in Doha therefore the pressure should be directed at Hamas and its leader sinir not at the Israeli government more on this I'm joined Now by DW's Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem Tanya what are the main stinking sticking points in the negotiations at this point well I can tell you what we know uh what's being discussed uh publicly of of course there a lot of things going on behind the scenes that we don't know but it seems that the list is still uh quite long and that despite the spring proposal that was put on the table by the mediators at the talks in Doha last week that is in itself based on the framework that was presented by US President Joe Biden uh back uh in may now Hamas released a statement on Sunday night um they said they met with the mediators and they are basically detailing some of the sticking points according to their understanding they're saying there's issue of a permanent SE that they want to see and the withdrawal of all the troops from Gaza now we heard from Israel so far that they are only committing to oppose uh in fighting now there's also the issue of the so-called narim Corridor this is the newly created uh area between the North and the South of the Gaza Strip where Israel has put checkpoints now Hamas says it wants free movement for the people to go back home in the north from the south to the north Israel has said they don't want to see any arm people uh going uh North so they need to control this area there's also the issue of the Philadelphia Corridor this is the area between uh the Border area between Gaza and Egypt and that also pertains to the opening of The rafar Crossing one of the main crossings that has been closed now for many many weeks uh there Israel says it needs to control this area has some sort of control because this is the main Supply Route uh for Hamas and underground tunnels and of course Hamas for that but there also still issues it seems about the number of hostages and also uh What uh you know the choice of the Palestinian prisoners that would be uh uh exchanged for the hostages that are still remaining in Gaza so quite a few sticking points uh given those concerns How likely is it Tanya that there will be an agreement well that's a good question basically um it's first of all we're not sure really where those talks stand but uh you know we heard the mediators after the talks in Doha there struck some kind of cautiously optimistic tone but this is not matched at all what we're hearing now from Israeli officials uh but also from Hamas officials and it doesn't seem that a breakthrough that's also really pushed uh by the United States and that's also why we are seeing Secretary of State Antony blinkin here now in the region that it seems really are near so also here in Israel Netanyahu has been accused also in the security establishment that he's not pushing hard enough for a deal netan of course has rejected this he says you know his strategy of military pressure is working and we are seeing this also translated in Gaza where heavy bombardment has been going on more displacement of people more more people have been asked again to evacuate areas which have been where the Israeli military has operated before and don't forget this all comes on the backdrop of course of the regional tensions here with Iran and Hezbollah uh they have been signaling that they're holding off some sort of their retaliatory strike seeing where those ceasefire talks are uh leading to but at the moment this is not true at all what's been what will be the result of that Tanya thank you very much for filling Us in there that was our correspondent in Jerusalem Tanya Kramer
