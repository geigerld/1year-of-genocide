delegations from Israel and the United States have arrived in Cairo in an effort to salvage talks for a ceasefire in Gaza a sticking point is Israel's demand to control a strategic Corridor in Gaza it comes as Israel holds funerals for hostages killed in Gaza earlier this week Israel recovered the bodies of six captives who were being held by Hamas which carried out the October 7th attacks in Gaza Israel has issued new evacuation orders for residents in the southern city of K yunes as its forces advance in the region and journalist kareim elgohari is a h joining me now on the line from Cairo good to see you again uh negotiations toward a possible ceasefire have been ongoing uh this week we expect official talks between Hamas and Israel to be kicking off tomorrow has any progress been made so far uh not that we know uh to be honest there's very little news leaking uh to the media about this negotiations Israeli negotiators reportedly already arrived in Cairo talks will start start between the mediators the US and Egypt and is the Israeli delegations later they will be joined by a delegation from the other mediator qar there is no word yet about uh Hamas delegation yet but of course they are briefed by the Arab mediators the goal is is to resolve the differences over this truce proposal to end this 10 months War main sticking points is the full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip the full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip or not until now netan is trying to keep a presence of the Israeli Army in the Philadelphia Corridor that's the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip and at the so-called narim Corridor that's a corridor that's dividing uh the Gaza stri into a northern and southern part yeah tell me a little bit more I understand these two strategic corridors have as you say been a major sticking point in these negotiations why is it so difficult for all sides to find agreement there well netan is trying to get a deal on on a continuous presence in of the Israeli Army in parts of the Gaza Strip signed off by Hamas or there will be no deal he says that until now is not acceptable for Hamas who insists on a full withdrawal of the Israeli troop let's take the the Philadelphia Corridor that's the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip according to reports in the Arab press there is a new proposal uh suggesting a un monitoring Mission instead of the Israeli troops also maybe the possibility that there will be a EU a European Union Mission at the border personing in Rafa along with the Palestinian authorities this according to this reports the Israeli troops could then gradually withdraw from the area but there is a very very strong denial from the office of Netanyahu about this report mind you until now we don't have any official copy about the so-called briding proposal uh there's very few official statements surrounding the negotiations most of what we hear is planted to the media by either Hamas or Israel in order to strengthen their negotiation position now just uh before I let you go I just want to get some clarity on this issue it is not just Hamas also Egypt that does want Israel to withdraw from the Philadelphia Corridor can you explain why that is well Egypt uh interprets the presence of the Israeli Army at this Border strip as a violation of the chem David peace Accord that's the peace Accord signed between Egypt and Israel 1979 the first peace Accord between an Arab country and Israel according to that uh this area should be some kind of demilitarized zone Egypt is arguing Egypt is also denying the Israeli accusations that there is smuggling of weapons through these areas Egyptian is saying they destroyed the tunnel that were existing there and after all of that Egypt like all other Arab states once an end of the Israeli occupation not only in the Gaza street but also in the West Bank so a continued Israeli presence in Gaza would enshrine this occupation and what Egypt sees as a violation of international law thank you so much as always for your insights today that is journalist Kareem elgohari in Cairo you're welcome
