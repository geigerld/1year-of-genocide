there's some of the most vulnerable like this next 13-year-old girl who left G Gaza City with her family after their house was destroyed now in Rafa a rocket damaged the house she was in and destroyed the one next door where am I supposed to go children were killed here 26 people were killed here I'm terrified I'm scared and I thought of me being killed or my my other brother being killed just crossing my my repeated I already lost my older brother I can't lose my younger brother I have no no one left no one to look up to DW xan Philip Schultz joins me from Tel Aviv since the beginning of the war Israel has been telling the people of Gaza to move South for their own safety but the South doesn't appear any safer than the rest of the territory as that young girl was pointing out there yeah it's uh definitely not safer anymore and what we hear from there from the young girl we just saw and from so many others is so horrible that it's difficult to find words for it it's become a completely desperate situation for civilians in all parts of the Gaza Strip uh thousands of children have died according to the UN more than 80% have been displaced at the same time Israeli forces once more intensify their attacks especially in the central uh and the the southern part of the strip and especially on the towns of Rafa and KH yunes and a lot of people that fled there from the north can't go back uh simply because everything or almost everything is destroyed also in the north um according to un figures 2/3 of the um the house houses have been destroyed and we have to keep in mind it's not only the fighting that is killing a lot of civilians but also the desperate humanitarian situations a lot of people are facing hunger and there are horrible scenes taking place around the few uh Aid convoys that are still managing to deliver Aid into the Gaza Strip and our report touched on that joint Israeli Palestinian rally in Tel Aviv yesterday can you tell us more yeah I mean a majority of uh the people here are still in favor of War uh prime minister Nan's popularity uh has decreased in the past weeks but the humanitarian situation in Gaza is is less of a topic here in in local media than in many other countries but there is a growing peace movement uh as you mentioned I was at a protest yesterday uh there were at least a few hundred people present and they said that they don't want the war to continue There will only be more radicalization if it continues they say and there can only be a lasting or real security for the people in the region if there is peace at least that's what they said at the protest uh but it is a minority most people here are still in favor of the war and the objective to destroy Hamas whatever it takes the latest there from Yan Philip Schultz in Tel Aviv for us thank you now the UN is warning than 150,000 people in Gaza have nowhere to go as Israel widens its air and ground offensive against Hamas which has been classified a terror group by many countries dozens of people mostly women and children were killed in a new wave of Israeli air strikes overnight writing the names of the Dead on their body bags and saying goodbye to loved ones the bodies of those killed by an Israeli air strike on the de albala refugee camp in central Gaza a laid outside a twins we were sleeping in the room with two of my children my twins were in another room the house was bombed and the rebel fell on the twins on their birthday inside the hospital doctors rush to treat those injured in the attack the Israeli military has stepped up its air and ground offensive in areas of Central and Southern Gaza it released this footage of Tanks rolling into the southern city of can yunes the Israel Defense Forces claim to have killed dozens of terrorists across Gaza in a single day 85% of gaza's population has been displaced by the ongoing flattened children search for belongings from the place that many called home while final prayers are said for those who were killed we can get more on this from journalist Samy sakol who joins us from Jerusalem welcome Sammy let's start with Israel's widening campaign in Central and Southern Gaza what are they doing well we're talking about the the area in the center of the Gaza Strip where you have very large refugee camps and these are refugees that came there in the 1948 war from what then became Israel and we're talking about Alat maazi and as the Israeli forces and the tanks are approaching this area the residents are being called to leave this area at the same time the Air Force is shelling this area and they're targeting Hamas operatives but as we know most of the casualties are civilians and the people there of course are stranded and they say that they have nowhere to go at the same time Israel is also continuing in the campaign in around kanun this is where the believe that the Hamas leadership is located let's pick up one of those attacks the Israeli Army has expressed what it said was its regret at the high number of casualties caused by their bombing of the magazi refugee camp on the 24th of December so just talk us through what happened and and explain to us why Israel is is bombing refugee camps yeah well this is in the mai refugee camp the IDF said that they were Hamas operatives and they were after them and they dropped bombs in this residential area which was very crowded we're talking about a very crowded residential area and indeed more than 90 people were killed uh women children and many more were wounded and uh still we believe that some are maybe under the rubble the IDF issued a statement which is quite rare in which they actually admitted that they dropped a what they call a munition that wasn't a suitable for this kind of a Target meaning that they dropped a a bigger bomb than necessary in order to go after these wanted men now Israel is under increasing pressure from the US and indeed uh much of the rest of the world to scale back its bombing of Gaza so is the war likely to enter a new phase well it's yet to see when this new phase will take place and now Israel is in this very intensive phase in which it's continuing the the bombing of the Gaza Strip but we know that in the coming week Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is coming and this is exactly what he wants to discuss with the Israelis and ask him when is it that you're moving from the current phase into what they call a phase three phase three is a phase in which the Israeli military will be located more along the borders along a kind of a perimeter that they will establish and will launch a kind of attacks more targeted attacks and this kind of warfare is going to continue for a very long time thanks for that Sammy journalist Sammy Sako in
