kisin thanks for speaking to DW um Israel is saying that it it's on the brink of mounting a new offensive against Rafa the town very the very bottom of the Gaza Strip over a million gazans have sought Refuge there there are fears that there could be another wave of of casualties if we look at Germany and the United States you know really Israel's two biggest supporters are we getting to the point where you think they need to say to Israel enough is enough well the German foreign minister has already said it's hell there and um I think this um must not happen um the protection of civilians is key so many um thousands of children have already been killed and um there is apparently no end inight so I really hope that um netan reconsiders that he does what 150 countries and more asked in the United Nations and finally agreed to ceasefire and yet that message is evidently not not getting through from Germany or the United States to Netanyahu well it's um for um the politicians to see what instruments do they have so that their appeal um is actually hurt we have seen President Biden we have seen Tony blinkin ask um netan to to stop and and have a ceasefire to allow for more um for more help to come in and um we'll see in in a short time when um the Israeli government has to deliver a report to the international court of justice what it does to prevent genocide and we we need we need to stop of of this killing do you believe that that there is any evidence that the genocide could be taking place or a risk of taking place well the this is what the international court has said by accepting um the South African request and it has said there is a danger of genocide and to prevent this um it asks certain measures to be taken and um this um will now have to be delivered to the court and we we'll see what Israel does to prevent a genocide now all of this means that the Germany the United States and also other Western supporters of Israel find themselves accused of of caring more say about Ukrainian civilians than about Palestinian civilians by the sound of what you're saying it sounds like you can understand where that criticism is coming from well we um we hear this as I said there are 150 countries who urgently ask for for a ceasefire this is a majority of of of Nations um and I think this is something that um the International Community asks for and I think this is what um should be asked um the Israeli government to to actually Implement now the other kind major conflict not far from here that that's raging in Europe of course Russia's um war against Ukraine uh which has been grinding on for so long long um we see uh a certain amount of jitters in the west here um we see that American Military Support could be you know close to the brink of collapse we saw Olaf Schultz of J Cher was just in Washington he warned that uh Ukraine is absolutely dependent on that support the implication the strong implication being that if that support Falls away then Ukraine loses is that the situation we're looking at well we um the jury is still out I think that the US president the US government um is pushing um for um the continuation of um delivery of weapons to to Ukraine we just saw that in the Senate there was a two-thirds majority in in favor it and I just can't believe that um us parliamentarians um will let um Ukraine down and will um Putin Vladimir Putin um strike a victory um so I don't believe that on the other hand what I must say there is also there's always something positive even in the worst developments and this is a European Awakening we see very clear the the German Chancellor assuming a leading role in Europe to for the support of um Ukraine he is um um really drumming up support from his European Partners to do more I think we'll see a drive now for more European Defense for the European Union to assume more responsibility and this is what we need in general we need the European Union um the European countries um the European members of NATO to assume more responsibility for European um security because no matter who will um be the next US president it's clear that the US will have to concentrate on their domestic challenges and they will um concentrate on Asia and therefore Europe has to do its home homework yeah and of course I mean you talking about the elephant in the room causing a lot of angst here in Europe a possible second Trump Administration over the weekend Donald Trump was saying that he would even encourage Vladimir Putin to attack NATO members that he feels are not paying his dues their dubes what does Europe need to do in that regard because Europe is totally dependent on American nuclear weapons well um there are several questions but first of all um that may surprise you but um Donald Trump has a point know the European members of NATO all member states of NATO have committed 10 years ago to spend 2% of their GDP on defense and many countries including my own have not delivered they have only now finally um you know with um um you know with a special effort um reach these 2% and um it will be key that Germany and other partners continue to do that not to do a favor to president Trump but um to secure European uh protection to strengthen the European um um European part of of of NATO with regard to um European cooporation with regard to the nuclear umbrella of course we rely on um on the US um but at the same time I think it it would be safe um for Germany um for the other um European NATO Partners to actually pick up what um the French president has offered to have a discussion about the force fra about the nuclear um French forces and we should add Great Britain to that discussion and see how much are we ready to have as a complimentary Shield a a European protection by those Europeans who um have at their disposal their own nuclear forces now at the same time on Ukraine you've been saying that it's really time time to be thinking about the form of negotiations that could happen at the end of this conflict whenever this conflict does come to an end uh a ceasefire and a negotiating process what could that involve how do you envisage that well when you look at conflicts worldwide most um uh have not only end ended but they have ended with some kind of agreement and therefore um I think we have to look at it it could be something like the um Minsk agreement which is not favorable looked at but I think it's not favor looked at not because of its content because the content is pretty normal you ask for a ceasefire you ask a withdrawal of uh heavy weapons you have an observer troop you have a political perspective all this the criticism that is at Minsk and other agreements is that Russia just um tear these kind of um agreements apart when it suits um the president and therefore what is key for any agreement that we could enter and um could have in the end there have to be guarantees there have to be security guarantees that Vladimir Putin knows he has to pay a prize if he again tear up an agreement and from my perspective the best would be for Ukraine to join NATO the strongest military Alliance um and do you imagine that as being part of a deal where then Ukraine does seed some territory to Russia so Russia keeps the donbass the rest of Ukraine goes into NATO for instance I think it's a very bad idea just to think about seeding territory this means that by force you change borders in in Europe and I think that cannot be part of any any agreement no it's um you know what kind of agreement we have in the end you know we we have to see the ukrainians have to decide for this could this be you know something temporary as it was foreseen for the donbas in the 2015 Minsk agreement um this is for the ukrainians to to decide how they want to play it um but again to change borders in Europe by force would set a a horrible precedent I think shouldn't be key is security key is guarantee so that Putin knows this is where the buck stops yeah and it it it's clear in your own report that ukrainians don't want to give up any territory and that is of course uh highly understandable but the Minsk agreement it just froze the conflict and isn't this the consider like well you have to understand this is only you know part of it it um when Minsk was concluded there was um Russia was attacking president penko told Chancellor Merkel he needs to have a a ceasefire because otherwise the Russian troops at the time could March all the way to M to to Kev so what was Min about was a ceasefire which the by the way the Russians didn't really observe but it did have this political perspective that um you know after a certain you know um autonomy that would have been granted to the donbas there would be a kind of reunification and and Ukraine would again have the sovereignty of over over this territory so the um I think the agreement was a was a good one uh the problem was the implementation that Russia Vladimir Putin was not ready to to implement it um but just a final question I mean you suggest that there could be an agreement where Russia withdraws all of its troops and Ukraine also joins NATO for Russia to go along with something like that they would probably need to be under much greater military pressure than they are now wouldn't they well this is why um we have to see that Ukraine continues to be armed with all arms uh that are at our disposal because after all they defend our freedom it's it's the ukrainians but also ours because Vladimir Putin has said publicly that he wouldn't stop there so we we have to do um we have to have to support um for Vladimir Putin he has to understand that he cannot gain by prolonging this war that he cannot win this war and um you you can see that um while he gives the um appearance of being the strong man who has everything under control that um you know there are the first effects of and strong effects of sanctions you know their Fleet of airplanes from Airbus and boing is is grounded you could see that he lost faith last week when he had to stop one of the candidates that who nobody knew before was running for president on a um you know on a ticket that was you know against the war and he was um scared that all of a sudden the momentum this person created was enormous so that he had to um stop that this shows um a sign of weakness um and um so we have to continue to push him into this one of the things is very important by the way is and we try to do this also on the Munich security conference that we have to talk to those countries that um don't Implement sanctions to think about this to think about um um if it wouldn't suit their interests better if an aggressor like um Russia would be put into um his place to stop um similar um uh you know things from happening in other parts of the world so lots of look out for the munity security conference thank you very much Christo thank you very much for for your questions
