to the Middle East now where US Secretary of State Anthony blinken is holding a day of talks with top officials in Israel as he seeks a ceasefire agreement for Gaza it's the latest stop on his diplomatic Dash to the region which has included meetings with qari and Egyption officials who broken the current draft deal Hamas has responded positively to the plan mediators are cautiously optimistic that Israel can still reach an agreement with Hamas which carried out the October 7th Terror attack well the exact details of the proposal aren't clear but according to Media reports here's what the framework deal mediated by the US Qatar and others looks like so it would be broken down into three phases that would see an initial six- week pause in fighting an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and an increase in Aid deliveries to Gaza and if all of those steps prove successful they could then set the stage for negotiation about a permanent ceasefire meanwhile in the last few hours we've learned details of hamas's counterproposal are submitted shortly before Anthony blinkin touched down and that's raising questions about the potential outcome of negotiations so let's uh see if Rebecca ritters in Jerusalem can shed some light on this welcome Rebecca what are you hearing about this Hamas counter proposal well Phil as you say details aren't 100% clear the Hamas proposal hasn't been made public but from the reports that we're hearing uh as you mentioned it was the the original framework set out in Paris a little over a week ago was received positively by Hamas but that they have offered a counter proposal they want to see 45 days uh of ceasefire in a first phase and that would see the release of the women children basically uh all of the civilians left in in Gaza to be released in exchange for a yet undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners and as well as you mentioned uh a great deal of Aid to be brought into Gaza Strip uh in a second phase if that all goes to plan a second phase would' see the remaining living hostages released in exchange for yet more prisoners and more Aid and then in a third phase should that uh come to fruition then we would see the release of any of the bodies that are currently in Gaza any of the people were either taken in uh already have been killed in Israel and taken across his bodies or the people that have died subsequently inside Gaza since they were taken there on October 7 so that would be a third phase now uh what they're are suggesting or what they're um proposing or asking for is the differences are are small but they are significant they're asking for a higher level of prisoner to be released they want to see some prisoners who are in Israeli prisons under life sentences uh to be released now what we saw in the the deal that happened in no November where more than 100 hostages were released we saw only women and youths released from prison uh so that is another request that they're asking and they're also asking for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and uh an end to the war a permanent ceasefire now those are things that Benjamin Netanyahu and his far right Coalition have said that they wouldn't get behind so we are likely to see now another counterproposal from Israel and further negotiations right and and the the bottom line for for the Israelis is what what are they looking for in in any agreement well I think they both sides want to come away from this looking like neither have really given many concessions I think that's uh certainly clear in what we're seeing and what we saw in November and again now now the Israelis uh definitely Under Pressure to bring home the hostages the families in Israel of the people still remaining in Gaza have been protesting have been putting a lot of pressure on the government uh for for a limited ceasefire to to see their loved ones returned home that is definitely a a priority or something that the Israeli government have had to take or are taking very seriously as they try to uh quell The Descent that's happening within the country so that's certainly uh something that it's a it's a high price and it's something that they are willing to of course give some sacrifices for but they are they have said they've come out staunchly saying that they would not agree to a permanent ceasefire uh nor a full withdrawal of Israeli troops which is what the Hamas side are asking for so the in the detail there you know we still could see negotiations carrying on for some time yet thanks for that Rebecca DW correspondent Rebecca RS in
