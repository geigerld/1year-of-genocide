Israel is to send a delegation to Washington to discuss its planned ground offensive in the southern gazen city of Rafa Israel's prime minister remains determined to move forward with the assault despite the US and others urging caution America's top Diplomat Anthony blinkin is expected in the Middle East later on Wednesday for talks about a ceasefire he's warned that the entire gazen population is now facing severe hunger as Israel's war against Hamas drags on in the wake of the October 7 Terror attacks nearly 6 months into Israel's war with Hamas the UN is saying that the looming famine in Gaza is no accident painful miserable hunger is spreading in a place which before never ever encountered hunger so this is clearly a manmade clearly uh what manm made artificially created hunger crisis the commissioner General tried to go to Gaza to assess the situation but Israel refused to let him in he now feels that dealing with the hunger crisis there comes down to commited support basically we we're talking about 20 30 40 trucks I I I believe the largest barrier is the absence of political will as simple as that if you have a political will you can address it as lazarini implied the world is putting pressure on Israel to allow more Aid into Gaza including pressure from one of its closest allies the United States 100% of the population in Gaza is at severe levels of acute food insecurity that's the first time an entire population has been so classified um we also see again uh according to in this case the United Nations 100% the totality of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance Israel pushed back saying it's already making Provisions for THS placing it at odds with the US mdle e idea that we're going to trap a million two we're not going to let them go out they're not going to leave we don't have arrangements for them that's that's not true we're going to move the various uh International agencies that are in the South we're going to say move here move there move there there precise locations this war so far it's unclear what Arrangements is has made in my opinion the future trucks with a shipments are still being denied entry into the Gaza Strip and crowds of gazans are waiting for food trying to fend off a famine that the world has warned as imminent unless something changes we should mention the humanitarian situation in gazer already suffered a serious blow after several donor countries withdrew funding for the UN relief Agency for Palestinians Israel had accused Hamas of infiltrating the organization now former French foreign minister krine Kalona is due to submit an independent review of those allegations the review was ordered by unad Philip lazarini after Israel claimed that at least 12 of its staff members were involved in the October 7th attacks and that a further 450 alleged Hamas military operatives were employed by the agency I intended to for more I'm joined by DW correspondent Rebecca Ritter in Jerusalem Rebecca as we just heard former French foreign minister uh krine Kalona will submit an interim report on the role of unra in the October 7 Terror attacks on Israel tell us more about that well that's right Michael and as you rightly mentioned this is an interim report a preliminary report with the final expected within the next four weeks or so by the end of April now as you also mentioned this was ordered by the unra chief Philip Philip lazarini who you heard from there a little bit in that report you just played uh now he ordered that after Israel accused or alleged that 12 unra staff members were involved in the October 7 attacks those accusations coming at the end of January and that's when he ordered that report now Philip lazarini uh instantly dismissed uh nine of those uh employees that were um caught up in those allegations one had subsequently died and two the identity of two uh was being looked into but taking very Swift action there in fact going against un's normal standard policy which would be to suspend and investigate but given the severity of the allegations and of course all the political rhetoric and all the uh of course the political situation surrounding uh those allegations he took very Swift action called for this report now Israel says a further 10% of un staff are Hamas supporters they haven't given evidence to support these claims but that is what something that will be looked into into this report just what's going to be in the report remains to be seen Michael but we know that it's going to focus on how to protect un's neutrality of course recruitment of staff and how they handled the allegations uh that came out in January now as I mentioned this was a pre this is to be a preliminary report we are expecting it to be released to the public at least the final report not clear whether this preliminary report will be released to the public or whether we'll have to wait another four weeks to find out what's in it Rebecca of course the ongoing news is that Israel and the United States are openly disagreeing about this planed offensive on Rafa an Israeli delegation is expected to visit Washington to discuss ways to avoid it from what you're hearing what does the US reasonably expect of Israel yes the US and Israel really at loggerheads with how the situation in Gaza is going to proceed the the US insisting that it is possible for Israel to achieve its military aims which is of course to eliminate Hamas to have the hostages released without actually having to go in and and and do a further ground incursion into Rafa that is something that Israel vehemently disagrees with they say that they are absolutely determined to push ahead they've been saying that for some weeks now even months and we heard even prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu you heard him there in that report we heard him come out yesterday and say that they would be uh in fact doing so regardless of the fact that their closest Ally is calling them uh calling for them not to do that you're reporting rightly that they uh have called the US has called for a delegation of isra an Israeli delegation to head to Washington to discuss with a US delegation about the ways in which they could proceed without having to go through but at this stage certainly looking like Israel is not going to back down certainly not without some kind of ceasefire which is still of course being negotiated ated but uh not yet coming to fruition Rebecca we have less than half a minute but I do want to ask you this the US Secretary of State is making a new push to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas I'm curious from your ground level vantage point is there still hope there's always hope Michael and that's certainly what the families of the hostages maintain they they continuously come out and say we we maintain hope what other choice do we have uh of course hope isn't enough and the negotiations are ongoing but it's been some five months since the November uh ceasefire agreement and the first uh tranch of hostages that were released so many many steps still to go We've Come Close uh during these negotiations but you know we're not that no one it's not over the line until it's over the line so hope maint maintains but uh but no sign of that coming to fruition yet understood that's DW correspondent Rebecca Ritter in Jerusalem many thanks
