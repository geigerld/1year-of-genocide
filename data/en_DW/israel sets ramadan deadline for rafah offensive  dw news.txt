Israel has set a deadline for its long-planned offensive against gaza's southern city of Rafa retired army General Benny gance a member of the country's War cabinet says Israeli troops will launch their assault next month if Hamas doesn't free the remaining hostages by Ramadan the Muslim holy month is expected to start on the 10th of March Rafa is the last major gazen city not to be invaded by ground troops during Israel's war against Hamas which is widely considered a terror organization air strikes across Gaza as Israel pursues what its prime minister has called total Victory Homes schools and hospitals destroyed as the death toll keeps climbing they are all civilians there are no military personnel or anything we send our message to the world and our message to the Israeli government and the Hamas government in Gaza is please stop the war enough War Israel's ground offensive has extended to raids on multiple hospitals aggravating the already dire humanitarian situation a doctor at Naser Hospital in the city of K Yunis described the moment he realized an Israeli Army raid was happening was like chaos everybody running there and there uh so I realized that it is invasion of IDF as I started hearing some dogs at the hospital yards and actually yeah they destroyed the back back wall of the hospital and release their dogs Israel claims its targeting of hospitals is legitimate because Hamas allegedly operates within them its military released this video set to show weapons found inside cars close to the nser hospital soon the ground Siege could be extending all the way to Rafa despite International concern over Israel's plan to invade the last City in Gaza that hasn't seen major ground fighting Benny guns a member of netanyahu's three member War cabinet said Israeli troops would launch their assault next month if by Ramadan hostages are not home the fighting will continue everywhere to include Rafa area the Muslim holy month is expected to begin around the 10th of March while gun does not have the final word on what lies ahead he represents an influential Israeli voice defying calls including from Israel's strongest backer the US to spare the city where more than a million Palestinians are Sheltering and have nowhere else to go Myra zon is senior Israel Analyst at the inter International crisis group she joins us from Tel Aviv welcome to DW um what do you make of this deadline Israel has announced for its Raa offensive well it seems like the offensive is a question of when not if but the Israeli government currently is not capable of going into Rafa because reservists need to be called up from the Army and as Netanyahu has said they would have to create some kind of evacuation of over a million Palestinians uh in right now so it's not something that could happen soon the deadline for Ramadan seems to be a threat by the Israeli government as a way to pressure Hamas I think in the negotiations and to tell the world that Israel is prepared to go all the way as Netanyahu has said but I find it hard to believe that it is something that could happen in the next few weeks right and you mentioned that the idea that the threat of Ramadan uh is a way to might be a way to to pressure Hamas this this because I was going to ask you what what we should make of Israel's use of a Muslim holy period as a a deadline for military action well in some ways this is kind of arbitrary but you know Ramadan has been um a point of contention and a flash point specifically in Jerusalem around access to the AL aamos which is already being limited and now the government has said that it will further limit uh access by Palestinians including citizens of Israel to alamasa Ramadan and this is a recipe for further friction and further disaster so uh you know making everything about Ramadan in some ways by the Israeli government is is just a way of asserting that it is The Sovereign it has full control and it will do as it pleases uh so this is kind of just a way to continue to intimidate the Palestinian population you talked about um uh Israel needing time to um uh sort out some sort of evacuation plan they they do appear to have heeded International critics and said that um an evacuation plan will happen but one wonders in a place as crowded as um Rafa is and with the rest of the Gaza Strip so utterly annihilated is any sort of evacuation plan credible no I don't think it's credible and as we have seen even the places that are considered safe spaces in Gaza are not actually safe and I think it's you know Common Sense and logic that in a place that is already so crowded and besieged and is under constant bombardment it's it's almost impossible to to properly evacuate civilians there as you said there's almost nowhere to evacuate them to the conditions are horrible we are in the middle of a very rainy winter so you know the conditions are are are impossible so even if they did have a logistical plan which again would take time to evacuate those civilians there's absolutely no guarantee of their safety I mean even the humanitarian Aid once it gets in it's almost impossible uh to deliver it properly because of the of the situation of the Warfare I'm so what is it then either about this offensive or this stage in the war that has prompted Israel to at least look as though it is heeding international pressure where before it hasn't it hasn't looked as though it's it's listening well I think it Netanyahu is constantly walking the line between trying to appease the US to some level whe whether it has to do with human Arian Aid or withdrawing troops or the level of intensity and at the same time continuing with actions and rhetoric that um that are calling for endless war uh endless uh occupation and control uh security control at least in Gaza and so he's trying to walk this line where he where he promises his base and the country that he will continue until what he calls a total Victory which even his own Military Intelligence has said would not be the case because Hamas will continue to remain intact as some kind of terror group as a Guerilla group it can continue to operate on some level it will not be eradicated as he has promised but when when he finds the need to appease the us or appease the world then he'll he'll do what he needs to do to try to make it at least appear optically that he's doing so okay thank you for a fascinating analysisa Zine from the international crisis group thank
