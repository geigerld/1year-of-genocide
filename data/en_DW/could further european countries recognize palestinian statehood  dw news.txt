Spain Norway and Ireland have said that they will recognize Palestinian statehood many Western countries have resisted recognizing an independent Palestinian state for years but Israel's war against Hamas after the October the 7th terror attack has put renewed focus on the issue Israel's foreign minister has denounced the decision as a threat to the nation's sovereignty and security barred off from Israel by fences and barriers the Palestinian territories will be formally recognized as a state by three more European countries Spain Ireland and Norway choosing to support the Palestinian push for sovereignty a step they say towards peace the time has come to move from words to action to tell the millions of innocent suffering Palestinians that we are with them that there is hope and to make it very clear but no matter how many walls are erected no matter how many villages are bombed and no matter how many illegal settlements are built the land and identity of Palestine will continue to exist in our hearts in international legality and in the future project of a Mediterranean in harmony previously 139 of 193 un countries recognize the state of Palestine the latest signatories calling on others to do the same in the midst of war with tens of thousands of dead and injured we must keep alive the only thing that can provide a safe home for both Israelis and Palestinians two states that can live in peace with each other Israel and Palestine Israel's government has hit back regarding a Palestinian State there are people who support this opinion and there are people who do not but this is not the place nor the time now to come and unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state and any such decision harms Israeli sovereignty and Israeli security and we will not allow it I order to recall our ambassadors back home and we will take all measures to prevent that President Mahmud Abbas the leader of the Palestinian Authority welcomed the recognition and called on other nations to quote support the struggle of our people for Liberation and Independence earlier I spoke to DW Corr respondents Rebecca rers in Jerusalem and Jack parck in Brussels I started by asking Jack what this recognition means well it is a political statement and it's also a very symbolic one obviously the Spanish prime minister uh Pedro Sanchez when he announced made the announcement in Madrid earlier today he said that the recognition serves to tell the Palestinians we are with you Simon Harris the leader in Ireland he said that the recognition of the pal it's a recognition of the Palestinian people to their right to selfdetermination it is a really significant move for the three countries it is symbolic they're not necessarily the biggest diplomatic uh powers of Europe but they have been making uh they've been saying that they're going to do this for some time all of them it will come into Force this recognition on May the 28th there were other countries Belgium was perhaps going to be expected to do this alongside them we do know that there are moves here in Belgium to make a similar announcement and indeed potentially in France as well now what although it is symbolic it is also significant because Arab countries have said that they will only be involved in the sort of policing of a reconstruction of a post-war Gaza if Western Nations recognize a state in Palestine so the more countries that do that the more support that there would be from those Arab Nations to fund firstly a post-war uh Palestinian State okay and looking at reactions from Israel Rebecca Israel has now recalled its ambassadors to the three countries what else is Israel doing and saying well this announcement has drawn Fury from Israel probably unsurprisingly to most viewers Israel completely opposes the decision that has been announced this joint decision by Spain uh Ireland and Norway um Benjamin netan who has long said that establishing a pal pales inian state would be an existential danger to Israel and and been standing against it certainly since uh the war that began on October 7 as you mentioned the ambassadors to those three countries have been recalled and they are looking at further measures the Finance Minister betel smotrich has called for further punitive measures uh and said that he will be withholding tax uh that Israel collects uh and then gives to the Palestinian collects for the Palestinian Authority and then hands over he'll be withholding those taxes they'll be looking at further punitive measures now um in response to this the foreign minister this morning said that it sends a message to Palestinians and to the world that terrorism pays he also said that it will harm efforts to uh retrieve the remaining hostages inside Gaza so a very strong reaction from Israel on the Palestinian side we've seen a much more positive response obviously uh the Palestinian Authority who have always been fighting for a two-state solution have acted positively and Hamas has also come out to say that they think this is a step in the right direction and we're joined Now by nura erat a human rights attorney and assistant professor at Ruckers University in the US welcome to DW it's great to have you on the show can I uh start by asking you what difference uh today's announcements make do do they bring a Palestinian state closer to reality I think that we need to understand these statements as mostly symbolic without the weight of accountability and action that's necessary in 2012 138 states recognize Palestine as a state and yet we are in a condition right now of apartheid where a state is not going to rectify that racial Colonial structure that regulates all of Palestinian lives and has led us to this moment where we see it uh enact an entire genocide against Palestinians who seen as as uh not desired on that land I think what would much more worthwhile I should I should just stop you there because of course those are terms that are highly disputed and and rejected by Israel absolutely but but do carry on please do make your point yeah has also rejected that it's actually that that there is a Palestine and I think that we should take everything that Israel says with an incredible grain of salt how dare it uh insult these countries and and and say and and recall its ambassadors when the entire Ron D of the peace so-called peace process was to establish a Palestinian State how dare Israel have this reaction when 138 states have have already endorsed the Palestinian state or where there has been an international consensus since 1967 that the occupation of the territories is illegal so for us to tiptoe around these words which are in international law and have been established by several human rights Legacy organizations is to basically submit to the dictates of a country that would like to make aarthi normalized all right and um Nora do you expect other countries to follow the lead of um Ireland uh and uh uh Norway and Spain I think if we're just focusing on the EU we see this as a tremendous step forward but the majority of the world has already supported Palestinian self-determination more than that they have supported an end to aparti and at this moment I hope that they follow the lead by actually issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Galant when they step on their soil by enacting sanctions against settlement Enterprise and other military Industrial Enterprises by actually stopping the transfer of weapons that are continuing a genocide by engaging in the boycott that has been called for by Palestinians in order to stem the aparti of our time and to end what's now days of a live stream genocide Nora we're going to have to stop you there obviously using the word genocide this is something that's being investigated by the international court of justice but of course no legal conclusion has been reached yet so we're just going to have to leave it there uh Nora erat thank you so much for your time we appreciate it that Duty thank you for having me thank you okay and for more on Germany's position on Palestinian statehood we can cross now to DW's Chief political editor Misha kufner Misha tell us is there any chance that Germany would also consider recognizing a Palestinian state it would in fact I'm here at the meeting of the German French and polish foreign ministers in Vima and Germany maintains that um seeing a two-state solution a Palestinian state is one of its key foreign policy aims but when you're talking about whether that's a starting point or an outcome of a political process Germany is more on the outcome side and that means that this is considered to be very much a far off go goal at this moment in time after all one of Germany's fundamental political principles reason of State it's called is the defense of Israel and staying by Israel's side and the current government under Benyamin Netanyahu of course strictly rejects the two State solution let alone declaring a Palestinian state or recognizing a Palestinian state anytime soon there is a stark contrast to what Germany's policy outlook for a stable and peaceful Middle East is but it certainly won't make any move in that direction of recognizing a Palestinian State ahead of those hopefully peace talks anytime in the future Micha thanks so much that's DW's Chief political editor mishaa kufner
