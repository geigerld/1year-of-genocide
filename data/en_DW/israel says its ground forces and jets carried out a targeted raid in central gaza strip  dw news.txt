joined Now by military analyst Frank ledwich he joins us from Oxford in the UK Frank the Israeli Army says its ground forces and jets carried out a targeted raid in central Gaza Strip uh can this be seen as an overt to the expected land Invasion good morning Terry yes in a sense I mean what we're seeing now is quite normal in operations like this we saw this in Iraq with the Americans and the British they're called bearing the purpose reconnaissance is in force area reconnaissance but the purpose is essentially to test the defenses give the troops some experience try and understand and and most importantly try and understand the kind of resistance that they may face not only from Hamas but also from mines and other prepared obstacles near the border none of them have gone in very deeply but I think as as time goes on we're going to see more of these and some of them may penetrate a little more deeply than the one or two kilometers we've seen so far uh yes the the second thing is that they are uh messages to the Israeli public and we saw from Tanya's report there that the kind of message they're trying to convey the Army is is in action it's doing things uh and uh as I said we'll see more now reports are also coming in Frank of uh US air strikes against several Targets in Syria how does that fit into the bigger picture of this conflict yes the uh Western commanders from from what I've I've I've been hearing are extremely worried about this now the raids into Syria by the US the Air Raids have been essentially in response to Iranian attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria themselves so we're seeing a measured and calibrated proportional response from the Americans we're not seeing any escalation but uh this is messaging to Iran that uh the Americans won't take these actions against their troops in Iraq or Syria likly but also to demonstrate capability and the Iranians that there's a very large American Force ready to take action should it be required those strikes in Syria also raised the Spectre of the possibility of a wider War there have been reports Frank of an explosion near Israel's Southern border with Egypt uh Israel is exchanging daily fire with Hezbollah at its northern border with Lebanon could this become a multi-front war very much so I think the the taba incident the one to the to the south of Gaza I think analysts in Israel suggesting that that that in fact came from Yemen the Americans shot down some drones from Yemen last week and I think this one may have been may have fallen short of its Target in Israel but more widely yes and the the action that will detonate ESC wider escalation will be a decision by Hezbollah to to engage its rocket forces and I think everybody's key that doesn't happen right now though the Israelis and Hezbollah are are are maintaining a fairly low level of of combat but if we see that intensify it'll be very serious not only for Lebanon itself for which it would be devastating ultimately but for the wider region Frank I want to get back to the idea of this looming ground operation that Israel says it is planning to carry out uh we have Israeli troops massed on the border they are ready to enter Gaza what will happen once that begins if it begins Frank well H are playing a very cool game with the the hostages extending the the Strategic or narrowing in fact the Strategic space for the Israelis but I think many many people now looking at this are thinking that the form this incursion or Invasion or assault may take may not be a very a single large assault but may comprise a number of of of raids in force and extractions we don't know it'll certainly occur but the Americans are particularly advising the Israelis do not go in force with the purpose of occupation what we would prefer to see is to treat this as a series of operations rather than one single operation it does appear that that's the way the Israelis are beginning to look at things Frank we really appreciate your analysis that was military analyst Frank ledwitch thank you
