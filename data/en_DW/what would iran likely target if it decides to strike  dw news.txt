the US and Israel are on high alert expecting retaliation over an Israeli bombing of Iran's uh Embassy in Damascus seven revolutionary guards were killed in the attack on the Syrian Capital it Iran has warned its Reser it reserves the right to make a decisive response Tran says Israeli war planes were used in a major escalation in Israel's war with its enemies in the region benan bblu is a fellow a senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracy A Research Institute in Washington DC thanks so much for joining us he focuses on Iranian political and security issues uh benam are we seeing a major regional escalation here if Iran decides to strike uh this would be a serious serious uh escalation uh greetings Melissa good to be with you it depends a great deal on how when and where the Islamic Republic choose to respond or indeed if they choose to escalate uh against the Israeli strike that killed several senior KS Force irgc extr territorial operations uh uh military persons uh in Damascus last week uh in essence one of those individuals was really you could say the connective tissue between the irgc in Iran the Syrian regime in Damascus and Hezbollah in Lebanon there's also stories uh circulating as of yesterday that that individual may have had a hand in the October 7 Hamas uh terrorist attack against Israel uh nonetheless in the past when the Islamic Republic has responded to perceived or real Israeli threats it's done so with drones and missiles but often against innocent civilians in places like Iraq as they did in 2022 and 24 alleging that uh these are mosad bases with no proof uh it's likely you could see some kind of regional configuration like that again but I don't think we're on the path to a major war unless there's a direct attack on Israeli territory which I would put at low probability but high impact now you've floated some of the possibilities is there a general consensus among the experts where the what the primary targets might be and where where exactly or is this hotly debated uh it's something between a consensus and a debate there's lots of folks Yours Truly included uh looking at the Hardline Iranian press trying to Divine uh based on what is being said currently out of tan as well as the past precedence for how Iran has responded to try to figure out what the Islamic Republic might do uh interestingly the past 48 Hours despite lots of tough headlines coming out of Iran major speeches made it look like the place and the time would come at Iran's own choosing so it's likely that this could be a terror attack at a potential Israeli Target Israeli diplomatic facility isra Cultural Center uh in places like Europe even this is literally something that Iran's ambassador to Iraq who actually himself his former ambassador to Iraq I should say who himself was a a KS Force individual Flo just a few days ago in the Persian press um there's of course also activating the militias not just against the Israelis but against the Americans uh part of the Strategic logic behind that might be uh to Push Washington to try to constrain Israel that would be an escalation though I mean from some people right uh indeed it my view would be an escalation uh but ironically despite the Islamic Republic knowing that America is the more capable uh adversary when compared to Israel uh there is actually a greater willingness to embrace RK even overtly against America when compared to Israel because the government of the Islamic Republic and its military Elite have a different impression about American resolve and American staying power in the region when compared to Israeli now do you think there's any side uh that can do something to deescalate the situation and what would those moves look like uh you know certainly the Islamic Republic feels pressure pressure uh from the AES of resistance but pressure based on its own ideology to respond publicly uh the question of course is the fact that it can't achieve escalation dominance against Israel means that it certainly isn't going to be doing anything to drive a major conflict at least you know uh so long as they don't strike Israeli territory given that there's very there's literally nothing that probably could be done to walk the Islamic Republic back in fact things that are driving it Forward are you know the Drone program the missile program unfortunately the more capable the longrange St capabilities and the more lethal these capabilities have become uh the more often you've seen Iran actually be willing to actually embrace risk and in fact use these weapons and act on its retoric so unfortunately I don't think there's any kind of diplomatic walk back but I do think strong messaging from Washington uh that if this does get out of control uh there will be a swift military response uh could can contain the nature of the Iranian military response Ben I'm Ben tblu senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies thank you so much for joining us thank you DW correspondent Rebecca ritters joins us now from Jerusalem uh Rebecca how seriously should these threats from Iran be taken well that's very difficult to say Melissa but I think what is safe to say is that they are being taken very seriously as you said in your intro there by the US and Israel especially uh Iran has said that the Israel will regret that strike that Israel hasn't actually said that it did it hasn't actually confirmed it was Israel but it is uh generally regarded that it was an Israeli attack Iran has said that they will regret that attack that they their military are are at the ready and they are just deciding how when and where to retaliate now analysts uh and officials believe that it will in fact be a strike from Iran rather than going through one of their proxies namely Hezbollah in Lebanon um that it could very well be within the next week uh and that it will likely be on either an Israeli Embassy Target or something in Israel as you mentioned the US Targets in the region also possible but I think more likely that it would be uh one of those first two that I mentioned now as you say everyone here on high alert particularly US forces in the region and Israel itself also on high alert saying its forces are ready to respond to retaliate and to defend um so I think you know whichever way you look at it this is being taken very seriously and it's certainly the biggest escalation we've seen Visa Iran since the the conflict began in October so a very tense situation and things feel kind of imminent uh Iran has so far avoided direct conflict with Israel though so if it decides to strike inside of Israel what are we looking at a regional War well that's obviously U the biggest fear that certainly dominat the news in Israel and Beyond in the region I mean that is something that people uh the US Israel citizens officials have been concerned about since the beginning I think you're right to say that both sides uh have been trying to avoid a direct conflict and I think that uh stands that's certainly what we're hearing from analysts is that neither side do want to get into that direct conflict so I think that will determine where we will see this return fire from Iran of course if it is on Israeli soil there'll no doubt be a response from Israel and it will just depend where and and what is targeted and how bad perhaps the civilian casualties are uh that will determine just how quickly uh this escalates you know if if it is a more sedate response then perhaps Israel will hold back for a while it's really difficult to say at this stage Melissa when we just don't know exactly how it's going to play out but I think we're certainly looking at a potentially very large escalation DW course respondent Rebecca ritters thank you so much in tan thousands turned out to attend a funeral for seven members of the Guard including two senior generals who were killed in the blast clashes between Israel and Iran back Hezbollah along the Israeli Lebanese border have increased since the war in Gaza began nearly 6 months ago the funerals took place on Al's day an annual event when people in Iran and elsewhere around the world stage Pro Palestinian rallies let's bring in my colleague anilu farani for more welcome why are we seeing this on alud day and what kind of reaction have we seen from within Iran to this funeral from what I heard from uh pro-democracy activists and Ordinary People or uh read on social media I can assure you that people in Iran uh they don't mourn but they are happy because irgc and gos Force are hated among majority of Iranians as they are actively involved in oppressing citizens during uh various protests especially in the recent protest in Iran after the death of jasa amini so um what we've seen in these um funeral like always is the minority who cooperates with the regime directly uh like regime supporters or the people who are financially or ideologically have some interest in the regime so uh pro-democracy activists also saying that this is the perfect timing for the Islamic Republic as they use such events for their own propaganda against Israel and the west and just briefly before I let you go here looking at the increasing increasingly dire security situation How likely do you think we are at this point to see a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel um only in 2024 Israel has conducted uh more than 30 attacks on Iranian Targets in Syria and killed 21 one uh God's Force members but there has been no answer to uh these attacks I I I don't think this time is won't be any direct confrontation as uh it could drag us to the war with Iran and it is the listing that the Iranian regime wants I need to mention that here that one of the political organizations uh that belong to the highliners claimed that zah that has been killed um in Syria was involved in the um plot of the attack of on SE October 7th in Israel but I think it only be uh attacked by a Paris neaar thank you so much for that that is neaar
