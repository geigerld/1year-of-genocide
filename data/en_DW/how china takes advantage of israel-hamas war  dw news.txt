as this conflict intensifies by the day some are asking China to use its Regional influence to help deescalate you might remember Beijing brokered a normalization agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia earlier this year it also enjoys warm relations with Iran a country that backs Hamas the terrorist group that launched the recent attack against Israel now China has declared its neutrality in the matter but has failed to condemn Hamas as the aggressor and accused Israel's response of being excessive still China says it intends to send a peace Envoy to the region to advance for two-state solution peace talks should resume as soon as possible all kinds of mechanisms to promote talks should play a role in this regard a special Chinese Envoy will visit the region to attempt to reach a ceasefire and en the bombing and to deescalate the situation obviously lots of interests at play here and about those we can now speak to valina chakarova she's a geopolitical strategist and consultant based in Vienna Miss chakarova welcome to the day now tell me how could the conflict in the Middle East affect the global balance of power well first and foremost we need to understand that uh we are already in a cold war 2.0 scenario uh in terms of the global context that is a competition between the United States on the one hand and China and Russia on the other and now we have a second front where this competition is being manifested given the fact that uh similar uh development has occurred uh in Eastern Europe when Russia launched the war against Ukraine namely now we are observing similar Behavior by China also in the Middle East where another convergence of interests between Russia and China has um logically emerged as expected mhm how is Beijing using the situation to its Advantage at this point well as it was pointed out in fact China was pursuing a normalization of relations between uh on the one hand Israel and the Arab world on the other namely as it was also highlighted uh the Chinese broker deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran this was a very big diplomatic highlight and China was also implying uh the the ambition to brocker a deal between Israel and uh Palestine so in fact the plans are now put on hold as we've seen also with the American plans uh towards normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia so here now China is pursuing its old let's say uh more traditional approach uh regarding the region namely that China has been in fact um well in support of of two-state solution and has been supportive also of the Palestinian Coast that goes back to the time of the Cold War similar also to what Russia is doing this is of course a hugely complex um conflict do you think we'll see china hit a wall when it comes to its Ambitions to to expand its reach in the Middle East here well let's not forget that China is already client number one when it comes to a lot of commodities coming out from the region so uh the Arab countries were in fact uh strongly interested in intensifying the relationship with China given the fact that China is also the largest exporter of Commodities in the world so in a sense China cannot stand neutral uh even though that it is once again uh following the same approach as it did in Eastern Europe with Russia war against Ukraine sending an Envoy um more or less announcing a neutrality no China is not neutral on this conflict uh same as with the other and let's not forget that we have a third front which is of course uh Taiwan so it is a multi front competition and here once again China will have to uh position itself so clearly what we expect is that it will position itself together with Russia in a more convergence way uh as opposite to uh United States which is clearly supporting Israel let's look at Russia because they're seeking more immediate gains How likely do you think this conflict is to draw attention and resources of course as well away from Ukraine well this is goal number one as seen from Russia's perspective the very fact that now there is a risk of an immediate War uh that is the ground offensive that Israel is planning to conduct in the Gaza Strip is good news from Russia's perspective Ive why because the international attention will be drawn to another region and Russia of course will be more or less uh continuing its War of Attrition against Ukraine that is uh goal number one goal number two of course is not to have a war with all the spillover effects in the region but at least ongoing military tensions this is why Russia has now uh actually declared that it wants to position itself as a mediator while having all these conversations with key players in the region such as Egypt Iran uh even the Palestinian uh Authority so in a sense this is a typical behavior of Russia to take um all the sides to position itself between all the sides to support all the sides while actually making sure that the as I said military tensions continue and this is also uh positive from Russian point of view because uh United States will have to get involved uh on the side of Israel Israel is strategic partner among the most important strategic partners of uh the United States and that also means in the long run that Ukraine May face a situation where the Americans will no longer provide military aid another of course good news from Russian perspective so all in all it means that Russia will actually support the two states solution will actually go against military uh intervention so ground offensive but we'll also try to position itself uh in between we'll have to leave it there geopolitical strategist Vina chakarova thank you so much for your input thank you very
