the Hamas run Health Ministry in Gaza says 150 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes in the last day the war against Hamas is putting more pressure on displaced people seeking Refuge many have been forced into the southernmost part of the Gaza Strip which the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says is of key importance a 10 story building is raised to the ground in an Israeli air strike on Han Yunis and attacks here have intensified in the last week of the year as Israel sets its sight on the south of the gasa strip rescue workers search for survivors of shelling elsewhere in the city Israel's Army has been pushing into KH yunes as it tries to eliminate Hamas which is widely considered a terrorist organization this video from the Israel Defense Forces CLA claims to show operations against Hamas Targets in Han yunas Israel says it has stormed the headquarters of hamas's intelligence Wing in the city farther south on the border with Egypt at least a 100,000 displaced Palestinians have flooded into the desolate areas on the outskirts of Rafa in recent days the Hall of Gaza has been destroyed people can't celebrate the New Year our homes have been destroyed I hope the war will end soon I hope we can survive and live with dignity I hope we can return to our homes go back to school return to everything that is familiar to us in the new year every run around the world is celebrating the New Year watching fireworks displays but for us the fireworks are missiles all we have is rockets and explosions 2024 is likely to bring more suffering for many gazans with the UN warning that lack of supplies have left nearly half of them at risk of famine peace in gasa remains a distant hope let's welcome Marina [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from the war studies Department of King's College London can Israel just retake control of the Gaza Strip border Corridor with Egypt good afternoon well Israel Can militarily it can retake the control indeed um the repercussions of doing so uh will however be very serious specifically for the humanitarian situation but yes of course you can uh secure the Border it would def Factor reverse the 2005 unilateral withdrawal from the border from from Gaza however yes it would make sense from a military point of view to be able to control that border where Israel believes a lot of weapons are being um brought into Gaza wouldn't this be a feasible way though of saving civilians on mass uh possibly putting pressure on Egypt to allow Palestinians in I know so many Arab countries don't want to see more Palestinians displaced but these are people sitting in a very dangerous war zone well absolutely for Israel it would be beneficial to get the civilians out and to have them stay in Egypt or elsewhere to get them away from the battlefield which would reduce then collateral damage and civilian suffering however Egypt has not shown any willingness to accept civilians and that is a problem if Israel starts controlling the border and the civilians remain trapped inside Gaza preventing humanitarian Aid uh which used to come from Egypt entering Gaza and that could uh potentially escalate even more and I guess Egypt wouldn't be all that Keen on Israel setting up a military presence uh decades after leaving that area well absolutely it could affect also um broader Israeli relations with Arab Nations including Egypt um then obviously there is a problem of um constant trafficking across that borders and the the there are civilian refugees so yes that would make Israel even more unpopular it is now and wouldn't Israel first have to defeat Hamas to take control of the corridor and surely Israel isn't close to that with Netanyahu having said that the war will last many more months well that is one of the step stepstones in order to destroy Hamas because that way you could prevent movement out from Gaza so the Hamas leaders that Israel believes to be in Han Unis um such as yahwa Sinar and Mohammed D are trapped in Gaza and have nowhere to go and so controlling that border would be vital to keep the Hamas militants trapped in order them to completely eradicate them so that is a necessary evil from a military stand Point great analysis there for military analyst Marina [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thank you very much for being on DW news the US military says it's killed 10 yemeni hooti Rebels who attacked a merchant ship in the Red Sea helicopters responded to a distress call from The Vessel and sank several hooty boats as the rebels attempted to board shipping giant mask says it has now suspended all shipping through the Red Sea the hoodies have been attacking ships they say are linked to Israel research associate Asher okabi from Harvard University joins us it's been two weeks since the US set up a task force to safeguard ships in the Red Sea and the attacks continue yeah the attacks continue because they're not driven by any strategic goal they're not driven by any military goal but rather merely intended by the houthis as a propaganda a propaganda War to portray themselves as heroes in the Middle East and focusing on external enemies rather than on their own humanitarian crisis uh their own ongoing corruption and despotic Rule uh within Yemen there's a conflict the humanitarian conflict within Yemen that's holding hostage 29 million yemenese for the past n years and clearly focusing on the external Enemy Within Israel is far easier for the huthis to do than work on their own development within Yemen itself so what is going to stop these attacks the houthis have moved themselves into uh the Israel Gaza War not only because they see how popular it is in the street the number of hundreds of thousands of yemenese pouring out into the street in support of the Palestinians and against Israel uh but really the houthis see this uh as an opportunity to both burnish their own credentials uh coming into the uh conflict coming into the peace negotiations with Saudi Arabia uh but also to put themselves uh behind the shield of Gaza uh they realize very clearly that the International Coalition that has been put together by the United States is limited spefic specifically by the ability of other countries to join the war because joining the war against the houthis would be supporting Israel what about Iran is there something it can do uh so the Diplomatic efforts over the past nine years within Yemen specifically related to the Iranian supported militias the houthis have only led to the hou's ability to rearm uh specifically after the 2016 diplomatic negotiations that led to a ceasefire in the Western yemeni Port of Huda allowed the houthis to retake the port and gain an incredible advantage in the Red Sea both in terms of arms and militarization and we see the ramifications of that Huda uh ceasefire so negotiations with Iran uh won't necessarily lead towards any uh further ceasefires uh if anything uh this plays uh the scenario as it's playing out in the southern Red Sea works very much into the Iranian larger Mission within the Middle East to destabilize the various different countries uh and to work together with the militias in the ground in order to create Perpetual chaos in the Middle East which targets specifically the gulf countries uh the gulf oil countries Middle East analyst Asha
