the head of Israel's Military Intelligence unit has resigned for failing to prevent the Hamas terror attack on October the 7th in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 others were kidnapped Major General Aron haliva is the first senior Israeli figure to step down over the attack haliva said that under his command the intelligence directorate did not live up to its task his decision to step down could set the stage for more resignations among Israel's top security Personnel for more Let's cross straight to Rebecca rits our correspondent in Jerusalem hi Rebecca now haliva says that he Bears responsibility for this intelligence failure How likely is it that we'll now see more resignations from uh senior military officials well of course Anna that you know we'll have to wait and see what happens in The Fallout of this resignation we know that her lever accepted respons responsibility already uh in around about a week after the attack initially took place back in October um and several other significant officials also took responsibility including yoav Galant the defense minister though nobody stepping down of course until today the one person that didn't take any responsibility at that time was the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu uh now in his resignation speech uh General haliva said the Intelligence Division did not live up to the task that we were entrusted with and we certainly know now in the aftermath of that attack on October 7th that there were major failures in intelligence we know that up to a year before that attack in October intelligence officials were made aware they they had found a document that detailed much of what actually happened it turned out to actually happen in the attack we know that spotters who were who were stationed to watch uh over much of Gaza were in fact uh calling the alarm saying that they'd seen unusual activity uh that they'd seen um drills being carried out by Hamas battalions and that they were worried indeed that there would be an imminent attack but intelligence officials basically battered those fears away saying that Hamas had no interest in carrying out an attack they didn't believe that they had the capability to do so and in fact that they were more interested in governing Gaza that was certainly the the the opinion of not just the military but also the government listening to that um listening to that advice from the military so as I mentioned he already accepted uh some fault back way back in October and now he is uh you know living up to that and standing down as uh intelligence chief for the military he's also called for an investigation into the wrongdoings and into the failures of the military the intelligence and indeed the government but uh that's so far hasn't been undertaken by prime minister Netanyahu okay Rebecca stay with us I'll come back to you in just a second to talk about the scores of bodies that have been found in Mass Graves um at a Gaza Hospital civil defense teams in Gaza have discovered uh these bodies buried in a hospital Courtyard in the southern city of Khan unun the grave uh was found in the NASA medical complex which has previously been raided by Israeli forces the civil defense group says at least 50 bodies have so far been exhumed uh a spokesman said that some had no clothes indicating that they may have faced torture and abuse uh Israel's military says that it is investigating these reports um Rebecca Israel said that it carried out a precise and limited operation at the NASA hospital that doesn't really fit with what we're seeing on the grounds of the hospital complex after the raid does it well sadly that is true we've seen the so-called Precision targeting of the alifa and other hospitals as well but in the aftermath and certainly the pictures that emerged from there you know I will reiterate again that we have not been able to access Gaza everyone knows that by now but the stuff that we is being reported from journalists on the ground people eyewitnesses we're seeing a lot of video being circulated on social media and around and it does not show what you might call Precision attacks which is what the military say They Carried out as you say uh 50 bodies that number has has been increasing I've been hearing 180 even up to 210 bodies uh from the NASA Graves that have been discovered uh that number very likely to rise as many people uh reporting missing persons in that area I've heard numbers of up to 2,000 missing persons uh in that area so we may well see that number rise it's difficult to say at this point it's obviously Ong goinging just how how much that number could rise but Precision isn't perhaps a word you would use when you look at the pictures and when you hear the stories of as you say there I witness accounts of uh alleged abuse and naked bodies being found in these pits so we'll have to see what comes of that in the days uh and weeks ahead but certainly not what you might call Precision okay now let's turn our attention to what's been happening in the West Bank because residents there have launched a general stri um at the weekend they closed shops and other businesses after Israeli troops raided a refugee camp in the territory the Palestinian red cresant as saying that at least 14 people were killed dozens were injured Israel says it targeted militants during a counterterrorism uh operation Israel's military raids the new Shams refugee camp in the northern part of the West Bank the aftermath many killed and injured roads bulldozed and homes destroyed my son was sleeping there he had gone to wash himself then he prayed and went home his home is higher up there was a sniper in front of him who shot him I heard the sound of the shooting my other son went up there and found he was bleeding he bled to death look at his blood Palestinians describe the Israeli rate as unprecedented there is indeed complete destruction of homes shops the electricity grid the sewage the water Network and the infrastructure this incursion is unprecedented there are snipers and rooftops death squats and Special Forces deployed it's indeed a real [Music] war the Israeli military says it killed militants during the raid the Army also says it has found and destroyed explosives and seized many weapons used in what it calls terrorist activities following the Israeli rate Palestinian residents launched a general strike shops universities Banks and the public transportation were all close to protest the Israeli rate on the refugee camp and we're back with our correspondent in Jerusalem Rebecca RS Rebecca what did Israel say prompted this uh raid in the West Bank well Ana Israel say says that the operation was aimed at dismantling terrorist infrastructure and apprehending suspects that's generally what they say when they go into these refugee camps or area cities uh and carry out these raids um it's certainly we believe one of the largest raids that's been carried out since uh October 7 uh but we know that violence has increased you know tenfold since October 7 violence uh with all over the West Bank at the by the hands of IDF and also by settlers uh has increased a great deal since uh since the attack on October 7th with more than 4 80 Palestinians killed by either IDF or settlers um now 2023 was already on track to be one of the deadliest years in the West Bank for more than a couple of decades really since the inap years and we were seeing that already prior to October 7 that optic the optic environment has surged since then with critics saying that the IDF are using the distraction of Gaza to go in and settle scores but of course the IDF saying that it is necessary to ensure the safety of its citizens and to ensure that it doesn't see a a second or third front if you will if you include what's happening on Israel's northern border with um with Lebanon so you know you can see that that the IDF saying that this is really for security for its citizens but critics denying that it's necessary and saying that many civilians are being caught up in the fry we'll leave we'll leave it there Rebecca thanks so much that's DW's Rebecca rers in Jerusalem
