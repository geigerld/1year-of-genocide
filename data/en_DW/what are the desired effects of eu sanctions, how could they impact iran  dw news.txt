EU leaders have backed new sanctions against Iran Following last weekend's attack on Israel during talks in Brussels on Wednesday they decided to direct sanctions at Tan's drone and missile producers these were used extensively in the assault the leaders also discussed the wars in Gaza and in Ukraine Bradley Bowman is senior director at the foundation for defense of democracies in Washington DC welcome back to DW Bradley tell us what's your opinion on new sanctions against Iran do you think that they'll have the desired impact I think the new sanctions on uh missile and drone Iranian missiles and drones is laudable it's necessary but far from sufficient I mean this is a logical step right we had uh more than 350 uh missiles and drones launched at Israel in an unprecedented direct attack from the Islamic Republic of Iran uh we saw a a lifting of sanctions following uh uh as as part of the Iran deal uh that uh many thought was unwise and this is beginning to walk some of that back but I would say this is just a first step of many sanctions that should be restored and actually enforced we've seen a real problem with Iranian oil imports and the more oil they import of course the more Revenue they have and they're not going to build spend that money on helping the Iranian people of course they're going to spend that money and building more missiles and drones and exporting more terrorism so so you're saying that the sanctions are far from sufficient explain uh where you think they they should be headed and and what should be agreed next yeah now I don't mean to be reflexively critical I mean I want to look at these sanctions in detail and see how strong they are but if uh it seems like a logical and appropriate step to sanction the tools by which uh Iran conducted this attack so that's laudable for sure but I'm just saying there's a lot of existing sanctions that are already on the books both in the US and in Europe they're not being enforced and I and and I named oil and sanctions as one of them uh and you also have other uh sanctions related to the arms embargo and and more broadly that could be snapped back and uh as members of uh the UN Security Council France UK and us you laterally could do that simply with a letter and so I would encourage that those governments to consider that step if we're speaking about new sanctions 5 years ago the US government designated Iran's notorious revolutionary guards as a terrorist organization uh why do you think the EU hasn't done this yet if we're talking about sanctions it's a great question I I think um it's a mistake not to do so the Iran we often say I think accurately is the world's leading state sponsored terrorism and the means by which the Islamic Republic of Iran conducts that terrorism is the Islamic revolutionary guard core specifically their cuds force uh and so uh let me just highlight that the individuals camil killed in the April 1 Damascus strike uh were irgc officers who were busy doing what they were smuggling weapons to Hezbollah for the purposes of taring Israelis in their homes and by by the way we've seen uh uh thousands of rockets and missiles launched at Israel from Lebanon since October 8th so a lot of focus has been on Gaza as it should be there's now a lot of focus on this unprecedented direct attack from Iran but don't miss the the the low-scale and some not not sometimes not so low-scale War that's already going on in Israel's North as well with the varsity Terror proxer team and that's Hezbollah the fact that Iran directly attacked Israel for the first time on Saturday despite uh all the warnings Iran has crossed this line now do you think it's going to be possible to return to what is known as a shadow war that we've known about all these years it's a great question for more than four decades the Islam Republic of Iran has pursued a asymmetrical Terror uh proxy strategy where they've Advanced their foreign policy and attacked their neighbors while displacing the uh consequences and counter punches on to others it's often said that Iran is happy to fight Israel to the last Arab uh but now we see an unprecedented direct attack from Iran uh and I think it's fair to say that the Middle East has changed I don't want to overplay it but uh you're going to see um I fear if the United States and Israel in particular don't respond strongly enough this is this is you know the Rubicon has been crossed I think they're going to feel that they can do this again in the future and Israel certainly feels like it now has license to attacked certainly covertly what it's already been doing inside of round but but overtly and so I think the Middle East will be changed uh I think it does remind everyone anyone who's willing to be objective about this that the real threat to Regional security is Iran and it really uh I think prioritizes the need for building a uh comprehensive Regional security architecture that includes Arabs Americans and Israelis not for the purpose of aggression but for the purpose of detecting deterring and defeating aggression when it comes there's been quiet work for years on this between the US and its Gulf cooperation Council countries with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab in the lead um but you know let's look at what happened this weekend you had the jordanians helping Israel defeat this attack from Iran you have reports of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates potentially sharing intelligence that was useful in defeating this attack and so this really was the region saying uh no Iran we don't support what you did and we're going to help defeat this attack that was aimed at killing Israelis in their homes some analysts have call have been calling this an Arab Israeli axis do you agree with that character I ation yeah you know these these labels get thrown around I mean I think the bottom line is that what was so significant about the Abraham Accord Accords a few years ago by which um uh by which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates normalized relations with Israel is that they were publicly acknowledging what Arab most Arab governments have known for a long time and that's what I said earlier that the main problem the main threat the threat in the region Islam is the Islamic Republic of Iran not Israel and so they were simply publicly and diplomatically acknowledging what they know to be true and you know like like a bully on the playground Iran wants to keep the other kids divided and distracted and and that's one of the great negative consequences I would say of the horrific October 7th attack on Israel the worst Slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust is that it slowed normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel um but I don't think it ended it and I think it would be a mistake to let those efforts end because that truly would be good news for Saudi Arabia good news for Israel good news for the region and bad news for the Islamic Republic of Iran which wants to conduct aggression because uh it really would identify who the real threat is and would build that comprehensive Regional security architecture that I was talking about they will make it harder to conceal aggression and get away and get away with it I want to go back and talk a little bit about what you were saying earlier and and the response to to these uh to this assault by Iran over the weekend Israel says it's going to retaliate we don't know when or how what do you think we can expect in terms of the Israeli reaction you know it's hard to say in terms of the wi and how you're exact you're asking a very fair question um you know I follow these issues closely for my part I hope that Israel takes its time I I I think uh the world is reminded of who the real villain is in the region uh Israel is beginning to pocket some important concessions or advances if you will from um from its European and American Partners I think it should continue that um and but definitely has to respond uh you know if if Israel is only in the business of receiving punches and not counter punching that's a formula for getting more punches and so they have to respond they but how they respond I think is a matter of debate you could see everything from something all the way from an attack on Iran's nuclear program and the regime itself which really is the Puppet Master orchestrating these Terror puppets proxy puppets or you could see attacks on their energy infrastructure or military bases or more attacks on irgc forces uh throughout the region particular in Syria or a combination of them and also with cyber effects not just kinetic so there's a range of activities but the main point here to take away I think for your viewers is that on Friday pres the Friday before the attack President Biden was asked what he wanted to say to the Islamic republ of Iran and he said don't don't how did Iran respond they Shrugged and proceeded to conduct an unprecedented attack on the state of Israel clearly American Israeli deterrence is tattered that is unacceptable and dangerous I would say and Israel understandably after having 350 missiles and drones launched them feels a need to respond to restore deterrence and there's two types of deterrence there's deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment and in a tough neighborhood in a tough region you can't neglect the deterrence by punishment good to talk with you Bradley Bowman with the foundation for defense ensive democracies thank you so much for your analysis Bradley thank you let's pick up a couple of those points with Dr Arash aizi who's a writer and historian he authored a book called The Shadow Commander suani the US and Iran's Global Ambitions welcome to DW are more sanctions do you think an effective response to Iran's strike on Israel I mean I don't think sanctions do much by this point Iran is already one of the most sanctioned it's probably the most sanctioned country in the world it also happens to have relations with Russia which is already another heavily sanctioned country um we've already seen that a lot of countries don't honor sanctions or find ways of going around them and even those who want to enforce them um find sort of a bit of exhaustion around them so no I think sanctions will have limited effect okay so looking at what happened last Saturday and the repercussions Iran has warned that it would strike again with greater to force if Israel or the US retaliate for their retaliation for Israel's strike on Iran's Consul building in Syria so do you think Iran is prepared for uh Israel to escalate I think they're not prepared I think they uh thought they could do this attack and frankly get away with it they've been going out of their way to say we want the other countries um beforehand um the head of the um political ideological office of H so basically someone close to the Supreme Leader um said that you know emphasize that we didn't want to kill anybody in this attack um Iranian diplomats beforehand went out of the way to say we didn't Target population centers so no I don't think they're ready for escalation with Israel I mean I think they know that there's a appetite against it in the United States investing capitals um in the region certainly the Arab countries definitely don't want a Iran Israel war to breakout that can be a catastrophe for everyone so no I don't think Islamic Republic is prepared for it at all and I don't think it wanted it I think it took the risk of the April 13 attacks hoping that it can get away with it without a direct confrontation with Israel it's interesting isn't it because of course Iran doesn't want this and Israel probably can't afford to fight two Wars at the same time yeah look it's this is this is a interesting thing um that I think neither Iran nor Israel nor United States not Arab countries not Europe not the people of Iran not the people of Israel not the people of United States I don't think anyone wants this war like I think um the the the Israelis who are now calibrating what Target to pick they're hoping they're able to attack a a somewhere or or someplace that um that could not lead to Iranian retaliation but of course everyone every side has to speak of retaliation there's this idea of deterrence also many scholars when they look at it I mean it's not really clear what this deterrence means all the time um because you know you think you you're deterred but you can also get yourself into a bigger conflict and then this cycle continues uh what is so I think nobody wants this war certainly on the Iranian Society no one is interested in fighting Israel um you know Iranians as a whole don't really feel like they have a stake um in the conflict of Israel uh with with the Arab Neighbors in many ways and um they're they're not interested in joining this fight um and they certainly don't support the regime's anti-israel falling policy there um so look on a popular level and on a government level I don't think people want this war but unfortunately history is full of wars that began based on miscalculations um of others um and uh Wars that ironically no one wanted but still they broke out so this is why it's a moment that calls for serious leadership um on site of all the states involved um to prevent uh the escalation and and breaking out of a direct War something that has been a threat since the last six months in fact it has been a threat for many years now and I hope we can do anything everything possible to avoid it and and a word then about where support for Iran might come from because the narrative tends to be that Iran is a pariah it's a it's um it's operating uh in the shadows and in the corners does it have any friends that would support it in a potential uh further strike well first of all of course the Islamic Republic sits at the top of a the so-called axis of resistance a group of militias in the region that are very significant political military forces in their own countries the houis are uh effectively thean Yen um and they are perhaps one of the most seriously anti-israel forces in the region they're all these Iraqi militias today's the Iraqi prime minister is allied with them with the protan militia so in many ways the governments that are controlling the capitals of Yemen and and Iraq are um are all allied with Iran in Lebanon of course is Hezbollah that has the um that is the strongest force in Lebanese Society in in many ways in terms of it's I think it's hated by many Lebanese people but materially it has a strong military power um and it doesn't have much Rivals so there there's Lebanon the Syrian regime that's more complicated I I don't think the Syrian regim would in any way at all want to join a fight with Israel but it doesn't all have the power on its on its own the access uh operates on Syrian territory when it comes to other countries um you know they'll decide on Case by case basis Russia and China have some relations with Iran they I don't think they want to get into a fight with Israel um Arab countries are mostly Pro Western in the region um other than the ones that I mentioned um you know but they are also they don't want to get into a fight they're proest but they're not pro-israeli and they don't want to get into this fight so I think the regional picture um is quite complicated when it comes to the war but what is very clear though is that and you know this will be a terrible War um that nobody can afford and a lot of these countries that I mentioned I mean Yemen and Syria and Iraq have experienced different versions of Civil Wars for much of the last 20 years Lebanon um is economically destroyed a a very exhausted place these are not places that are ready for war so a war would be a catastrophe on every level um for all the Constitutions constituencies involved a fascinating analysis thank you for walking us through that writer historian and political scientist Arash aizi thank you William Wexler is senior director of the rafic hereri center and Middle East programs at the Atlantic Council welcome to DW let's start with that complicated Balancing Act facing Arab countries in this conflict does future cooperation with Arab states like Saudi Arabia form part of Israel's calculation when it comes to calibrating its response to Iran's attack absolutely uh one of the real differences in what we've seen now and what we saw just a little while ago is that the Israel's war in Gaza was dividing it from its Arab neighbors Israel's conflict with Iran is bringing Israel together with its Arab neighbors so it's a very different Dynamic so too much and you RIS inflaming the the inflaming Allies that you spent decades uh uh trying to get on side indeed the average um uh Arab um is very upset about Israel's war on Gaza um the average Arab government is very concerned about the threat that Iran uh poses so it's a balancing act um that uh that these governments have to do most of these governments also have no love LW for Hamas um so it's a balancing act that they've been doing now ever since October 7th and and Jordan's position uh seems particularly precarious how does Jordan's King Abdullah balance strong public support for Palestinians with shooting down Iranian missiles well it's a very clear narrative for him um he is defending the sovereignty of Jordanian airspace the Iranians uh entered into his airspace that was an invasion of sovereignty um without the permission of Jordan and so he was fully in his rights to defend his country and his people um from those that's the narrative that he is presenting to his people that's a narrative that he's pres to the world that is also legally and practically correct it will also be viewed by some as a a support for Israel and is there any benefit to Iran from Jordan shooting down Iranian missiles well Iran is trying to walk a fine line of their own they're trying to uh enhance deterrence against Israel because they're very upset about the success that Israel has had in targeting a number of senior uh Iranian military leaders they're also trying to um not provoke a wider Regional War they're very happy with the situation that they have and they're trying to create a new normal which allows them to strike directly at Israel for the very first time and for that to somehow be accepted as as a way of behavior that um aligns with the rest of their malign Behavior throughout the region we'll pick that apart now firstly why did Iran decide that now was the time to attack Israel directly instead of through proxies really because of Israel's success um back in the beginning of the month they uh they targeted a number of senior leaders um including one that was very important to the ks Force um one that has a personal relationship with the supreme leader in Iran um and they killed him um and that was seen by Iran as something that they had to respond to um they don't like the fact that Israel is so successful at taking out their their generals okay and so this new normal that you mentioned tell us how Iran benefits from that this is uh part of the Iranian playbook for many decades now what they do is they March up the escalation ladder until they're pushed down they March back up again and what they try to do is create an environment in which they can get the world to accept behavior that would otherwise be considered completely unacceptable they are literally the only country in the world that routinely gives Precision Weaponry to non-state actors and instructs them to fire them across International borders to intentionally Target civilians but they do that so routinely that we don't even comment on it they've had the they've had their allies in Hezbollah move tens of thousands of Israelis out of their home in the north a year ago that would have you would have said that was a Prelude to war but they've done that below War they have their allies the houthis um in the Babel mem streight shut down all international shipping again a year ago that would have been a Prelude to war they've been able to do that below the threshold of war and now they're trying to establish the ability to to hit Israel directly from Iranian territory so given that new normal as you describe it if Israel does act militarily and decisively what does Iran do does it go back up that escalation ladder does it want a full-on direct conflict with Israel Iran doesn't want a full-on conflict and is and Israel shouldn't want to full on conflict Israel has its hand full in Gaza uh right now and and their other military activities that they need to do um so hopefully uh uh we won't be in that scenario what folks in Jerusalem are trying to figure out is how do they send a signal that tells uh Iran that they do not accept the ability for Iran to Target them directly but at the same time does not result in a wider Regional War that's what that's why they've been taking the days to work this out in Jerusalem okay that's very clear thank you so much for walking us through that will Wexler from the Atlantic Council thank you now Germany's foreign minister has concluded her visit to Israel aimed at diffusing tensions with Iran an Elena bbok met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the Fallout from Iran's unprecedented aerial attack at the weekend earlier in the day uh she met with President ISAC Herzog in Jerusalem like many of Israel's allies Germany has been urging deescalation in this conflict speaking at Tel aviv's benorian air report as bbok warned that Iran's attack on Israel shows tan is not afraid of escalation I am reiterating here today my total condemnation of this dangerous act and have told my Israeli Partners very clearly Israel has our complete solidarity Iran will face consequences we in the EU placing sanctions against Iran and will continue to work on these at the same time it is critical that this highly flammable situation does not turn into a regional Wildfire Iran and its proxies like Hezbollah or the houthis must not pour any more oil onto the fire last our Jerusalem correspondent Rebecca writs whether the Israeli government was likely to heed the German foreign Minister's call for restraint well Phil I think These Warnings from from many of Israel's allies will be take will be being taken into consideration when it comes to Israel's plan of Counterattack but the question is just how much we have been seeing Israel taking advice taking calls from world leaders including US President Biden but today we've seen the foreign Ministers of the UK and Germany as well but but also uh you know listening to Regional allies uh all of whom have been warning restraint if Israel is going to attack as it says uh it is vowing to do so it says that it has no choice but to retaliate uh you know we we we're seeing that sort of rhetoric but we're hearing also uh Netanyahu saying again today to uh David Cameron and analina bebok that Israel would make this decision on its own that it isn't going to be pressured by the Allies though it will no doubt be taking be taking this advice into consideration um uh you know I I think the the the leaders we've been seeing you know the war cabinet meeting day after day and they're not able to reach an agreement so these calls from Regional leaders and from allies certainly playing into the decision what we are hearing and what we can be pretty sure about is that Israel is going to Counterattack we've been hearing reporting from axus an American Outlet uh saying that there were the sources within sources close to the discussions were saying that you know Israel had given the decision to retaliate on Monday but had decided not to go ahead with that because of operational reasons so you certainly we're teetering on the edge of seeing a retaliation but of course when and just how severe we we don't know yet the German foreign minister also called for more humanitarian Aid to be delivered to gaza's civilian population how much is getting through now I think it's safe to say that certainly not enough that is what humanitarian Aid workers on the ground are saying and it is still uh humanitarian catastrophe unfolding inside Gaza we did see a lot of pressure put on Israel in the wake of the attack on the world Central Kitchen Aid workers it killed seven of those Aid workers including uh foreign Nationals now we've seen huge pressure largely from the US but other allies as well urging Israel to increase the humanitarian uh Aid that it is allowing into the Gaza Strip they said in the wake of that attack that they were determined to do so we had the defense minister saying they were going to quote flood Gaza with aid but uh that is not in fact what we're seeing we have seen an uptick we've seen the border crossing that they were going to open in the north open but only one Convoy cross over and we've seen also some aid though only eight trucks coming from that ashd Port which was another one of the the measures that they were taking in the wake of that attack we've seen 200 trucks enter just a little over on Monday comparing that to 500 trucks a day which is what we were seeing before the war then you know certainly we can say there's not enough Aid going into Gaza even still okay thank you Rebecca Rebecca rits in Jerusalem as tensions between Israel and Iran increase the International Community is being warned not to lose sight of the conflict in Gaza and the suffering of civilians there Israel is pressing on with its military campaign aiming to destroy Hamas which committed the October 7th Terror attacks the UN has warned of the threat of famine in Gaza and is calling on donor countries to provide nearly three billion in additional Aid by the end of the year urgent supplies descend on Gaza as signs of the war smolder in the distance these airdrops are a desperately needed Lifeline not only for their food and Essentials what made me resort to this parachute with the lack of cloth in the city there is nothing and our house was damaged we resorted to this parachute and it was incredible that we were able to make it work it was not easy but thanks God it worked Aid access is still severely restricted the UN says 40% of attempted deliveries to Northern Gaza were denied last week while most Israeli forces have withdrawn from Gaza St on residential areas continue children were among the victims of this bombing in Rafa like the rest of Rafa residents we were shocked when at around 10:45 in the evening an Israeli rocket hit a house that shelters his place people my sister's son-in-law her daughter and her children were having dinner an Israeli missile demolish their house over their head death has become a normal thing the people in the whole world got used to our death three people are killed in Gaza 20 died 35 died it has become normal we have just become numbers the Hamas ran Gaza Health Ministry says nearly 34,000 people have been killed in the conflict Israeli officials say the war is not over and they still plan to send Ground Forces into Rafa where more than half of gaza's population are Sheltering
