the Israeli military has reported that the number of people known to be abducted by Hamas has risen to 199 it's thought most of the hostages including elderly and children were taken to Gaza but there were few details on their plight Israeli Defense Forces have also released body cam footage of the moment Hamas militants breached the security fence last week before Fanning out in towns and communities and killing more than 1300 people Hamas militants record themselves infiltrating a community in Israel close to the Gaza border they breached the main gate to kabut sufa and began searching for civilians to kill or take hostage the body cam video was obtained by Israeli forces who battled and killed Hamas militants who carried out the massacre Israel has vowed to demolish Hamas after their Terror attacks that Israeli authorities say involved the the indiscriminate Mass killing of civilians including children and the elderly Israeli troops are stationed at the border with Gaza waiting for the order to begin the ground operation and to attempt to rescue hostages Israel has called up more than 350,000 reservists I saw our wonderful fighters who are now on the front line they know that the whole nation is behind them they understand the magnitude of the task they are ready to snap into action at any moment to wipe out the bloodthirsty monsters who seek to annihilate us if Hamas thought we would fall apart they were wrong we will tear Hamas apart Israeli border towns in the South are being evacuated ahead of the offensive night was like every night no change sleep for 1 hour wake up and hide during rocket alerts sleep again wake up sleep again I could hardly have a shower I could hardly shave myself some things you just cannot do so you deal with it the US has deployed warships to the region to support Israel President Biden said he's confident Israel will act under the rules of War Let's cross straight to our correspondent Tanya ker she's in the city of ashot in the south of Israel Tanya the Israeli military has now confirmed 199 hostages abducted by Hamas what do we know about Israel's uh efforts to bring back these hostages from Gaza yeah that's right that's at least 199 hostages that are being held uh in Gaza um in the past days there had been a whole uh you know identification process going on this is why it takes so much time to confirm to families and relatives where the loved ones are there's still identification process going on for many of those who were killed and we understand from the families and relatives they're asking more and more questions there's a lot of anger as well against at the government uh why they don't do much more prime minister Benyamin nanah who met some of those relatives uh on Sunday um but you know they couldn't they didn't get the answers they wanted especially in the light that there might also be a ground Invasion and that of course complicates um you know to look um on the one hand it should look for for the hostages but it might complicate actually uh their rescue we also understand that of course there's an international effort because among those uh hostages these are mostly civilians as we understand but also military personnel and uh you know their elderly uh children young people um but also they're having some of them have uh other nationalities or have dual citizenship so there is an international effort as well to help and try to see how to mediate some kind of uh exchange or some kind of you know to to solve this solution but at the same time there doesn't seem to be a window right now the war is going on we heard from Gaza there are air strikes a massive campaign of air strikes we had just rocket fire uh also here in the south of Israel so there's no letup in that um and uh this this has to be done now in these conditions now the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has returned to Israel after touring six Arab countries what can we expect from his visit what did he bring back well I think uh there there are several issues here on the one hand of course uh there are also us Nationals among those hostages there are also uh some that are still unaccounted for so this is uh one certainly one of the many issues that uh the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin is is working on also with the help of other nations that are usually you know mediators in that case Qatar or Egypt he just was in Egypt on Sunday and also he was working on and he is working on on the humanitarian uh uh Aid or on on some sort of uh solution to get in some humanitarian Aid into Gaza uh as we heard the ra Crossing is still uh not open the situation is very fluid and unpredictable there because air strikes are also ongoing um and we also know that he wants to get out some of the uh um us Nationals that are in Gaza Palestinians with US citizenship but also others with a dual citizenship but that hasn't happened yet and also another topic here for the us as we just heard they send more warships they have two aircraft carriers here and uh in in the to the Eastern Mediterranean also to make sure that this is not spiring out of control into a wider conflict in the area especially also now everybody in Israel is looking up uh to the north to the uh Lebanese Israeli border or we have seen a lot of exchanges of fire and the tensions are rising there so um this is another concern of course also for for the us as well as for other and for for Israel T in as thank you very much
