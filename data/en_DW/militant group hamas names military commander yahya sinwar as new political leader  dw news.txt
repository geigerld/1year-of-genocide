well the Palestinian militant group Hamas says it has chosen its top military commander in Gaza as its new political leader y Sina replaces former political leader isma Haner who was killed last week in Iran Sina is the man Israel believes was behind the October 7th Terror attacks it's been pursuing him ever since and has vowed to kill him let's go straight to Jerusalem where DW tanyaa is following this story for us T what's being made of this announcement where you are well I think it shows that Hamas is capable of rather swiftly uh choosing a new leader that they have done this throughout the years especially after now these targeted killings and uh just like you know what happened to is hania in tan uh last week uh first and foremost it's Senor that this will move uh the power back to Gaza to the leaders ship in Gaza now Hamas has a leadership that is divided in the occupied West Bank in Gaza and in uh and abroad uh and this will uh consolidate uh the power between uh the military wing and the political Wing under Yahya Sina who is since October 7 since uh the terror attacks on October 7 he's considered one of the masterminds of these attacks and of of course the war now in Gaza he is in hiding uh so so it will consol consolidate the power uh under this one person uh it's also a defying Step At least at scene like this here in Israel uh he is on Israel's Hit List he is considered as I said as The Mastermind of the attacks from October 7 and we already heard from the IDF spokes person but also from the uh Israel's foreign minister cuts that Israel should swiftly eliminate sinir so they have been trying uh to to catch him but haven't found him yet there in Gaza so what does the appointment then mean for a a ceasefire any possible ceasefire and hostage negotiations well I think it's not yet clear I mean uh it seems that you know they also um conflicting statements what's the state of these negotiations right now especially now that um after the uh targeted killings in Beirut and Teran and the region is waiting for a retaliation from uh Iran and Hezbollah but um what has been the case for now is that the leadership outside isma hania was basically leading those negotiations but he had to consult and uh the decision making was ma made together with Yahya Sina so this will be now solely in the hands of Yahya Sina at least that is what's being expected there's also a small detail will be very difficult as he is in hiding you to to pass on those messages mik may be making these uh the this process a bit more complicated as well but as I said again the situation right now everybody's waiting for retaliation uh by Hezbollah and by Iran and it's unclear where those talks uh on releasing the hostages but also on a ceasefire that's really important for the people in Gaza where they will be going as the region here is on edge DW is ten cler reporting from Jerusalem thank you
