internal investigation by Israel's military has acknowledged that its troops failed to protect civilians during hamas's October 7th Terror attacks the inquiry detailed a slow and disorganized response to the attack on the beeri kabot one of the worst hit communities that day Israel's defense minister is calling for a state inquiry into the attack and the government's response security cameras capture the moment Hamas Fighters surrounded kabot ber their attack began early in the morning on October 7th and ended with 101 residents killed another 32 people taken hostage the military has now admitted the community waited hours for help to arrive with forces waiting outside the kots into the afternoon as residents were being killed the Israel Defense Forces failed in their mission to protect the residents of kibutz berry it is painful and difficult for me to say this the IDF should have defended the residents of kibutz B but unfortunately we were not there for long hours of fighting for hours the residents of B defended their families with their bodies alone in front of the terrorists the military admitted it was prepared for the infiltration of militants didn't have enough forces in the area and said its fighting was uncoordinated the investigation praised The Bravery of the kibutz residents but some still have questions the conclusion of this investigation this is what uh supposed to Cal me down in the future but we didn't get the answer why the Army didn't come in a minute why we left alone some conclusions but not like the big picture conclusion and uh what could have done differently and what they are going to do on the next step how can we feel secure again Israel's defense minister yov Gulland is now calling for a national inquiry it's the probe needs to check me Minister of Defense it needs to check the prime minister and needs to check the chief of staff and the head of the shin human rights groups have previously criticized Israeli Army investigations saying they rarely result in punishment Israel's fighting in Gaza in response to the October 7th attacks has killed 38,000 people according to Hamas run Health authorities Israel is now facing allegations of war crimes and genocide in international courts well I'm joined Now by Bing sladin he's a journalist based in Tel Aviv good evening to you B maybe we can start by you telling us how remarkable is it that the IDF has admitted its own failings its own mistakes well if the question is if that's unusual then the answer is no this is not the first investigation in es like this has been done also after the Yon kipur War when Egypt by then attacked or surprisingly attacked um Israel on that day and there has been lot of failure and uh thef by then also admitted their mistakes also after the 2006 war or military operation if we can call it this way uh with hisbah there has been also internal investigation and conclusions that led to many U punishments for the um senior commanders in Israel and also the Prime Minister was affected by this defense minister as well so this is not the first time and this has been expected it what has been announced a couple of months ago there's been some push back uh for it especially by the political level for their own reasons but this is not the first time and uh this has been expected in Israel yeah talk to me about the consequences that this report could have particularly for the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu well theoretically speaking uh he's not affected by it this is an internal investigation inside the IDF inside the military and it is just for learning from their mistakes and concluding what they can do better in the future but practically speaking while we're talking about uh uh this investigation the uh this is apparently bad news for the Prime Minister and that's that's why there has been some push back from his office when it has been announced because of the fact that when the investigations start then it means that we will at some point have more pressure on the prime minister to open that state inquiry that independent investigation that will investigate him as well now just a couple of hours ago and recent poll uh 40% of isra 39 specifically has said that he is the one to blame more than anyone else in the uh political level and also the military level for the 7th of October attack and even 72% of Israelis say that he should resign either now or at some point in the future so apparently this is of course going to be uh considered bad news for the Prime Minister our report that air just before you and I began talking you know highlighted the Barry Kuts what do we know about the survivors um from that kabut I mean how are they doing today well uh most of them of course evacuated after the October 7th attack but from the recent data uh that has been announced uh six days ago so last week by the knesset Apparently most of them came back there is no specific number of um the people that came back to their homes in each kibuts but 43,000 of those who who evacuated came back to their homes apparently because of the um relatively safe situation right now we're not hearing any sirens in the in the uh uh South excuse me and the situation is different of course now but uh in terms of how they are doing of course they are seeking answers now uh for their uh for the failure of the IDF back then and also for the failure of the political level so of course they are devastated but they want to go back to their lives and that's better apparently for them than leaving their homes to some hotels or motels anywhere else in Israel journalist Bing with the latest tonight from Tel Aviv B we appreciate your reporting tonight thank you thank you
