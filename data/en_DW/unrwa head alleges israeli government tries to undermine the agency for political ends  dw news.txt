a new report by the United Nations says that there are quote reasonable grounds to believe that rape and gang rape occurred during the October 7th terrorist attacks led by Hamas against Israel the UN Mission interviewed survivors and Witnesses and examined hours of video footage and thousands of photographs to arrive at this conclusion the special representative on sexual violence said she and a team of experts had found clear and convincing information about rape and sexualized torture the report also said that some incidents of rape could not be verified but there was convincing information that hostages taken from Israel were subjected to sexual violence during their captivity oober meanwhile the head of the un's Palestinian refugee agency unra has warned of a deliberate campaign to destroy it following a funding freezed by donors speaking at the UN General Assembly Philipe lazarini stressed that the agency was vital to support what he called a sea of displaced Palestinians in Gaza he alleged the Israeli government was trying to undermine the agency for political ends Israel has repeatedly accused anra of employing Staff linked to Hamas and other militant groups that's led many countries to suspend funding lazarini warned that the agency was being pushed to the brink we are functioning hand to m without additional funding we will be in Uncharted Territory with serious implication for Global Peace and security the fate of the agency and the millions of people who depend on it hung in the balance excellencies un is facing a deliberate and concerted campaign to undermine its operations and ultimately end them DW correspondent Tanya Kramer joins us now from Jerusalem Tanya the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency claims there's a deliberate and concerted campaign aimed at ending its operations in Gaza what's Israel's response to that well I think Israel uh has made it uh repeatedly clear that they don't see a role anymore for unra in Gaza and potentially also o uh in the region and uh Israel's military spokesperson Dan in hagari last night in that regard they released again audio recording as they say uh reportedly um it's the voices of two uh uh people uh two uh employees of unra as they say that are linked directly to um taking hostages uh at least one of them uh on October uh 7th now the head head of unra Philipe larini as we heard him now speaking last night uh said they have received no clear evidence uh of Israel for their claims and that uh unra has stressed time and time again that they are submitting the list of employees um uh to Israel and that over the year there were no uh um you know no complaints received by unia over these uh um uh employees um of course this has direct repercussions as we heard for Palestinians in Gaza unra is the biggest Aid provider in Gaza and obviously uh a lot of donor countries have suspended their aid so this has a direct impact now uh on the people in Gaza now the UN had also faced criticism for reacting too slowly to reports that Hamas used sexual violence during its attacks on October 7th Tanya a un report has now come out uh it's been published saying on that very topic tell us more well the reactions are coming in now from Israel and we heard from the foreign Ministry that they welcomed uh as they put it the definitive uh recognition that Hamas committed sexual crimes and they're calling for convening the UN Security Council we also uh just got a statement by president itak are calling the report of immense importance showing uh that there was systematic and ongoing sexual crimes committed uh by Hamas now this comes as you said there was a lot of criticism leveled at the United Nations especially also at uh uh the un uh women uh agency that they were not um uh acting uh fast enough not taking it uh serious enough and now we have uh the UN special representative on sexual violence and conflict prila Patton as you said they were in Israel Gathering the information and she has said that they found clear and convincing information that hostages have been subjected to sexual violence that this could be potentially be ongoing and also that there were reasonable grounds to believe that uh sexual violence rape and gang rape uh happened uh during the terror attacks on October 7th now all this comes Tanya as negotiators meet in Cairo for talks on a truce and uh on Rel getting the release of those uh of those hostages from from Gaza what's the latest there briefly if you can yeah diplomatics efforts are ongoing as we understand and it would be a third day uh where um uh negotiators come together from Egypt Qatar uh Hamas and also from the US uh in Kyo they're expected uh to uh continue those negotiations but uh it seems that there is one of the problems Israel is not part at the moment they haven't been their delegation is not in Karu yet they have said that they want to see a list of Hamas of those hostages that are still alive 130 hostages are believed to be in Gaza 30 of them are presumably have been killed but they want to see this before those negotiations are uh further going Tanya thank you very much that was our correspondent Tanya Kramer in
