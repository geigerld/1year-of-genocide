well my first guest tonight served as prime minister of the Palestinian Authority between 2007 and 2013 Salam fat is also a veteran political opponent of Hamas in the West Bank Mr fiad is an economist by training he's currently a visiting scholar and lecturer at Princeton University in the US which is where he joins us from tonight Mr Prime Minister welcome to the program it's good to have you with us tonight I'd like to if possible thank you thank you I'd like to start if we could in the future and then return to the present when the fighting is over in Gaza the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin says that both Gaza and the West Bank should be United under the leadership of the Palestinian Authority can you see the Palestinian Authority taking on that role not as it is currently configur I have written about this before the S state made the statement he did I believe he made either yesterday or today I I just read it uh the concept is sound I mean Gaza and West Bank are supposed to be under the perview of the Palestinian Authority and that's how it all started and and the separation took place in 2007 as you know uh but to say that the Palestinian Authority as is currently constituted and and configured uh is to be expected to really assume that responsibility on on the so-called day after uh I think that's the to order but before we get there we have to get to the day after and when that happens it will not be a day too soon before we consider any of these issues the focus must squarely be on stopping the Bloodshed I I saw some footage and images on on your screen and they are you know for all to see how can there be even consideration of anything to be done in the day after until the blood ched stops The Killing must stop the destruction must stop and that ought to be the utmost priority right now the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says whatever happens Israel will maintain security control over Gaza he said that will happen indefinitely who should govern Gaza when the fighting stops if it's not the Palestinians you know I when he says what he says about maintaining security control over Gaza as if Israel has not been doing that I mean there is this usion out there that when Gaza when when Israel quote unquote disengaged from Gaza back in 2005 that actually the occupation of Gaza ended that's not true Gaza has been under siege for decades now uh even before 2007 from time to time subsequent to that definitely Israel has been there I mean the mere fact that this attack on Israel Southern Israel was possible in two th in in on October 7 does not in any manner shape or form suggest that Israel did not really have control over Gaza from a security point of view it just happened and they themselves are looking for answers and I suppose they will launch commissioner inquir to find out what happened but the mere fact that an attack like this happened does not at all suggest that they were not in control they in control of everything besides this current very serious and unprecedented of escalation was preceded by several such rounds beginning in 2006 not to mention flareups from time to time before then and between those those rounds but nothing at the scale that has been taking place over the past month and few days I'm going to come back to the president just a moment one more question though about looking ahead you know that the US is an ally of Israel the US is designated Hamas as a terrorist organization is Washington and indeed Israel are they going to have to accept Hamas playing some role in whatever solution emerges from this conflict B I have written about this and let me just you're giving me an opportunity to explain what it is I mean what I say the PA has currently constituted and configured cannot do the job I I wrote about this before us officials said what they said and by the way what what secretary blink is report to have said about this issue comes after about 10 days after the vice president of the United States made a similar statement uh on an interview she gave on 60 Minutes about 10 days ago uh there's something there I think that we should look into and see what's going on right there but before that I actually wrote saying that the PA must be reconstituted and reconfigured before it can assume its natural role of being in charge of managing the Affairs of Palestinian people on the territory occupied by Israel 1967 including Gaza what what do I mean by that I mean by that a PA that's consented to by the entire Palestinian political system and Landscape which importantly includes factions like Hamas Jihad and others who are currently outside of the PLO so that's a fundamental issue as far as I'm concerned I explained in the article I wrote why it is that I believe so number one as a matter of a political movement they do enjoy considerable support amongst palan public uh the last time we had national elections Hamas did win an outright majority we haven't had elections since then but they continue to to enjoy good standing with the public the doctrine on which the PLO stood since 1993 uh in fact failed and people saw that and with that there was a a concomitant rise in hamas's popularity and its platform that's the reality that cannot be ignored so as a as a a political issue I just don't see how you really can exclude from representation factions that enjoy this kind of public support that's what pluralism is about how to manage that effectively is our responsibility and my own suggestion would be definitely immediately and swiftly expand membership in the PLO to include factions that are not there importantly Hamas definitely Jihad is also not there should be there now this body reconstituted and this can be done very quickly is to consent to a PA government that is to be tasked with the role of managing the Affairs of Palestinian people West Bank and Gaza you know such reconfiguration is necessary because if you do not have that kind of political backing there is no president government that can function in Gaza an attempt at this was made in in 2014 but it failed miserably so this has to really be owned by the expanded PL consented to by the expand PL and then it should be given the perview to go ahead and and do that which is necessary to do in the period ahead but first things first Bloodshed has to stop Mr Prime Minister but what you're asking this is a tall order isn't it you're asking the Palestinian Authority to basically reform itself and at the same time to take in Hamas in the hopes that you can take Hamas maybe reform it get rid of the the militant arm and turn it into a credible political force that's a lot to ask do you think that the PA has it in itself to do all of that well we I need to really make clear to your viewers the distinction between the PLO and the PM P came into being as a product of the O Accord of 1993 before that we had the PLO which is kind of really the overall tent representational body and it acquired the status of being the so legit to representative Palestinian people now what happened since then the political standing and viability of the PLO as a representative of Palestinian people diminished in part because of the failure of political process that started in 1993 now what hamash does or does not do to reform itself Hass is like any other faction like factions that are within the PLO there were attempts at doing what I'm really suggesting now before they didn't work partly because of faction Rivals and what have you politics if you will but if if this is not the time to really actually do this I don't know when that time will come it is doable but that's the PLO it is not up to the PA to fix the parties the factions that make up the PLO PLO is like the the umbrella now the PA is is more of an administrative body actually under o law I mean a lot is made of what the pa is the PA is is nothing but a self-rule instrument that's what is it's not a state it's not anything like that it is supposed to manage and oversee management of the Affairs oper people must Bank Gaza that's what supposed to do now absent political support by the entire body the politic of of us Palestinians no Palestinian government of the Palestinian Authority can assume that responsibility that's what I'm saying now it's up to parties do whatever is they want to do to adjust their platforms to amend them to not amend them these are political choices that they make in the scheme that I offered there is election there is election at the end of a transitional period and people the Palestinian people then will decide how they're going to be led thereafter but this is a period of transition that we really must be uh definitely engaged with in with all kinds of ser seriousness ultimately it's to make those choices you were Palestinian Authority prime minister at the same time that a HUD Omer was Israeli Prime Minister Mr Omer says this week he said that the way to stop the fighting is for Hamas to release all of the hostages in return for an immediate ceasefire and Israel saying that it is ready for immediate two-state talks so you're talking about hostages you're talking about a ceasefire you're talking about two-state solution talks that sounds reasonable on the outside is it realistic on the inside yeah uh several elements there first on the hostages I think there Mr Almer as well as others know very well that and everybody knows this there were negotiations uh there were messages being sent uh as I understand it Hamas expressed willingness to begin to release the civilians amongst the the the the hostages or the prisoners and some of that happened in a modest way uh now they're saying and I I think there is logic to this what they need is a little bit of of resp in order to ensure that they can have access to all of those who are held cap captive in different places in Gaza and to ensure their safe P passage so the Israeli government I said if that is really the focus if that's what you really want to do and you're conditioning stopping the killing on the release of hostages there is an easier much less costly and less bloody way of doing it you know give that space create that that space in which the hostages the civilians can be released that can happen and it was beginning to happen and my understanding is that there is still ongoing conversation C is mediating and I hope that this will come to fruition but it's very difficult for me to see now we saw some images when some hostages were released it was an orderly transfer something like the this needs to happen you need to recreate the space the safe safety of Passage to make sure that happens so for Israel to continue to first to we want to eradicate Hamas we want to eliminate Hamas and now we will not stop until the hostages are released well guess what under this bombing and shelling unprecedentedly that has been taking place for more than a month now those hostages could perish I mean you I do not know a single Palestinian who does not know a Palestinian G has not been killed or know somebody who know somebody has been killed this is the mass of horror that's been taking place in Gaza for for a month now so I think what we really need is a bit of Sanity here there there needs to be IR rational uh uh uh approach dealing with with problems and this hote headedness where it's coming from I I can understand I don't accept but it can't be policy and we are dealing with situation when vengefulness has become policy that's what it really looks like to me Mr Prime Minister before we run out of time I want to ask you I want to apply maybe a question that was made famous by the former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger when he was talking about the European Union if there was a crisis in Europe you know he he posed the question who are you going to call so let me ask you um is there a Palestinian figure who Palestinian people could accept as a leader now a person who was not connected to Hamas that the Israelis could call and that the rest of the world could also do business with is there someone that you could think of right now who could take on that role yeah uh let me say and by way of reiterating actually what I said before we need to come to a point in time when Palestinian people are going to be able to make that choice Through The Ballot Box and and and that's imminently possible after a transitional period in which we you know some measure of stability is is attained that's absolutely essential which actually takes me back to the question you know somebody to call somebody to call in order for that somebody to be able to actually to be responsive for for for that person to really have a point of view that matters he or she must have the representational power to do so I mean the idea of just kind of really having somebody to pick up the call and for some say on me I'm able to do any any and all that is expected that doesn't happen things do not happen this way so that's why the representational framework of the Palestinian people has to be fixed right now it has been malfunctioning it has been malfunctioning for a while and it continues and it will continue to malfunction until that umbrella is broadened to include all those who are outside of it that's absolutely essential now you mentioned something about resumption of a iCal process peace process two State solution I think the one thing that I think no one should be thinking about is to rush to hit the reset button on a process that has failed for three decades to deliver what what needs what we need is definitely a new process one that actually starts given the failure over the past three decades by a formal statement of recognition of our right our national rights as a people including the right to self-determination which should include the right the right to a sovereign state on the territory is Israel occupied in 1967 minus that we'll end up in a situation where transactionally we would enter into another process another round of renegotiations and throughout you you could have problems and you could have flareups you could have escalations you could have all kinds of problems so what we really need if for this to be any different from what the process has been like over the past three years is is is something that's principle something that actually begins with a a recognition of our rights as a people right now we don't have that as a matter of fact we haven't had that from any government of Israel not only this can government not any government that preceded it it's about time particularly consider considering the retor that has been coming out Israel government and I'm not really only talking about the current one time and again Min of Israel said repeatedly that there was no room for sovereignty between River Jordan and Mediterranean other than israels now somebody who says something like this clearly is not accepting the idea of emergence of the State of Palestine on the territory occupied in 1967 so we really need to have to go to the basics I draw some encouragement from statements made by President Harris and maybe recent more recently Secretary of State if you add up the words they're using particularly Kamala Harris about 10 days ago uh she pretty much is saying what to me means we Palestinians have a right to estate that would be a good point to start the negotiation and a political process from Mr I can certainly hear the passion in your voice if if you decide to go back into politics please let us know former Palestinian Authority prime minister Salam fad Mr fed we appreciate your time and your valuable insights tonight thank you thank you Brent for having me appreciate it thank
