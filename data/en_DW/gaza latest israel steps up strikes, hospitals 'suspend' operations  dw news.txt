the health authority run by Hamas in Gaza says operations at its biggest Hospital have been suspended because the facility has run out of fuel Hamas officials say Israeli air strikes hit alifa Hospital earlier the israelian military says it's active near the complex and that Hamas command posts are located under buildings in the area our next report contains some images that may be disturbing displaced gazin were sleeping here near Al the hospital when it came under [Music] attack now the area outside the hospital looks more like a graveyard the hospital complex where thousands are believed to have been staying came under bombardment before the attack Israel said that its forces had been operating near the hospital it claims Hamas has tunnel networks underneath hospitals and other public facilities Hamas Isis hides in hospitals it hides in humanitarian facilities it hides in schools it does all these actions that are a war crime and against international law we will continue to expose this to the world we will continue to expose the face of Hamas Isis as a terrorist organization that cynically exploits humanitarian facilities an Israeli government spokesperson has claimed hamas's headquarters is under alifa Hospital there are fears that medical facilities in Gaza could lose their protected status under international law during war despite the risk the hospital's medical staff have vowed to continue providing care we will serve this hospital and we will not leave it we will stay with our patients even if we have to provide treatment for them by candlelight I cannot believe that hospitals are being bombed in the 21st century we cannot Evacuate the alifa medical complex there are more than 60 patients in the Intensive Care Unit more than 50 babies and incubators the World Health Organization said that other hospitals in Gaza have come under bombardment and that medical facilities are dealing with shortages Hospital corridors crammed with the injured the sick the dying morgs overflowing surgery without anesthesia tens of thousands of displaced people Sheltering at hospitals families crammed into overcrowded schools desperate for food and water Fierce fighting continues with more and more Health Facilities attacked forcing more civilians in Northern Gaza to flee well let's get more on this from Jerusalem with DW special correspondent a ibraim so Aya the Gaza Health Ministry saying that just a short time ago it had suspended operations at alifa hospital what more can you tell us well Hospital officials said the hospital has run out of fuel and that as a result one child one baby in an incubator has died out of 45 babies that they have at the hospital that's according to a spokesperson for the Gaza for the Hamas controlled Gaza Health Ministry uh rather this is a scenario that um doctors in Gaza have been warning about since virtually the beginning of this war fuel is essential to their operations and it was just a matter of time for that fuel to run out they have been asking for Israel to allow fuel into the Gaza Strip also virtually since the beginning of the war but the Israeli concern is that this fuel um could fall into the hands of Hamas who also use fuel to operate the tunnel system and also also to launch rockets and remember um Rockets coming out of Gaza are still hitting Israeli cities this is something that we saw just yesterday uh sorry Hamas Rockets are still trying to Target Israeli uh cities just yesterday uh there were sirens in Tel Aviv and in uh other uh cities we have also heard from a spokesperson for the shifa hospital that the hospital has been struck multiple times in the past day they've blamed the Israeli military for that the Israeli military on the other hand has said that this is a misfire of a Hamas rocket that was actually targeting Israeli troops in the area we're getting contradicting information from uh both sides on the story and it's very difficult to be able to verify exactly what is happening there as um the few journals that have been allowed in the Gaza Strip so far have been embedded with the IDF so we're not able to really independently uh get a an act accurate picture of what's going on around the hospital okay and just bring us up to speed on the Israeli army strategy as this ground operation intensifies in Gaza we can expect more close combat and uh Urban Warfare between Israeli troops and Hamas Fighters and with Urban combat um you know the death toll casualty toll is expected to rise both among civilians and uh uh uh Israeli uh troops but there's also the hope that with expanding ground operations there is a chance for more hostages to be uh rescued remember there are still over 200 um uh hostages that were kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on October 7th that are believed to be in the in the Gaza Strip so there's hope that with these grounded operations more of them may be rescued as well now while All Eyes seem to be on Gaza at present there's also unrest in the West Bank as well what's happening there violence uh settler violence in the West Bank is by no means a new phenomenon this year was already set to be the most violent on record but what we've seen since October 7th is a is is a is an alarming phenomenon that has been accelerating and that's of um forced evictions of Palestinian beduin herders in the West Bank because of settler uh uh violence according to un to the UN about thousand of them from 15 hurting communities have been forcefully uh uh had to leave uh their communities because of Celler violence I was just in the West Bank over the past two days and had a chance to speak to some of the communities there and what they have told me is that you know Sellar violence is nothing new to them but because of the war and because uh so many people have been called into reserve duty they're now seeing settlers that they know by face and by name coming to attack them in Israeli military uniform and that makes it really really difficult uh because often these these attacks are not often happening from the Israeli military and for some families it's just too danger of a situation and they have had to uh uh leave risking their livelihood um and um their safety the safety of of their children and this you know this um this increasing displacement if you will also puts the entire question of a two-state solution in an even uh more uh sort of Shaky Ground because the West Bank is of course supposed to form the heart of any future Palestinian State and we have if we have um increasing displacement and increasing um uh loss of uh land from Palestinians that of course makes this a much more difficult conversation to have now Israel's primee Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under mounting International pressure to do more to protect Palestinian civilians how are people feeling in Israel do they want to cease fire I've um spoken to families I think for the families of the hostages the question of a ceasefire has to be contingent with the release of more hostages I've been to their protests their sitting in Tel Aviv and that is certainly something that they're actually angry at the Prime Minister about they're saying that any concessions uh for the Palestinian side must come hand inand with the release of uh hostages overall there's um I would say there's a lot of support for the war effort here in Israel even though people here know that it will come at a high cost also for their own troops because they feel after you know the horrific Terror attacks of October 7th this is the only way to restore uh peace and security here uh in Israel that's AI Abraham reporting for us in Jerusalem thank you so much well joining me now from Cairo is Ahmed al- mandari he is the regional director for the the world health or organization it's good to have you with us here on DW news now alifa is gaza's most extensive hospital just bring us up to speed on the situation there and the surrounding area good morning thank you very much for giving me the opportunity in fact you know a shifa hospital is considered as one of the big hospitals in Gaza uh it has around 650 beds you know capacity but they increased it to around 900 um the bed Capac in fact increased to 188 to accommodate the large number of casualties sick patients uh the hospital is hosting um tens of thousands of refugees you know Sheltering themselves in that hospital uh out of the 36 hospitals in Gaza in fact 18 are not functioning either because of the direct attack or because of the lack of fuel um hospitals there are serving hundreds of thousands of patients and as I said you know accommodating refugees hundreds of thousands of refugees Sheltering themselves in these safe places but unfortunately there are around 235 attacks around in in the whole of OBT you know occupied Palestinian territory 110 around 110 are inaz which is affecting damaging you know severely the healthare system there now you've said that the hospitals are meant to be a place of safety and refuge for many people right now Israel says that they're striking Hamas targets now based on the information that you have and what your colleagues on the ground are telling you what signs have you seen of Hamas operations in and around the hospitals according to the feedback we are getting not only from who but from all other un agencies they have not mentioned to us and we keep asking them the same question and this feedback is from the UN they have not yet you know until now reported to us any doubtfully military operations there in the hospital or around it and to be honest you know what matters to us as a un are those people who are you know there above the above the ground you know in these hospitals there are tens and thousands of patients many of them are critical there are thousands of heare workers there are hundreds of thousands of innocent civilian people you know are Sheltering themselves and if Israel is is is you know having that sort of fear or worry to me they are are many political and un channels you know they can raise that and it has to be investigated but targeting hospitals for only the sake of you know having military people there is not a justification by International humanitarian no these healthare facilities are fully protected and any breach of that is really worrying regardless of where is the location and regardless whom who who is doing it just talk us through some of the the the major casualties uh because you know we are hearing stories about patients and intensive care babies and incubators how are doctors trying to treat the wounded without essential supplies right now it is very devastating situation there you know as you said they are operating with no medications like you know anesia medication ladies are delivering in a very dire situation very bad situations there are around 180 deliveries a day in Gaza there are around 700 cesarian sections out of 55,000 deliveries inaz many of them are delivering in bad situations there are around 130 units under incubators 70 of them under um you know ventilators it is really very worrying that those babies will lose their life there are around 9,000 patients with cancer needing regular you know treatment chemotherapy radiotherapy the only Hospital in a or the main hospital in h providing Cancer Care is closed so there are tens of thousands of patients who are in need of service and they are losing it hour by hour and this is very worrying to us all and do you have any information about these tactical humanitarian pauses that are meant to be taking effect and what impact are they having in terms of bringing Aid into these much-needed areas yeah we heard about this tactic you know poses but unfortunately I must be clear you know these poses yes it may help but the help is very minimal because the need there is very huge humanitarian need you know supplies water food fuel to hospitals as well as medical supplies it has to be full ceasefire immediately with no interruption with the safety of those people who are going to the field with opening a corridor or more than a corridor in fact uh before the seven October you know event around 500 trucks used to go into a with different humanitarian supplies until now for almost more than a month only 650 trucks entered Gaza with these supplies only 14 trucks with medical supplies from wh so the the need is for immediate ceasefire with no interruption with security of those who are going into the field because the situation there believe me is beyond beyond our imagination there are tens of thousand of Childrens who are suffering around 10,000 of them are suffering from acute malnutrition 5,000 will go into this severe severe status they need support there are around 450,000 people now suffering from mental uh stress and diseases from moderate to severe many of them are from schizophrenia pipor disorders depression they need support and the only Hospital in Gaza providing mental Health Services is closed because of direct attacks and because of lack of fuel these are examples of the dire situation ahed alandari from the World Health Organization speaking to us in Cairo thank you very much for your time my pleasure right thank you now despite international calls to stop the bombardment Israel is stepping up its actions in Gaza Israeli troops are pushing deeper into urban areas in Northern Gaza as more air strikes pound the region Israel has also hit sights in southern Lebanon in the worst escalation along the border in nearly two decades its main target is the Hezbollah armed group an ally of Hamas let's bring in a journalist Samy sool who's joining me from Jerusalem so Samy what more do we know about uh Israel's strategy right now with this ground operation and and the continued intensification so uh the forces inside the Gaza Strip are now we are seeing like both from the north of the city and the south of the city uh there are forces around the shatti refugee camp their soldiers have taken over the shatti school which theyve turned into a military base and from there they're going in incursions into the Gaza Strip we talk about thousands of so that are deployed and they're talking about a cooperation between the Air Force which is continuing to strike and the artillery at the same time we have the ground forces and the military is saying that all the forces are working uh together and they're talking about a long stay in the Gaza Strip some are talking about months of Israeli operations inside the Gaza Strip and yesterday we've heard the Israeli military official talking about a year inside the Gaza Strip so we're talking about a very long H campaign and there is already talk about going down south to the area where the uh refugees have been relocated to the to the South so so after uh what they call cleaning the north they will be heading towards the south of the Gaza script and that is why they are not interested in any ceas fire at this stage they want to continue they feel that they still enjoy support from some of the western Powers especially the United States and that any any L will kind of bring an end to this effort we believe there's also been some casualties among Israeli soldiers as well what's the latest on that yeah there are there been casualties but all all in all in terms of the way this campaign is is coming along the the numbers are not high the public is supporting this uh campaign ER the military is saying that the casualties are inevitable H the military have to pay a price for this but so far these numbers have not exceeded anything that the public and the military sees as a twoo higher price yeah um and Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under growing International pressure to do more to protect Palestinian civilians in Gaza um just give us a little bit more about the reaction to the criticism of uh the government's handling so far yeah well when Israel waged this uh campaign in Gaza in the beginning Nan was saying that one of the goals of this campaign is Revenge so and and other people in government and we saying that this campaign is going to look totally different from other campaigns in terms of the aggressiveness in terms of the fact that they're not going to let any humanitarian Aid into the Gaza Strip well what we we've seen is that as a result of the international pressure Israel is enabling trucks to go into the Gaza but so long there is a green light for Israel to operate it will continue with the campaign okay thank you that's Sammy CLE speaking to us in Jerusalem now Arab leaders are gathering in Saudi Arabia for an emergency Summit on Gaza Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas has arrived in Riyad for the talks as the war reaches its fifth week Arab nations are expected to issue a joint call for an end to Israel's bombardment of Gaza the leaders of Syria and Iran are also among those attending well here's a look at some other stories making headlines around the world Germany's foreign minister analina bbok is pushing for a two-state solution to the conflict she's making her third visit to the Middle East since the start of hostilities she began in the United Arab Emirates and is heading to Saudi Arabia next well activists in the UK have blockaded a British military equipment manufacturer calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to arm sales to Israel the BAE Systems Factory doesn't directly export
