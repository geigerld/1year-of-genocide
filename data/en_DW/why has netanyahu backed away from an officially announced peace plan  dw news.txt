we are using countless ways to bring back our hostages I will not sit in a government that raises a white flag I think of them all the time of their families and their suffering God forbid the government should adopt this surrender offer I believe that if a real deal is on the table Netanyahu will vote for a new deal we will work to replace the failed leadership with new leadership [Music] welcome to the day last Friday it seemed like there was genuine progress in ending months of Destruction and bloodshed in Gaza US President Joe Biden outlined a three-part plan for an Israeli Hammer ceasefire which he said came from the Israelis but today Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu made clear that there will be no truce without his government's conditions being met then he claims to the contrary are incorrect here's the spokesperson explaining the explaining the disconnect um he said and I quote the outline that President Biden presented is partial uh the war will be stopped for the purpose of returning hostages and then we will proceed with further discussions well Mr Netanyahu is under increasing pressure from Washington to end the war but he's also facing push back from his far-right Coalition partners they've criticized the draft deal as Reckless and tantamount to surrender if it's signed without the elimination of Hamas two ministers are threatening to sink The Fragile Netanyahu coalition government over the plan if the government chooses to adopt this offer of surrender we will not be part of the government and we will work to replace the failed leadership with new leadership which knows how to make decisions to win the war decisions which destroy Hamas bring home the hostages hit Hezbollah and allow residents in the north to safely return to their homes well the White House maintains the ceasefire plan is good for Gaza and good for Israel national security spokesman John Kirby said the intention of President Biden's speech last week was to pressure Hamas to accept the deal and not to put Netanyahu in a bind this wasn't about jamming the prime minister of the war cabinet this was about laying Bear for the public to see how well and how Faithfully um and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal how it shows how much they really want to get this ahood Almer was prime minister of Israel from 2006 to 2009 and joins us now from Jerusalem uh welcome back to DW um could we start with today's news that four hostages being held by Hamas have been confirmed dead by the Israeli military that was just in the last couple of hours yeah this is a very sad news as you can imagine we are losing them almost day by day uh uh two weeks ago we thought that we have 133 now we have 120 which means that 13 of the hostages that we thought were held by the U Hamas somewhere in Gaza on the ground are now dead and every day that passes they bring uh worse news so they need to uh reach an agreement that will bring back all the hostages is quite urgent right and and you're of the opinion that that this this news means that we should move more urgently in the direction of a ceasefire deal rather than more urgently in the direction of destroying Hamas well I thought uh maybe a few months ago already that we have reached a point where we have achieved most of what we set out to achieve in the military operation in the first place and that uh we don't need to continue the war and I definitely think that now it's overtime we need to stop the War now and we have uh to accept the proposal which was presented by President Biden which I now know that actually was submitted by the Israeli government and uh that hopefully will uh bring us to the point where we can make an exchange of all the hostages uh so that uh we'll bring them back and what want to get them forgive me please continue oh go ahead um what do you make of the confusion surrounding that ceasefire proposal apparently signed off by Israeli negotiators announced to the World by an American president and now disavowed by the Israeli Prime Minister what do you think is going on I wish I could tell you I wish that someone would be able to explain and to understand the uh uh policy of our government uh it appeared to me from the beginning that uh uh while it was possibly submitted by Israel that the main question was not whether Biden supports this plan but whether the Israeli government supports the plan which was presented by the Israeli government this I think just indicates again that the degree of confusion and uh a lack of leadership uh by the Israeli Prime Minister the choice is very simple and it's very clear it's not easy but it's simple the only way to get back the hostages is to stop the war it is what I think we should do anyway because we have reached a point where any further military confrontation will not lead us into any great achievement so we can at the end lose the hostages and not uh achieve that kind of complete victory that net was talking about so this is the time the only problem is that as we all know and I'm sure that you know very well that the Israeli Prime Minister is held and is uh squeezed and perhaps is extorted by his political Partners his political partners that say in the most explicit manner that will leave the government and they will break down the Coalition if this plan which was as we know now submitted by Israel but was presented by President Biden will be accepted by Israel formally and openly which will lead into the end or at least a temporary end of the war for maybe 82 days which means practically ending the war and uh the Prime Minister has now to make a choice what he wants more to risk the stability of his government and bring back the hostages or to maintain the stability of his government at the cost of lives of uh the remaining 120 Israeli hostages still held by these MERS and it sounds like you're quite clear that you believe that uh he should go for this this deal and end the war quicker absolutely I thought the we should have gone to this deal long before even before this was The Proposal uh in maybe two or three other occasions which took place earlier over the last few months but certainly now now it has reached a point where it is absolutely clear that every day that passes may cause the loss of more lives of the hostages and we are not moving anywhere in the military operation that is of any significant that can make a difference in terms of the overall balance uh so I think we have uh beaten the Hamas in a very significant way they lost more than 12 thousands of their Fighters their their um tunnels their headquarters their command position the launchers the Rockets they almost completely lost them they probably have few more that they can shoot but they have lost the bulk of it and uh so uh there is no need and no real interest of Israel to continue this military operation and risking the life of these people and losing the the support of the International Community which we have greatly lost anyway and also maybe also killing unnecessarily more innocent civilians or the among Palestinians okay that uh there no justification for it so all together if you look at broader aspect of what is going on the time has come for a complete cation of uh the military operation uh immediately afterwards when the hostages will be returned we have to pull out from Gaza there should be an international intervention force that will take over preferably it should be a Palestinian together with moderate AR countries but if they are not ready yet which I think they are not there should be an international European intervention Force for a period of time I know that European countries are not happy about this option but they were not happy in 2006 after the towards the end of the second Lebanese war and yet they uh took part in in the military force that were brought to the south of Lebanon and that has created a ceas fire for 17 years there is a advantage in doing this hope it will be done soon so it it sounds like you certainly have an idea of what happens the day after uh which of course is um the the what what Benny Gant needs to hear from uh Benin Netanyahu if he also isn't to quit this uh government in two days um how should Mr Netanyahu respond to that threat from Benny Gans you know I'm not certain that I'm the best advisor to prime minister nany as far as I'm concerned netan should disappear all together so that uh we can establish a new government that will be responsible and uh serious and courageous and have a vision about the uh future of this region all together which I'm not sure netan is the guy I I'm certain that he's not the guy so uh you know on the one hand the obvious uh is that guns and Eisen cour should leave the cabinet not in two days but tonight on the other hand if netan will choose to accept the proposal which he himself submitted to President Biden and will agree to AAS fire now and to the end of the war now it can give a good reason for gun and Eisen to remain in the cabinet at least for a while in order to allow this to take place netan doesn't have a problem in terms of the majority in Parliament to accept this because all the opposition will vote for the plan which was submitted uh for for the ceas fire but as I said before problem is that Netanyahu doesn't think about what's good for Israel but what's good for netan and it appears that it's not good for netan to end the war now because he will lose his government thank you for talking to us and talking us through that Ehud a former prime minister of Israel thank you so much thank you plan for a ceasefire well Yosi bin has served in a variety of ministerial positions in the Israeli government before retiring from politics in 2008 he was also one of the architects of the 1993 Oslo Accords he's now a journalist and business consultant welcome to DW let's start with this disputed peace plan apparently signed off by Israeli negotiators announced to the World by an American president and now apparently disavowed by an Israeli Prime Minister what do you think is going on well it is very strange apparently netanyahu's work cabinet decided to suggest some ideas to the to the pamas through Qatar or or or other channel H but did not announce it and uh so other ministers of his government were not aware of it h mainly because he was worried that since they they belong to the extreme rtist group they would torpedo the ideas of the smaller cabinet and here President Biden did something which was very smart in my view he exposed netan and said this is your plan this is what you sent to the other side what we would like to see is that you stick to your own ideas and nany found himself in the corner he could not deny it he just said that it was not the full ofer but only parts of it or something like that which nobody took too seriously so it is now up to the the Hamas to to decide whether they accept it or not and I hope that it will really change the situation and and enable us to have a ceasefire in which the hostages will be released and now we have rightwing elements of Mr netanyahu's fragile Coalition threatening to leave to bring it down uh if this is acted on what do you think he should do should he call their Bluff I think that there is no real problem because H first of all it is time to get rid of them there are really bunch of lunatics who were never participated in any previous government Nan himself promised only two or three years ago that they will never be part of his government but when he found that without them he could not form a a a government he decided to breach his promise now he has an opportunity to get rid of of the whole group and to get a safety net for his Coalition for the C from the center left parties H who promised which promised him this safety net and I think that that that is what he should do have a long ceasefire in in that time get the assurance that all hostages are free and begin to negotiate with the Palestinians on the permanent agreement something that he said that is not urgent for him to begin so is it your un understanding then that that Mr Netanyahu without these right-wing extremists would actually be more amable uh to um some sort of ceasefire deal because the mood music that that we hear around this is that uh that he's prolonging this war in order to stop himself from having to face the music on various criminal charges but you seem to see him as being held hostage uh by the right-wing elements in his government he was not held hostage he invented them I mean his idea to to ask them to join the cabinet was in my view the worst thing that he did and the the ramifications were endless so he is not their host hostage he can and should get rid of them and and assure himself that he has a safety net and he will have a safety in it so he he doesn't have to worry about him continuing to be the Prime Minister for the coming months whether he has a secret plan to prolong the war forever in order for the for the court to have mercy on him and not to judge his him harshly because he's in the middle of the war this is a guess I don't know whether this is true or not I I it is not a question of of effect the question of the fact is only that he has a government even if these people leave him and and finally and and briefly if you would in mind you helped negot the 1993 Oslo Accords what do you think is missing now that made peace possible then an Israeli leader who is willing to make peace with the Palestinians and to partition the land in order for the two peoples to live side by side and fulfill their right for S determination thank you so much for explaining that so clearly y see baing thank you thank you thank you for having me let's see if we can work out what's going on with DW correspondents Benjamin Alvarez gruba in Washington DC and Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem welcome both let's start with you Tanya um why is the Israeli government now apparently distancing itself from a ceasefire plan that President Biden says they approved well that's very much discussed here as well and the way it's being seen here is that prime minister Benin is trying to reframe uh in a way or to put a different spin on the outlines that were given by President Joe Biden on Friday night in a way to counter the anticipated criticism by some of his own cabinet members especially from the far right that have threatened uh to walk out of the government uh if uh such a deal or agreement would go through but also prime minister benam netan himself has said it time and time again again also in a statement that you know Israel uh won't end the war and uh that it needs to continue the war to eliminate Hamas and this is one of the main disparities here between the outline that we've been hearing from US President Joe Biden and you know what uh Israel is uh trying to say here the sticking point also that is a sticking point actually not just for Israel but also uh for Hamas and uh what actually we're seeing in this outline that was given is that the first phase would be a temporary uh ceasefire where some of the hostages would be released and then both sides would have to continue negotiating to come to this uh um uh permanent ceasefire and the release of the other hostages that will remain until then in Gaza but also Hamas of course has to agree to this and we are still waiting for an official response but there's no doubt and we just heard it um tonight the Army declared four more uh hostages uh uh that were killed in captivity in uh Gaza and of course the public pressure as well is mounting on prime minister Benyamin atan to come to a decision so Benjamin Alvarez guber in Washington does this Israeli backtracking over the president uh over the plan the president presented three days ago does this leave President Biden with egg on his face the White House says that what's important also to see other Regional partners are looking at this proposal and there have been many comments coming out from Washington on this topic Jake Sullivan the US National Security advisor said Israel has shown willingness to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release by this deal that was set out by President Biden and the White House is insisting that this peace plan was Israel's own and was not drafted by Washington to put a pressure on its allies some people have been suggested and that still seems to be necessary as many still wonder why it wasn't us president and not an Israeli Prime Minister presenting what President Biden called this Israeli proposal so all this this backtracking this must be stretching an already fraught relationship between Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu that's right and frustration is growing with the Israeli government Among Us officials but there is mixed signaling here again because there's another aspect here not just the frustration behind a closed doors what's also happening is this bipartisan invitation so from both Republicans and Democrats to invite Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to deliver an address to Congress that was confirmed also on Friday after President Biden laid out this proposal for a three phas ceasefire so a push that can be seen as trying to raise netanyahu's political standing in Israel so the timing here is important because if this speech takes place actually before there is an agreement it might be used even by Netanyahu to argue against the deal and this visit of course it will also be kind of awkward if for Democratic Senate Majority Leader Shak Schumer who supported this letter in this invitation and who has previously called for Israel to hold a new elections in Israel and tan krer what's your take how long and how hard can this Israeli government test the Biden administration's patience well I think there's a sense here that there are two sides who need to make uh you know to come to this agreement and so far I think that there's a sense here that the US has been patient at least so far but of course there's also a sense that prime minister Benjamin netan has to come to a decision he hasn't taken that until now and now it's the time to go forward okay thank you for that Tanya Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem Benjamin Alvarez grber in Washington thank you both
