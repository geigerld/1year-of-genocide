in Gaza the Hamas controlled Health Ministry says that more than 10,000 people have been killed it says they've been killed by Israeli air strikes since the conflict erupted one month ago now this number has not been independently verified yesterday the Israeli Defense Forces released what they said was evidence that Hamas is using hospitals and schools as cover for its attacks Israel says that it has intensified its operations in Northern Gaza in circled City and split the north of the strip off from the south all right for more now I'm joined by DW special correspondent a Ibrahim she is in Jerusalem for us tonight A Israeli media they have reported that troops are set to enter Gaza City within hours what more do we know we have confirmation that there's now a northern Gaza and a southern uh Gaza Brent that the strip has been effectively divided we know that uh Israeli troops have reached the shorelines of Gaza and as you mentioned encircled Gaza City you know one of the if not the most populated spot in the entire Gaza Strip and so as a result in the coming days we can expect uh Israeli troops and Hamas fighters to engage in close and uh direct uh combat now we know that Hamas maintains a network of tunnels that spreads throughout the entire strip but the Israeli military has always maintained that particularly in the north uh that's where a huge concentration of that network is and that's why for the time being uh the um the uh the ground offensive has uh been and is uh concentrated in the northern part this is coming uh with a lot of uh casualties the uh Hamas controlled Gaza Health Ministry has said that the death toll has now surpassed 10 ,000 these numbers as we keep mentioning on the show cannot be independently uh verified uh independent Watchdogs are not allowed in the strip and the few journals that have been allowed in Gaza have been so far embedded with the Israeli Defense Forces but given that this very tiny very densely populated uh piece of land has been under near constant bombardment for uh more than two weeks now we can expect that the death toll is very high but again we are not allowed in there and it's very very difficult to get a full picture of what is going on uh on the ground in Gaza at the moment the Israeli military it says that they are allowing a one-way Corridor for civilians to head south I mean is that a safe option for people to flee from the fighting well the Israeli military has been calling on uh gazan civilians to move from the north to the South for a while now our viewers may remember that first uh call for evacuation uh where the deadline was was initially just a couple uh uh of days which was deemed Impossible by International observers um and so we know that a lot of gazin have indeed made it South an estimated 800,000 have evacuated uh but there remains around 300,000 in the northern part part of the Gaza Strip and there are many reasons for that what we keep hearing from people is that they just don't feel safe going to the South because there have been targets struck in the South as well we've also heard reports that on the way from the northern part to the southern part uh people have also sometimes been struck uh by uh uh Rockets um and and air strikes there's also you know the the the the reality is that there might not be people who who are able to evacuate and communication has been cut off a number of times uh you know uh to the Gaza Strip so it may also be that people are just not getting that information with internet and Telecommunications being so unreliable it's something that we also have to deal with you know trying to get in touch with our colleagues every day on the ground it is very very difficult to to be in touch with people in Gaza right now and so all of this comes together to make this a very very difficult situations for civilians even if that route were were safe and we unfortunately have reports that people as I mentioned have been struck trying to get from the north to the South DW special correspondent a Ibrahim reporting tonight from Jerusalem a thank you Egypt has reopened itsa border crossing with Gaza for foreign Nationals and medical evacuees but the vast majority of gazans remain trapped with nowhere in the territory truly safe in Gaza the human cost of this conflict keeps on mounting as the small strip of land continues to be pummeled the Israel Defense Forces say they opened a humanitarian Corridor this allowed Palestinians to evacuate the north where the bombardments are heavier though it seems that nowhere in the strip is truly safe an Israeli air strike hit a residential building in a densely populated District of KH Yunis in southern Gaza they are all children not a single adult all children the whole building collapse on them these are your goals Netanyahu may God take revenge on you hundreds of thousands of displaced garans are now living in makeshift shelters in the south of the strip as Israel intensifies its bombardments for this Hospital employee just one missile strike took everything away I was working my shift at the hospital when the casualties started arriving shock I saw among those marted where my wife Mayon as well as our four children the youngest of which was 8 months old it's an all too familiar story for many living in the Gaza Strip the war between Israel and Hamas shows no sign of letting up and it's the people on the ground who are paying the heaviest price of all the Jordanian Air Force has dropped V medical equipment to a hospital in Gaza as supplies in the strip run dangerously low the air drop was made to the Jordanian Hospital in Gaza City and contained medical supplies as well as food Jordan's King says the operation was carried out in coordination with Israel's Defense Forces there are growing calls for more humanitarian aid for Gaza the Rafa Crossing from Gaza into Egypt has now reopened after it was shuttered for days I asked Ahmed al- mandari of the World Health Organization in Cairo how much of a difference this will make in fact you know as you said today uh RAF Crossing will be opened in fact but I don't have details on how many people will be Crossing but definitely it will include people who are you know carrying um uh different nationalities as well as you know casualties and sick patients uh this will definitely definitely help those people who are injured you know severely they need further care outside Gaza Strip um in addition to that you know it will it will give hope for hundreds and thousands of people who are seeking Medical Care outside Gaza but still I must say this is really beyond beyond the high demand and the need of the people inside G it should be really opened all the time with no interruption Elan Levy is a spokesperson for the office of the Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu the Hamas run Health Ministry today said that the death toll in Gaza has now exceeded 10,000 and that many of the victims are civilians my colleague geard elfers asked him how the Israeli government is justifying that first of all as you mentioned these are the numbers we're getting from the Hamas Health Ministry Hamas the same organization that on October 7th burned beheaded raped butchered mutilated its way through southern Israel and then lied about it to the international media the same Hamas that when an Islamic Jihad rocket hit the alahi hospital immediately claimed it was an Israeli air strike that killed hundreds of people the sun came up in the morning it turned out it wasn't an Israeli air strike the hospital was still sing and the death toll was much lower so we cast out on the Hamas numbers we also note that Hamas whether it's exactly 10,000 it must be thousands Hamas does not distinguish between civilian casualties and Military casualties we've been clear our goal in this war is to go after the perpetrators of the October 7th Massacre and make them pay we expect the death toll to rise from Hamas terrorists the people we are targeting now what's the problem Hamas has a deliberate and well-documented strategy of embedding itself in civilian areas in tunnels under people's homes its main headquarters are located underneath the shifa hospital in Gaza that's why Israel has been taking more action than any army in history and I'm happy for your fact Checkers to check me in order to get civilians out of Harm's Way 20,000 phone calls placed with residents of Gaza 1.5 million leaflets over 10 million recorded messages and SMS for three weeks urging the residents of Northern Gaza get out of the way temporarily for your own safety the Army has also opened humanitarian corridors for residents to evacuate during the insul of Gaza and just the other day we had Hamas firing mortars at the Israeli soldiers facilitating the humanitarian evacuation so we're doing everything we can to get civilians out of Harm's Way Hamas is doing everything it can to keep them there and we hold Hamas fully accountable fully accountable for any harm to civilians as a result of its decision to declare war on the 7th of October and then its decision to try to use civilians as human Shields now Anthony blinkin the US Secretary of State has pushed for a humanitarian ceasefire during his visit to several Middle East countries and several major un bodies issued a joint statement demanding uh a ceasefire will Israel agree to a ceasefire at some stage and when is will that be we will not consider any ceasefire no matter how temporary without the return of our hostages there was a ceasefire on the 6th of October Hamas broke it it brutally murdered, 1400 people and then retreated back to the Gaza Strip a ceasefire would literally let Hamas get away with murder it would leave it free to do it again this time with 240 hostages inside Gaza and Hamas is threatening to to do a second October 7th and a third and a fourth as many as it takes in order to wipe out the state of Israel and murder every man woman and child in this country so we will not cease fire until we achieve our war games our War uh goals of destroying Hamas so it can never again hurt our people and never again perpetrate what it did on October 7th the biggest Massacre of Jew hoca war in in a in a in a moment but Israel has stated you mentioned the hostages Israel has stated many times that the release of all hostages is also one of your principal War aims but do you think an allout military assault is a good way to ensuring they all come home I wish we could send Hamas an email and politely ask them to releve the hostages but that wasn't going to happen our assessment is the hostages will only be brought back through pressure through military pressure and diplomatic pressure we saw four hostages released by Hamas because of international pressure on Hamas and its supporters and we saw one is Israeli hostage who was freed by soldiers who went in and grabbed her out and our assessment is that only more pressure on Hamas is going to advance the goal of bringing our hostages home who hostages who I should mention include over 30 children under the age of 18 there's a baby who was 9 months old at the beginning of this war and is now 10 months old there are children who were literally orphaned because Hamas murdered their parents in front of them and took them hostage inside Gaza Strip so we're doing everything we can to bring them home and we expect the whole world to put all possible pressure on Hamas and its supporters to releasee our hostages immediately and unconditionally you mentioned the whole world there are you worried with because you do not agree to any kind of ceasefire that you will lose international support we know that we're fighting the most moral fight there is to dismantle the terror organization that perpetrated the biggest Massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and is promising to do it again and again until they murder all of us we know that we're the good guys and we know that history is on our side and we know that good Nations have lined up behind us like Germany who Vice Chancellor from the greens not exactly a party known traditionally for supporting Israel says Hamas must be destroyed even Senator Bernie Sanders says there can be no ceasefire with Hamas because its goal is to eliminate the state of Israel and murder everyone so we know that people of conscience are on our side they understand that the right of self-defense means eliminating the terror group that perpetrated this attack and that any anyone who wants to take the side of the baby burning beheading terrorists of October 7th they're on the wrong side of history and history will judge them I'd like I'd like to come back what you just said elimate eliminating Hamas Israel is currently fighting a conventional war against insurgents if you will and that has failed many times in the past in Iraq in Afghanistan for example how convinced are you really that you Israel can win this war against h this is an asymmetric War it's an asymmetric war between the professional Army of a democratic State and a terrorist militia that has embedded itself inside civilian areas in order to maximize casualties but we have no choice we cannot leave Hamas in power because if we leave Hamas in power it will attack our people again October 7th wasn't the first date in history history didn't start then it's been two decades that Hamas has been terrorizing the people of Israel firing tens of thousands of rockets against us launching raids inside Israel abducting people and October 7th was the straw that broke the back of a very strong camel we cannot leave Hamas in place and I think the world understands and secretary blinkin said this as well from his own conversations with Arab governments in the region that a terror organization that perpetrates a massacre like that cannot be allowed to remain in power a moment longer we will not go back to 6: a.m. on October 7th that will not happen Israel's Army says Gaza is now split into two what's the goal here the goal is to totally eliminate the entirety of hamas's terrorist and Military infrastructure we're going after every Commander every terrorist every tunnel every rocket launcher all of it now we've completely encircled Gaza and despite that have still allowed several humanitarian corridors for civilians to leave for three weeks we've been urging civilians in Northern Gaza to get out of the way temporarily for their own safety and most of them have only a small minority remain in the north just the other day Hamas attacked the humanitarian Corridor that Israel was facilitating they fired mortars at our soldiers who are trying to get Palestinian civilians out of Harm's Way because we're doing everything we can to keep civilians safe Hamas is doing everything it can to keep them In Harm's Way so the goal now is to close in on Hamas we will destroy its tunnel Network we will destroy its arsenals and it will terrorize our people no longer speaking about the tunnel Network are you convinced that for example if the the hostages are being held in this tunnel Network that you can spare them that you can get them out out alive I can't comment on specific operational matters but that is a top priority in our war to bring the hostages home and safe to their families those who still have families to return to that is aen Ley there spokesman for the office of the Prime Minister of Israel thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us earlier I talked to MIM abusar in Kan Yunis in southern Gaza before the start of the war he worked as a professor of political sciences at the University in Gaza City he told me about his experiences um I'm staying now in canun south of Gaza with some of my relatives since October 13th on that day the Israeli Army ordered the Palestinians in the north of Gaza and Gaza City to evacuate to the south of Gaza Valley which is and ra and I have been living with my relatives for the past three weeks almost now I'd like to come back to Hamas which is of course governing Gaza are they offering any assistance for civilians or is the population just reliant on assistance and services of the eight organizations well very much uh most of the Palestinians who have evacuated their homes and north of Gaza to the to the South are either with their relatives like myself or the overwhelming majority of them are residing at hwa run schools and uh uh institutions where hwa is responsible for uh uh most of their most of the assistant that they are giving them food uh uh water and they are offering also sanitation services so basically Hamas is not doing anything right right now uh uh um either onwa is in charge on other International organizations or uh uh the relatives are very much helping uh their their friends and relatives who evacuated to their to the south of Gaza now you're a political scientist let's talk about the support that Hamas uh had and maybe still has inside Gaza and among the local population well that is to be honest with you that is not uh there is no way of measuring Palestinian support for Hamas at the current moment you have to take into consideration that there are more than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed since this Israeli bombardment against Gaza a civilian population has started and also more than 20,000 uh people have been injured in addition to the uh destruction that has been inflicted on many areas of the Gaza Strip so there is no way of knowing whether people are still supporting Hamas in a big way or not and uh there are also no channels of uh uh expressing any of any voices criticizing Hamad if there is any criticism against Hamas it's done within in our closed circles now Israel's aim is um as Israel said many times to fully destroy Hamas is that realistic you think it doesn't seem to me that is a very realistic goal uh for a number of reasons first of all it's been a month since Israel has started its war against Hamas and to the best of my knowledge Israel has succeeded only in eliminating some top leaders of the military wing of Hamas and the Israelis are also having very trouble a lot of troubles in controlling large areas of with with the ground operation and second uh uh uh when we talk about Hamas we are not talking only about uh uh the the military wing of Hamas we're talking also about Hamas as a a Grassroots organization which has entrenched itself among the population in the Gaza so when you talk about an ideology and about an idea it's it's very hard to destroy it or to eliminate it completely but I think uh Hamas has been weakened by the ongoing Israeli bombardment and uh and also uh uh uh the ground operation that has been carrying on uh for for a number of days now the political scientist Mima abusada there talking to us from Gaza thank you very much for your
