protesters in Israel have returned to the streets to demand their government to make a deal to free the remaining hostages being held by Hamas it's the second night of Nationwide demonstrations after the bodies of six captives were recovered from Gaza prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked for forgiveness for failing to secure their release though he insisted he would press Israel's military campaign against Hamas and keep control of strategic territory within Gaza MERS also attended a funeral for one of the hostages thousands line the streets of Jerusalem to pay their final respects to hsch Goldberg Poland the 23-year-old is the latest hostage kidnapped by Hamas on October the 7th to be laid to rest in [Music] Israel H we failed you we all failed you for 23 years I was is privileged to have the most stunning honor to be hersh's Mama I'll take it and say thank you I just wish it had been for longer the Israeli American was kidnapped at a music festival during the October 7th Hamas Terror attacks the Israeli military says his body was among six recovered in a tunnel in Gaza over the weekend shortly after they were killed by Hamas the prime minister apologized for their debts I told the families and I repeat it tonight too I ask for your forgiveness for not bringing them back succeed he added that no one is more committed to their release than he is and called critic ISM of his approach to a ceasefire deal shameful the deaths of the hostages have sparked two days of mass protests across Israel the demonstrators are calling for an immediate deal with Hamas to bring the remaining hostages home the rallies have blocked many major roads in and around Tel Aviv snarling traffic for hours there have also been several clashes with [Applause] police and this is the only way they can hear us if we stop everything that's the problem with the Israeli government they won't listen they're not thinking about the hostages they only thinking about the government Survival on Monday the demonstrators were joined by thousands of striking workers who disrupted services at hospitals schools as well as flights at Israel's main airport union leaders eventually called off the strike when a court said they had not given enough notice it also called the work stoppage politically motivated let's get more from journalist balig sadine in Tel Aviv welcome back balig um we heard the Prime Minister asking the families of the hostages for forgiveness but despite the softening of Mr netanyahu's tone his position appear appears not to have changed well uh yes the main goal of this uh um speech or this press conference that he gave is not actually to apologize for the families of the hostages that were killed yesterday or actually their buddies recovered yesterday they were killed last week by Hamas in the Gaza STP but actually toh talk about the Philadelphia Corridor and its importance and why Israel can't um give up on this Corridor that um separates the Gaza Strip from the border with Egypt he said that this carridor was used by Hamas during the past 20 or more years to smuggle weapons to smuggle ammunition and to continue their what he described their terrorist um attacks against the Israeli Society in general and that's why Israel needs to still um have presid presence in this Corridor even in the first phase of the possible deal or the theoretical deal that everyone is talking about even in the first 42 days because he said that in case Israel withdraws from this Philadelphia Corridor then the Diplomatic pressure not the Tactical issue here is the problem in which he says that the US and also the inter International Community in general will put a lot of pressure on Israel not to go back and to stop the war um entirely and where are ceasefire um where are hostage negotiations and negotiations about a ceasefire where are they at at the moment well today it has been reported that the head of the Mad DEA came back from Qatar after holding talks with the qataris and just a few moments ago the Qatari prime minister said that he talked to the National Security adviser of the US Jake solivan about the uh recent talks and the possibility of reaching a deal we know also that the US President Joe Biden with his vice president cin Harris alongside the other members of the team held a meeting in The Situation Room about this specific issue as well that's after the killing of these six Israeli hostages including one American here that we just have seen his funeral in the report so uh the talks are still continuing but apparently uh they are reaching a Deadlock after all because the Israeli Prime Minister doesn't want to give up on the phia corridor and Hamas doesn't want to give up on the fact that they need the Israel troops to leave entirely the Gaza Strip so we both have or both of the parties have uh very harsh um positions on their demands and um nothing that could we that we can talk about in the near future that can change this uh US President Joe Biden was asked today whether Benjamin Netanyahu was doing enough to achieve a hostage deal his answer was a simple no which sounds like a rebuke to the Israeli Prime Minister exactly that the families of the hostages Forum said that if we were seeking more evidence that Netanyahu is the one that is jeopardizing a deal we are having it right now from the US president and by the way some people are saying that he didn't exactly say that Netanyahu is not doing enough he was asked two questions and it's not clear whether they know what toward the first question or for the second part of that question but in any way Nat was asked about this and he decided not to talk about it also the US president after the meeting in the situation room also chose not to talk about the netanyahu's comments and address today so we're seeing that there is a huge difference between the positions of the US Administration and the Israeli Prime Minister specifically about this um concession that Netanyahu is asked to give about the Philadelphia Corridor apparently both here are seeking also some political um interest because after all the US president Al is facing um election in for his party in November and wants to see a ceasefire done and hostage deal done so we're saying that the um Israelis prime minister way and the US president way are not meeting at this point and maybe this will even increase in the coming days and what about the uh the Nationwide general strike that was called today calling on the government to make a deal for the release of hostages that strike's now been called off but the protests are continuing just give us a quick timeline of what's been happening yes the protest continues and they are very intense I I don't think that we have seen such a thing for a long long time because um 13 people were arrested in um Jerusalem up until now uh and also in uh the city of T Aviv where I am right now some people were arrested lots of clashes between the protesters and the isra police some of them even went um down toward the highway the Aon Highway that is the center of T Aviv Main Highway and closed de fire was burned there so we're seeing that even they have got closer to the leud headquarters which is the party of the Prime Minister and also trying to reach his um residence in the uh um city of Jerusalem so lots of Rage lots of uh anger toward the Prime Minister but I just need to mention here that according to according to a recent poll that was um taken yesterday morning so exactly after the news about the hostages uh most of Israelis said that they are not willing or the government should not be willing to um give concessions on the Philadelphia Corridor even though that means that uh a hostage deal won't be sealed which means that the at least now Israeli government's position is aligned with the Public's position on this topic as well well yel aronov is an expert on Israeli politics and professor of political science at Michigan State University in the United States she joins us from the state capital at laning welcome to DW Professor um let's start with today's speech from Benjamin Netanyahu we heard a clip there him asking for forgiveness before going on to effectively double down on his position there's no changing his mind is there uh no uh I tragically not I think for both the Hamas leaders in war and for Netanyahu they put their own uh political survival and uh and so forth above uh the welfare of both uh Palestinians and Israelis and of course while the hostages were killed uh by Hamas who had taken them hostage 11 months mons ago it's certainly the case that Netanyahu has never put uh um getting the hostages home and getting to a ceas fire as the first priority um and he hasn't done so for the last 11 months I don't think it is a very sincere apology and many Israelis don't see it as such um about 70% of Israelis throughout the many months have wanted uh him to immediately resign and want him uh to have new elections even before uh this um they held him of course Hamas is responsible for the massacres and The Taking of hostages that took place on October 7th but netan was held responsible for not doing enough um to uh be able to deter and prevent that by distracting the country through trying to weaken its Supreme Court uh which uh produced Mass demonstrations for many months uh before October 7th uh and since then um you know about a July survey of Israelis by the Israel democracy Institute indicates the majority of Israelis 56% uh would want uh a deal to release all the hostages and end the war and about almost 30% would want it for uh part part of the hostages for a ceasefire and only 14% didn't know so for a long time now uh the majority of Israelis uh and many surveys uh want to you know put as the first priority a deal um of course that would also end the suffering of so many Palestinians uh with with um yeah so uh I think uh he just wants to stay out of jail since he's been incriminated and stay in power um and uh some of his right-wing Coalition uh extreme right uh members of the Coalition uh want the war to continue and uh don't want to withdraw from the Gaza Strip obviously um representatives of the Israeli government uh would take a somewhat different line uh to the one that that you're taking there but your point is made we'll we'll move on I'm going to play you another clip from Mr netanyahu's earlier speech laying out when he said this war would end I would Define the end of the war in Gaza in Gaza when Hamas no longer rules Gaza we throw them out I would Define the end of the war in uh World War II when the Nazis no longer rule Germany to do that you you need to have a military Victory and you have to have also the political Victory to destroy their governance y aronov um where is the Israeli public on the way that Mr Netanyahu is Prosecuting this war well of course it would uh many Israelis and many people around the world could understand um that when there's organization like Hamas that officially wants to destroy the country and that um you know massacred hundreds of civilians on October 7th and says they want to have many more October 7ths um that you wouldn't that you would want to uh not have Hamas uh rule uh the territory next to you and of course you know uh um hopefully there'll be a Palestinian State alongside Israel in the future so this is certainly an understandable goal but certainly as um you know has been the experience of many countries as well uh since World War II and his analogy um that you know and this is a you know a Palestinians you know strive for a nation um and self-determination as Israelis have uh that you won't be able to successfully just get rid of all Hamas and so forth and therefore you do need to yeah Ju Just on on that the the the start of your answer there seemed you you seem to be going to I didn't quite get an answer to my question um where is the Israeli public on the way this war is being prosecuted by this government you seem to be hinting that they are behind the prime minister no I no I'm sorry if there was any misunderstanding I think they very much want to prioritize and for many months um getting to a ceasefire and getting to the hostages back as opposed to complete Victory and that's not only where the Israeli public has been that's many me that is where many in the defense establishment have been uh for many for also in this summer in terms of uh trying to push Netanyahu to get to a deal um and even though he has uh understandable concerns about the border between Gaza and Egypt where there are so many tunnels where they've been rearmed and got gotten weapons in the past the military establishment itself is saying um that you know in the first state Israel could go back if if it were going to be used in any uh a way but also more importantly um that there could be some kind of uh International force or Regional force uh including uh different countries that Israel might agree on that could uh be at the border um so again it's not that it's not an under not it's an understandable concern but most of the Israeli public has been solidly behind prioritizing as the number one issue getting to a hostage deal and to there thereby a ceasefire and and now we have about uh 600,000 Israelis demonstrating that would be U the equivalent to I think 6 million Germans and uh over 15 million or 20 million Americans demonstrating uh that they want uh to prioritize as the number one issue bringing the hostages home and uh therefore at least having a ceasefire or end of the war and so he's not in line with the majority of the Israeli public and and talking about the the Philadelphia uh Corridor there as the Prime Minister um did when Israel we we can see now why both sides uh see that as being so important whether you're you're smuggling uh trying to smuggle um uh people or explosives into the territory or indeed trying to secure uh that particular particular border when Israel seized control uh of the Philadelphia corridor from Egypt Egypt warned then that it was ready to respond um Why didn't it why didn't Egypt respond I mean I think that it's um it too is trying to um get to and facilitate and mediate uh um and negotiate a deal uh between Israel and Hamas and so that's been I think its priority um I also think the Egyptian government of course has um itself had designated Hamas a terrorist organization not it has done so um several before because they see it as affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood that's a threat to their own government so they certainly have mixed feelings about Hamas but um as uh their public and of course we all uh care deeply about um the deaths and suffering uh and displacement in Gaza so I think that they're concerned about that as well um and therefore you know want to be able to negotiate something by which it wouldn't be Israel at the border um uh and they can get a deal and so to some extent they've pushed for that um and you know there are probably people on the ground that get bribes you know and so forth at the border for uh for the things that go back and forth through it just a a final word on where um Israel SL Netanyahu is in internationally because Mr Netanyahu does seem more isolated than ever um US President Joe Biden was asked today whether the Israeli Prime Minister was doing enough to achieve a deal for the hostages his simple and ambiguous answer was no so is that the nonchalance of a one-term president with nothing to lose or has the White House had it with Benjamin Netanyahu I mean I think they have um they're extremely frustrated I think for good reason um that he's not prioritizing a deal um I think other administrations have been frustrated with Netanyahu as well uh in previous American administrations um and he very much I think is prioritizing staying in power with his own uh Coalition partners and the extremist parties in his Coalition um don't want actually to get a deal um and are not prioritizing the hostages and so I can understand why the American Administration is frustrated with him as are as I say so many Israelis with 70% at different times wanting to him to resign immediately Aaron David Miller is a Middle East analyst and a senior fellow at the carnegi Endowment for International Peace he joins us from Washington DC good to have you with us we heard Netanyahu asking the families of the hostages for forgiveness but it doesn't appear he's changed his position on the Gaza War so where does that leave ceasefire and hostage neg negotiations at this point you know this isn't really a question of one hand clapping it's two hands clapping and based on my experience in Arab Israeli negotiations they close only when there's sufficient urgency and the part of the decision and cruy tragically and sadly there's insufficient urgency on Net's part and on the part of yak Sinar the preeminent Palestinian decision maker and scone somewhere below ground in a tunnel and probably by hostages in Rafa Oran units and two two basic events over the last 48 hours convince me that there's no origin number one the willful execution of six hostages uh probably 48 hours before the IDF discovered them and second Benjamin netanyahu's determination to hold out for control of the Philadelphia Corridor even though his own security and Israeli Defense Forces analysts and commanders have assured him that there is a way to secure Israeli interests without a permanent Israeli pres so yes Philadelphia Corridor is important but right now it's the ho hostages that are acutely uh threatened the Israelis can always deal with AAS they have to figure out a way to get the hostages home and right now neither sinir nor Benjamin Netanyahu are prepared to make the compromises and the concessions that will enable an American mediator to broker an agreement now you're mentioning the Philadelphia Corridor which it seems on the face of it is the major sticking point right now uh as it seems in negotiations between Israel and Hamas it's the space along the Egypt Gaza border why do you think that Netanyahu is refusing to budge on that on uh giving up control of it if it's not Philadelphia quor would probably be some something else look Benjamin netanyahu's entire political world is driven and Tethered to one overriding objective which is the maintenance of Benjamin netan in power he's conflated the interests of the state of Israel with his own political interest on trial for bribery fraud and breach of trust in Jerusalem district court before three judges four years in running now he knows that if he lose his power and can't find a way somehow to end-run the indictments or to lay the trial or have it cancelled he faces either a conviction possibly or alternatively a plea bargain to avoid prison that would mean the end of his political career so this is the the key to understanding Benjamin nany's motives it seem to me and that means keeping a coalition of 64 seats with two extremist ministers who have threatened to bolt leave the Coalition should the um prime minister make any sort of concession on Philadelphia on the Philadelphia quter or frankly anything that would leave Hamas in power in Gaza and the reality is uh unfortunately Hamas Will Survive most likely as an Insurgency so right now it seems to me the US is in a strategic sort of culde act and there's no easy or quick way out no you're saying that Benyamin Netanyahu has no interest in a deal US President Joe Biden has said that Netanyahu is not doing enough to a a hostage deal does Biden though have more leverage to get Netanyahu to act well if you look at the last 11 months the answer to that question would be no and we have 70 days left before one of the most consequential elections in modern American history with Joe Biden's vice president as the Democratic nominee and the reality is no political candidate no Secretary of State no president and certainly no uh nominee running for office has any stake right now in picking a major fight and confrontation with an Israeli Prime Minister if to Remember If This Were a conflict between Israel and Egypt America's capacity to leverage and pressure would be greater but it's not it's a conflict between Israel and an organization which by Statute we have us has declared as a foreign terrorist organization which created a terror surge on October 7 has abused is holding and killing hostages including American hostages so I think the is much to minuted Aaron David Miller Senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace we're gonna have to leave it there thank you so much thanks for having me
