my first guest tonight is a man who helped bring Israelis and Palestinians as close to peace as anyone Yosi bin is considered the architect of the 1994 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization he served as Minister of Justice and religious Affairs under prime minister ahud Barack and since then he has remained committed to a path to peace just last year he supported a proposal for an Israeli Palestinian Confederation and I a that seemingly fell on deaf ears Mr bin it's good to have you with us tonight um this week thank you for having me when you look at what happened at the the UN this week when the UN Secretary General said that the October 7th attack did not happen in a vacuum that prompted Israel's un ambassador to demand that the Secretary General resign what did you think when that [Music] happened well the Antonio gutes is a somebody who supports Israel who believes in Israel who believes in peace who was shocked by what he W but what he saw in the region and regretfully he was rejected when he asked to visit Israel few days ago I don't know why the Israeli government decided to do something like that he made a huge mistake by saying that the attack the the crazy crazy Isis kind of attack against babies and and women and and old people was not in a vacuum because it was not a situation that in in which the Hamas people are saying we would like to have peace with Israel we would like to H divide the land we would like to live in peace and it is impossible and because they are unemployed and and because they are under Israel indirect rule they had to do something no this is not the situation that perhaps was the situation of the first intifa of the Palestinians against Israel in 87 what happened is something which is totally crazy it is not written anywhere and rather than totally rejecting it he gave the impression although he did not say that he he understood what Hamas did but if it was not in a vacuum then you give some kind of legitimacy the demand that he would he would resign is a a big mistake of Israel I don't think that he deserves such such a an attitude of Israel towards him let me ask you uh this week on Wednesday in The Times of Israel the Israeli writer Yosi klin halevi wrote to blame the occupation and its consequences wholly on Israel is to dismiss the history of Israeli PE peace offers and Palestinian rejection has the world forgotten what you and others achieved with the Oslo Accords in 1994 yo you you know such a question to which the the answer is is positive could be asked and should be asked Visa the PLO the PLO is our partner and we had ups and downs with the PLO Hamas is something else Hamas doesn't want anything from us they don't want to to divide the land they don't want to have peace with Israel and this is why it was a mistake to allow Hamas to run in the elections of 2006 and to remain in the leadership of Gaza despite of all the the violent encounters that we have with it we had with each other but the point is that the Israeli right saw Hamas as a better interlocutor or neighbor than the PLO because the PLO wanted and wants to divide the land this is the major issue between us and them yeah and rather than understanding that this was also the interest of Israel they preferred an interor who didn't want anything from us but that we will disappear Mr B I I want to I want to come back to Hamas just a second but I want to stick with history for a moment the the Oslo Accords they did not mention the establishment of a Palestinian state was that a mistake is that something you regret now this was a request of the Palestinians they said we don't want to mention the Palestinian State as one of the issues that should be solved towards the permanent agreement there were five issues like borders refugees Jerusalem and not the Palestinian State and they explained it because they said this is our right for self-determination and we don't need from you any negotiations of the principle of the Palestinian state so it is not that Israel said no way we we should talk about the Palestinian State I mean all the negotiators knew that we were talking about a or or thinking about a Palestinian State there is no other solution what they're going to to have a club I mean it is a state but it is not mentioned because they said that they didn't want to to discuss it they didn't want to negotiate it because they were that was their right this is the reason so the the the question is whether it was possible to get in 93 a permanent agreement rather than an interim agreement of five years and when I understood that we had had Partners in Oslo the the PLO people were people with whom I believe we could strike a deal I went to Rabin to the Prime Minister and I said to him Mr Prime Minister I believe that we should not we should not try to have a five-year agreement right now there is an opportunity which may be very rare to go for the permanent agreement so that the extremist on both sides will not have a the opportunity to thwart our efforts he explained that he he he preferred to go along the Madrid conference guidelines the American guidelines of an interim agreement for five years rather than getting D directly to a permanent agreement which may not succeed the negotiations may not succeed for a permanent agreement and I believe that this was a very big mistake Mr let me bring it up now to the president in an interview last month about three weeks before the October 7th attacks you gave an interview to the Spanish newspaper elpis and you were quoted as saying the the Palestinians tragically have become resigned to their limited options and this disappointment fuels The Divide between Hamas and fata would would you say that today considering This Global chorus of support that we are seeing now for the Palestinians in Gaza well this support is is very problematic you know the people who are who belong to the PLO are the biggest enemies of Kamas Kamas as you know threw them from the roofs of Gaza in 2007 when they took Gaza by force it's I mean even now when we are trying to think about what should be be in the morning after the the end of the war who should rule Gaza if Israel succeeds to prevent the Hamas from continuing and Rule Gaza then the the PLO is not in a hurry to get there to to get back to to Gaza because of the animosity towards them so even when you hear that in Jordan and in other places people are saying oh or or comparing what the Hamas did on that black Saturday few weeks ago and and and what Israel in its retaliation does you know that if you know the people you know their motivations you know that Hamas is an enemy of of many many forces in the Middle East who would like to see Israel distancing them from governing the the Gaza Strip but they cater to their public opinions and this is a problem you you said before the October 7th attacks that that the Jewish settlements in the West Bank were one of the biggest obstacles to peace the current government the one that was in place before October 7th it was the first ever in Israel to make annexation of the West Bank a stated objective in its Coalition agreement I mean that had to really sting for someone like you well I I I I believe that the the current government of Israel led by Netanyahu is a a big obstacle for Peace by itself and encouraging more settlements or more housing units in the current settlements is a is a very very big obstacle and one of the ideas that I suggested but not not only me it is a group of Palestinians and Israelis the Palestinian group is led by Dr Hiba huseni is to have as you mentioned before a confederation the Holy Land Confederation of Israel and Palestine in the future which will allow all those settlers who will find themselves in the Palestinian State once we draw a border between Israel and Palestine to remain there in in Palestine as residents of Palestine and citizens of Israel while the same number of Palestinian citizens who would like to live in Israel will be allowed to do that as permanent residents so then you can really ER take off the table the issue of evacuating hundreds of thousands of of settlers and if if that is removed I believe that the way for an agreement will be open and since sometimes in history or many times in his history the efforts for peace were accelerated as a result of Wars I hope that this very sad situation when we see ourselves now fighting in Gaza and of course civilians are are hit and suffer and and and pay the price even if we are telling them in advance you have to leave their homes even that is not such a big oros positive announcement for them I believe that it might the the current situation the current tragic situation may be an acceleration to world's peace if we are wise enough to use this opportunity well that is a a positive way to end our segment Mr bin unfortunately we're out of time but we certainly appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us tonight Mr Yi bin thank you thank you very much
