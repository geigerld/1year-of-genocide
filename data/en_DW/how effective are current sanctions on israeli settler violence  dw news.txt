well Palestinians living alongside hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers in the Israeli occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem say that increasing violence has left them worried for their lives and Futures the United Nations says that violent settler attacks on Palestinians have increased since the Hamas Terror attacks of October 7th and the war in Gaza and locals say International sanctions against some settlers are not helping them DW's Tanya Kramer reports violent Israeli settlers make their way to the Village of assaa in the Israeli occupied West Bank scenes that Anan Ahmed knows all too well it happened again some weeks ago settlers came down the mountain from the settlement frightening the children we have small children at home they throw stones this last time they injured two people my wife's brother was shot at twice here and here the situation is difficult Palestinian Villages as Assa are almost surrounded by Israeli settlements considered illegal under international law violent settlers throw stones destroy crops and olive trees burn cars and property and it has increased in recent months we live on our land this is my father's and grandfather's house there's no safety there are children small children this is forbidden they come and destroy everything why they cause the problems there is no security ever the violence recently turned deadly when a Palestinian volunteer paramedic was shot and killed while treating people injured by Israeli settlers his colleague Bashar cayti was at the scene he tells us several shots hit their ambulance Muhammad Musa was driving it when he was hit and killed we live through a difficult nightmare facing tremendous suffering but we are steadfast we have seen many Murs many injuries but what we faced with a targeting of our colleagues was the most difficult in our years as medics the question of whether a settler or a soldier fired the Fatal shot remains unclear the Israeli military said in a statement at the time that they and the Border police were called to disperse a riot during the incident an ambulance driver for the Palestinian red Cresent was killed the military police have opened an investigation and a command review Into the circumstances of the incident is under the way Bashar says Palestinians feel they simply have no protection here the military is often seen standing by or even accompanying settlers during intimidating and violent attacks and Palestinian security forces are only allowed to operate in limited areas he says International sanctions which have been imposed on some settlers have not helped the sanctions imposed by the US on those criminal settlers don't change much in reality settlers continue to attack burn and Destroy homes and act violently towards the Palestinians in reality these stabs have had no effect back in asaia Anan Ahmed says he fears most for his children who are growing up in this atmosphere of violence and we can now talk to Shuki Friedman about the he's vice president of the Jewish people policy Institute and a senior lecturer in law at the Perez academic center thanks for joining us Dr Freeman how do you explain the dramatic increase in settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank First of all the increase of events and violence is definitely concerning um me personally is a a lawyer in Israel and a CI of Israel but also it its concern regarding International Arena and our ability to enforce law within the West Bank and therefore there is definitely a necessity and crucial necessity from side of the government and their authorities to become more determined and more aggressive in enforcing as a law in the West Bank but we have to try to understand the reality and differentiate between false reports and increase on violent there are more events and this event should be take care seriously and should be investigated and prosecut based on Israeli law we are and trying to be loyal to our laws international law also in the West Bank but there are some false reporting and then for the experence in the statistics of the increas in violent is not precise always okay uh extra additional investigations both journalistic and and I suppose by the authorities would would be useful uh but last month the US and the EU already had conducted their assessments and they imposed sanctions on some settler extremists and Associated groups uh what impact let me ask you about that what impact are these sanctions likely to have first of all it was the first time that the US sanctioned West Bank settlers and the West Bank entities and been followed by other countries also the EU and this is definitely red light for the Israeli government signing the government signing the authorities here in Israel to be much more determined in enforcing the law with the West Bank and these sanctions have a crucial and might be dramatic influence on the settlers in the West Bank and their ability to continue their daily life because we have to realize that sanction like this work as a net through the financial institutions and might um in a way harest or um prevent Financial activities not only of the sers that been sanctioned by the US and EU but also by others that are walking or acting from the West Bank financially and therefore it have implication and also political implication on Israel in the West Bank okay so that the sanctions will affect uh some of the settlers and the organizations that they've been imposed on but do you think it's going to lead to a reduction in violence we heard someone in our report there uh Palestinians saying that so far those sanctions haven't helped you know the major aim I se Target of the sanctions by the us is to force Israeli government to work more determinedly against the settlers I don't think that settlers themselves would have any impact or redu her violent I think that the role is on the government and on the ideas that working the West Bank the police working in West Bank to try to uh protect Palestinians from this violent and protect Israel from Palestinian violence we want the West Bank as far as we are still over there calm and secure to all people that live there and if there are settlers that breaching the law and acting violently it's the role of the Israeli government to enforce the law over there and sanctions should should motivate not only the seters but mainly the government to be more serious about it what do you think has to happen next and to what degree is this uh connected to what's happening in Gaza how do you see this going forward very briefly if you can yeah so far s West Bank is more C that expected we in Israel expected that due to the seven of October Massacre of Hamas and the war in Gaza there will be more unrest and violent activities from the side of Palestinians and from the other side in West Bank and so far Israel IDE successfully containing this ER potential violence but with we have to look to the H long term and to think how we contain and how we manage to H able to have M life in the West Bank to the extent we are still controlling this territory Dr Shuki Friedman with the Jewish people policy Institute thank you very much for talking with us today thank you very much good day
