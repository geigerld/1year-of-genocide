Israel has again denounced the international criminal court on Monday the Court's Chief prosecutor requested a warrant for the arrest of Israel's prime minister and defense minister over the war in Gaza in a statement spokesperson for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged nations of the Civilized free world to oppose and condemn the decision several of Israel's Western allies including the US and Germany have criticize the Court's move saying it equates Israel's actions in Gaza with hamas's October 7th terrorist attack hamus leaders are also wanted by the court and let's bring in now Brussels correspondent Rosie Berard who's been following this for us Rosie how are EU leaders reacting to Israel's appeal to ignore any warrants requested by the ICC well like with so much of the eu's response to this conflict really since the early days the European Union is divided no different here we've had different responses from across the eu's 27 member states so for example here in Belgium where I am we've had a statement from the country saying that this is uh this request for an arrest warrant from the IC is an important step in investigations into the situation in Palestine that's according to belgian's foreign minister the way she described it we heard similar statements from Slovenia then when it came to France France has its foreign office has released a statement saying that really for months the French government has been warning about the importance of compliance with International law in Gaza particularly highlighting the importance of humanitarian access Germany on the other hand has said it in theory supports the ICC thinks this is a very important achievement of the International Community but it has criticized what it sees as the idea that the the court came forward with an application for on the one hand Israeli leaders but also Hamas leaders and Germany has said that seems to create an implication or false implication of equivalence and then really at the far end of the spectrum we have the Hungarian prime minister Victor Orban who has called the application from the ICC for this arrest warrant shameful so that is something you can see as once again EU countries divided on how to move forward on this conflict and divided again I should say in this case from the United States we've heard a different view from Joe Biden who has called this request for a warrant outrageous well moving forward what do you expect to happen next well while they might have different opinions here in theory EU countries are all bound by the same laws are signaries to the Rome statute which is what establishes the international criminal court and those laws are that if this arrest this application for arrest warrant were to be granted Benjamin Nyah who is really prime minister would officially become a fugitive of the ICC and that would mean EU countries would in theory be obliged to arrest him should he come to their territory we are not in anywhere near that position yet however that is the potential Road forward and I asked the European commission's Foreign Affairs spokesperson about this and he really seemed to me highlighted just that importance of compliance with official international law obligations take a listen to what he said to me the European Union respects the independence of the ICC this is independent International institution that deals with the investigation of the of the serious crimes that uh that uh tries to deliver on the issue of impunity or prevent that there is impunity when it comes to violations uh which uh fall under the remid and the Mandate of the ICC and again all the countries that subscribe to the Rome statue of the IC have the obligation to follow that in light of what we just heard how will this affect the eu's credibility if a warrant is granted so it should be noted that we are still at the stage of an application and there is no timeline or deadline so ICC judges will now decide whether or not to move forward with this war and if it is granted and if EU countries decide to Sher their official obligations under international law you can bet there will be a louder clamoring accusations of the EU uh exerting double standards basically having different applications of international law we know for example the EU was quite uh vocal in welcoming the arrest warant which was issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin however one analyst put it to me this way he said look the West has there's no kind of Monopoly from the West on double standards here and we have certainly seen countries in other parts of the world also really tying themselves in political knots over what to do about an ICC arrest warrant that was the case for example when there was discussion over whether South Africa should welcome Russian President Vladimir Putin to a summit of the brics alliance instead in the end his foreign minister went and years before that also in South Africa there was a debate over whether to uh whether to arrest Omar Al Bashir who is the suspected war criminal from Sudan so this is not something which is unique to EU countries but certainly something which could be a great source of political controversy moving forward DW correspondent Rosie burchard live from Brussels
