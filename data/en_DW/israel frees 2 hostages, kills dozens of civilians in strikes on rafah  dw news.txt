Israel says it has rescued two hostages during a raid in gaza's southern city of Rafa the men aged 60 and 70 are reportedly in stable condition and have been taken to a hospital near Tel Aviv Israel says the hostages were freed as its forces carried out overnight strikes in Rafa Hamas ran Health authorities say at least 48 people were killed Israel launched its military operation in Gaza after Hamas carried out the October 7 Terror attacks for more on this I'm joined Now by DW correspondent Rebecca RS in Jerusalem Rebecca what do we know about the freed hostages well barish the two men have been named as Fernando Maron and Louie har both in their 60s and 70s uh they were both Argentinian Israeli Nationals and they were kidna kidnapped on October 7 from the Kuts of near yitzak they were also kidnapped with some of their family members they were released in the November hostage exchange and now these two men uh were rescued overnight they've been taken to a hospital near Tel Aviv family members who have been in contact with them say the men were thin and pale but otherwise looked relatively okay in good condition they will of course be completely medically checked and and go through the the processes now uh that is standard for any hostage release um the IDF says that uh this operation was carried out overnight at around 2 a.m. they were able to get access a special ops Unit were able to get access to this apartment building where the men were located on the second floor according to the Israeli military they said it was a uh a highly um specialized operation and that it was done on credible intelligence and that they had in fact been waiting for some time for the conditions to be right to carry out this operation that they had intelligence about the whereabouts of of these two men for some time but just were waiting for that right moment to be able to carry out this operation there are also reports of air strikes that the Israeli forces conducted was that in support of this Rescue Mission well the Israeli military saying that these air strikes were needed to be carried out in order to provide cover for this special operation we're hearing more than a dozen air strikes were carried out and as you were reporting the AAS run Health Ministry putting the number of casualties at 37 we're also hearing reports from a hospital with a lower casualty figure and and hearing as well that Hamas saying that the number could be much higher so uh definitely a very intense operation from all reports that we're hearing eyewitness reports and video that we're seeing posted on social media there was an ensuing Panic uh people some people reporting that they thought that the ground operation had begun and was underway and we're trying to run trying to find uh a cover we see women with children running trying to escape now more than a million people are Sheltering in this small southern city that's on top of the some 300,000 people that were already living there uh when this operation began so we're 1.3 million at minimum and they're running out of places to go many of them have been displaced several times the conditions in that City are horrific by all accounts and getting worse people warning that any ground operation would see a a catastro the humanitarian catastrophe so certainly some dire situation a very terrifying situation for civilians Sheltering there overnight but the Israeli military saying that they needed to carry out this operation in order to be able to rescue these hostages we leave it there for the time being but thanks so much for joining us now Rebecca rers from Jerusalem and for the wider implications of that operation I'm joined Now by Mike Martin a former British army officer and security Analyst at Kings College London good morning Mike are the overnight air strikes in Rafa the start of military operations there would you say absolutely I mean usually and and the Israeli Arm Forces are indifferent to how the British or the Americans would do it but usually ground operations are preceded by a period of aerial operations where you try to take out some of the more High value targets so yes it does seem that the incursion into Rafa has begun US President Joe Biden says that Israel should have a quote credible and executable plan that ensures the safety of more than a million Palestinians who are Sheltering in Rafa does Israel have such a plan I I can't speak so what's going on inside the Israeli government but I can speak to the fact that it's almost impossible to have a plan where you have a million people as you've just said but also cramped into a very very small area and these people have left other areas in Gaza fled for safety in Rafa and they're up against of course Rafa is the Egyptian border so they can't go any further south it's very very difficult if you're doing the kind of operations that Israel has been doing so far so aerial bombardment and ground troops moving in is very difficult to uh separate between military targets so Hamas militants and civilian targets and of course that's one of the things that you must do if you want to fight and remain within the laws of war this is not the first time that there that there are calls on the idea to try and work out a plan to spare any collateral damage and the lives of civilians who are caught up in a war zone from everything that you have seen over the past few months does it appear that the IDF has at all paid heat to any suggestions that it avoid this kind of collateral damage I think there's there's two things here one is the evidence that we have in front of us of uh civilian casualties and although the number is disputed it is many many many thousands some say up to 25 or 30,000 civilian casualties and that is a number that tells us that there is more that could have been done to distinguish between militants and civilians and to prot protect civilians but the other thing I think we should look at as well is the rhetoric of some Israeli government ministers and senior members of the IDF we we've talked about laying Siege to Gaza we've talked about cutting off power these are all things that expose perhaps the intent of the IDF and the Israeli government is not always as they say to distinguish properly between uh militants and civilians and to protect those civilians Benjamin nety says that total Victory is possible in Gaza within months would you say that's a realistic assertion no it's it's it's it's impossible um the Israeli government has set itself two Targets one is to uh kill destroy Hamas quote unquote and the other is to free all the hostages well the period that we had the most hostages released was when there was a ceasefire and as for destroying Hamas several months the operation Hamas is still able to launch rockets at Israel it's basically impossible to destroy military targets when you when they are interspersed amongst civilians living in high density in urban areas the only way to do that is to kill all the civilians so that's a huge problem for Israel we'll leave it there for the time being thanks so much for joining us today Mike Maron thank
