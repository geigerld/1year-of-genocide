we start in Gaza where the World Health Organization says the strip's largest hospital has come under bombardment Palestinian officials claim Israeli air strikes have hit a number of medical facilities including the main alifa hospital Hamas authorities reporting a number of deaths following the alleged attack the hospital is believed to be Sheltering thousands of people wounded and displaced by War Israel has said its forces are active near the hospital and alleged said hamus command posts are located under the hospital buildings our forces in gasa have reached the heart of GSA city they're at the outskirts of shatti they're near alifa hospital and very near to the gasa Port those terrorists who are staying in the basement's underneath alifa hospital tonight can hear the Thundering sound of chank chants the bulldozers that pound the ground they can hear it Underground the Israeli defense minister there thousands of Palestinians are fleeing to the south of the Gaza Strip meantime streams of people are traveling on foot as Israel intensifies its ground and air campaign Israel has agreed to daily four hour pauses in its military operations in parts of Northern Gaza to allow civilians to flee through a humanitarian Corridor it's considering the creation of a second passage let's get some analysis now uh joining me is military analyst Frank ledwidge he's a senior lecturer in strategic studies at Portsmouth University and a former UK Military Intelligence officer Frank Israel continues to reject calls for a broader ceasefire saying that would be a surrender to Hamas but it seems it has agreed to pauses in the fighting at least in the north is there a risk for Israel here of Hamas exploiting those pauses to their own advantage well good morning Terry yes certainly Hamas would that's wrong the Israelis would would claim so but I don't see it as a particularly significant tactical risk of course there are advantages presentation and one of the issues that Israel faces and the US chairman of the gief Joint Chiefs of Staff said yesterday Israel could be a little bit more skillful on its presentation I think that's true and it might help him in that way tactically there's no great risk but I think what's Happening Here of course in The Wider context as hinted darl said directly by Tanya is that is the hostage issue and the this joshing about ceasefires or pauses or whatever terminology is used is is part of a much wider discussion going on in Qatar in Cairo and indeed to some extent in terms of policy in DC as well as Tel Aviv and within within Israel there's a there are two major parties and one party is in these negotiations is led by mad which tends in these matters to be PR deeply pragmatic and uh let's say less hawkish and then there's Netanyahu and the issue for the negotiators Apparently is that Netanyahu contines to increase demands uh with respect to hostage releases but of course the first issue is to find out how many hostages are really there and who they are and that's at the top of Israel's demands so it's a very confusing situation around ceasefires hostages and paes the US chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff has called Israel's aim of destroying Hamas completely a pretty large order do do you think eliminating Hamas is a realistic goal Frank well the goal of prime minister Netanyahu and his staff has slightly shifted since the start of the war from annihilating rooting out and utterly destroying Hamas to eliminating the military capability in I suppose in strict terms that's doable but the problem is and this is what general Brown in in Washington is is stressing is you it's very difficult to eliminate an idea this would be my gloss not his but whilst uh killing perhaps uh civilians in ways that are not properly explained or or perhaps even Justified now that's a that's a moot question but there is this information war that lies much of this and right now as Tanya hinted uh the information being given out the strategy as it were is is very uh sketchy now I think In fairness we are actually at a very early stage of this war and one shouldn't demand a full list of objectives and uh predictions now uh but we should be starting to shape them up and that doesn't seem to be happening there's been a lot of talk Frank from the very beginning about the risk of this conflict spilling over into the broader region uh we heard from the Iranian foreign minister recently warning of an expansion in the scope of the war saying that would was inevitable uh meanwhile we've got the Pentagon saying that the US and Coalition forces have been attacked at least 46 times since October 17th including in Iraq and Syria by Iran's proxies it would seem is is it too late Frank to contain this conflict oh certainly we're on an escalatory path however there are moderating factors in this last Saturday the Hezbollah leader in Lebanon Hassan Nas nasala gave a long and detailed speech the message of which was we're not going to get involved yet we weren't involved in in the Hamas attack in any way nor was Iran so that was a moderating speech as it were which certainly slowed things down but the attack on herbel uh Airbase or Airbase near Orel in Northern Iraq yesterday the uh dispatch last last couple of days of popular militias into Syria to supposedly join the fight and last night we had reports you know in a different uh in a different u a domain of what what is in fact a Cyber attack probably by Israel on Yemen all indicate that we are on this escalatory path and I think the Iranian foreign minister in his leaked words were was was trying to message that and and right now there's no countervailing force and us too are involved now of course militarily in strikes on on Syria and a few weeks ago anyway Iraq it's most certainly a dangerous situation yeah Frank there thank you very much for your analysis that was military analyst Frank ledwich joining us from Oxford in the UK well we asked our Jerusalem correspondent Tanya ker what the Israelis are saying about possibly introducing daily pauses in their offensive in Gaza well there seems to be or appears to be a difference in messaging here the isra Israel has not really confirmed it they are saying this is merely what they already had in place an army spokesman um spokesperson briefed reporters on Thursday evening and said very clearly this is not a ceasefire of several hours but rather um that they will be implementing those 4-Hour Windows they see it as a tactical pause as local pauses for humanitarian aid but also for um people for residents in the north of Gaza to move uh again south uh towards the South and also that they already have this in place in the past days that they open these corridors where people are able uh to move South Israel has refused you know to go for a longer ceasefire or a one or two day ceasefire that has been pushed for by the US administration because they say they don't want to give Hamas the possibility and other milit groups there uh to regroup so this would be as far as we understand implemented implemented in different areas without uh so with a very short notice for people to be able to move or to to go out and of course we need to see if this is actually happening uh today and of course fighting uh is continuing uh in Gaza City from what we are hearing there from on the ground and China low is a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refuge G Council we asked her whether the introduction of a daily 4-Hour pause and fighting would provide relief to the people of Gaza nothing can be done in a 4-Hour pause first of all these pauses are unilaterally declared in order for there to be assurances of Civilian safety we need all parties to this conflict to be committing to these 4our pauses but secondly in terms of of the four hours it's not really enough for humanitarians to go and provide assistance many of the people stuck in Northern Gaza are struggling to flee because they have mobility issues people in their families with disabilities there's no food or water in Northern Gaza so people are expected to make this long Trek on foot and it's just it's it's not safe they when they arrive in the South they won't be assured of their safety either this is um forcing people out of their homes with no assurances that they'll be able to return When hostil ities are over amounting to forcible transfer which is a grave breach of international humanitarian law and we can talk now to Peter Lerner from the Israeli Defense Forces joining us from Tel Aviv great to have you on the show again uh first of all clarify the situation for us are we getting these humanitarian pauses and in what form absolutely the the idea of humanitarian pauses is to enable people to to evacuate safely from the north of Gaza we've been speaking quite frequently about how Hamas has been preventing it and by the amount of people that are actually leaving over the last three days uh and specifically yesterday some 880,000 people evacuated from north to south it goes to show that Hamas was preventing people that wanted to take care of their own lives um indeed so it is enabling people to evacuate safely but also um if those that want to stay they can restock if there's a humanitarian pause I it is important to identify that the humanitarian poses are in specific locations it's not widespread it's not all of the northern Gaza you know Hamas is deeply embedded and the combat is still ongoing from door too face to face in urban combat so while we are conducting humanitarian pauses and specific Rel locations to enable evacuation of those that want to go we are continuing to to pursue Hamas but Peter over the past days the IDF has also said it can't secure those humanitarian corridors fully secure them um how safe then are they for these people wanting to evacuate this is exactly very representative of the situation as your the former spok uh speaker interview on on the show just said when these are unilateral sides we have no partner in Gaza there's no governing Authority Hamas has no regard for is any life Israeli or Palestinian and that's why when we were uh initially engaging in this humanitarian evacuation corridors they initially in the first two days they were firing at these corridors so but what we did see yesterday that most a huge amount of people were evacuating which is a good thing uh two days ago also we had a huge amount so it's 50,000 880,000 yesterday we we are seeing and I can say that I've seen this morning reports of more evacuation from the northern Gaza Strip This is a good thing it's people taking care of their lives we have been trying to get them out of Palm's way now for over three weeks um unfortunately Hamas was putting barriers intimidating physical barriers um to prevent people from evacuating so that they could to them and hide behind them but at the same time some of these evacuees are saying that they're being confronted by tanks and by air strikes no I'm not aware of any um I would say distri disruption on the roots that have been designated or from the specific locations where we've said we've conducted a pause um this is uh I'm not aware of that at all and I would say yes we are seeing and mass huge amount of movement from people going south which actually proves the opposite so you're saying you can guarantee these people's safety um as far as the timing goes we heard there from Netanyahu as well a few hours here a few hours there for such masses of people moving on foot how is it physically possible that they get from the north to the South and safely and this is a balance of of the war that is ongoing and it is a war that we are determined to uh to win uh because Hamas launched their attack against us and we are determined to remove them from control so um it's important that the humanitarian Mission and we see the humanitarian Mission as part of our our broader mission in order to achieve that goal but what is important is to get people out of the way safely uh indeed when there is gunfights that are Hamas are conducting or RPG attacks against our forces then the forces are required to defend themselves but I would say that you know the mass evacuation yesterday of 880,000 people proved that people actually are feeling safer now that Israel and the IDF are mobilized there because it means they can get away despite the fact that Hamas is trying to prevent them Peter is is there a change in mindset or a change in uh hamus hamus control over these people in the north that you can clarify for us so we've seen some people that have been uh a few people not too many that have been speaking out against Hamas they feel a bit relieved that they can actually say what Hamas was doing to them I saw a video circulated yesterday from Gaza of a lady talking about how they had threatened to cut hope in her belly if she leaves um so I would say that is obviously people are feeling a bit more relieved of course the situation in Gaza is not an easy sit situation uh it is a war zone there is in specifically the north where we are uncovering the extent of hamas's embedment inside uh hospitals inside schools inside uh residential areas and how they have created this fortified position out of all of the communities all of the towns all of the villages in Northern Gaza to serve their terrorist activities we are seeking them out we are destroying them stage by stage I would say we're not in a rush to do it we're doing it systematically in a way that maximizes our Force protection in order to make sure that we don't have too many side and that is why we're moving forward you know there are 239 Israelis still being held this morning in in hamas's hands we are working to bring them home and so many civilians who are allo being caught up in this uh from both sides uh IDF spokesperson Peter larner there thank you very much for joining us again here on DW and let's talk more about the humanitarian situation with Hisham Mahana spokesperson for the international Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza you're in Rua I believe how severe is the situation uh at hospitals in the South um first of all thank you for having me and the answer to your question is that it's unprecedentedly shocking the situation in D at all levels as we speak we are receiving news that there are hospitals in in the northern part of Gaza City that are subject to attacks uh and violence which resulted into the injury of medical personnel um and deration in facilities and the ambulances some of these hospitals are pediatric hospitals um and many of these hospitals do not only treat um a large number of of of casualties of all different kinds but also it inhabits tens of thousands of internally displayed families who um ran to these Hospital as sanctuaries and um you know hospitals and Medical Teams enjoy special protection under the international Unitarian law and these reports about these these these incidents um imply that there is a disrespect for these principles and um it goes against what the IHL say um we were as icrc on our way a few days ago to reach alot Hospital which is run by the palese recr society and that was the first time that tried to reach to theas city after October 13th uh we were um homey of four trucks and two IC vehicles and while we were trying to reach to upot hospital which is the southern part of Gaza City uh um we uh were under Fire and we had to immediately Evacuate the area U and two trucks uh to stay damages and one of our drivers was injured we had to go to the Sher Hospital which is the largest repal hospital in the Gaza Strip and have itss over 50,000 displayed families we delivered the aid and we reported a number of ambulances filled with injur injured people to the r Crossing and on the way we have witnessed thousands of civilians who were trying to get from the north south Gaza walking on okay can I just clarify from you from whom you were under attack um who was actually opening fire on you we we could not verify this so far but we were clearly visible in that location and um and both parties were aware about our homeo and what would be the reason is is there any have you seen any evidence of Hamas using these uh convoys to hide or transport weapons or hide themselves we have not been subjected to this before and it was clear about the perpetrator what I am I can confirm is that we were clearly visible in the location it was nearly only the icrc Convoy moving in that area and clearly all the roads leading to the hospital were completely damaged which was which was for us to find a way through to get to the hospital um but uh it's a it's a very very challenging situation that humanitarian situations now have to worry for the safety of their own teams on grounds uh while they are um trying to get life-saving Aid to the hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza who are an entire need for either in the hospitals or in the shelters or even for the families who are still staying uh in Wonder without any roof on their over their heads and without the basic access to essential services to like water food and drinking water you know like people who were walking um on their feet trying to uh to reach to the southern part of gala where asking for for some water to drink i i s myself uh children even newborns carried by their own mothers uh trying to cross and get to safety and they were asking are we goingon to live are we going to die do we are there still faing the shelters for us is there enough food and we could not answer these questions unfortunately um as we speak there's an ongoing nonstop deterioration the humanitarian situation uh in Gaza Strip and um this should uh not be acceptable to tolerated anymore any further because it will definitely result into the loss of Civilian lives destruction of infrastructure and more hampered you know environment for for Medical Teams and Personnel to to provide life-saving services insights there from hisam Mahana from the icrc thank you very much for joining us there from Gaza thank you and let's try Crossing now to ad cop it's a journalist in Jerusalem ADI there's Fierce fighting around this Hospital tell us more about what you're hearing well for starters I think it shouldn't surprise anyone that the shifa hospital became one of the targets of the Israeli Defense Forces we've seen Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Daniel hagari since the beginning of the war declaring again and again that the IDF has concrete information about not just a couple dozens but hundreds of Hamas and Jihad militants using the hospital as a shelter for military forces besides that we've seen several intelligence reports about the headquarters of Hamas and the control of Hamas sophisticated tunnel system being located under the shifa hospital this is probably the reason that we've seen Israeli forces trying to convince people to evacuate from the hospital since the beginning of the war and we are expecting to see more and more extensive attacks near the shifa hospital again the reason for that being that Kamas is using the hospital as its shelter for its own headquarters this has been the focus of the war since the beginning and it's going to become a much stronger area of battles as the war keeps on going this is also one of the main reasons that Israel has demanded the complete evacuation of people from the shifa hospital and from other hospitals in the Gaza Strip as well and this is the one of the reasons that humanitarian corridors are being opened from the northern part of the Gaza Strip where these hospitals are located towards the south of the Gaza Strip which is considered to be more of a safe Zone AI let's get back to the hospital I've seen some of the evidence that uh the Israeli Defense Forces uh have been releasing uh tell me how concrete is that evidence that Hamas is using places like these hospitals as command centers well unfortunately these evidence seem very concrete I myself went to my sources and confirmed with them that this information is true and to be honest I heard a lot more off the Record about the cynical use Hamas and other Terror organizations in the Gaza Strip are using medical infrastructure in the Gaza Strip This by the way goes Way Beyond just the hospitals which on its own is a crime against International humanitarian law we're talking about using infrastructures such as ambulances to commute Hamas militants and weapons around the Gaza Strip something that again is very contradictory to International humanitarian law we have to say the the consistency of this evidence and how concrete it is probably takes away the legitimacy and the immunity that hospitals are supposed to have under International humanitarian law because Geneva Convention explicitly mentions that once these facilities are used as militant bases and as places of combat as bases for the headquarters uh for Terror organizations they lose their legitimacy and their immunity in the war and let's pick up on the other point you made there these humanitarian corridors that have been offered by Israel but can't be secured in some cases and Israel also warning that Hamas has been opening fire on uh people trying to flee the North to the South yes and it's not just Israel that has been reporting that I myself have seen several different Palestinian reports and videos published by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip admitting that they have been trying and attempting to evacuate to the South and Hamas militants have been shooting not above their heads but to their feet and to their bodies killing many Palestinians who are trying to evacuate to the southern part of the Gaza Strip this is happening because Hamas realizes that the less civilians are around its own militants these militants are less protected Hamas is using these civilians as human Shields and the more people who evacuate to the southern part of the Gaza Strip Israel will have more legitimacy to attack Hamas and Jihad Targets in the northern part of the Gaza Strip which again is becoming the main Battleground in the Gaza Strip okay great to get your insights out a couple of it Jerusalem journalist joining us here on DW thank
