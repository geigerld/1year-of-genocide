members of the Jewish faith are observing Passover a celebration of Freedom From Slavery but it's a somber occasion for Jews in Israel this year because of the war with Hamas in Gaza in our next report the Israeli hostages still held by Hamas how their relatives are coping bring them home that's the message these Israelis are sending to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu they've set up a Passover table outside netanyahu's house but all the chairs are empty symbolizing the missing hostages they're sick of waiting and some accuse Netanyahu of deliberately stalling hostage negotiations we believe that the government and BB Nan don't want them here he don't want the hostage back he want to keep the war he's afraid that the war will end because he's afraid that he's going home and he's going to prison so he just want to keep the war after dark the protesters burned a table not a ritual but a gesture of defiance and Desperation in Tel Aviv families and friends of hostages taken from a kabut near Gaza Gather in a plaza the city council officially renamed hostages Square mixed emotions running High so my feelings are very complicated because this is the holiday of the liberty and for us it's not it's not Liberty because my father is in Gaza he in captivity my mother was also kidnapped and she returned after 54 days so we are very confused with the situation and it's very we feel very broken because my father is not here and all the the other just are there with no Freedom what we're focused in is reminding the other people around us that she is still alive that we can still bring her back and this is this is a holiday that celebrates Freedom so we don't commemorate people here we try to remind other people that freedom is still possible and that people should be free meanwhile across the border in Gaza the war rages on bombardments troops and tanks with no deal for the hostages return in sight well my next guest is a living witness to one of the most important moments in Israeli history Yuri droy was press spokesman for the governments of two Israeli Prime Ministers Yak Rabin and shimone Paris in the 1990s as the Oslo Accords were negotiated and signed he's also a former Israeli Air Force officer and he is the founder of the Jerusalem press club I'm happy to welcome Yuri dry to the program tonight Mr dry it's good to have you with us I want to start out by just asking you about the situation with the Israeli hostages being held by Hamas some of the relatives of those hostages say that their release is being postponed if you will um in order to keep prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in power help our viewers understand this accusation do you is that possible do you think that is what is happening here well uh if we were talking about Benjamin Nan only I would unfortunately have to agree to this accusation but um in the emergency Coalition that he formed you also have people like Benny gun and G Eisen these are serious people people and as as long as they are part of uh the current Coalition I don't think uh the government is uh doing uh these kind of things to just to to be in power but as I said in the beginning if it were for netan only I wouldn't be surprised well you know we often hear that Netanyahu is very unpopular among Israelis particularly among Israeli voters so is is it true when I say as long as Israel is at war with Hamas Netanyahu will remain in power well that's uh that's the Assumption right now there's more and more Israelis who are um you know reluctant to protest when war is going on uh people are have a mixed feelings about this I personally must admit I myself found it difficult to protest against the government while we are uh Waging War in Gaza but now I think the more and more Israelis are starting to understand that at this government uh of Netanyahu is the government that brought us to this situation by uh pretending to contain Hamas by actually letting Hamas Prosper with the Qatari money Etc and then waging a war with the war aims which are not realistic you know netan keeps talking about total Victory this is nonsense uh there's no such thing we are six months in a war with Hamas which is not a an army or whatever it's it's an organization and and they're still standing on their feet so more and more Israelis are weary of uh the netan government and there's a call add to this of course the fact that 133 hostages are still in the hands of Hamas and who knows how how many are alive still all this leads many Israelis to really protest against the government and call for its uh top Ling I want to ask you about there are reports today that that Hamas has made an offer to completely disband if and only if a Palestinian state is created you know you come from an era in Israeli history when there was this strong belief in the two State solution C do you think that it's viable at all to consider this if it's true what Hamas is offering that a two-state solution could be created moving forward if Hamas is allowed to continue to exist well uh you're talking to a sworn optimist so uh yes I think the two state is still the only uh viable uh solution to the problem because the these are two peoples claiming the right to the same piece of land so the only solution is dividing the land uh between them and and as you mentioned in the beginning I served under Rabin and Paris and during the OS times when there there was the beginning of this uh and you know paradoxically Hamas is now calling for a two-state solution uh which is I think most Israelis should have embraced it and and welcome it not to mention the Saudi or the Arab initiative of 2002 yeah which calls for the same thing except that the current government the current government in Israel is is not ready for this so we'll have to wait Mr J do you think that that Israel is running a danger here of missing an opportunity so let's say Hamas is being truthful that um it will disband if there's a two-state solution that becomes reality then the burden is on Israel in the West Bank to pull back these illegal settlements do you can you imagine Israel doing that well not Israel under the current government unfortunately I hate to say that because uh in in the current Coalition there are some Messianic and and and and AR settlers uh who will make it difficult with the with another government yes I doubt it if the big settlements can go because they are already accomplished facts but some kind of a settlement that definitely should be uh achieved especially if other Arab countries are joining and some of them already have joined under the Abraham Accords so there's a there's a potential here there's a opportunity here but we need a different Israeli government uh to uh stand up to this kind of occasion Yuri droy we appreciate you taking the time to talk with us um fascinating insights thank you thank you so turning now to the war in Gaza Israel says it's planning a ground offensive against the city of Rafa despite intense International criticism the Israeli government claims that most of hamas's remaining forces are hiding out in Rafa in southern Gaza where more than a million Palestinians are Sheltering satellite images show rows of tents that were not there earlier this month unconfirmed reports say Israel has bought 40,000 tents to accommodate the those displaced in any assault earlier I spoke to Sam Rose director of planning at unra the UN Aid Agency for Palestinians I asked him whether a humanitarian disaster can be averted thanks bees thanks for having me on look I think any shape or form in which a large scale operation military operation takes in Rafa will have absolutely devastating consequ consquences for the almost 1.5 million people who have been seeking Refuge here for the past several months however it is done we fear that the uh implications will be absolutely catastrophic for a population that has already gone through so much yet despite what you say Israel appears committed to carrying out this operation should Israel have a rethink is that what you're saying I think we as a humanitarian organization we we as part of the humanitarian Community here we're interested in the humanitarian well-being of that population we call for an immediate ceasefire for immediate release of hostages and for an end to this uh to this Bloodshed and this hell that people have had to put up with we uh yes we we call for it to stop we as the humanitarian Community have very little influence on that directly but we call on those that do have influence to do everything that they can before it's too late you're with the largest Aid operation that's working in Gaza have you seen or been told of Israel's plans to evacuate people from Rafa before any offensive we personally as unra me myself no have not been told we are not party to those discussions we read the newspapers we follow the satellite imagery as you are we hear the announcements from the Israeli authorities we understand that it may be IM but there is still time not to go ahead with it but no we are not party to any of the planning on their side speaking of satellite satellite imagery there are satellite images that have appeared of tents that have come up in southern Gaza do you know who put them up and if they are for people who might potentially be evacuated from Rafa I do not know I've not seen the tents personally I've seen the satellite imagery we can only assume that these are for people who will be evacuated I can see them on your screen right now but as I said it's hard to see impossible to see how this can take place how this can happen without major humanitarian consequences major suffering major loss of life we're talking about human beings here who've already gone through so much temporary camps talk of setting of flooding Gaza with Aid these are human beings they simply cannot put up with this we see the pictures as you've seen them now but no person I cannot I cannot verify them myself there this war has continued for about 7 months now if I'm not wrong what would you say about uh similar evacuation plans that have been implemented from time to time in various parts of Gaza have they actually worked they they haven't worked no uh I mean what are the objectives that have been achieved people have left without anything they've left at short notice they've received leaflets from the air telling them to move within a matter of hours we saw that in Gaza City back in in in October we saw it in Rafa and we saw it with this checkerboard approach that was taken several months ago uh so no these may give people time to move but there is nowhere safe to go to we've all seen the reports we've all met the people whose relatives have been killed we've not all but we have here people who've been killed on their way from one spot to another have they been directed to by the authorities being being killed on on on the way so no there is no safe place to go and as people are hemmed into an Ever smaller area it will become even more difficult both in terms of the conditions that they're facing and our ability as a humanarian community to deliver the aid and the supplies that they need and for them to get the water the sanitation the health care the food and the shelter which will keep them alive Sam just one final question you're there in Rafa what are people in Rafa telling you or telling unra about uh what could be coming their way people are waking up as they have done now for several months with with feelings of of dread with fear with resignation for what what comes next I mean it it's odd somehow this is my third third visit and and over time you know people people get used to the most horrible of circumstances so life somehow gets back not to to normal noral but life progresses slightly people are dreading the thoughts of of having to move again they just want this madness they just want this situation to come to an end we'll uh leave it there for the time being but thanks so much for joining us today Sam Rose director of planning at unra joining us from Rafa in the Gaza Strip thanks so much Sam
