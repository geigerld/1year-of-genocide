now Israel's military campaign in Gaza in response to the terror attacks committed by Hamas on October 7th has been described as one of the deadliest and most destructive in recent memory and a new intelligence estimate finds that many bombs Israel is dropping on the territory are unguided that could undercut Israel's claim that it's doing all it can to minimize civilian casualties tww security and defense reporter William glucoft has a look at the data Israeli officials have repeatedly said they take care to avoid civilian deaths even in the best case scenario however that's a challenge to stick to because Gaza is one of the most densely populated places in the world before this latest fighting broke out more than 2.2 million people lived in a space of just 365 square kilometers that's smaller than many midsize cities some military analysts have been skeptical of Israel's targeting efforts new information casts even more doubt about them a recent us intelligence report estimates that Israel has now dropped more than 29,000 air to ground weapons on Gaza and as much as 45% of them have been what's known as dumb bombs these are weapons without GPS or another sort of guidance system making it difficult to direct them against a specific Target Israel's tactics have led US President Joe Biden a staunch supporter of Israel to call the bombing campaign quote indiscriminate the United Nations estimates 90% of gaza's population has been displaced and 45% of all homes too damaged to be lived in again satellite imagery suggests well over 100,000 buildings have by now been damaged or destroyed and we can show you some of the satellite images from the US company maxar Technologies these show neighborhoods before and after Israeli air strikes you can see from these images just how much whole neighborhoods have been damaged before after now the physical destruction gives us an idea of the human toll gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry says more than 20,000 people have been killed so far many of them civilians and about 8,000 of them children many more of course have been injured or face secondary risks like hunger or disease conflict research ERS say there is little recent precedent for this level of Destruction and impact on non-combatants now despite this level of Destruction Israel says it will keep it up until Hamas has been wiped out for more let's bring in military analyst Frank ledwich he's a former British Military Intelligence officer and joins us now from Oxford Frank good to see you again we just hearded their 29,000 Munitions around half of them so-called dumb bombs how does that fit into the Israeli military's claim that it is only targeting Hamas not gazans in general well good afternoon Nicole I think it's worth mentioning that Western Air Forces the US Air Force predominantly also the British German French and others pretty much have given up the use of what are called dumb bombs we use only now Precision guided weapons however it's also worth pointing out of course that we haven't conducted operations of the intensity the is Isis have even mosul doesn't really compare and there are two constraints on Israeli operations in this respect the first is the availability of weapons so we've had 29,000 strikes probably more bombs than that uh figures would tend to show the Israelis may be running out of precision kits to fit on the bombs and it may well be a question of availability of ordinance now that may or may not be the case we don't know I guess we will we will never know but there's also another issue and that's the delivery system so it's not just the case that any aircraft can use Precision guided weapons I was talking to a royal Air Force officer yesterday who told me actually not every aircraft is fitted with them nor every pilot equipped trained and cleared to deliver these weapons so there are those constraints however the effect may be uh the intention may be discriminate the effect does seem to be indiscriminate the effect not the intent I have no doubt at all that the Israelis do not intend to injure or kill uh more garans than necessary unfortunately it does seem that their Rules of Engagement have been uh somewhat uh eased over the last couple of months are there specific situations where the use of unguided Munitions is legitimate yes you can deliver uh unguided Munitions reasonably accurately usually within a sort of uh era of about 30 mters Precision guided weapons is 3 MERS or even less in some cases depending on the missile you use so if you're attacking a military Target and you can be fairly certain that collateral damage will be prop as it's horrendously called in other words civilian casualties is proportionate to the effect you gain you can use unguided weapons but as I say uh Western Air Forces tend not to do so we often hear that Northern Gaza has been flattened we just saw the pictures there that William was showing some observers are comparing it to what in the past has been called carpet bombing would you agree no if the Israelis wanted to flatten Gaza they could do so in a few days quite easily as could any uh modern Air Force we saw what the Russians did to Aleppo we're not seeing that really in Gaza uh it's not a good look though there's no question about it I just don't like to use terms like carpet bombing because it does bring up Dresden and Hamburg and all the other horrors of the second world war and I think we can probably avoid that now let's let's talk about the the um the the strateg y here do you think what Israel or what the IDF is doing right now in Gaza will lead them to their stated goal of eliminating Hamas well that's an operational goal and I think in due course they will uh eviscerate the military capability of Hamas but in a sense that's not a strategy and anybody talking about a strategy here I think would have to concede that we are absent of strategy we don't know what Gaza is going to look like afterwards we don't know what political track is being looked at or aimed at and that as we' found out time and time and time again over the last 20 years is the important thing there's no strategy here there are just operational techniques uh an objective and then let's see apparently let's see what happens and and we'll look after it when the time arrives that's no way to conduct any military conflict so strategy here isn't the appropriate word operationally yes they are eviscerating Hamas but of course is the cost proportionate and is that cost uh politically sustainable over the long term and particularly in in in Israel's friends that's perhaps out with this conversation but it's something that uh I think a consideration is with us every day could there be any legal implications of using dumb bombs against such a densely populated area like the Gaza Strip well as I say I think there's no evidence that the Israelis are deliberately targeting civilians which would be in violation of the discre mintion uh principle of international humanitarian law and by the way I think it's worth mentioning all the time that there is a bright white line to be drawn between the deliberate murder of non-combatant civilians such as we saw on October the 7th and what's happening now uh clearly however the figure of 20,000 which is probably well exceeded now is unacceptable uh it it WR large or indeed WR small and it's having horrendous effects on Israel's overall political situation but uh but in terms of uh uh legal response look the Practical element of this is um there'll be no legal recourse I think against Israeli uh Israeli operators in this respect the the the procedures aren't present but that's for now let's see what happens in the future as military analyst Frank lewi thank you always great speaking to you thank you
