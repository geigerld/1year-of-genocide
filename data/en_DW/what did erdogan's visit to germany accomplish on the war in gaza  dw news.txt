the conflict in Gaza has also cast a shadow over a controversial visit to Germany by turkey's president Reep T erdogan has been here in Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Olaf Schultz the two leaders voiced sharply different views on the war a handshake with a Stern looking German president Frank valter Stein Meer and then onto the chancell where Olaf Schultz was waiting to greet toan with a friendly smile the usual images from a visit between NATO allies but as the two leaders spoke to the media just before their talks it was clear there was a wide Gulf between them on the war between Israel and Hamas I'm aware that we have different indeed very different views on this conflict that's hardly a secret and that is even more of a reason for us to talk particularly in difficult times we need to speak directly face to face look places of worship are hit churches are hit hospitals are hit but shooting hospitals killing children these things are not in the Torah you can't do that it is not in the Declaration of Human Rights you cannot do it in recent weeks erdogan has made a series of inflammatory statements about the conflict calling Hamas Freedom Fighters and Israel a terror state but his tone in Berlin was more conciliatory how can we solve this problem how can we get a humanitarian pors in the fighting how can turkey and Germany make a contribution and how can we take these steps together Olaf scha concentrated on the positives such as Anchor's constructive role brokering a grain deal between Russia and Ukraine and the importance of trade between turkey and Germany but on the war in Gaza his position was clear if you know Germany you will know our solidarity with Israel is unwavering Israel has the right to defend itself aligned with international law at the same time we say every life is equally valuable and this means the suffering of the people of Gaza is upsetting us as well the two leaders said there were plenty of other issues to discuss during erdogan's very short visit migration NATO enlargement and turkey's hope of buying Euro Fighter war planes were all on the agenda and if the Clash of words over Gaza was kept to a minimum that in itself may be counted as a success for more I'm joined Now by uran Aran director of DW's Turkish service so uran was in fact the Turkish president's visit a success and if so for whom I don't think so Michael that this visit was a success for any of them neither for uan nor for Chancellor schz because I think that most of the topics are talked in a kind of diplomatic way and not very open and uh face to face I think they had to um talk more deep because in the past that uh eruan calls Israel a terrorist State and calls the Hamas resistant fighter organization we can say that they are like uh uh Boy Scouts something like that and that's really ridiculous and I think this kind of topics had to put it out yesterday and there didn't no even before erdogan arrived his visit was roundly criticized here in Germany why it's because of these kind of Expressions that he did in the past it wasn't just once I mean he did it twice he did it two weeks ago in front of the AKP members of parliament and on Tuesday again he did it again in front of the AKP U members and uh everybody shouted for him and everybody screamed for him because the relationship to Hamas is very deep and therefore um erdogan was very criticized in the past as a NATO Ally he had to be side by side with all these NATO members but he didn't and he always make a Stepside and that's not very healthy for all of them um uron Schultz very publicly addressed the major differences between these two leaders how do you think he mastered the delicate balance between on the one hand resolutely standing by German policy and on the other showing warmth welcoming uh an antagonist of that policy sure I think that Charles uh didn't had any other chance to react like this he did yesterday but uh I think most of the people most of the experts most most of the journalists will say that Schultz wasn't very very um aggressive he had to be more um reliant on his standings uh to Israel for example and uh against the Hamas and he didn't do this very open um and frankly I think he was he looked a little bit weak uh he wasn't of course he never smiled of course but I think he should be more directly and more strong against his opponent from Turkey but he wasn't unfortunate talk about the specific differences the diff the specific uh topics that you keep bringing up what should he addressed much more specifically I think he should much more addresses that Hamas is a terrorist organization he did it but not he just talked to the press and not to uan he addresses that to the press and I think that the freedom of press and freedom of speech in Turkey should also be a topic that he had to bring up yesterday but of course the migration issue the um the the deal the refugee deal uh with the European Union is also very important topic and of course these kind of topics were um on the major hand so that was um too less time to talk everything and of course no official press conference just two questions and there was not very much should Schultz have addressed anything in addition to that Sweden NATO definitely I mean we see that turkey desperately wants 14 Euro fighters from Germany and I think on the other hand uh Germany will say Okay so let's put Sweden into the NATO and then we can discuss again and this is also a very important thing and I don't think that we are on the end of the discussion it will go on for the next uh couple of weeks or maybe a month till we get a solution to in this issue uran Aran head of head of director of DW Turkish thank you so much
