hello and welcome I'm joined today by my colleague Ben fulan who has spent the last few weeks reporting from Israel Ben welcome um let's jump right into it you're reporting from the country about a month after the October 7th attacks I would imagine this is a time in which some of the sheer shock of those attacks has perhaps dissipated a little bit um but obviously the disruption to lives and livelihoods a lot remains unclear how would you describe uh your perception of that time I would actually say it's a nation still in shock even a month on um that's all people were talking about uh a lot of grave faces not the generous uh welcoming Israelis that you're used to uh but rather an economy a people under attack really um the economy is going to take a huge hit uh especially the tech sector the tech sector makes up uh a fifth of the economy a half of the country's exports and a third of tax revenues you've got a heap of people working for the sector and uh that alone has got to got get to get the diversification alarm bells ringing um but sentiment had already been dropping before the war there'd been a sharp drop in investment because of the government's divisive judicial reforms that's right and uh also a global slowdown a survey of 500 startups though highlighted two big points uh just two weeks into the war a lack of Manpower whole lot of reservists 3 60,000 of them being called up and a drop in investment uh for many startups in their initial phases so it's not boting well for the sector this Tech sector you filmed a piece there we want to take a look at it in just a moment maybe you can give us some context about uh your decision to film and and uh anything else you want to add before we look at it uh well basically what I wanted to point out is that um there are some upsides here there is a global Coalition of tech companies and entrepreneurs that have banded together and they're providing a $100 million fund not as huge as some of the sums we're used to throwing about in the tech sector in Israel but certainly a little bit of hope uh from a senior Microsoft official in Israel uh a very pessimistic tone he's saying that is warning that multinational companies May close research and development centers and that the country uh really needs to create some sort of positive Horizon in his words uh to convince that multinationals need to keep growing need to keep investing is in Israel um he noted that for every Tech job there are five more created in the Israeli economy and uh there's a great danger that Israel uh could return to selling oranges and being a third world economy in his words okay let's go ahead and take a look at that piece it can be Lonely at the Top oi Glick heads a sustainability platform that services companies worldwide her Tel Aviv headquarters are eerily quiet with Israel at War about 70% of the team members are either drafted or supporting the effort which we are actually encouraging their it knoow means some employees are key to military operations but what about their jobs Israelis are very agile and very resilient so they work during the day and work with us during the night so our business uh thankfully um is not affected but even if companies are managing for now a country at War could be unsettling for international investors crucial to Israel's high-tech sector around 400 multinationals are set up in Israel all the big names the largest foreign employer of local Engineers is Intel the company is planning a $25 billion chip manufacturing plant will it still happen I'm sure they're very committed to Israel I'm sure they will continue to support Israel and I I don't think it will impact their long-term Strategic investment in Israel but the war could drag on the Chief Operating Officer of the startup is also off to the front he says they're doing okay as a company during this important mission to protect our country we need to make sure that ESG go is Contin to exist and this is what we are managing uh we have a great employees in the company that understand the situation the challenges challenges of the situation to make sure that they are in service but in the meantime taking care of the company one last strategy meeting then yif is off to war oy back to business all right let's get more from Ben fulan who filmed that report the head of that startup saying that some 70% of her employees were either drafted or supporting that effort can we say if that's typical for what we're seeing in this Branch I imagine it's a very young branch in general it is um that's an extreme case um in other companies it's about half but that's you know still a huge number and for workers to be operating on the front and working nights for their companies I mean how long can you go on doing that I asked oy that and she said oh yeah you know we can keep that up for months but this might go on for a year we we've been talking about the tech sector what about other parts of the Israeli economy when we look at um you know the resources being pulled for this draft for this mobilization what can we say when I was there I was one of the only ones in my hotel There Were Soldiers there people being relocated uh evacuees from um communities close to Gaza and uh and that was about it it and on the streets a whole lot of soldiers a whole lot of police uh a lot of people carrying weapons and uh otherwise a real real hit to sentiment um hit to the mood and um it's just an unfortunate time for me to go to the country of course isn't it the head of um that company who you interviewed there she seemed generally AC accepting of the situation as we talked about this was only a month after those attacks um do you have a sense if that is IAL right now is this a common sentiment that you hear definitely her son is also off to the front uh her Co O's son is a paratrooper uh I met two families of soldiers one working in international Liaisons and uh she's on the northern border to Lebanon um and another family an American uh Israeli whose son is in Gaza and has been there since day one so she she basically hasn't really heard from him in a month this is essentially an economy right now in which a lot of people aren't showing up I would imagine in the same degree that they were before and that there there seems to be an acceptance of that given the situation fair to say yeah people are holding out um others I've spoken to devastated they don't know what to do big question marks lots of uncertainty and as you know uncertainty drives uh the bad vibes on exchanges uh Ben we want to show another piece from your reporting that looks at the livelihoods um that continues to look at how livelihoods are affected by this war this one looking in particular at the tourism Branch um maybe you can give us some context for the piece um sure I went to Jerusalem's old city um that's the occupied uh East and there are lots of um mainly Arab traders there who are really worried about their families in Gaza worried about bigger things than just their own livelihoods but yeah zero tourist s and usually when um a conflict hits um you know tourism takes a hit but not to this extent all right let's have a look at the piece a once in a-lifetime trip for many cut short by War Jerusalem's old city is one of the holiest places in the world for an array of religions and communities it's usually full of pilgrims and tourists not today the typically bustling Suk of East Jerusalem is e quiet after October 7th tourists left the country in a hurry bookings were cancelled of the 800 Merchants mostly Arabs only a handful are here they say this will hurt business for months if not years every two years 3 years we have a new round of violence that can you know stop or not reduce the amount of tourist but this one stopped it completely and this one seems to be the roughest round we I have ever seen from peak season to nothing there is no work I'm just coming to sit business no we feel sad you know we don't have work at all the situation is not easy it's uh the war is not easy no no no we feel very upset and sad and no nobody feel good you know not from no Arabs no Jew nobody feel good we feel all de the stairs to the Church of the Holy Seiler this has been the pilgrimage site for Christians since the 4th Century today it's devoid of the usual tour groups no people are very afraid and disappointed and they don't want even to want to hear about religion you know because they say like this things is taking us to a dark days with no no end to the conflict in sight there is a lot to pray for right now well Ben fulan filmed that piece and he's here with me now Ben we know that there's a lot more going on um than just the economy obviously in this conflict lives lost through the attack lives being lost right now through these operations at the same time this is about livelihoods um give us a sense of how important tourism is in this case to many livelihoods across this region uh tourism basically your tourism related jobs make up 6% of total employment it's a huge sector it's one of their key uh income sources and uh we're talking about 2 and a half million tourists who visited including pilgrims um up until the war and they were expecting another 2 and a half million in this next period and the war hit right at peak season and none of those are going to be coming what does this mean for those uh who are basically seeing their income evaporate um through this slck of TRS they're really uh bewildered they just don't know what to do they're turning up to like one of the guys in that report to air out his carpets and chase away moths that's all he does um others have moved online during uh Corona time so uh they're really cashing in on that side of things and that makes up for a lot of sales but what they're missing is that huge uh tourist crowd that comes uh right throughout the year actually again sort of wrapping this up and taking a step back we know that the the economy in Israel is just one part of this broader story uh at the same time this really is about livelihoods um how much of an issue is it for Israel when we look at their economy compared to where they are right now and what's going on is this something that you're seeing being talked about what it can sustain we mentioned um the the investment from outside you mentioned the the Microsoft analyst and his thoughts on it um what do we here within the country there are some saying that investors will return but the question is when you know is it going to take a year for them to come back just for these tourists to come back they're saying it's going to take if the war stops tomorrow it'll take another six months um as far as the big investors go um it's said that they may out of solidarity suddenly increase uh you've got a lot of countries behind Israel around the world um but hotels Hospitality cafes bakeries restaurants they're empty and they're going to take massive hits um the only sector bucking the trend is the gun trade because there's a lot of distrust at the moment and people are hiring bodyguards uh people are buying weapons there was a politician court giving out free weapons which the US wasn't happy about because they were sponsored by the US um it's it's a really tricky situation right now no one's happy and uh no one feels safe all right it's a situation that continues to develop by the day we're going to have to leave it there for now Ben fulan thank you so much DW reporter anchor joining us
