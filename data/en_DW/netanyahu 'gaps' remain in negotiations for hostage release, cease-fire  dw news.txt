negotiators have met in Paris to discuss a deal between Israel and Hamas that could see hostages released and an extended ceasefire in the Gaza Strip protesters in Israel have been ramping up the pressure on the government to bring home the hostages Israeli officials described the talks as constructive but the Office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says there are significant gaps between the two sides and that discussions will continue this week officials from Egypt katar and Israel are taking part in the us-led talks and let's get more on that we are joined by defense and Foreign Affairs analyst Nava bin Mubarak Al tahani he was director as the Qatari director of Defense intelligence operations and as the defense attache to the United States He joins us now from Doha thank you so much for joining us on the program um when you see the current where things currently stand how optimistic are you about these talk talks in Paris well I'm quite optimistic that the uh any progress towards negotiation would be successful however all parties involved have to commit to the process it's a hard process it's a long process but commitment to that process is vital for it to succeed and we know that the CIA Chief William Burns met with his Israeli and his Egyptian counterparts as well as qatar's prime minister and they are supposed to meet again this week tell us a little bit more about the mix of participants and what might be going on behind closed doors well obviously um from a qari perspective they've made it very clear that they they played very close to the vest secrecy is important in any negotiation for Success however if we see past negotiations even in this conflict as a guide it usually means that it starts off with laying ground rules understanding of the parameters of negotiation moving forward to setting reasonable goals and then executing that and while that is being executed as in the last round of negotiations the Qatari foreign Ministry had an OP Center set up to make sure that if there's any snag or issue in implementing negotiated agreements that it would re be resolved in real time I think that would usually be the same Moda sarandi moving forward now details about the negotiation uh obviously isn't clear right now but hopefully if past uh results are any proof of future hopes then we're very hopeful what do you see as the main hurdles now especially you know given the role that Qatar has played in facilitating um the Israel Gaza peace talks given its channel of communications with Hamas well the main hurdle as I said is commitment now we've seen some issues internally in Israel uh the new conservative government of Netanyahu has been on one side asking for qatar's help and wanting it and praising it and on the other side criticizing and that is not helpful moving forward now the later statement I would say about on the part of Hamas how about on the part of hamas's commitment well well the the proof is in the pudding qar has proven that it is able to negotiate release of hostages this is not pie in the sky or imaginary or theoretical issue this has seen actual results it's only replicating those successes that we're talking about right now and I think if everyone's committed and again the prime minister of Israel's office just less than 12 hours ago said that is it is quote unquote constructive as it's going forward I think that makes us hopeful but steadfastness and commitment by the parties the negotiators are only the negotiators the parties whether Israel or Hamas have to be steadfast in their commitments and that only will guarantee a successful negotiation thank you so much for your time naash Al tahani defense and Foreign Affairs analyst and former qari director of Defense intelligence operations we appreciate it thank you
