US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin has called on Israel to protect civilians as its forces close in on Gaza City meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv blinkon repeated that Israel has the right and obligation to defend itself so that militants can no longer Massacre people on its soil and he called for a pause in the fighting to allow Aid and Essentials into Gaza I've seen images too of Palestinian children young boys and girls pulled from the wreckage of buildings when I see that when I look into their eyes through the TV screen I see my own children we need to do more to protect Palestinian civilians we've been clear that as Israel conducts his campaign to defeat Hamas how it does so matters I spoke to Israeli leaders about tangible steps that can be taken to increase the sustained delivery of food water medicine Fuel and other essential needs while putting in place measures to prevent diversion by Hamas and other terrorist groups uh We've identified mechanisms to enable fuel to reach hospitals and other needs in the South Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would press on with its action in Gaza we're continuing with all our strength and Israel is refusing a temporary truce that does not include the release of our hostages Israel will not enable the entry of fuel into Gaza and opposes transferring money to the strip our correspondent Tanya Kramer followed blink's visit today she joins me now from Jerusalem Tanya the Secretary of State stressed the need for humanitarian Aid and for humanitarian pauses as he called them in Gaza what influence could his appeals have on Israel's future course of action well that's why we've seen much more pressure from the US now more emphasis on this humanitarian Aid and the humanitarian pauses as he called it uh he said there would be some mechanisms now put in place talking about you know at the moment only dozens of trucks of course coming into Gaza from Egypt that is beyond the need for the Gaza population there um and at the moment also the movement of people is very restricted we only see Palestinians with dual citizenship coming out of course the majority of Palestinians if they would like to they cannot uh get out of Gaza uh but of course he also talked about the humanitarian pauses uh but that he said this is still under discussion and he said you know there's still discussion about when this will happen how it will happen and we heard also the um prime minister Benyamin netan then after this press conference by um Secretary of State Anthony blinkin actually rejecting the idea uh of having a temporary ceasefire or such a humanitarian pause if hostages are not released so uh at the moment there don't seem to be a breakthrough in having any of of a of a sort of ceasefire that is actually what humanitarian organizations and the United Nations have called for given this catastrophic situation for the civilian population in Gaza yeah uh just today the Israeli military said it hit an ambulance near gaza's biggest Hospital the alifa hospital what more do we know at this stage well we don't know uh all the details the Hamas Health officials have said that um in Gaza that it was uh transporting that it was a convoy going from the alifa hospital that's the largest hospital in Gaza City where also a lot of uh people are seeking shelter or trying to seek shelter uh that this uh Convoy of ambulances was hit at the entrance of this uh of of shifa Hospital uh there were on their way to rafar this is from the officials there but we also got a statement now by the Israeli army they confirmed that it targeted an ambulance they're talking here about an ambulance outside chiffa hospital and they claim it was used by Hamas and it was uh in a in close proximity to a uh a battle Zone as they put it they also said they will release more information uh in the hours uh to come Tanya Kramer with the latest from Jerusalem thanks for that and Aaron David Miller is a senior fellow at carnegi Endowment for decades he worked at the US state department on the US policy on the Middle East Mr Miller welcome back to DW now prime minister Netanyahu had said calls for a ceasefire would equal calls for Israel to surrender today we heard him connect the possibility of a temporary truce to Hamas releasing its hostages how big a shift is this in his position well if in fact the prime minister is offering a trade uh temporary ceasefire for the release of all the hostages uh I think that's probably a deal the Israelis uh might might want to make if it's just a release of the foreign Nationals leaving the Israelis um Jewish Israelis behind or Israeli Nationals behind they may not all be Jewish I'm not sure that the uh government is prepared to accept that but the reality is the hostage negotiations are incredibly opaque neither you nor I frankly have the vaguest clue about what is actually happening in these days of negotiations moderated by the cutteries and the Egyptians the Israelis and the Americans we just don't know yeah and I did speak to someone familiar with the hostage negotiations though and they said Hamas won't release the hostages until the bombing stops which you know when Netanyahu says we will stop the bombing once the hostages are released and Hamas says we will release the hostages once the bombing stops where does that leave us well you could try a thought experiment or you could test hamas's Intentions by creating a you can even uh you know create a humanitarian pause for 6 8 10 24 hours do you think that's something that that is would go for um just to try it out saying that it would you know or given what they've been saying about about the risks that truce is bear for them especially now when they say that they have encircled Gaza City right well they they don't have to leave their established positions I mean a 12-hour humanitarian truce or a series of humanitarian trues in in localized areas to allow humanitarian assistance in and to allow wounded and incapacitated uh Palestinians to move into safer areas might be something worth trying what they won't do is create an extended ceasefire that needs to be negotiated the real question is if Hamas put on the table the release of all of the hostages the 240 estimated humans that they have would the Israelis agree uh to Cease the Bombing and then of course for how long once Hamas uh frees the hostages one of their uh points of Leverage in their cards then dissipate so I don't know and again Hamas has also wanted the release of the anywhere from 5 to 6,000 Palestinian prisoners uh who are the Israelis now hold a third of them uh without without trial and administrative detention so that's another angle here I again I not trying to be difficult but I really think we don't have anything remotely resembling a a fair grasp yeah of what these proposals really involve yeah the situation in Gaza is becoming more and more hellish by the day um secretary estate Anthony blinkin was clear today when he said it matters how Israel does this now with the humanitarian crisis deteriorating will the US be forced at some point to draw a red line for Israel in its fight against Hamas and Gaza well the question is what what red line are we talking about if we're talking about an American president saying to an Israeli Prime Minister stop enough stop the campaign stop the bombing stop your operations against hamas's infrastructure first of all that conversation I I cannot imagine uh happening so when you talk about a red line the question question is exactly what line aren't the Israelis uh permitted to cross and I'm not sure um that this president or frankly any president under these circumstances are prepared to have that conversation the real the question to me and I can't answer it is when the secretary of state says he's discussing with the Israelis concrete measures that will prevent the deaths of Palestinian civilians and allow these Isis to continue their military operations to eradicate H what concrete measures is he talking about yeah yeah I've seen only two options for the Israelis number one stop the bombing encircle Gaza and then go house by house with bulldozers their Engineers their uh demolition experts their special ops house by house it'll take weeks if not months and the cost to Israeli soldiers would likely be in the hundreds if not the thousands that's one possibility yeah I can't imagine this is really government being willing to accept that level of of uh the deaths of its own soldiers second option is to uh stop the gr campaign and pursue a more targeted set of operations that would last months and that for sure the Israelis are not going to accept because that will permit Hamas to remain uh with its assets with the hostages yeah for a very long period of time I just don't think there is an answer yeah to the problem of how you eradicate Hamas and still protect civilians yeah seem to be bad options at this point we'll have to leave it there we're unfortunately running out of time that was Aaron David Miller from the carnegi and down thank you so much for all of that thank you now Israel says its troops have fully surrounded Gaza City that became the focus for attacks when Israel ordered civilians to flee South those still trapped in the city are now at grave risk explosions continued to rock gaza's north even as Israel's military said its troops had fully encircled Gaza City Israel's military released these videos as its soldiers prepared to enter the city backed by more military force hitting Gaza simultaneously from many fronts Israel Defense Forces have encircled GSA from the air Land and Sea they've encircled the city of Gaza and its surroundings are advancing troops are destroying terrorist infrastructures both above the ground and underground and they're eliminating terrorists Israel's military says that its operations killed over 100 Hamas militants but International organizations warn that the civilian toll on the Palestinian side is increasing by the day amid a worsening humanitarian crisis to sustain the humanitarian response on the scale needed we need hundreds of tracks to inter Gaza every day at the very least we need a humanitarian pose in the fighting and ideally a ceasefire let me be clear there can be no justification for hamas's horrific attacks on Israel the Gaza Health Ministry run by Hamas says over 9,000 people have been killed with Gaza City fully surrounded the Gaza Strip home to over 2 million people faces even more Carnage Israel continues to oppose calls for a ceasefire Peter Lerner speaks for the Israel Defense Forces and joins us from Tel Aviv welcome back to DW um now Israel says it has encircled Gaza what happens next i Phil thank you for having me again I would say we are putting the pressure up on Hamas in order to achieve our goal of destroying and dismantling this terrorist organization that conducted the worst terrorist activity the worst attack against Israel in the history of our country indeed it is day 28 and we have been saying of the last several weeks that we are expanding and increasing our activities against Hamas and this is the way we push forward uh we continue to strike and and uh attack the leadership the commanders the operation operators the terrorist infrastructure that is serving them and this is what we are continuing to do we heard in the report um Israel's claims to have killed more than a 100 militants um how do you verify that I would say that was in just one location that we identified specifically uh in one in one battle on in the area of B but there are hundreds of terrorists that have been killed in exchanges the battles are ongoing and indeed there are uh face hand to hand or face Toof face fights and exchanges with terrorists all the time um as the as the operation as the war moves forward and so how do you verify the numbers we have visual confirmation of the different strikes where they're taking place how the exchanges are taking place the types of reports that the forces are reporting back uh and that is how we are confirming those numbers what are you telling civilians who are still in Gaza City the old the young the sick uh the the people who have just got nowhere else to go what are you telling them as you surround the city Phil with there are still excess routs out of Gaza City and um and towards the South we are still encouraging people to move South and I hope that they will listen if they listen and can't clearly that they're they're in danger no they as I just said there are routs out of the city towards the South they should listen and go your government announced today that Gaz and workers in Israel are being expelled and sent back to Gaza into a war zone um R DF our IDF involved in those expulsions no I think uh they actually it was a return that was conducted earlier today during the morning of uh several thousand of uh several hundreds of Palestinians that were stuck in Israel uh during uh the war up until now and they would returned to uh Gaza but I can't confirm the the the magnitude of that right how does Israel's duty to protect because just on that one looks at what's going on and one wonders how your country's duty to protect civilians how that squares with sending them into a region that you are bombing at the same time again I can't discuss the the details because I'm not clear on those so I would rather not go into that now Phil we can catch up at a later date if You' like okay what security um so what then are your plans for uh the south of of Gaza this place where uh you keep telling people to go which is still subject to being uh bombed now that Israel has surrounded Gaza City what are your plans for the south of the territory so the activities the humanitarian activities as people continue to move South which is a good thing because they're moving out of the the area where our forces are operating on the ground is actually a good thing that people are listening and moving south um the it is safer and as you as you rightly pointed out if Hamas conducts attacks from the south they will be targeted as well but the the potential there of uh ground operations currently is almost non-existent and and and that is why we're telling people to go south because the Beating Heart of hamas's operation is in the North in Gaza City and that is why for the last three three weeks we've been encouraging people to go south um in the South there is a humanitarian uh Zone excuse me uh designated in the southwest area of a longer Coast called the maasi that sa safe uh humanitarian Zone and there is ongoing supplies and medical supplies and food supplies that are coming in through uh Rafa and of course the the evacuation the emergency evacuation of dual Nationals and foreign Nationals from Rafa that you've covered extensively over the last couple of days um indeed this is the situation this is the humanitarian situation we are at a state of war with Hamas that continues to attack launch rockets at Israel and continues to try attack our forces operating on the ground we will continue until achieve our goal we'll leave it there a Peter larner of the Israel Defense Forces thank you so much thank you Phil Marina Moran joins me now she's a military Analyst at Kings College London Marina so what is next for the IDF after it says it has encircled Gaza City good evening Nicole well what it looks like right now is that indeed there is going to be a complete Siege of the city what we're seeing here is the city is being encircled in order to control movements in and out of the city but um Israel claims that they still have left a W for civilians to leave and they want the civilians out of the theater of operations for obvious reasons because they'll make it difficult so we estimate that once some civilians leave this wall will not be open for a long time the isra the Israeli forces will close the circle and then start combing the cities Street by Street house by house but Hamas Fighters know the environment much better than the IDF how much of a challenge will that be for them it is a huge challenge generally speaking Urban Warfare is the most dreaded type of warfare and specifically because Hamas is on its own uh land so to say they know every single street corner and every single house basement they have their extended um tunnel Network as well so they have the advantage there defending um Gaza City and for the Israeli forces the risk is very high so um it is pro probable that there will be high casualties also on the Israeli side this because the threat is coming from all directions and even using air power and using Naval assets to strike Target targets within the city is not going to minimize that risk let's take a closer look at this tunnel system the Gaza Metro as it's called how can the Israeli Army go about destroying that tunnel system which is what they're aiming to do especially with Israeli hostages believe to be held there well I think the Crux of the problem is indeed the Israeli hostages because um the IDF could fill the tunnels was gas I mean um these tunnels need ventilation otherwise you cannot use them and they could possibly bomp the tunnels uh from not from the air but directly by by throwing explosives they have engineers and detonation experts that could do that but the problem is that you have the hostages there and you don't know exactly from the Israeli point of view the layout of those tunnels how many levels they have and where is a lead so there there is some intelligence on that but it's very difficult and it's going to be a huge problem because uh Hamas Fighters can pop up in any location because they know that system very well and surprise the Israeli forces so that that will be the most difficult component of this urban fight is to control the tunnel system or destroy it uh Marina there has been strong condemnation around the world of the civilian casualties and the suffering the Israeli mission in Gaza is causing now with Hamas using gazans as human Shields is there a possibility at all to fight the terrorists without creating unbearable hardship for civilians well that was a problem that the US and the British forces had in Afghanistan and then it it depends on the situation of course but then you would have to abort the operation in order not to create um more casualties or collateral damage but in some military situations you have to take the risk um knowing that this will create a a collateral damage if the military objective is important enough so it will be situational but of course uh there will all always be criticism because nobody's on the ground to assess the situation and to say indeed this was the right time to strike the terrorist um despite the fact that there were people around as Marina Mor military analyst from Kings College London thanks so much thank you for having
