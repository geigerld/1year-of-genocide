the Israeli military has rescued one of the hostages taken in the October 7th Terror attacks led by Hamas Israeli officials said that kayid faran aladi was found in a t tunnel in southern Gaza he's the first hostage to be rescued alive underground aladi is recovering in hospital where his medical condition is described as normal Hamas is thought to be still holding around 110 hostages about a third of them are believed to be dead well Israel's prime minister Benyamin nety who spoke with alqadi shortly after he arrived in hospital he avowed to bring home the remaining hostages welcome home faradi I congratulate the Israeli Army and Shin Bet on another successful rescue operation we are working tirelessly to bring all our hostages back we are doing this in two main ways through negotiations and through rescue operations both approaches acquire our military presence on the ground and continuous military pressure on AAS we will continue to operate in this manner until we bring home everyone I'd like to welcome Laura Blumenfeld now she is the Middle East analyst a New York Times bestselling author and a senior fellow at the Philip Merill Center for strategic studies at John's Hopkins school for advanced International Studies welcome to you hostage rescues by Israel are relatively rare what do you make of this latest release rare indeed it's only the fourth hostage rescue in 10 months where the Israelis and and multinationals have been held in Hamas um look he humanizes the hostage issue it's hard to keep those faces to believe that they're real they're not just posters they're real people um and this was a father of 11 who came out squinting because he hadn't seen sunlight for months a 40 lbs thinner um I would say the second notable thing is he's a Muslim he's an Arab he spoke uh you know Hebrew though because he's a citizen of Israel and the commanding officer the Israeli uh military officer who welcomed him greeted him in Arabic which kind of pushes back on the narrative that Israel is an aparti country but more more realistically a kind of multinational multiethnic Community um the 12 Drew children who were killed by the holla rocket last month um that kicked off the most recent cycle of retaliation in the north also weren't Jewish so I think that's notable as well and then finally I think that you know today while we were celebrating the rescue of one hostage there was a funeral for another one one of the bodies that was recovered last week there were six hostages who were not rescued so I think that adds some pressure to reach a negotiated deal I wanted to ask you about that how do you think this affects any potential ceasefire deal to bring remaining hostages home well at the hostage fam's note that there are at least 70 of the 100 um remaining uh hostages who they believe are alive and it's not realistic although prime minister Netanyahu says they can do both they can do rescue operations but also hostage negotiations it's not realistic to think that they'll all be freed by the military I do think that today's operation puts pressure on senoir the leader of Hamas as well as the unsuccessful attack by Hezbollah on Saturday night because it just shows that you know Hamas is on the defense and the military um is not the way that they're going to achieve their goal so I do think that's a good sign it's harder to reach senoir now um you know he's cut off he's in the tunnels the the negotiations do continue though I believe that they're um they're continuing tomorrow in Doha with low-level working groups we at the kind of nuts and bolts details unfortunately the devil in this case is in the details and it's going to be hard to get there Laura a bit more broadly Israel is fighting conflicts on on multiple fronts including in in Gaza as well as against Iran's various proxies like Yemen's houthis and Hezbollah in Lebanon as you just mentioned how long do you think Israel can withstand all this well look the Iran and its proxies are playing the long game um they have a Doomsday Clock ticking backward in in Palestine square and tahon to 2040 where they predict that Israel will be annihilated that's one of the reasons why prime minister Netanyahu is pushing so hard C for what he calls total Victory I mean for him it's you know the hostages today yes those are the faces that we see but if you trade them for Palestinian prisoners those are going to be 10 or 100 more hostages tomorrow this is why he feels like it's so important to push back in that way and re aieve the deterrence that they've been trying to reclaim after the surprise attack on October 7th so much of this war has been about intelligence the the the the achievement by taking out uh hania in tahon which was an intelligence coup for Israel and shuker who was the commander of Hezbollah in Lebanon for Netanyahu that's his way back to Redemption showing not only can they be smart they can be smart and strong that was Middle East analist Laura blumen F there thank you very much thank you
