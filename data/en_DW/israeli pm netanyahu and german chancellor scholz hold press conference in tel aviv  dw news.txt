Prim Minister the security of Israel and its citizen is something that Germany defense this is the principle that we have when we government and Parliament supports Israel and all parties do the same and it is very important for me to emphasize this here in Israel German history and the responsibility we have given the history of the Hol Holocaust mean that it is our task to stand up for the security of ladies and gent the cruel and bloody attack of Hamas against Israel is uh condemned by us the terror against innocent civilians the killing of innocent people the murder of babies Abduction of women men and children the humiliation of Holocaust Survivors all of that shocks us it is quite clear Israel has the right to defend itself against this Terror under international law every state has the obligation to protect its we feel the awful suffering of all Israelis that have lost parents children families in this uh barbaric attack we share the sorrow of all those family members who have lost members that were adopted by among person Germans we focus on them and all the other hostages and we try everything we do to free them minister prime minister my government stands up for this conflict not to escalate we need to prevent the spill over into the whole region and I warn every actor they should not think it's a good idea to intervene into this conflict from the out it would be an unforgivable mistake and this is a message we have spread through many channels to all Minister prime minister Germany and Israel are united by the fact that we are Democratic states based on the rule of law and even in extreme situations we act on the basis of the law and that is why we not uh taking we also taking notice of the human suffering in and that is why I have said we need to provide monetary help to the innocent civilians different from the Hamas that keep humans as human Shields we are also concerned about the civilian population we want to prevent civilian with Minister President with prime minister netan I spoke about the opportunity of a better human humanitarian access to Gaza and that is one of the reasons why I'm going to travel to Egypt to talk to president Ali tomorrow talk about the situation and humanitarian aspects the federal government is going to continue its humanitarian commitment to mitigate the suffering of the civilian allow me at the end of my statement to make two remarks regarding the situation in Germany anti-Semitism has no place in Germany the celebration and glorification of violence is inhumane abhorent it is prescribed and will be punished in Germany is a gift Jewish institutions are being protected thank you thank you Chancellor uh I appreciate all your statements including your last reference to protecting uh the Jewish Community we discussed this um in our conversation as well the question of uh uh the safety of civilians uh is something that is raised by hamas's actions Hamas is committing a double War crime not only is that targeting and murdering civilians with unprecedented savagery it's hiding behind civilians their own civilians we are calling on the civilians to leave Gaza go south to Safe zones and Hamas is preventing them often at gunpoint from doing so Hamas wants to keep them there as a human shield and prevent uh the people from leaving and getting out of Harm's Way it's important that the entire world understands this the responsibility for the civilian uh civilians who are there both the abducted people and both the uh people who are kept there at force uh the citizens of our our country and the citizens of dozens of countries and the Palestinian civilians themselves that responsibility is sits squarely on the shoulders of the Hamas war criminals they're committing a double War crime attacking civilians hiding behind civilians as you Shields the entire world should condemn it and should support Israel in its just War thank you very much and thank you Chancellor thank you thank you we just saw a press conference there with Olaf Schultz who is currently visiting Israel with Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu um the German chancellor has said ahead of this visit that his trip will be a clear sign of German solidarity uh for Israel let's dig into this a little bit more with DW's Chief political editor Michaela kufner joining me in the studio Michaela hi we heard Netanyahu there um painting a very clear and gruesome picture of hamas's attacks in Israel calling it a battle for the future of civilization I'm curious what you made though of German Chancellor Schultz's remarks in this press conference that we just heard yeah let's just lay out what he said and I first of all I just want to note that um whatever comes next this is a historic moment certainly for Germans um but also um for the Jewish people because we just saw the prime minister of Israel standing there with the chancellor of the nation that is responsible for the Holocaust and um we saw the direct reference uh to the Holocaust I mean this is the the largest loss of Israeli life since the Holocaust uh very concrete references from Benin Netanyahu there um to Bab as well the Mass Slaughter of Jews in what is now Ukraine and um the German Chancellor recognizing this and once again conveying the message uh that Germany has made a very unusual commitment towards Israel uh which is that it's a fundamental principle of German of the German state to ensure the protection of Israel now what that means in concrete detail uh I think it's a bit too early to really understand what that will mean in the end we know that there has been o so far only a request um for drones that Germany had leased from Israel um I think it's noteworthy that the German Chancellor um reiterated this message there was this is rhetoric this is what we've heard before um we heard this in the German Parliament and he's also very eager to stress that Germany will clamp down it will use the full force of the law to clamp down on anti any anti-semitic demonstrations here in Germany any potential actions against Jews because Jews in this country they are afraid looking at what happened but the clear condemnation of Hamas and a clear responsibility that rests with Hamas for whatever is to come and that is something that is concerning the entire world now course so this was a hugely symbolic moment as you say uh has it already been clear though in Practical terms what kind of support Germany is going to be offering Israel as Schultz takes this trip to the region well we have this um commitment by Germany and a request um to basically for Benjamin Netanyahu to tell Germany whatever he wants and that Germany will consider this what we didn't hear from the German chancel also when he spoke in charlian that Germany will give whatever Israel requests but that it would whatever is requested would be considered now initially it looked like it requested ammunition for some of it um warships that request was actually withdrawn and there are a lot of practical reasons behind that um Israel is very much armed with its own um Hardware but also mainly American um military hardware so that is the first reference point I think there are very practical reasons behind that so it wasn't a good fit is that what you're saying well that is what I'm being told by military experts but I'm not a military expert by any means but this is that is not widely expected here but full political support is expected and I think we saw in that interaction there were no questions taken um that um also the German chancellor who is there to basically show solidarity and reassure uh an Israeli Prime Minister who clearly you can you can see under how much pressure he is at this very moment in time to prove that this state can protect its citizens as well um that Germany is firmly at the side of Israel while at the same time maintain maintaining international law and him basically calling for the protection of civilian life which let's translate it into non-political speak uh means to at least minimize civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip um more than a million citizens of Gaza have been called upon to move to the other end of the country it is unclear how many lives that will actually cost simply asking them to move uh so there is an underlying tension uh within this that Germany wants to maintain its role as a mediator and we're also seeing the German Chancellor travel on to Egypt um to make the case for humanitarian Aid to go into Gaza at the same time so I think we will observe over the coming days and weeks um what that commitment of uh Israeli security being a fundamental principle of German policy means in Practical terms and whether trying to ensure Israeli security might also mean that Germany doesn't always agree completely with what action Israel chooses to take as we are all awaiting for that ground um offensive to start yeah thank you so much for joining us to break that down that is DW's Chief political editor Michaela kufner we really appreciate your time today now Hamas which the EU uh the United States and some Arab states label as a terrorist group abducted nearly 200 people during their massacre in Israel the mother of one French Israeli hostage has made a desperate plea for her daughter's release I didn't know if she's dead or alive until yesterday all I knew is that she's May might be kidnapped um I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home she only went to a party to a festival party to have some fun and now she's in Gaza it's difficult testimony to hear there I want to bring in DW's senior International correspondent of funny faar reporting for us from Tel Aviv funny Israel is in a difficult position here isn't it um how can it ensure the safety of hostages that are believed to being be being held in Gaza while it is current ly bombing the Gaza Strip Israel is basically facing a huge dilemma here because when we are talking about Hamas militants we're talking about a vast Labyrinth of at least an estimated 400 kilomet long tunnel system like an underground city the entrances to these tunnels are basically close to schools close to hospitals in a very densely populated area so the goal of Israel trying to root out Hamas but also obviously rescue those hostages and estimate at 199 hostages that's the current number that Israel is working with is a huge challenge nobody knows how that's going to work if you in fact look back at the history 2014 the last Gaza War Israel was not able to uh root out and eliminate Hamas militants so how is it going to work this time now what the US is trying to do is influence Israel trying to have an impact with regard to how to create safe zones with the help of Israel but also how to make sure that it gets into gaza's STP because so far nobody's getting out from the Gaza Strip pretty much the only possible opening to the world would be the rougher border crossing with Egypt but that also remains closed and as we are speaking by the hour people there in Gaza Strip are really very much running out of the very Basics and I'm talking also about the basics in terms of fuel that you need to actually go from the northern part of Gaza Strip to the South where these safe zones are to be established but there are no concrete details here no concrete plans that have been shared and while all of this is happening all this diplomacy of course that question also remains just when that ground offensive is going to start and how that is going to cause another consequence for all those people who are basically trapped in Gaza Strip yes lacking food Fuel and water um and Aid agency desperate to get that in I want to come back to the issue of the hostages as we've seen there are many foreigners as well among the hostages that have been abducted what role are foreign governments playing in trying to secure their release Germany for example represented here by German Chancellor Schultz today uh who also is urging to uh for the release of for example German hostages but obviously old hostages what they're trying to do is trying to explore who has most information and contacts with Hamas militants and this is where actually Qatar plays a significant role in fact early on Qatar has offered uh the help to someone negotiate one has to understand that Qatar is basically the main financial backer of hamus Militan so so they do get kind of an an an an an a leverage here at least it seems that if somebody can help release the hostages then it will probably go through the efforts of Qatar but that being said and you may see all the protesters here behind me asking for the release of those hostages making sure they do not become a collateral damage as a uh ground offensive is lo looming nobody knows whether uh the release is going to be possible with or without Qatar at this point nobody even knows what the state of this hostages is thank you so much for reporting that is DW's funny Fatar in Tel Aviv and that is your news update at this hour if you want more
