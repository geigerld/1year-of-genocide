reports from the US are suggesting the Biden Administration paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week now according to a quoted Us official this was over concerns that Israel would move ahead with its planned ground assault on Rafa in southern Gaza the details of the decision are emerging after Israeli tanks moved in to take control of the gazen side of the Rua border crossing with Egypt the incursion has left the prospect of a new ceasefire deal between Israel and mass hanging in the balance makeshift shelters in a sea of rubble and debris KH yunas is a ruin yet thousands of Palestinians have begun to return after Israel ordered them to evacuate parts of the Southernmost city of Rafa Israeli forces have seized control of the Rafa Crossing on the border with Egypt the attack came just hours after Hamas says it accepted a ceasefire proposal one that Israel says was unacceptable I thought the Hamas proposal was intended to prevent the entry of our forces into Rafa it did not happen as the war cabinet unanimously determined the Hamas proposal is very far from Israel's necessary requirements the attack was not the full-scale ground offensive that many have feared but in seizing the checkpoint Israeli forces have altered all humanitarian Aid passing through the crossing the two main arteries forgetting Aid into Gaza is currently choked off indeed this morning is one of the darkest in this s month long nightmare with famine already spreading across Gaza the loss of Aid is devastating for its civilians ceasefire negotiations are ongoing but they stand on a knife's edge we are at a decisive moment for the Palestinian and Israeli people and for the fate of the entire region an agreement between the government of Israel and the leadership of Hamas is essential to stop the unbearable suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and of the hostages and their families almost half of gaza's population fled their homes to shelter in Rafa now they must flee again but with so much of the territory in Ruins many are losing hope I'm tired of life because there is no life in Gaza Gaza has no future when are our children going to learn if the schools are closed Gaza has no health facilities and no hospitals what kind of life is this all eyes are now on the negotiation in Cairo as mediators attempt to salvage whatever remains of a possible ceasefire okay let's cross straight to our correspondent in Jerusalem Tanya kma Tanya um so Israel is saying that it's conducting a limited scope operation in Rafa what more do we know at this point well there have been reports reports uh um that you know there have been air bombardments across the Gaza Strip in different location but of course very much is centered on the eastern part of rafar in the Jan neighborhood or neighborhood the uh Village of huzar their bombardments and uh what we hearing a heavy fighting going on there uh while people were told of course to evacuate from that area uh since Monday and to move to what the Israeli Army uh described as the expanded milit uh expanded humanitarian Zone I talked to some people here in the past days some have left immediately they said you know we don't want to uh uh stay here this is risky but some have also said you know they don't really know where to go they have a large family they don't see themselves sitting or being uh in a tent again and they simply don't also feel safe uh to move so some have also not left to this protected area uh but to kanun or further uh to uh the middle area and another concern of course especially for the eight agencies are the crossings we heard it in the report um Israel has said they are controlling now the Palestinian side of the uh rafar Crossing that was the only Gateway of course for many Palestinians to leave in a limited number but also the major hub for a to come in as well as the Kum Shalom Crossing there was a mortar attack on Sunday which killed four Israeli soldiers since then both Crossings are close so it's very hard to get any humanitarian Aid in in the South okay and Meanwhile we're hearing reports that the US paused a shipment of bombs to Israel because of its concerns over uh an Israeli offensive in Rafa what what more can you tell us about those reports yeah there were reports in the American Media and that is based on an American unnamed American official who has confirmed that the United States has indeed opposed a shipment of bombs and that shipment would have included about uh 3,500 bombs some of them the 2,000 uh bombs which are as uh you know analysts say very um problematic when it comes to uh uh bombs in a densely uh populated area as we've seen across the Gaza Strip but also if they would be used in a full incursion uh on rafar so you can see here the pressure is piling up on Israel as the US United States and other countries have said they don't want to see a full incursion uh in rafar but there's also of course domestically some pressure on the United States because this week it's actually uh the US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin he has to submit a report to Congress and that report has to deal whether Israel has violated humanitarian international law while using Us weapons in Gaza and also whether um Israel has impeded on us humanitarian efforts in Gaza okay and just brief briefly Tanya if you could ceasefire talks are continuing in Cairo do we know where the negotiations stand well we understand that Israel has sent a delegation but it's described here as a lowlevel delegation of Israeli officials with a very limited mandate Now talks will continue as you said but it's unclear how both sides will actually Bridge the gaps and we heard from Hamas you know they had agreed to an agreement Israel had said this is rul and Hamas had said you know they want to see the full withdrawal from Gaza they want to see a return of residents to to the north they want to see a permanent end to the uh to the war and this is something Israel has always rejected so we understand that today uh the CIA director uh Bill Burns will also come to Israel to talk to his counterpart to talk uh to um the uh um Israeli Prime Minister but there's a lot of pressure here domestically uh from uh people they want to see a deal they want to see the hostages being brought home but also for prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu who has a lot of pressure within his own cabinet to continue the war all right DW correspondent in Jerusalem Tanya kma Tanya thank you now K mohari is a journalist joining us now from the Egyptian Capital Cairo where those ceasefire negotiations are taking place welcome kareim how high are the hopes of achieving a deal this time well uh that they're still speaking we don't hear much about it is maybe a good sign there is only really one official statement from one of the negotiators a spokesperson of the C foreign Ministry who says there are positive there's progress but there are still gaps to be filled now the rest what we hear is from media reports that are somehow leaked from both sides for example Hamas is saying that they got you because because they agreed to this uh exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners because they got some kind of us guarantees that this will be with accompanied with uh the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and a longer term ceasefire on the other side the Israelis are saying that some of the sticking points are for example that Hamas is demanding that they have the full say in who is going to be released from the Palestinians from the Israeli prisons Israel has no say in this matter the Israelis want to have a veto power here and there's also talk about the the first phase how many hostages are released now we have first it was 33 now the word is 18 it seems to be like for Hamas this first phase is not the important phase it's come out kind of a confident building measure and the most important phase for them is then the second phase and then in the second phase they really want to have guarantees that there will be some kind of permanent ceasefire or as the Americans are saying sustained calm okay and while these talks uh are ongoing what are you hearing from people who are inside Gaza in Rafa despair I would say I mean lots of people you know people were displaced multiple times some of them there's a family that was displaced nine times um people run out of money people don't know where to go when when they arrive at the new places they see that they're absolutely not fit to receive so many people and a lot of talk already was before here about the humanitarian situation because the crossings are closed it's also the other way around not only that there's no Eight coming in for example there can be no injured right now coming out which happened before with any seriously injured went out to Egypt to be uh um um treated there and that's especially difficult because uh um there's only one remaining Hospital in Rafa which is the Kuwait hospital and other medical facilities were ordered to um evacuate by the Israeli Army so also the situation of the Health Care system in Rafa is pretty Dire kareim El goari in Cairo thank you so much kareim for your analysis there you're welcome
