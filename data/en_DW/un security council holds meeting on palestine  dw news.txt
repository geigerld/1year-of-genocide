floor to miss Rosemary dealo Mr President members of the security Council and increasing tensions in the Middle East the devastating Israeli attack on the elban school in Gaza City which prompted this

of life in Gaza following another attack on a school Sheltering hundreds of displaced Palestinian families according to Israel the IDF targeted a Hamas Command Center in a mosque inside the school

proportionality and precautions in attack must be upheld at all times also yesterday Hamas announced the killing of a hostage and serious injury of two other Hamas others by Hamas militants while in captivity in Gaza both sides have stated they are looking into the incidents Mr President with hostilities continuing across the strip including in the north around Gaza City in the middle area in con Yunis and in and around Rafa the situation remains catastrophic for civilians no place is safe in Gaza yet Civ I Ians continue to be ordered to evacuate to ever shrinking areas my colleague director Doon from OA will brief you shortly in more detail regarding the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza 10 months since the start of the war the threat of further Regional escalation is more palpable and chilling than ever exchanges of fire across the Blue Line have continued nearly daily since I last brief on 31 July numerous projectiles have been fired from Lebanon across the Blue Line causing damage to buildings and bushfires in open areas the IDF has responded with strikes across the blue line into Southern Lebanon uncrewed aerial Vehicles crossing the blue line from Southern Lebanon have also continued an IDF base was hit across the Blue Line while yet while another base was hit near naria and North norn Israel an open area in naria city was also struck Mr President I urge continued attention to the worsening situation and ongoing violence in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem on 3 August the IDF said it conducted two air strikes on a Hamas cell in taram killing nine Palestinians who the IDF said were planning to conduct an attack inside Israel separate IDF operations in Janine and tubas early last week also killed another 16 Palestinians on 11 August a shooting attack claimed by Hamas killed one Israeli civilian and wounded another in the northern Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank another Palestinian shooting attack now cilia reportedly injured one Israeli and two Palestinians the as salant who was claimed by Hamas as an alassan brigades Commander was subsequently killed by ISF Mr president if the slide towards an even greater catastrophe is to be halted the parties must end all escalatory rhetoric and actions I reiterate the secretary General's call for all to work vigorously towards Regional deescalation in the interest of long-term peace and stability I welcome efforts by Egypt Qatar and the United States to bring both sides to conclude a deal to bring about a ceasefire the release of hostages and desperately needed humanitarian relief as the leaders of Egypt katar and the United States emphasized in their joint statement on 8 August and I quote there is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay end quote their call for immediate relief to the people of Gaza and the hostages and their families must be heated I urge all parties to prioritize the protection of civilians and promptly conclude this deal as endorsed by the security Council in resolution 2735 the United Nations is committed to supporting all efforts towards this goal and remains in close contact with the relevant parties Mr President The Killing destruction and suffering in Gaza must end the hostages must be United with their families but even as efforts to achieve these goals continue we cannot lose sight of what we consider indisputable in the absence of a clear path towards a future in which Israelis see their legitimate needs for security materialize and Palestinians see their legitimate aspir erations for a fully independent viable and sovereign state realized lasting peace in the Middle East will remain elusive thank you Mr President I thank Miss car Deo for uh briefing I now give the floor to Miss Lisa dotin thank you Mr President members of the security Council here we are again in the aftermath of yet another horrendous episode in this brutal war in Gaza like under Secretary General Dar Carlo were deeply horrified by the strike on alabin school in Adar by Israeli forces on Saturday the school was Sheltering several hundred displaced families many of whom had moved there because of recent evacuation orders and the strike was conducted during Dawn prayers initial report suggests this was one of the deadliest attacks on a school Sheltering displaced people since the start of this conflict tragically this is far from an isolated in incident indeed such attacks appear to be occurring with increasing frequency the most recent in incidents include three schools hit within 48 hours between 3 and four August and two schools hit on 8 August all in Gaza City with alabin on Saturday the latest such attack according to ohchr this is at least the 21st strike on a school that has been serving as a shelter recorded since Four July this year scor scores of people have been killed in these strikes among them women and children Mr President sadly these large scale incidents are only some of the Myriad of ways in which this horrendous conflict is causing unbearable suffering and Devastation unremitting violence in Gaza has now killed almost 40,000 Palestinians and injured more than 90,000 others according to the Gaza Ministry of Health some 10,000 people remain unaccounted for and are thought to be buried under the rubble and as of 9 August an estimated 115 hostages remain captive in Gaza despite repeated demands for their release including hostages who've been declared dead and whose remains are in Gaza the health situation Gaza remains critical and the Health Care system is barely functional providing brave but limited support for the injured and the sick for the women and childbirth and against rapidly spreading disease thousands of patients in critical condition are on waiting list for medical evacuations more than 60% of residential buildings and 65% of the road Network have been damaged or destroyed according to un recent analysis in just two weeks more than a quarter of a million people have been displaced often on multiple occasions evacuation orders supposedly for civilian security are clearly having the opposite outcome civilians are repeatedly asked to evacuate to areas where Essentials for their survival are absent they're repeatedly being killed and injured in the very places they've been told were safe to go shelters and displacement camps are reportedly used for military purposes by Palestinian armed groups exposing those Sheltering there to terrible danger overcrowding in these places is putting immense strain on already severely stretched Water Sanitation and hygiene facilities acute respiratory infections diarrheal illnesses acute ja syndrome and skin infections are all surging and very worryingly with school immunization programs practically impossible polio looms as a new threat after six circulating polio virus strains were detected in environmental samples in June as a matter of urgency health workers must be allowed to carry out an immunization campaign this war is destroying lives dreams and Futures more than half a million students have lost an entire academ mic year with 39,000 students missing their final exams even if this war were to end today we estimate that at least 8 and 10 schools would require Rehabilitation and we must not discount the immense emotional and psychological trauma this war has had on children indeed people of all ages trauma they will carry for the rest of their lives it Bears repeating there's no protection of civilians in Gaza alongside the Relentless Mass displacement within Gaza many thousands of Palestinians have left and many more are trying to as this conflict persists and lives are threatened daily civilians must be allowed to seek protection those displaced must also be guaranteed the right to voluntarily return what we're seeing in Gaza is a result of a war waged with pitiful if any regard for the requirements of international law I share the secretary General's and others deep concern about violations of international humanitarian law being committed throughout this conflict Mr President in the middle of the spiraling catastrophe in Gaza the humanitarian Community doggedly continues efforts to mount an effective response we do what we can to increase food assistance provide education support and boost Hospital capacity efforts are also ongoing to avert the spread of polio and Senior un officials continue discussions with st stakeholders including senior Israeli officials to increase the flow of Aid into the Gaza Strip and improve conditions for the delivery on the ground however as things stand access constraints and high levels of insecurity severely hamper the humanitarian response Aid in triaza has more than haved since the Rafa ground operation began and Rafa Crossing was abruptly closed in early May new limits imposed by Israeli Authorities on bringing cash to Gaza are significantly limiting the resources available for operations fuel shortages mean Water Supplies have fallen as low as 2 lers per person per day far below the 15 liters required organized crime and looting along the Route used by humanitarians dispatching cargo from Kum Shalom Crossing continue to hinder Aid delivery access to people in need remains a challenge the increase in bureaucratic and administrative impediments such as delays in Visa issuance and renewals for broader Operational Support and management is severely impacting the response and our concerns for the safety of Staff keep growing with attacks on or near Aid vehicles that have been coordinated On The Rise recently within a 12-day period there's been four shooting incidents involving un convoys including on a vehicle carrying children on their way to be reunited with their father Nos and the Palestinian red cresant all report similar attacks the result is that hundreds of thousands of people are not getting the life-saving humanitarian assistance they so desperately need Mr President how much longer can this continue how many more tragedies such as the one in altab beim school must happen before action is taken can this Council look at the children the people of Gaza and all those affected by this war in the eye as humanitarian workers have to do every single day and swear that no stone has been left unturned to end their suffering the Urgent requirements so often repeated remain the same first an immediate cessation of hostilities and sustained ceasefire secondly strict adherence to International humanitarian law by all sides this entails releasing all hostages it also entails protecting civilians and meeting their essential needs including by ensuring the unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza as ordered by the international court of justice including through unra and lastly we have said before in this context all member states must use all of their leverage to prevent and stop violations of international humanitarian law including through diplomatic and economic pressure and conditioning arms exports on compliance with the rules of war and cooperation in combating impunity we must remain we must remember that this is now one of the several conflicts in Gaza over the years which humanitarians have had to respond to conflict at the population in Gaza was never afforded the ability to recover from or repair the past 10 months have destroyed what little hope for a future existed for any surviving child I urge this Council and all member states to use your influence to protect civilians and bring an end to this conflict and its intolerable toll it's imperative that Mutual Security and Lasting peace is pursued so that hope can be restored so that civilians there can enjoy the hope that we take for granted and the hope that they have never experienced thank you Mr President I thank M dtin for her briefing I now give the floor to those council members who wish to make statement I give the floor to the representative of Algeria Mr President I thank USG Mrs Rosemary De Carlo and OA director Mrs liisa dton for their briefing I will start my statement by the same question of Mrs Bon how long is it going to be yet another ineffective Vain and hopeless meeting of the security Council are we going to count and count the number of death in Gaza the answer is simple this is neither what the council is des designed for nor what the International Community expect from us more importantly this is not how the council should address the Palestinians plea the Palestinians Quest For Justice the Palestinian right to exist our Council has the legal and moral primary responsibility to act and to act firmly to shoulder its mandate in preserving International Peace and security Mr President for 300 and 11 day our Council has been constantly fooled and disregarded while an entire population has been subjected to a collective punishment last Saturday the world woke up to yet another horrific horrific Bloodshed after the Israeli occupying power targeted deliber deliberately a school in a Dar neighborhood in Gaza it was the third School bombed in two days it was a civilian structure Sheltering civilian by the testimony of the International Community our Secretary General said it clearly the school was Sheltering hundreds of displaced Palestinian families the eurom made human humanitarian right monitor also stressed that the school was nothing but a dilapitated place that hundreds of families have taken refuge in this testimonies of one of the Survivor is harrowing a father said that he has been given 18 kilogram 18 kilogram of body parts and he buried them as the body of his young son President this heinous Massacre of a daraj and the previous ones wouldn't have been possible without the generous financial and Military assistance freely provided to the Israel aggressive more than 100 innocent like lives were s sacrificed in ad Dar among them women and children in addition to the nearly 40,000 40,000 Palestinian martys so far were these martys not human with their dreams with their hopes as as we all do is the council's role limited to keeping a record of lost lives again the answer is simple our Council must and now fulfill its responsibilities and honor its commitment if its responsibility to tackle the root cause of the Palestinian question which is the illegal occupation of the Palestinian land it's a responsibility to hold the occupying power accountable accountable using all legal means and including sanctions yes sanction mechanism third its commitment to achieve a just and Lasting peace in the Middle East and to prevent the dangerous escalation provoked by the Israeli occupying power Mr President the Israeli occupying continue to defy the very commitment of this Council made in resolution 2735 calling for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire in Gaza immediate ceasefire in Gaza this resolution jeopardized is seriously jeopardized by the int intensifying aggression of the Israeli occupying power against Gaza Algeria warns against this continuing sabotage of effort made by the United States Egypt and Qatar to implement this resolution urgently effectively in this regard Algeria Express again its support for the mediation effort made by these three countries there is no room for delaying or over complicating negotiation by adding new conditionalities or new demand engaging in good faith in the is initiative of President Biden is Paramount to achieving the long awaited ceasefire Mr President for the sake of Humanity's value we must act now our inaction is costing life it's and jeopardizing the destiny of whole people the Palestinian people I thank you I thank the representative of Algeria for their statement I give the floor to the representative of Slovenia thank you thank you very much Mr President and thank you for organizing this surgent meeting as requested by Algeria uh I also want to uh thank uh under Secretary General De Carlo as well as director Doon for their briefings today uh Mr President this Saturday the world was once again Shell Shocked by another devastating air strike in Gaza one of the deadliest months yet Slovenia strongly condemns the Israeli attack on alabin school pool in central Gaza City in complete disregard for the faith of Palestinian lives there are serious claims that Hamas is embedding itself among the civilian population in civilian infrastructure we strongly condemn such actions Hamas must stop sacrificing their fellow Palestinians and putting them in Mortal Danger on the other hand we are horrified by the serious of military attacks on school that we have witnessed recently we repeat our call for full respect of international law including security Council resolution 2601 just yesterday we marked 75 years of Geneva conventions which are being seriously tested these days in Gaza and in other complexs Slovenia is Gravely concerned about the potential for tensions to spiral further out of control into a broader regional conflict with devastating consequences Beyond gaza's borders we call for maximum restraint by All actors in the region to prevent us from going down a road of no return there is an urgent need to refrain from further attacks unthreatening rhetorics colleagues the resolution this Council needs to focus on as a priority is 2735 we express our full support to the m mediators and their call on both sides to conclude talks on a CIS fire and the release of hostages and prisoners in this regard we call on both sides to resume the negotiations this week we call on both sides to commit to concluding the deal without delay it has been more than two months since the council demanded a ceasefire we have been patiently waiting for the implementation of our resolutions meanwhile we have been witnessing a continuation of deadly attacks and civilian casualties and we have been observing Palestinians being chased across Gaza there is no more time to spare there are no more innocent lives to be wasted we once again propose that the council establishes a clear deadline for the conclusion of the deal in in this interim period a pause in the fighting should be observed a pause that would allow for humanitarian Aid to be delivered at scale and for polio vaccinations to be administered safely we welcome the efforts of who UNICEF and unra in outlining plans for two rounds of polio vaccination if a deal is however not reached this councel should without delay discuss how to ensure compliance with each its resolutions in the face of immense suffering in Gaza and indeed as director dton said we should not leave any stone and turn Mr President yesterday a journalist asked me how many more briefings this Council needs to start changing the situation in Gaza indeed we are receiving briefings so that we can take action we adopted four resolutions but never followed up on their implementation the time for Action is now it is time for ceasefire to be finally reached or else it is time for this Council to ensure it finally happens thank Slovenia for their statement I give the mosambik Mr President mmek wishes to commend Algeria for requesting this meeting we praise sier Leon presidency for convening this urgent briefing on the situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian question we are regretful to miss Rosary De Carlo and Secretary General and Miss Lisa doen a representative of what for their briefing to the council Mr President the ongoing conflict in the Middle East has been causing devastating consequences and unacceptable toll on children women and the civilian gazan population at Large the latest killings took the lives of more than 100 Palestinians it is imperative that urgent efforts be undertaken in order to address and stop these killings we are deeply concerned over the Israel's continuous air strikes against civilian infrastructures that include schools hospitals and shelters that's inflicting on them severe damage in this connection we wish to remind once again that attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure constitute a grave violation of international law and international humanitarian law and this is particularly disturbing as we celebrate this year the 75th anniversary of the Geneva conventions we call on all those who sincerely believe in the obligations arising from the premises of responsibility to protect to ensure that this Doctrine is swiftly and coherently applied to Gaza situation on the other hand indiscriminate military attacks can only aggravate Regional conflicts and Trigger new conflicts that will gain a larger Dimension unimaginable implication for regional and International Peace and security could ensue given the gravity of the situation it is imperative that all parties involved particularly Israel comply with International legal norms and agreements in particular they must abide by all orders judgments enacted by the international court of justice on the matter we reiterate our call for an immediate end to this war we urged parties to implement without reservation and without further delay all Security Council resolution that we have taken on this conflict as advocates of Peace security and humanitarian Aid it is crucial that we undersood the importance of raising awareness about this is heartbreaking events described by our briefers Mr President we hold the view that the resolving this conflict in the Gaza strep and Palestine requires approach encompassing negotiations this approach must must include plans for economic development humanitarian Aid reconstruction of Gaza and Regional collaboration these are the necessary steps that will P the way towards a lasting and sustainable peace we therefore embrace the move for a concerted global action to end Israel's military operation in Gaza which is expanding exponentially with the untold suffering of the people in this context mosambi reaffirms its commitment to supporting all diplomatic efforts and AED at finding sustainable solution to the protracted conflict in the Gaza Street and the Palestine we reiterate our full support for the ongoing diplomatic efforts by the United States of America Egypt Qatar and other Arab countries as well as the International Community at large in pursuit of a lasting the Gaza Street Mr President mosambi remain stf first in our recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to selfdetermination political Independence and sovereignty as described by the charter of the United Nations and the dictates of international law we reiterate the urgent need for the implementation of a two-state solution a solution based on the existence of two independent and sovereign states Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace security both as members of the United Nations I thank you Mr President I thank the representative of mozek for their statement I give the floor to the representative of the United Kingdom thank you president I thank under Secretary General D Caro and director Dalton from AER for their briefings president the UK is appalled by the Israeli military strike on alaban school where Palestinian civilians were shelter Sheltering the UN tells us this strike killed dozens of Palestinians many of whom are reported to be women and children sadly this was not the only Israeli strike on schools turned shelters we have seen there were 17 such attacks in July alone Palestinians have nowhere safe to turn 86% of Gaza is now under evacuation orders and in recent days we've seen some of the largest orders to date impacting tens of thousands of people displaced multiple times over families are forced to move back and forth back and forth but with none of these places offering the safety or security they so desperately need on top of that some of these orders have been issued by Israel in the middle of the night with minimal notice to allow civilians to flee Israel must ensure it complies with its obligations under International humanitarian law to protect civilians the UK is also horrified by the reports of sexual violence and abuse faced by the hostages in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli DET Det attention many of whom are children Hamas must release all the hostages immediately Hamas must also stop endangering civilians and Israel must Grant the icrc access to prisoners immediately and ensure accountability if anyone is found to be responsible for the abuse of Deton we have also heard completely unacceptable rhetoric from Israeli ministers relating to the mistreatment of Deton and starvation of civilians in Gaza we call upon the government of Israel to retract and condemn these remarks international law could not be more clear systemic mistreatment of Deton and the international starvation of civilians are war crimes president another deadly threat is on the horizon for the people of Gaza they stand on the precipice of a polio outbreak with 600,000 children under the age of eight in desperate need of vaccinations we call on the parties to cooperate urgently with the World Health Organization to facilitate vaccine rollouts and ensure the safety of workers we call on Israel to allow unfettered Aid access into Gaza and to put in place an effective Decon deconfliction mechanism to ensure Aid can be delivered safely finally president I reiterate the UK's call for regional deescalation as my prime minister made clear in his call with Iranian president pesan last night thanks to the tireless efforts of the US Qatar and Egypt there is a Ceasar deal on the table for Gaza my prime minister joined with his French and German counterparts to urge the parties to resume discussions on 15 August and get the deal done we need an immediate ceasefire we must get the hostages out get much more Aid in and move quickly towards a two-state solution with a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable and Sovereign Palestinian State I thank you I thank the representative of United Kingdom for their statement I give the China president I thank Aleria for requesting meeting thank you to car and director mton for their briefings Israel's air strike on the T School in Gaza last week claimed around 100 innocent civilan lives China strongly condemns this attack civilians and civilian infrastructure must not be the target of mil operations this is a red line under the international humanarian law attacking in broad daylight a school where a large number of siblings are seeking shelter again and again is a heinous act the month millions of people in Gaza and have SE their home destroyed their loved ones separated they been forced to move from place to place in search of a corner of Peace only to be M with indiscriminate bombardment and death that could Beall them at any moment as we speak nowhere is safe in Gaza in a place was declared a soall safe Zone by Israel the people there have been forced to flee in the face of newborn the desate people OFA want to know where is the end of the war and where is the Hope for survival an immediate un ceasefire is what the people of Gaza year for it is also the overwhelming consensus of the interal Community two months ago when pushing for the security Council 2735 the US claimed that Israel had accepted a ceasefire agreement but the reality is quite the opposite instead of credible signs of Israel's commitment to a ceasefire what we see is ever expending military operations and adverising civilian casualties the us as the largest supplier of weapons has enough influence over Israel we hope that the US will take a sincere and responsible actions to push Israel to stop its military operations in Gaza as soon as possible and to stop slaughtering civilians president the humanitarian disaster in aaza has continued to worsen hunger and disease are spreading recently a high ranking is politician described it as just unmoral to Star 2 million people in Gaza suching remarks are totally unacceptable hunger must not be weaponized humanitarian issues must not be politicized civilian lives must not be trivialized as sparking chips China urges Israel to fulfill its I obligations by opening all border crossings and guaranteeing rapid and safe access for humanitarian supplies at the World Health Organization is conducting a polio vaccination program for children in Gaza which is crucial to stemming the thread of infectious diseases and protecting Children's Health Israel is obliged to protect the safety and freedom of movement of the medical workers involved the increased volatility of the situation in West Bank is worrisome we are greatly concerned about the incidence of sexual AB by Israeli soldiers against paltin DET needs we call for investigations and accountability China urges Israel to immediately seize all settlement activities effectively curb the intensifying settler violence and stop eroding the basis of the two-state solution we reiterate that the two-state solution is the only viable way to resolve the palestin Israel issue China supports the establishment of independent state and other case of a larger more authoritative and more effective International Peace conference president they Fallout of the Gaza conflict is spreading ever faster the situation in the Middle East is Hing in the balance nevertheless irresponsible provocation and adventurism continue unabated we are deeply worried about this China reiterates that it ke to avoiding the deration and escalation of the situ lies in achieving a comprehensive and durable SE in Gaza without delay China ready to work tly with International Community to end the fighting in Gaza Elevate the humanitarian catastrophe Implement two State solution achieving long-term peace and stability and Security in the Middle East thank you president I thank the representative of China for their statement I give the floor to the representative of United States thank you Mr President thank you also under Secretary General Dar Carlo and director Dalton for your very sobering briefing we continue to support the United Nations vital albe it difficult to implement humanitarian efforts in Gaza the United States is deeply concerned about reports of Civilian casualties following the August 10th strike by the IDF on the compound in Gaza that included a school and a mosque Sheltering desperate displaced people including women and children we have raised our concerns with Israel and while they indicated they were targeting senior senior officials from Hamas and Palestinian Jihad they have an obligation to do everything possible under International humanitarian law to protect civilians we mourn every civilian lost in this horrific incident and in this conflict but this much we do know and must be acknowledged Hamas continues to gather and continues to operate out of schools with no regard for the well-being of civilians Israel has a right to pursue Hamas Israel has a right to respond to threats but how it does that matters we've said repeatedly and consistently that Israel must must take measures to minimize civilian harm colleagues I cannot stress enough President Biden's view that it is time to bring immediate relief to the long-suffering people in Gaza and the long-suffering hostages and their families the best way to do that is a ceasefire in Gaza with a hostage deal the United States alongside Qatar and Egypt has worked tirelessly for months to forge the framework agreement on the table with only the details of implementations to be concluded a framework based on the principles endorsed by this Council in resolution 2735 simply put the deal needs to get done now now as President Biden emphasized in a statement last week with leaders of Qatar in Egypt and I quote there there is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay it is time to release the hostages begin the ceasefire and implement this agreement unquote we've called on both sides to resume urgent discussion on Thursday August 15th in Doha or Cairo to close all remaining gaps and commence implementation of the deal without further delay as mediators we are prepared to present a final bridging proposal one that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties we welcome the statements of support for this effort such as the one issued by Algeria over the weekend and we call on every member of this Council to speak with one voice to press samas to participate in the discussions on August 15th and for both sides to agree to implement the deal on the table without further conditions or delays a durable ceasefire could accelerate efforts to restore basic services including electricity and water and sanitation bringing much needed relief to Palestinian civilians many of whom have been displaced multiple times it could enable an urgently needed vaccination campaign to stop the spread of polio and it would facilitate the release of all hostages held by Hamas including eight Americans and citizens from many other countries we also have been clear that a ceasefire and Gaza could help enable diplomatic efforts to restore calm along the blue line and reduce Regional tensions indeed from the start of this conflict between Hamas and Israel the United States has worked to avoid a situation in which the fighting in Gaza spirals into a broader regional conflict four months ago exactly on April 13th the United States worked closely with Israel and our partners in the region to repel Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel and Stave off a broader conflict now we once again in a moment of heightened threat consequently the United States has taken needed precautionary steps including moving an aircraft carrier group and additional air assets to the region so that should the situation arise again we are prepared to defend Israel and US military personnel in the region against any threats but let me be clear our deployment of additional military assets are not a prediction of what is to come a broader regional conflict is not inevitable the United States overall goal remains to turn the temperature down in the region deter and defend against any future attacks and avoid regional conflict that starts with finalizing a deal for an immediate ceasefire with hostage release in Gaza we need to get this over the finish line again we urge every member of this Council to say clearly and unequivocally that it is time to finalize and implement this agreement thank you Mr United States for their statement I give the floor to the representative of Japan thank you Mr President I also thank USG diaro and director Doon for briefings the number of Civilian casualities and the degree of suffering we have seen in Gaza for more than 300 days of conflict are unbearable and distressing today this urgent meeting is convened following yet another grave incident Japan expresses its deep concern over the loss of many civilian lives and injuries caused by the Israeli air strikes on Al tabin school last Saturday it is appalling that numerous Siberian casualities have occurred in schools and hospitals all parties must strictly abide by relevant principles of international law especially the protection of civilians we urge Israel to make every effort to avoid civilian harm Mr President Gaza is truly in agony nearly 1.9 million people are forcibly displaced due to the repeated evacuation order by Israel fleeing again and again to places where life is very tenable Japan is deeply worried about the significant shortage of food medicine Fuel and other basic necessities in Gaza we strongly condemn the deplorable remark by an Israeli cabinet minister starving more than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza cannot be justified the detection of polio and the spread of such diseases is a man-made problem stemming from the collapse of the waste management system and is another matter of serious concern The raer Crossing must be reopened and the safety of Aid workers must be assured at all times Israel must lift all imped MS to humanitarian assistance not only to provide the minimum of survival but also to protect human dignity Mr President the still unfolding tragedy confirms that three things that this Council called for in resolution 2735 must be achieved now without any further delay namely an immediate ceasefire the release of all remaining host hostages and the expansion of Aid delivery across Gaza at scale in this vein Japan appreciates the vigorous diplomatic Push by the United States Egypt and Qatar to close all remaining gaps to finalize the deal on the ceasefire and hostage release we strongly support the recent joint leader statement and the effort made by the three countries and we urge all parties is concerned especially Hamas to constructively engage at the proposed meetings later this week and immediately work towards concluding the deal this Council and the entire International Community must remain United to end this crisis immediately Japan will play and Japan will play its part in close cooperation with relevant stakeholders I thank you Japan for their statement I give the Guana Mr President thank you for convening this meeting in response to the timely request made by the delegation of Algeria I also thank under Secretary General De Carlo and Miss Dalton of Ocha for the information provided Mr President the attacks on the alaban school are part of an ongoing pattern employed by the Israeli Defense Force since the beginning of the war in Gaza it is a pattern characterized by a complete disregard for the humanitarian principle of proportionality and it results over and over again in the killing of a high number of civilians on the pretext of eliminating one or more military targets the alaban incident joins a growing list of similar incidents and one can expect this pattern to continue unless there are meaningful measures to stop the Israelis from continuing the senseless Massacre of the Palestinian people Guyana condemns in the strongest terms the ongoing violations of international law including International humanitarian law that manifests in the targeting of civilians and civilian INF infrastructure we call on Israel and all parties to the conflict to abide by their obligations on the international law and to end the hostilities against the people of Palestine Mr President 10 months of Israel's unrelenting and unprecedented assault against the Palestinian people in Gaza have created a tragedy of such cruel proportions that it is difficult to find anything comparable in mod history the death toll is approaching 40,000 with women and children over represented in this number people are starving and living in the most inhumane conditions imaginable with virtually no access to medicine and Health Care polio has now been detected in waste water in Gaza placing unvaccinated Children at Risk again it is the children of Gaza that will suffer the most if an outbreak is not prevented what else can we expect though when there is one toilet for 600 people living in shelters council members are all aware that the World Health Organization is ready to send more than 1 million polio vaccines to Gaza targeting 600,000 children in the words of the director General and I quote the who needs absolute freedom of movement for health workers and medical equipment to carry out these complex Le Lex operations safely and effectively a ceasefire or at least days of Tranquility during preparation and delivery of the vaccination campaigns are required to protect children in Gaza from polio end of quote Guyana supports the who's plans to tackle this problem and appeals to the Israeli government to provide the relevant authorizations and to ensure the conditions to vaccinate to facilitate the vaccination campaign this is a humanitarian imperative and a legal and moral obligation Mr President Guyana has watched with Keen horror the Israeli strategy of making Gaza a thorough fear of Destruction the images coming out of Gaza shows a moonscape yet what those images do not show is the problem of unexploded ordinances which according to one commentator makes Gaza a literal ticking Time Bomb even after the hostilities end these will present a real danger that could possibly take years to address Mr President shall we speak also of the severe psychological trauma that this war has brought on and which Miss dton referred to the constant bombings multiple displacements sight and smell of death dismemberment harassment and other indignities can only be expected to have a heavy mental toll on civilians shall we also speak of the harrowing accounts of Palestinian civilians detained in Israel the torture including sexual violence to which they are subject is illustr illustrative of a level of depravity and debauchery that should never find expression among the Agents of a Civilized Nation more so a United Nations member state but all of this represents the OCC occupying power executing its colonialist aspirations fueled by a racist and religious ideology of superiority that allows it to treat Palestinians as inferior it is an ideology that promotes the subjugation of the Palestinian people this is the reason that Israel's response to 7th of October has been so over the top it is to Pummel the Palestinians into relinquishing any aspiration to freedom and self-determination Nation it is part of the wider strategy that we are also witnessing in the occupied West Bank characterized by the ongoing illegal settlement activity and the accompanying violence under the watchful and encouraging eyes of the Israeli Security Forces this Council has a responsibility to end the impunity with which Israel has been carrying out its atrocities against the Palestinian people it flies in the face of everything that the United Nations is built on peace and security human rights and sustainable development we cannot allow this to continue Mr President it has been more than two months since this Council passed resolution 2735 endorsing the efforts of the United States Qatar and Egypt for which we thank them since then 2,600 more Palestinians in Gaza have been killed and over 7,000 more injured Miss Dalton asked how long we ask how many more we stress again the obligation of the parties to implement the provisions of resolution 2735 to reach a deal for a ceasefire the release of hostages and for adequate humanitarian assistance to reach the people of Gaza we also underline the obligation of Israel to abide by the icj orders mandating that Israel takes a necessary steps to protect Palestinian lives and well-being and prevent genocide in closing Mr President implementation of the two-state solution is way overdue and is the only viable path to peace it is an injustice to the Palestinian people and to the people of the Middle East generally that peace appears to be a chimera owing to Israel's dogged agenda to deny Palestinians their right to live in Freedom and dignity in their own State Guyana urges the council to act to end this Injustice Guyana is prepared to do its part I thank you I thank the representative of Guyana for their representative of Republic of Korea thank you Mr President I thank USG Carlo and director dton of o for their detailed briefing on the current situation in Gaza the entire Globe is anxiously watching the precarious situation in the Middle East a series of destabilizing incidents have continued all across the region including along the Blue Line Teran in Tel Aviv in Beirut and in the Red Sea as repeatedly stressed in this chamber the Republic of Korea reiterate its urgent calls for maximum restraint by all parties in the region we strongly oppose any action that may trigger another cycle of violence and counter violence as this would only further endanger the lives of innocent civilians throughout the region we are appalled and Gravely disturbed by the repeated attacks against civilian infrastructure including schools hospitals and shelters in Gaza and especially by the August 10th strike on a mosque inside the Aline school where around 100 people were reportedly killed this was Israel's eighth bombing of a school Sheltering civilians so far in August alone we are all aware that civilian infrastructure should not be targeted this is all the more so when those schools are being used as shelters for desperate civilians who have been displaced multiple times amid ongoing hunger insecurity and disease Israel argues that these attacks on alabin school were carried out using precise Munitions to eliminate Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members embedded in the compound but regardless of this argument a fact is a fact yet another school where hundreds of civilians were Sheltering was intentionally targeted Israel claims that 31 terrorists were eliminated but in this indiscriminate air strike no distinction no distinction was made between militants and civilians including women and children we understand Israel has numerous nous challenges in fighting against Hamas but it is our be our belief that once again a school filled with displaced civilians was bombed by an advanced country like Israel International humanitarian law must be observed at all times as the office of the High Commissioner for human rights clearly pointed out the potential collocation of Hamas with civilian as well as non-compliance with international law by Hamas which we strongly condemn does not negate Israel's obligations under international law killing militants cannot justify killing civilians including children this is the unambiguous conclusion of international humanitarian law as such Hamas must not endanger civilians by using them as human shares yet at the same same time we urge Israel to take every possible measure to protect innocent Palestinian civilians we are also disturbed by last month's ohchr report as well as media reporting detailing that the rights of Palestinian detainees have been violated through arbitrary detentions and ill treatment Mr President we are seriously alarmed by the exacerbating humanitarian situation in Gaza spreading famine has been compounded by the total Destruction of Law and Order and repeated evacuation orders by the IDF we urge Israel to implement all possible measures to enhance the Swift and safe delivery of humanitarian Aid throughout Gaza at scale humanitarian workers notably on Rise must be protected Ed and their activities should be ured we are however opposed by the announcement last week that the UN office of internal oversight Services found at least nine honoral staff members may have been involved in the October 7th attack onra should maintain its role as a core pillar of humanitarian efforts in Gaza its credibility and neutrality must be ensured Mr president the situation in the Middle East simply cannot continue along this dangerous trajectory of escalation the conflict in Gaza must end immediately in this regard we welcome The Joint statement by the United States Egypt and katar calling for the resumption of the negotiations on August 15th Hamas must take part in the to in the talks Israel also should stick to the conditions elaborated in Security Council resolution 2735 urgent ceasefire should be followed by humanitarian Aid distributed as scale and reinvigorated efforts towards the two-state solution we hope all leaders in the region make the right de escalatory decisions rejecting the extremist voices bent on additional Bloodshed I thank you Mr Republic of Korea for statement I give Russian Federation thank you President we like to thank USG on peace building Affairs Ros De Carlo and also the director of financing and Partnerships division for op Lisa for their comprehensive briefings and their assessments of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories we grateful to the delegation of Algeria for taking the initiative to con in today's meeting regarding recent events in Gaza the last time that we discussed the situation there was two weeks ago it's clear that we need to be doing this more often because the notion that the situation in G in the region as a whole continues to drastically deteriorate has unfortunately already become routine and does not across the horrors and the suffering civilians in guards that have to face every day including elderly people women and children our West primarily American colleagues In Cahoots with Israel to express any passion to Palestinians Point therefore it's important to regularly bring the truth about what's happening in Gaza to the security Council platform and to International Community extremely shaken by the Israeli strike on the alaban school in at the time more than 2,000 refugees were Sheltering there more than 100 people died and tens were injured many of the with women and children we express our sincere condolences to the families of those who died and we wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured comp with the Norms of international humanitarian La we call on Western Jerusalem to refrain from any attacks on civilian objects there can be no justification for this kind of action what happened in alab can't be seen as a oneoff or indeed some awful criminal misstep to in the last 10 days alone centers in Gaza where idps were Sheltering have been bombed to data the Fourth of July Israel cared out 24 strikes on schools where displaced people were as a result of at least 274 people have died a growing conclusion that what is happening is not anything else than a deliberate Choice by isra leadership condemnation specific West and for restraint will not work the problem runs much deeper that the Pand to Israel Wan colleagues Council still has unfortunately not been able to take reaction to the escalation of the crisis mid reminds us more and more of passive powerless situation and ritually Express on this their concern I say 14 M of the secer by the US who rewards an immediate ceasefire June more than two months ago counil adopted it most recent product on American spons members of the security Council to give it the green light as soon as possible CLA that it theal between and Israel on a ceasefire Russ abstained time because we had the most serious doubts regarding the feasibility of this resolution time has shown all of these doubts have been confirmed W colleagues to about this resolution 2735 contain three phases with extremely ambitious plans for to start scale reconstruction of the Gaza Strip not a single one of these phases has materialized now absolutely surrealistic Security Council signed up to this security aat lineing the first operative paragraph that Israel agreed on many ining this that they not of the Israel official shows that isra in princip does not intend what the position of the security Council may be isra minister of the deal capitulation and the ministry of National Security directly said that there will not be an end to this war from colleagues their ground to bring to agreement with the security Council should not interfere with expression the mountain has given birth to a mouse been understatement we have not more adoption of resolution 275 the only anti- result is a BL provocative murder of the main negotiator h Minister during his visit to Tran now the whole world is sitting anxiously fearing a new escalation in region United States of America Hamas should participate in uh negotiations on August 15th as if everything only depended on Hamas president the sponsorship of the USA is not only unsuccessful but counterproductive in time region it's a blaze it's on the brink of falling into priority stop to the of to an immediate and unconditional ceas weos the first resolution with this demand back on the 16th of October last year how many lives have been saved C then had risen to the not question there was a specific figure 40,000 people died 200 more than 90,000 have been injured already said today di resolution 735 was adopted this is the price thetion of multilateral diplomacy and shorted interest of some members of the council who with their veto of D six months have not even allowed for mention Security Council documents of a innocent also H will be released and detain will be released and also full and uned Israel once again again we should think together about what measures can be taken to deescalate in Gaza and the region as a whole we need visit to the field then that's what should happen other department of the secretar in the zone of the conflict to fulfill their mandate often risking their lives and we here in New York with information from their reports and from open sources invitations to visit Geneva rather to those regions where we are really needed pror Cil visit not politic tourism to comfortable locations also to have a second at the question on the ground specialized misss could be reformatted primarily streng mandate without tying cons of both if will never be received tce alreadying specific to be resolved to bre new life into his which is very needed in the circumstances of the current escalation call on colleages on the council to not sit idly by but actively involve themselves in these discussions the counil cannot not should close eyes what is happening in the East for the benefit of one delegation neglect direct mandate to maintain International Peace and security and should it forget about its own decision the need to create independent Sovereign Palestinian state within 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital living side by side in peace and security with Israel sches and concept Foundation of Peace in the Middle East we are ready to cooperate with all of those who share this approach thank you for your attention I thank the representative of Russia Federation for their statement I give the floor to the representative of Malta thank you president I also thank under secretary Rosemary the Caro and director Lisa dorton for the hering briefings today MTA condemns the horrific strike on the alabin school in Gaza last weekend which reportedly killed dozens of civilians including children this is a continuation of the deeply concerning pattern of strikes on Palestinian education facilities alaban school was a refuge for hundreds of displaced Palestinians who urge Israel to seize attacks on civilians and civilian objects and to take immediate decisive action to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian law it is unacceptable that the civilian casualties of this war have reached 40,000 and by some estimates may have may be as high as 180,000 and that several hostages including children remain captive in Gaza for 312 days innocent lives on both sides should be safeguarded at all costs the state of s reflects an apparent complete disregard for international law as the modus operandi of the conflict parties hamas's use of the civilian infrastructure for military for militant purposes including through the firing of rockets into Israel directly jeopardizes civilians which we wholly condemn and as we have consistently condemned the terror attacks including those of 7th October nonetheless strict compliance with international law including International humanitarian law remains a Paramount obligation of the conflict parties including Israel the principles of Distinction proportionality and precaution are not voluntary the lives of civilians women and children cannot be disregarded Malta condemns the loss of all innocent civilian life including the recent killing of Drew's children in majal Shams and we stressed the conflict party's obligation to prioritize protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure president the broad and systematic risks faced by gaza's population remain humanitarian Aid continues to be blocked without any legitimate administrative or Bure bureaucratic reason hunger the growing threat of diseases such as polio exacerbated by little to no access to Medical Aid persistent displacement and lawlessness have deepened insecurity rendering the security the situation untenable humanitarian actors continue to inform us that what is being done to address these horrific conditions is nowhere CL close to enough a paradigm shift is necessary border crossings must be reopened and effective measures need to be taken to ensure that Aid is delivered into and across Gaza president the Carnage must stop hostages must be released they must be they must be reunited with their families and the humanarian crisis must be adequately addressed the full immediate and effective implementation of of relevant Council resolutions and the orders of the icj is essential mot affirms its categorical call for an immediate and permanent cease fire we fully support and commend efforts by the US Egypt and Qatar who continue work towards bridging gaps to implement the framework agreement which is in line with counc resolution 2735 we call on the conflict parties to constructively approach negotiations and urgently implement the ceasefire deal as Regional escalations continue we underline that concluding this deal is critical this will directly con contribute to avoiding a broader conflict in the Middle East we call on all regional parties to commit to diplomacy deescalate and refrain from any attacks which would inflame Regional tensions and undermine chances for a ceasefire deal for Israelis and Palestinians to know security and peace a return to restorative dialogue towards a itical Horizon must become the core

of Gaza and addresses condolences close victims and stands in solidary thought for some weeks schools have been bombed where hundreds of people were displaced and seeking Refuge an unacceptable number of these attacks against the civilian infastructure must stop and France recalls the urgency of respecting humanitarian law in this regard and France would also underscore the urgency of a ceasefire immediately and permanently in Gaz in order to put an end to the suffering of the civilian population and to bring about massive and unated delivery of humanitarian systems which is absolutely necessary for the immense needs of the people of Gaza and reiterates it call for an immediate release when without conditions of all hostages as well as its condemnations in the strongest terms of all

key and th reaffirms his attachment to the security and proposes intends to propose to this Council a Dr resolution to renew unfill mandate for another 12 months we call upon all parties to shoulder the greatest responsibility and exercise the greatest restraint for the region as a whole to prevent any further flareups Israel should refrain from any attack that might further exate Regional tensions and which would make it more difficult to bring about a ceasefire and the release of hostages thank you I thank the representative of France for their statement I give the floor to the President and direct for their briefings to the council my country reiterates support for the courageous and sacrificing efforts of the United Nations and agencies in now now more than 10 months haveed since the beginning of this more than 10 months of violence and desolation more than 10 months and deadly news and this weekend was no exception the bombing of a school in Gaza has once again led many of whom were displaced several times SE in vain security and protection theous numers of deaths and civilian wounded created by this world make it difficult to disagree with those who have said the Palestinian people is grappling with colletive punishment as stated by the secretary various world leaders more than 110 hostages continue to be under the of H and more than 300 days since they have been in captivity with the which started with the unjustifiable attacks terrorist attacks of 7 October these attacks we should recall were the immediate cause of the current violence and we can't but condemn as my country does once again on this every day that passes it's the civilians who bear the brunt of the weight of this conflict in the midst of horror displ and unending suffering as indicated correctly by the special coordinator to every day that passes also the increasing possibility of a Reginal conflict that would lead to death more suffering for the civilian populations paradoxically just yesterday we commemorated 75 years of the Geneva Convention agement def urgent to have an agreement in place that will make it possible to stop this War release the hostages aliviate the terrible human humanitarian situation in Gaza and leave those who would wish further violence without a pretex president on the 8th of August the leaders of Qatar Egypt and the United States ised a join communicate whereby they called on the parties to resume the dialogue this Thursday 15th of August and finalize without further delay an agreement my country would like to thank three mediating countries for their leadership and their and urges the parties to accept this call and take opportunity demonstrate political will and good faith this is the only way to finally the negotiations of an agreement and begin its implementation without further delay as requested by this Council in resolution 2735 in the mean all of the regional actors that must exercise a maximum of restraint and avoid any action or measure that might impact negotiations it is time already to truly make a ctive effort for peace it is time for concrete action and attitudes that will lead to a change in the cruel current reality it is time for agreements and restraint I conclude this statement Mr President with the hope the next time the council addresses this issue the hostilities will have stopped and it will be possible to make progress towards a peaceful negotiated definitive and fair solution for the parties with the existence of two states Palestine and Israel on the Bas of the 1967 borders and the relevant resolutions this is the only way to put a definitive end to this conflict thank you very Equador for their statement I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of seron I thank USG Miss osar de Caro and director Lisa dtin for their important briefings and call to action particularly in the statement of director Lisa dtin to leave no stone ont I welcome the participation of the representatives the state of Palestine Israel and South Africa in this meeting after weeks of sustained escalation amidst continued violence in the Gaza strep and the Wilder region it is tragic to hear another report of a direct attack on the alabin school located in central Gaza a place where hundreds of displaced Palestinian civilians found shelter we know that in the press release the Israeli Defense Forces stated at following intelligence the Israeli Air Force precisely struck a Hamas command and control center embedded in the alteran school located adjacent to a mosque which serves as a shelter for the resident in Gaza City Sal deeply regrets that over 80 civilians were killed including a family of 10 persons and that many more were injured we deplo this tragic and unacceptable loss of Civilian lives and the actions that led to such devastating consequences we iterate our condemnation of attacks on honorous schools civilian objects including residential areas providing shelter to innocent civilians in particular women and children we call for an immediate end to indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks and violations of international law colleagues as reported by the UN Human Rights office in the occupied Palestinian territory the unfolding pattern in the recent weeks of direct strikes on schools and in the Gaza strep is unacceptable and cannot be justified under any circumstances the UN Human Rights office has also reported that over the past months 17 schools have been struck killing at least 163 Palestinians including women and children in the span of 10 months each day has brought new challenges struggles and hardship for the affected civilians who have witnessed and endure prolonged suffering the humanitarian situation remains a crisis of EP a crisis of Epic Proportions as the supply of humanitarian Aid into the Gaza strep remains challenging due to access constraints and the high level of insecurity civilians are not only struggling to access basic amenities such as food water and medication but are also at risk of a surge in communicable diseases due to overcrowding and poor living conditions recently the World Health Organization has confirmed the high risk of polio virus spreading within Gaza Strip due to the unsanitary condition in the confined space as stated by a wh expert an outbreak of polio virus in the Gaza Street May spel over internationally at a very high point we therefore call for the safe facilitation of unobstructed access into and within Gaza through all cing points for all vaccinations Associated equipment including cold chain storage and specialist staff the well-being and health of children require far greater inputs than just vaccinations and we reiterate our call for unimpeded Access for all activities it is at rending at this stage to recount the series of threats and devastations civilian face in the Street while people still struggle to have an average proportion of a square meal per day and access to basic healthare there are also warnings of potential flooding ahead of the winter season humanitarian experts in the field have highlighted that the repeated evacuation orders by Israel since the start of the conflict has been carried out in a manner that fails to prioritize the safety and well-being of civilians as they fail to meet the international humanitarian law criteria colleagues on the Wilder region the situation remained fragile as hostilities continue across the Blue Line in Lebanon the Hues continue their Marian attacks in the Red Sea and a potential attack on Israel territory as a possible retaliation from Iran cannot be discounted the West Bank is no exception as there is an increase in attacks and casualities with the war in wider Middle East Regional context I would like to conclude with the following observations firstly the cumulative tool of the conflict makes it even more essential at this stage to find a peaceful resolution this can be achieved with an immediate ceasefire release of hostages followed by parties to the conflict that is Israel and Hamas complying with the provisional measures ordered by the international court of justice in South Africa versus Israel case and Security Council resolutions 2712 2720 2728 and 2735 secondly in adhering to the principles of international law including International humanitarian law and international human rights law civilian object including schools cannot be legitimate military Target as well as cannot be used for any military purpose thirdly and despite the stelmet S remains supportive of ongoing diplomatic engagement which in our considered view is one of the effective tools to resolving this conflict we once again call on the mediators ker Egypt and United States to Foster an environment of constructive dialogue to rebuild Trust TR and confidence since SC 2735 was adopted over 2,33 civilians have been killed this can cannot continue as we know that the deaths have added to the 287 a workers killed in Gaza Strip since 7th October 2023 including 205 honoral staff and at least 39,6 199 Palestinian kill and over 91,92 injured in this regard and in closing we call on all sides to take steps to urgently finalize the deal being brokered by Egypt Qatar and United States in line with resolution 2735 the parties must demonstrate good faith through sustained diplomatic efforts and negotiations it is hoped that the collective conscience will rule over actions of the parties and guide them towards doing what is right and just as against what they so desperately desire I thank you I resume my functions as president council I give the floor to the representative of the Observer state of Palestine Mr President As We Gather here for the 10th month in a row to advance a ceasefire to save human lives Israel continues taking human lives and every action possible to spread a wild fire Wildfire across the East as we sit here on the 75th conventions that where birthed in the ruins of entire cities in the mass and indiscriminate killing of civilians in the death Chambers in Hiroshima and nagazaki as a pledge that the light will emerge out of the darkest night and protect the dignity and Humanity of all persons cot in armed conflict Israel is tearing the conventions apart in Gaza along with every rule Humanity has ever elaborated as we meet here in New York there are Israeli government and military officials pundits and analysts explaining seriously that they are entitled to carry out indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks against the Palestinian civilian population to wage war against civilians they explain that starvation is a legitimate weapon of War they justify gang gra and torture against defenseless prisoners as a required deterrent and this is not a theoretical exercise this is what Israel is imposing against millions of Palestinians no man woman or child spared you demand Israel to stop killing civilians as a security Council but it Target them in their shelters and Tents you demand Israel to allow food and Medicine in but it ensures that famine and diseases spread you demand Israel to treat Palestinian prisoners humanely but it tortures them and allows the isra jailers to rape and abuse their hostages you call on it to stop its settlements but it rapidly accelerates its colonization of Palestinian land you urge Israel to uphold the historic status quo at the holy sites but its ministers and settlers desecrate the AL harar each time more openly and provocatively so let me State the obvious Israel does not care about your condemnations let me repeat Israel does not care about your condemnations it dismisses your resolutions it does not even live listen to your debates that representative will be playing with his iPhone while you are talking as countries as a security Council you had a responsibility to act months ago to stop this impunity as the genocide continues you have a responsibility to react to save human lives and preserve the foundations for peace and security for for all not just for some Israel is a rogue state with a rotten government due to unbridled impunity it has enjoyed so far I have no doubt that the tides will turn and we will not be deterred in making sure no one can act as if Palestinians lives are worthless but Palestinians in Gaza cannot wait for the tide to turn their Agony must stop now must stop right now they wonder if you see them do you ever think what if you were born in Gaza what if the prisoner raped was your son what if the children starving to death were your own what if that woman killed was your daughter or your wife what if the disease was riddling the body of your mother your grandmother what if that family that was blown into pieces or burn to death was yours killed in Cold Blood after running in desperation and hunger for months to survive just consider for one moment the sheer Agony and despair that our people have suffered all these long months of deprivation and Devastation lashed upon them while the world watched and left them to suffer starve and die President while we acknowledge and welcome the international consensus that has long called for an immediate ceasefire clearly Israel has rained a veto right over that Prospect this must be brought to an end Israel cannot continue to defy the world and every rule of humankind it is not a coincidence every time the world pushes for a ceasefire Israel responds with a massacre like the one in the school it sends a message each more gruesome than the one before that it will not stop but there is no right to commit jono obviously no right and we warn all those contributing directly or indirectly to the emergence of such a right there is nothing that can justify Israeli actions nothing and don't anyone dare say this is about the hostages it's not about the hostages it became apparent long ago that this Israeli government could care less about them the hostages know it their families know it you know it in the security Council Israel is killing them abandoning them playing with their lives Netanyahu has other priorities self-serving ones maniacal ones he's a maniac something terrible is happening Israel something that has made justifying genocide famine and gang rape mainstream ideology something horrific horrific is happening the memory of the Holocaust instead of serving as an unbreachable barrier against the commission of atrocities has been instrument in instrumentalized to justify their commission how's this how is this possible 10 months later with the whole world opposed to it because that opposition has yet to lead to Serious consequences for Israel this is a hard fact you have to face it there are no consequences they're not going to stop they're not going to listen to you to those who continue to AR Israel to those who still have the audacity to call in Israel quote unquote to investigate its own crimes as if the actions of its soldiers do not reflect the actual policies of its military and political leaders to those who dare to try and deter courts from ensuring accountability instead of deterring the perpetrators of atrocities wake up wake up how long do you have to remain in denial wake up stop finding excuses stop imagining that you can reason with the Israeli government so it stops killing civilians by the thousands imposing famine torturing prisoners colonizing and annexing our land all while you appeal to them call on them demand them to stop you have to tell them to stop and you you have the tools to make them stop as a security Council and as nations in your National capacity you have to decide what do you stand for and what do you stand against this is not a time for justifications and equivocations this is a time for clarity resolve this is time to shore up principles and morality do not abandon your duties do not abandon your duties as a security Council you have the tools to make what you decide a reality and no one should be above the law if you choose to do that if you have the political will to Implement what you decide Mr President when will the Israeli government be held accountable for its actions when when will the war criminals be sanctioned and as my brother from Algeria it is time to sanction we reject a position whereby you would be against hostage taking except when the hostages are Palestinians and whereby you would sanctions war criminals except when they are Israelis we cannot come back here over and over again and pretend that everyone does not all know that Israel will not listen until it has no choice but to listen you have to make them have no choice but to listen to you until there are consequences for its crimes you cannot commit a crime and get away with it there has to be consequences for those committing crimes for those who want to defend the for Geneva conventions and all the conventions elements when in artic one it says that you have to ensure in all times the compliance with provisions of the conventions and you see them getting away with murder and you keep repeating the same thing when are you going to enforce your decisions and international law you need to impose sanctions on those criminals you do that that they will stop continuing to commit these crimes and atrocities and genocide against the Palestinian people we reject a position whereby you would be against hostage taking as I said except when the hostages are does not know that Israel will not listen until there are consequences for its crimes Palestinians are exhausted surrounded by death and endless Horrors and they know your words are so that they know that your words are no match for the bombs and bullets taking away their lives and limbs but words are not all this counil has wordss are not the only tool your countries have some have gone beyond wordss they are too rare this is a time to act as a number of you have stated and you will be judged not only for the eloquence of your speeches but also and more importantly for the courage of your actions show some courage show some bravery take actions stop the criminals in getting away with murder Mr President we don't want Israel to torture our prisoners a bit less as some say that torture them a bit less we want to see them free we don't want Israel to make its occupation a bit less brutal we want to see it end our people deserve Freedom the international court of justice has been unequivocal in its determination that and I quote the sustained abuse by Israel of its positions as an occupying power through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the occupied Palestinian territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian Ian people self-determination violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israelis presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful their presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful therefore the court said it has to end as quickly as possible this illegal occupation and all the illegal inhumane racist and destructive policies that flow from it must end the Palestinian people will not disappear and they will not surrender they will not relinquish their legitimate aspiration to live in Freedom and dignity in their as ancestoral land I urge the security Council to act I urge you to act and in the coming days we will go to the general assembly to make sure that it upholds its Charter responsibilities to make sure that the determinations of the highest court in the world the icj is translated into Political will momentum into concrete actions to be pursued by the UN and its member states to end this illegal action as soon as possible to Mo to make protect civilians life to preserve and pursue peace and security dag Hammer shold once stated and I quote it has been said that the United Nations wants not created in order to bring us to heaven but in order to save Us From Hell end of quotation history will remember that the Palestinians were left to endure hell now the fire they have painfully endured for almost a year is spreading to devour everything around in our region there is only one way to stop a man-made fire it is not enough to tend to the flames you need to stop the arsonist let me repeat what our people in Gaza is saying and they have been saying that and they cannot take it any longer enough is enough you have to act to put an end to this cruel criminality and genocide against our people in Palestine particularly in the Gaza Strip will you do that all of you you gave beautiful statements you said you showed in anonymity in rejecting their criminal action but that is good not sufficient show the will and the resolve to act on that basis with the tools that you have with the Mandate given to you by the chch to come to the Palestinian people and serve them Justice to stop the criminals from continuing in what they are doing can we count on you thank you Mr the Observer states of Palestine for statement I now give the floor to the Israel thank you uh Mr President Mr President I'm sure many of you were not aware or did not care to check but today is tshav the saddest day on the Jewish calendar our our ancient day of mourning we are fasting today for the many traged tragedies in Jewish history that occurred on this day including the destruction of our first and second holy temples in Jerusalem but let me be clear Jerusalem will never fall again Jerusalem United Jerusalem will never fall again no matter how many times our enemies attempt to destroy us no matter how many times the UN Slanders us and distorts reality we will stay in our homeland and we will prevail Mr President council members in the early hours of October 17th 17th 2023 reports flooded from Hamas Ministry of Health of an Israeli air strike on alah Hospital you probably remember it remember that day these reports were then quickly very quickly parroted by un officials media outlets and several governments not even 24 hours following these baseless claims this Council convened to discuss what was exposed to be a terrorist propaganda operation as you probably remember it was a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket which fell on the hospital par parking lot not an Israeli missile fast War forward 10 months and nothing has changed in the early hours of August 10th 2024 the Gaza Ministry of Health which the AA representative referenced while failing to mention it is in fact Hamas has concocted a new blood liel once again un officials and media Outlets were quit to Echo this campaign of Lies I simply cannot comprehend that the United Nations security Council would hold an emergency session based on jihadist propaganda once again the council Falls for terrorist narratives amplifying them and neglecting its obligations to the truth some in this chamber distort reality because of politically interest and we all understand the political interest so I will set the record straight for all of you on Saturday August on Saturday August 10th Israel targeted not a school not a uh an innocent school we targeted dangerous terrorists operating in a Hamas command and control Central Center within Elin school as you usual Kamas cynically abuses civilian facilities which should be protected as their Terror bases this strike eliminated at least at least 31 Kamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists who carried out attacks from inside this compound these V terrorists included platoon commanders mortar and rocket operatives cell commanders and intelligence operatives we neutralized we neutralized dozens of vicious terrorists who used this school for their evil goals and were in direct violation of international law but do you hold Hamas accountable for the losses no of course not and of course he shouldn't speak for Kamas because he doesn't represent them how convenient by the way the building itself is still intact which would be physically impossible if Kamas claims are to believed to be believed so I ask you dear colleagues did you learn nothing from hamas's lies about Al hospital or from their lies about alifa Hospital which they also used as their headquarters and the lies about our daring hostage rescue among many other instances in which other context would the International Community rush rush to propagate the lies of a terrorist organization attempting to malign a democratic State as we take every possible measure every possible measure to minimize collateral damage while Hamas uses civilian as human Shields deliberately putting them In Harm's Way not only are Hamas lies echoed here but you also ignore and enable their outrageous violations of international and humanitarian law prohibited use of Civilian infrastructure by Hamas terrorists are numerous are widespread everyone I'm telling you everyone can see them everyone expects the UN of course yet the briefer today only touch upon these violations rather than investigating the twisted and immoral strategies of Kamas terrorists but why would we why would we be surprised if the UN has no data of itself they have to rely on baby killers and rapers to supply them the data just 80 years ago the Nazi minister of propaganda Joseph gbls used the language of race science as his weapon against the Jewish people people poisoning the minds of the German people Mr President Joseph gabel's ilk the people who are ideologically his descendants are alive and well sadly only now it is Hamas using the language of humanitarian and international law and modern blood lials to vilify Israel the council convened today urgently to discuss hamas's false claims shockingly it seems that you have decided to dedicate your time to listen to the terrorist lies while no real concern has been shown when Israeli children were murdered only recently by kisala let me show you the differences these and you have the names and their positions these are the terrorists eliminated in Gaza on Saturday this is only part of them because we as a reliable country we check ourselves we don't rush to conclusions but this is only part of the terrorists who were eliminated on Saturday terrorists exploiting alabin school as a base for their murderous objectives these are the people you call an emergency session for while these are 11 of the 12 Israeli children murdered by the terrorist by the terrorist of kisala these children were playing a football game in Maj Shams when kisala terrorists rained down death upon their sweet heads so while these terrorists used a school as their terabase these children will never see their school again but for them you couldn't find the time for an urgent session they do not deserve an urgent session huh my Algerian colleague shame on you what a disgrace so ask yourself why was the murder of 12 Israeli children in majal Shams insufficient cause for a meeting but the elimination of Palestinian terrorists operating out of a school is sufficient but you know what the most unbelievable thing is your inaction to condemn and stop the biggest danger and threat to the entire region Iran right now as we speak here now millions of Israelis are preparing for a direct Iranian Attack Just just as they did in April Iran's aggression threatens the entire region with war original War yet you are here wasting time on falsehood spread by the words of terrorists this fact that we are holding an emergency session because Hamas uses civilian as human Shields rather than discussing the real Global threat perfectly represents the distorted agenda within the UN a significant Detachment between the un's supposed agenda and the global reality colleagues as this may be the last time for me to address you as Israel's Ambassador though who knows perhaps another session will be called because of more terrorist propaganda I would like to leave view with this I have been immensely immensely proud to represent my country here the most moral country in the world the most moral country in the world you listen representative in this warped place I hope one day you will also see the bias and perversion of morality here and pray and I pray that you will see the truth the terrorist organization that this guy represents here and tyrannical regimes should be condemned not protected and that Israel should be praised we are today the Vanguard of civilization we are the Vanguard of civilization but until then I'm Israel Kai thank you Mr President I than the represent of Israel statement the representative of Algeria has asked for the floor to make a further statement I give them the floor thank you president very briefly I wanted to testify here 16,000 children who have been killed since the 7th of October didn't kill themselves I would like to testify here there more than 10,000 women massacred didn't Massacre themselves thank you very Algeria for their further representative of South Africa Mr President thank you for giving us the opportunity to participate in this urgent meeting which is most likely not going to be the last on the same matter will civilians continue to be massacred by the implacable government of Israel unfortunately some in this room continue to support and defend Israel as it commits the most despicable crimes against humanity the world has ever seen in recent times with impunity it is indeed an indictment on the UN Security Council that a resolution has to date not been found on this intractable conflict that has served on the agenda of this organization since time in Memorial just yesterday lamenting the inefficiency of the security Council the SEC Secretary General remarked and I quote since 1945 the United Nations security Council has been a Bedrock of Global Peace and security but the cracks in its foundations are becoming too large to ignore they are contributing to deadlock stalemate and stagnation around today's most pressing crisis end of quote in this regard the inability of the council to put an end to the genocide that's continues to be carried out by Israel against the people of God Gaza is a case in point Mr President Israel's impunity and apparent political protection is not perceived it's real this impunity puts in puts to into question the whole meaning of and I quote legally binding because this organization has adopted numerous resolutions since the formation of the United Nations that have been undermined by Israel for decades to affirm its status as a legal delinquent immediately following its receipt of armed support from those who support it Israel committed yet another Massacre on 10 August this year when it bombed the alabin school in central Gaza City where thousands of displaced families had sheltered more than 100 Palestinian children women and men and many and many injured as a result the assassination of a mass leader Dr ishma Han in Teran last month and the continuous targeting of civilians in Gaza will likely further compound the situation in an already volatile region we hope that the investigation into his assassination will soon be concluded and call on all parties to exercise the utmost restraint and avoid any acts that would escalate tensions in an already fragile region Mr President as an avid believer of the rule of law in December last year South Africa approached the international court of justice seeking an order to prevent Israel from committing genocide against the People Israel defied the Court's order and launched an offensive in Rafa once again South Africa put its trust in the global court system and sought additional provisional measures to prevent Israel's persistent acts of genoside against the Palestinian people Gaza deciding on the matter the court proclaimed that the Palestinians have a legal right to protection against genocide and that South Africa had shown that there was a real and imminent risk of the irreparable violation of that this also fell on theirs in addition to the evidence presented at the icj South Africa submitted to the security Council a body of evidence in support of its argument that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza this document was circulated as s224 419 and we encourage all members all member states to study the document and acquaint themselves of its content Mr President there must be an immediate sensation of hostilities across the whole of Gaza and all attacks on humanitarian workers and medical staff must cease immediately and permanently the continued occupation of Palestine destruction of infrastructure obliteration of livelihoods displacement Collective punish M and extra judicial assassinations will undoubtedly make the realization of a peaceful solution to the Palestinian question and the situation in the Middle East in general much more difficult to achieve we reiterate that the International Community cannot proclaim the importance of international law including the respect for the UN Charter in some situations but not in others the ability of Israel to Simply ignore binding decisions from International organizations with no consequences is unacceptable the council must immediately ensure respect for its resolutions in line with its mandate if it's to successfully mend and I quote the cracks in its foundation End quotes and avert a situation where these cracks become too large to ignore I thank you Mr South Africa for their statement there are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers the meeting is [Music] n la e [Applause] speee with L SP on fore spee speee foree with aome y he
