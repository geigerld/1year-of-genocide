today the European Union stepped up the pressure on Israel to support a two-state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict the message was crystal clear from Brussels two states Israel and Palestine are the only credible way to have peace in the Middle East European Union foreign ministers held talks in Brussels today on the conflict Israel's foreign minister and the Palestinians top Diplomat were both at the table France's foreign minister said there will be a need for a Palestinian state with sec security guarantees for everyone after the war in Gaza is has ended other ministers echoed that call as well as a appealing for the release of Israeli hostages being held by Hamas this puts the European Union on a collision course with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he refuses to consider Palestinian Independence and he says that Israel must control security from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean an area that would include an independent Palestine Now that statement brings Israel again into conflict with its number one Ally the United States as well as other International allies such as Germany Germany is a staunch supporter of Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas German foreign minister analina barbach she's paid several visits to Israel since the October subth Terror attacks today in Brussels she made it clear that Berlin thinks a two-state solution is the only way to achieve long-term peace Israel can only be safe if Palestinians are safe and if they can live with dignity and Palestinians can only be safe and live with dignity and freedom if Israel is safe that is why the two-state solution is the only solution and all of those who are not in favor of this have so far failed to come up with an alternative solution there can only be peace if there's peace for all the people living in the region let me pull in our correspondent now Rosie birchard she's been following the meeting in Brussels for us Rosie tell us what the EU wants to see happen in the Middle East when the war in Gaza is over yeah well the EU says that quite simply the only way to ensure a sustainable and enduring a credible peace in the region is to have the creation of a Palestinian state but of course that's not simple at all is it and nor is it anything new this is the EU long-standing position but the accusation that's been leveled in the block and even really acknowledged by the eu's foreign policy Chief yose Burell is that for decades the EU and other Global actors have been paying lip service to this idea but not actually doing anything to back up those words now what we've seen here in Brussels is an effort to try and have the EU move from being what really looked like a bystander in this deadly conflict to a bit more of a broker so we saw Brussels today corralling around different actors so the Israeli foreign minister the Palestinian foreign minister but also counterparts from example from Saudi Arabia from Jordan from Egypt and what Brussels is trying to do is float some ideas uh including for example what it's called a preparatory peace Summit that would involve those actors but also for example the United Nations and the United States to try and look at some of these big ideas for the future so the bid to try and broker something here is certainly underway whether or not it's going to actually make any difference especially on the ground As We Know that very dire humanitarian situation both for gazans and and for Israeli hostages which rages on and of course as mentioned by a lot of foreign ministers here in Brussels today that that situation simply is not getting any better and we know that the Israeli Prime Minister he has basically you know trashed the idea of Palestinian statehood I I'm wondering what makes the European Union think that um it's going to be listened to by the Israeli government well I think the European union feels that it was not listen to and I certainly sensed a a bit of frustration at these talks here in Brussels today for example I was told Minister showed up expecting to have a conversation about a two-state solution with their Israeli counterpart instead the Israeli Minister Minister Kat went on to show two videos which included connectivity projects including an artificial island of Gaza so that really seemed to spark a bit of disappointment among you ministers we had the eu's foreign policy Chief saying that really the Israeli Minister could have used his time better and I even spoke to Portugal's foreign minister on the sidelines of these talks and he was even more strident saying really calling on Israel prime minister to revise his position of course from the Israeli side here there was calls to really keep the focus on that situation the the Israeli Minister brought out pictures of a baby that's being held hostage and of course this is a really primordial question of security for Israel not least to say of course the Palestinian Minister who was president had a similarly passionate appeal talking about the plight of gazan children yeah let me ask you Ros we've got about a minute left what about in inside the European Union itself I mean how United is the EU when we're talking about a push for a two-state solution yeah the EU is united in that call for a two-state solution but that's really about it the European Union is divided overall on how to approach this conflict we have on the one hand for example Germany which really emphasizes Israel's right to self-defense due to not least that historical responsibility that Germany has to protect Jewish life on the other end of the spectrum countries like Ireland and Spain that have been quite clearly and early on calling for a permanent ceasefire there now what I would say is that in the early days after that uh terror attack by Hamas on October 7th there was a real cacophony of different positions from the EU that messaging has now quieted there is less of a kind of messy messaging what I think will be the case is that moving forward EU States will continue to really speak more on their own behalf and less as the eu27 as a United block here simply because what they can agree on is very little and and in many ways limited really to that call for a two-state solution Rosie Berard with the ladies from Brussels tonight Rosie as always thank you Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has once again rejected what he says are conditions for the release of hostages being held by Hamas and there has been no letup in the fighting in Gaza Palestinians say that the city of hanun has been subjected to the worst bombardment since the start of this war officials say at least 50 people have been killed and more than a 100 wounded gaza's Health Ministry which is run by Hamas and Hamas as you may know is classified as a terrorist organization smoke billows over gaza's southern city of khun as Israel's military continues its bombing campaign it's latest strike forcing dozens of the Wounded into hospitals that are overwhelmed and under resourced children and babies are among those injured or killed doctors say they're struggling to treat patients I'm telling you the hospital is on the brink of collapse we all are we're running out of medical staff and supplies nothing is reaching us there's nothing in the hospital to treat patients with no painkillers no anesthetics no medical resources Israel's military has been focused its offensive on the southern city where its battles against Hamas Fighters are intensifying explosions and gunfire echo through the refugee camps in the Gaza Strip most of the population have had to move more than once to find safety where do we go this is the 17th time I've left my home where am I supposed to go to Rafa Rafa is just one Street what do they want from us do they expect 2.3 million people to live in an area that's no wider than 200 M and can't be longer than a kilometer pressure is mounting on Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu after he rejected terms offered by Hamas to end the war in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages there and opposed the creation of an independent Palestinian state and relatives of Israeli hostages in Gaza disrupted a parliamentary committee meeting calling for their loved ones to be freed this comes as EU leaders meet in Brussels to discuss the situation in Gaza and what will happen after the war while there are deep divisions on calling for a ceasefire many including the eu's foreign policy Chiefs still think establishing a two-state solution is the only way forward I think that we have to stop talking about the Beast the peace process and they start talking more concretely about the two State solution process because pie could be many different pieces what kind of a piece you're talking about so let's talk about what we want to do all we want to do is to build a two-state solution meanwhile in Gaza many are trying to find a place that's not under siege in order to bury their loved ones as a number of casualties and displaced people continues to [Music] rise all right for more now I'm joined by shanea she's Communications advisor for the humanitarian organization the Norwegian Refugee Council it's good to have you with us so the worst Israeli attacks in hanun since the start of Israel's Invasion that's how residents there are describing it what are you hearing from Gaza what we're hearing from our teams in Gaza is that the situation in general continues to deteriorate day after day uh we cannot even access khun and have not been able to access Kan yunes for days uh because of the fighting that is ongoing there and the the challenges in keeping our own staff safe we do have a handful of Staff who have been seeking shelter in places in Kanan yunes and it's been very difficult for us to even maintain contact with them to know whether or not they are safe we understand that many G are now fleeing leaving hunis and fleeing to Rafa um is there safety for them there no there simply is no safe place in Gaza so long as these hostilities continue we desperately need a ceasefire to to put an end to this madness to put an end to this hell that Palestinians in Gaza have been subjected to for over 15 weeks now we had staff members who lost members of their own family uh just in the last couple of weeks in Rafa Rafa was remember supposed to be the safe place now we're seeing Milli over a million people cram into less than 1 of the territory in the Gaza Strip seeking out some type of shelter there's no uh space in designated shelters to host these displaced people disease is spreading uh quickly in shelter in overcrowded shelters due to unsanitary conditions sewage is flooding the streets because people simply don't even have bathrooms to go in uh to use and so this is a this is a situation that is increasingly concerning to us and we're increasingly concerned that Israel might continue their ass their op ground operations further south into Rafa where so many civilians have sought Refuge the European Union is now pushing hard for a Palestinian crisis that is now in direct opposition to what the Israeli Prime Minister wants the US also wants a two-state solution I mean these differences have never been so clear and they've never been so public what does this type of tension mean for your work well I think netanyahu's statements this week really demonstrate what we've been warning about in the West Bank for for years now that Israelis uh continue to to illegally colonize and settle uh in the West Bank in the occupied West Bank destroying any OPP opportunity or potential for a negotiated two-state solution we've seen pal inan communities forced off their lands uh forced out of area C of the West Bank these are some of the most vulnerable communities I think uh the International Community needs to continue to put pressure to abide on uh to put pressure on Israel to abide by their obligations under international law of course all parties to this conflict must be abiding by international law but what we've seen is a complete rejection from the Israeli government uh and its leaders of of uh the international Ally uh acceptable political solution for this conflict it's indeed very troubling Shan Communications adviser with the Norwegian Refugee Council in Jerusalem Shaya we appreciate your time tonight thank you thank you and as we said the families of those hostages being held by Hamas today stormed the Israeli Parliament our correspondent Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem has more there have been a group of uh relatives of those hostages there believed to be 136 hostages are still believed to be held in Gaza um uh by Hamas and other groups uh there um they have been storming uh a a a parliamentary session of a committee uh saying uh that enough is enough uh that you know the uh they shouldn't sit there they should do something uh to the parliamentarians and we've seen this here in the past days they have also on Sunday night there have been uh um relatives and families uh of those hostages they have pitched tents in front of the prime minister's private residents uh in uh Jerusalem saying they're not going to budge from there they're going to stay there they're going to block uh traffic um you know they're becoming more more desperate in the sense that they say we are not being heard by the politicians and that uh what the government is saying that more pressure on Hamas will bring those hostages home or will bring another deal is clearly not working and that every day uh uh uh those people their loved ones are staying in Gaza is a difficult day and that their run their time is basically running
