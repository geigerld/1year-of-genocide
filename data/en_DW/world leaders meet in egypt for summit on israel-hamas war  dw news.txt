International leaders are in Egypt for a summit on the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups more than 20 Prime Ministers foreign ministers and Regional leaders are attending the meeting in Cairo is aimed at de-escalating the conflict and providing humanitarian aid for civilians in the Gaza Strip conference is being hosted by Egyptian president Abdul fatal CeCe well addressing the summit president CC said Egypt condemned the killing of innocent civilians it expresses its bewilderment and amazement at the solid silence silent stance that the entire world is actually impo embodying right now in the midst of one of a scene in which 1.5 million people are being sieged and are being collectively punished and are are being forcibly displaced these are practices that are denounced and deplored by the International Community well we can speak now to journalist and Middle East analyst Kristen hellberg who joins us from Berlin thank you for being on DW so leaders are already giving their statements in Cairo did anything stand out to you so far I think the idea of this Summit is really to find a United stance within the Arab world at this point and within the region because the leaderships of these countries that especially the ones that have a peace treaty with Israel that are Egypt Jordan the United Arab Emirates Morocco and Bahrain they are under a growing pressure from their populations that are Furious about Israel's bombardment and Siege of Gaza so they really try to come down their own populations to prevent a spillover to prevent unrest within their own countries and it's just not yet the time for an inclusive Summit that would discuss um that would engage all parties to the conflict Israel and the us as well because and to discuss long-term solutions to uh the conflict so right now it's really about de-escalating tensions within the region what can we expect I think there is one point that we could focus on maybe there might be some positive results on the hostage issue because we've heard yesterday that most of the approximately 200 people kidnapped might still be alive and we see that the efforts to bring back home as many hostages as possible before an Israeli ground campaign could really speed up we have seen the release of two American hostages this is a sign of Hope and it shows that the Diplomatic efforts by catar that led uh to these concrete results are a sign of Hope and we have to see that all the countries that have diplomatic ties diplomatic channels to Hamas are present in Cairo today which means um Egypt and Qatar and turkey so there might be more coordination on that issue Within These among these countries instead of competing who has more leverage on Hamas all right so then what are the common ground issues that you think the participating countries can agree on you mentioned hostages is there anything else yes definitely the humanitarian Aid that is being delivered now that has to be um sped up and it has to be more than what we've seen so far to get the foreigners outside Gaza there are about a thousand people with foreign passports that need to be transferred to Egypt I think all these countries from the region ask for an end of the fighting or at least a ceasefire to be able to evacuate civilians to the south of Gaza to create security zones within Gaza and I think they all agree on the fact that the population of G Gaza should not be displaced um to another country for for example Egypt because this could lead to a second NABA the catastrophe um that involved the displacement of more than 700,000 people when Israel was founded in 1948 this uh this um word was used by president pesan president Mahmud abas so who is and I think there needs to be a talk about a long-term solution for Gaza with more International engagement not leaving the responsibility alone on Egypt because Israel we have seen yesterday they already emphasizes that it's not ready to play a role there there needs to be a new security regime but um Israel does not want to take over responsibility for life in Gaza so who is supposed to play that role in the past the EU and the US have um poured a lot of money into the Gaza Strip but that is not enough I think for the future there needs to be discussed an international approach um that would guarantee the security of Israelis and obviously the the well-being of the people in Gaza and to prevent a situ situation that before led to these Terror attacks by Hamas that was Kristen hellberg thank you so much for your insights my
