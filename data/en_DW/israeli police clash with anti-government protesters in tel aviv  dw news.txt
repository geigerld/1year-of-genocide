us officials say they are closer to a deal to PO fighting in Gaza in exchange for the release of many more hostages held by Hamas that's as pressure in Israel Mounds against the government of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday Israeli police clashed with protesters during a anti-government rally in Tel Aviv protesters called for new elections along with the immediate release of all hostages still held in Gaza DW correspondent Tanya kma is standing by in Jerusalem hello Tanya Israelis uh broadly backed their government's handling of the war on Hamas in the first weeks after the October 7th attacks now we seeing massive protests outside the prime minister's home what has changed well I think it's quite a fast moving situation but also a complex uh picture here uh as you said the the country is still very much United uh uh behind you know a majority of Israelis support the war they support uh the armed forces and to a certain extent also uh their leadership but the longer this goes on the more questions are being asked to what are the scenarios for the day after and one very very big and very important question here is the issue of the hostages um that you know that that's what we are seeing here in the past weeks there have been every Saturday uh tens of thousands of people coming out to demand the release to to demand the the government a new uh hostage deal to um release the remaining uh over 136 hostages that are believed to be still in Gaza to uh free them and to uh and we have more groups now joining uh uh those protest there the anti- Netanyahu uh protesters that have been um around but they haven't been coming out so much we've seen them we have some protesters that are protesting against the war these are smaller protests but also protesters that are now calling for new elections and that is also according to Pauls what a majority of Israelis want to see that after the war ends there should be new elections and yes it seems like in the face of the growing criticism prime minister Netanyahu has remained defiant but how long can he afford to stay the course well I think he seems to be quite unfaced as you said by the uh criticism uh he says uh he wants to achieve the goals that he has set to remove Hamas from from power and also that the war continues has to continue as long as it takes but he is under more pressure uh internationally by his allies the United States they want to see a scaling down of the intensity of the war um a more Aid uh a more protection of the civilian population in Gaza but domestically as well there's the issue that he needs to bring those hostages home that is very much on the Public's mind his popularity has dropped dramatically um in polls and a lot of people have criticized him because he didn't take so far responsibility for the security failures uh during the terror attack for the terror attacks uh on o oober 7th you you started touching on it a bit but uh tell us more about this uh there reports that Israel and Hamas are close to a deal to Halt the fighting in return for the release of hostages well there have been a lot of reports here in the past days uh but you know these are all talks that are happening behind closed doors so it's very hard uh to see where they are at at the moment so there are reports now that there's a four-way meeting supposed to take take place uh in uh in France uh um from the uh you know this heads of the C the mosad and the Kat Egyptian U mediators uh trying to hammer out a new deal that would be a phase deal where first some of the hostages would be released uh uh in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli uh prisons and also a longer period of a temporary ceasefire but of course Hamas has always said that they want to see a full stop of the hostilities and a full withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza so it's still to see how this will play out right DW correspondent Tanya kma thank
