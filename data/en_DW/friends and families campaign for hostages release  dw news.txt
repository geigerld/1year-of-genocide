among the communities attacked by Hamas on October 7th was kibuts beri the terrorists completely destroyed the kibuts and brutally killed over a hundred of its residents one of the families torn apart on that day was the haran Shams their home in the agricultural Community burned to the ground and most of the family members went missing 11 were kidnapped by Hamas including three young children and an elderly man it's thought they're still being held in Gaza four members of the family have since been found dead Noam Harts is a friend of the family and has been campaigning for their release she joins me in the studio now welcome to DW first up do you know anything about how the family is doing thank you for having me um we have no further new information unfortunately every hour and every day that goes by we still waiting for a sign of life you're still waiting for any certainty and mostly waiting for them to come now back home but as you said we know now that four are officially murdered and seven are officially kidnapped now an Israeli National Security advisor said today that there is no deal in sight for the release of the hostages How concerned are you about that you know I'm a I'm a medical student I'm not a security specialist I'm not a diplomat of course the families and the friends are every day concerned you you can imagine how it feels when your best friend or your mother or your child is a hostage and held by Hamas yeah so every day that goes by every every minute and every hour we are we are very worried and just waiting for them and and expecting for from everyone for all the sides the International Community and the Israeli government we expect all sides to to put this at the top of the priority and to end the misery and the suffering and to bring them back home now yeah um just this weekend prime minister Netanyahu said that releasing the hostages was his number number two priority though how does that make you feel as someone who you know is is so concerned about this entire family missing as I said I'm I'm not a national security specialist I'm I'm a medicine student and I'm a this is uh Dr shashan she's she's my dear friend I know her for 10 years we work together at the NGO she established uh her life mission was to solve the hunger problem in Africa and to help small farmers to develop Agriculture and to gain security she she's she's always been an inspiration for me she's all her family are you know just amazing people humanitarian Aid workers peace activists it's it's been too long it's been too long it's almost a month we just we just need it to end we just need them home now and you've been you've been bringing that message to a lot of people over the past days you've been incredibly strong touring several countries and and trying to to Rally people to to get on board with this cause to get the hostages released how have people responded to to your please I would say that everyone we met were very empathic we spent 1 hour with President sha Michelle we met prime minister rout we met President metsola we met the whole EU Parliament the list is so long we met so many people from all parties I feel that we we had their heart going out to us and I truly respect their support for now now as I said the families need actions the family the families cannot take it anymore they need their loved ones back now what kind of action and and what are you asking for specifically coming here because there are a lot of EU citizens among the kidnapped people in that family yes we believe this is an international issue as you said many of the hostages are with foreign nationalities and not only that um we we know that Europe is our Our Hope with this humanitarian issue so we really expect them to to put this as a top of top of the priority and to use old their tool older diplomatic tool everything everything to end it today now as far as you're concerned do you know that that is already happening are there things going on behind the scenes that maybe you were assured of that they're doing what they can to get the people released I wish that I would know more details as all the families wish to know more details but as you know how these things work um it's very hard to get real information and real insight about any negotiation and anything that's going behind the scenes but the only thing that I can says that we have hope and we have expectations of them and we I I really want to believe that everyone that we met didn't only meet us that day and I I really think I from the people that we met they gave us a huge support and I believe that they're doing whatever they can uh under you know things that cannot be said um but we urge them not to forget them these are our people these are our families this there this is not numbers this is real people and you just got here to Berlin what's what's next for you who are you going to meet who are you hoping to be able to speak to and convey that message to so one delegation of the German hostages family was already here uh on the second week of the war um we are now arranging a second delegation and I'm here for uh this uh as as long as it takes to meet with u any diplomats or any anyone that is in a position to help us um especially we first we need even the basic stuff a sign of life and to know that they are held in humanitarian terms these are basic stuff that we still don't have have any certainty about I know it's a very comp complex situation but I I really I really really wish for anyone not to be in these shoes never this is every minute every hour that goes is terrifying yeah I really hope that your voice is heard thank you so much for for having the strength to come here and and all the best to you and and your friends and your cause thanks thank you
