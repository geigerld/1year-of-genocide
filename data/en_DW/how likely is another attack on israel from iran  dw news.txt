to the Middle East next where Russia has entered the Diplomatic Frey as Iran vows to punish Israel for the assassination of Hamas political Chief is hania on its own soil Russia Security Council secretary Serge shyu met the new Iranian president masud pesan in Teran on Monday and according to State media wants to expand Iran's relations with its Court strategic partner Russia this comes as the US steps up its diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider war in the region US President Joe Biden and vice president kamla Harris met with security officials to discuss threats posed by Iran and its proxies to American military forces in the region and as Israel braces for any possible retaliation from Iran the families of the 115 remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza fear the escalation will make a ceasefire deal even more out of fre indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel have so far been unsuccessful and the threat of a wider conflict in the region appears to be growing daily it is not easy for Dan El garat to walk here in Tel aviv's hostage Square for 10 months he has been campaigning for the release of his brother iik who was kidnapped by Hamas from kibuts near o on October 7 but now as a crisis unfolds with Iran and Hezbollah a ceasefire and hostage deal seem more elusive than ever I support the assassinations of the leaders I think these people deserve to die and we need to eliminate them the question is when and whether they are more important than the lives of hostages that is the question after the targeted killings of Hamas leader isma Han in tan and f shuk a senior hisbah figure in Beirut Israel is now praised for retaliation and possible escalation 115 hostages are still believed to be held in Gaza some of whom are no longer alive people here in tviv are extremely worried about the fate of the hostages still being held in Gaza fearing an allout war with Iran and Hezbollah people here are more on edge than ever life goes on as usual here at least for now but the threat of an imminent escalation is on everyone's mind it's very worrying things are unclear there is a lack of information we don't know what is going to happen we are terribly worried about our people over there there is no one who is leading us responsibly it's a difficult feeling it's not easy to be a citizen in Israel today for me it was already scary after 7th of October uh and uh I was really scared because I wasn't like sure what's going to be tomorrow or the day after tomorrow but uh eventually like um um I'm sure that everything is going to be okay no matter what and trying to stay calm yeah but it's a bit scary cuz you don't know what to expect Danny El garat is critical of netanyahu's strategy of Maximum military pressure and thinks he's motivated by his desire to stay in power we see the condition the state is in today the country's condition is much worse than on October 7th we're on the worch of a regional war in the face of growing uncertainty the hostages families are waiting anxiously for their loved ones to come home as the country prepares for whatever comes next let's get more from DW Middle East analyst Shani rosanes who can put this into perspective for us shannie welcome how far away are we from a ceasefire deal right now well very far think I think there's no reason to assume that Hamas would be having any interest in letting Israel you know deescalate the situation Hamas what is seeing now unfolding you know with the threat of of you know Iranian response on Israel hasbalah and so on this is what they wanted from the GetGo Hamas wanted to see as many fronts you know Israel entangled in as many fronts as possible and it's on the verge of reaching that goal so there is no probably any incentive there and also Netanyahu I think made a very calculous decision to go for these you know assassinations that triggered the situation we are in knowing it might have a direct implication on uh you know any deal that is possible so I think both sides are kind of pushing that aside for a while though technically still talks are being held mostly because of American and Egyptian pressure who feel like there's so much details to work in the backstage of the mechanism and this can still be uh ongoing uh without reaching the heavy uh issues but um we're not anywhere close no so with this being the situation How likely is another Iranian attack on Israel really well there's no doubt the threat is imminent I mean the Iranians are very clear in their you know in in their intentions they they communicate very clearly what shape this uh attack will will take this is the big question and in Israel there's a growing assessment that first actually it would be hasbalah from Lebanon who has its own open tap with Israel following uh the assassination of the the leading military uh official there last week and and the assumption is also that this is the more challenging threat for Israel because of the proximity I mean you know Bala sits right on Israeli northern border and also because it managed in the last months of the war to actually uh dumb down it operation in a way and use more less sophisticated uh weapons and this is a threat that Israel is trying uh very much to tackle but it's very much struggling with all of this works in favor of Benjamin Netanyahu does it well in a way I think it depends what's the end goal he feels emboldened politically I think he he hasn't felt so strong since October 7th uh he doesn't have any anything threatening his position right now um of course there's always you know the American pressure there's a lot of pressure bubbling from the public but I think anono sees for now that I mean he can sail surely until there's a new president in the White House in November and he's hoping I assume that it would be Trump and then we will have he hopes card blanch to take this war wherever he wants where is the Israeli public in all of this what does the Israeli public want to see I think most Israelis are just exhausted there's great fatigue I mean this is basically a war of attrition we've been seeing it going on tomorrow for 10 months um there's a lot of hopelessness but there's also great fear of course you know there's real anxiety when it comes for you know waiting for the Uranian response there's a lot of calls of maybe Israel should be more active sort of a preventive strike but then you know I think Israel is not in a position we can again hit on Iran but Israelis are exhausted they're depressed and I think that um they're not the only ones you know in the region you know Palestinians are in Far More dire situation unfortunately we leave it there for the moment DW's Middle East andley Shan rosanas thanks so much welcome
