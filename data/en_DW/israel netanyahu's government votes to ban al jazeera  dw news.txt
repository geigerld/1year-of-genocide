Benjamin netanyahu's government has voted to ban the Qatari broadcaster Al jazer from operating in Israel the decision follows a law passed by the Israeli knesset that allows the temporary closure of foreign broadcasters considered to pose a security threat Israeli media say the block can last up to 45 days the head of alzer's Israeli operation called the ban dangerous and said it was motivated by politics journalist balag sladin joins me now from Tel Aviv thanks for coming on um what is netanyahu's cabinet saying about why they made this decision well there are some things that they are saying publicly and others that they are not saying publicly in terms of what they are saying publicly is that the law comes not to uh close El jazer specifically but the law itself says that any media outlet that does harm Israel's security will be closed now we've seen that with withad a couple of months ago as well but now we're seeing it with a different and a more uh influential media which is El jazer it's not mentioned actually in the law but of course everyone knows that that's what we are talking about why El jazer hurting or harming Israel's security well there have been many accusations throughout the years that El jazer are using the reporters in order to report from places that are not entirely accept CED by the military some things that the military does censor that they are saying with no censorship these accusations we have heard over the years but it's happening right now and this is the big question why right now specifically some are saying um in the background of the war El jazer with in its influential uh um coverage in the Arab world in general they are of course uh um hurting Israel's um stance or repution in the world something that Israel cares about and it's also Championship championing excuse me Hamas and what they call the Islamic resistance or the Palestinian resistance in general what they're not saying publicly is that the Israeli cabinet knows that no one actually is putting any pressure on Qatar the owner of Al jazer to pressure Hamas in this deal so they're trying to do something to make it lose something so maybe it can hurt it can press now you touched on this a little bit but practically speaking what does this actually mean the closure of alzer's offices in Jerusalem uh which they have and to clarify does this impact alzer's reporting operations in Gaza well I've talked to my colleagues in jazer that are working here um that does mean that they will close the offices of Al jazer in Jerusalem but the law and it states that clearly we are talking about only only the 67 borders so inside proper Israel we're talking about the Gan Heights of course Israel itself and the east of Jerusalem we're not talking about the West Bank and also of course not talking about Gaza unless of course at some point Israel does have any uh any administrative uh rule over Gaza at any point in the future but for now we're talking about the 67 border alone it will not hurt what is going to happen in Gaza journalist bik sladin in Tel Aviv thank you very much
