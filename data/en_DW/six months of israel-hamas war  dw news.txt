anti-government protests have been taking place in Israel as the country marks 6 months since the Hamas attacks that sparked the conflict Israeli president isak hatok has called it a bloody and difficult War many Israelis are now questioning their government staging Mass relies urging a deal to release hostages still being held captive by Hamas and other groups and calling for new elections more this I'm not by the W Middle East analyst Shan rosanes Shani 6 months into the war how are average Israelis feeling about what's going on it's a very somber day I mean the mood is very low we've seen the protest I don't think any Israeli could have imagined six months ago that Israel would still be fighting Hamas um so long and I mean we've just had Israelis just experience attack attacks missiles attack from Gaza to the same uh parts of of land in the southern of Israel just last week so uh basically back to zero point back to the same place Hamas is still far from being defeated in Gaza Israelis are aware of it uh netan and his government have promised uh repeatedly again and again uh they're going to keep on pursuing uh Hamas until it's complete inhilation and this is far from being achieved and also there's still over 130 Israelis still kept hostage in Gaza that's of course so a big part of the national mood and something that is driving the discourse about where is the this heading and is there maybe a need for reconsidering the strategy Israel has taken so far and before we go further into that let's uh have a look back at how all this unfolded these Festival goers seemingly oblivious to the exploded Rockets overhead soon afterwards Panic as Hamas militants run Rampage at the Nova music festival in southern Israel almost 360 young people were killed in this Attack Just kilometers from the Gaza border dozens more were kidnapped at first light on Saturday October the 7th Hamas began firing a barrage of rockets from the Gaza Strip towns in southern Israel such as ashalon bore the brunt islamist militants also broke through Israeli border fences CCTV footage shows them entering a kabot but Hamas also filmed the terror it inflicted on Israeli communities as well as killing around 1200 people more than 220 were taken hostage and driven over the border into Gaza there's mounting evidence some were subjected to Serious sexual violence in an audio message Hamas military commander muhamed de called on all Palestinians to fight this video footage shows Palestinians on the Gaza border celebrating on top of an Israeli tank that was said to have been captured by Hamas there were anti-israel rallies in the occupied West Bank as well as in other countries such as Iran Israel's response was Swift as it began its bombardment of the Gaza Strip with devastating results citizens of Israel we are at War not in an operation but at War Israel's most powerful Ally the United States offered its total support good afternoon the United States stands with Israel we will not ever fail to have their back October the 7th a day of Terror and Carnage that continues to traumatize Israel and a day for which Gaza is still paying the price at least anal Shan rosanas is still with me here in the studio shy there's never any true winner in any war is there going to be a winner in this war well hard to say I doubt that I mean this day October 7th has changed a region it's changed the status quo um there was maybe a belief that there might be a way out of it the Americans were pushing for a greater deal connecting also with Saudi Arabia and other moderate Arab countries for the region this is still on the table but nothing's going to move forward without having any progress in Gaza um and where we stand now Israel seem to have have lost you know the connection with American the ties with American uh regime government and Biden specifically that was a strategic asset of the Israeli and it seemed to have been weakened same as the public support in America there's a lot of criticism in Israel as well as the rest of the world that's one thing Israel have lost and of course when it comes to deterrence that was Israel's biggest you know part of its of its defense uh apparatus it was a main pillar the deterrence the the the feeling that the rest of the world and mostly the Arab world have had that nobody should even try attacking Israel because it's its military might is so strong having seen that collapse on October 7th put Israel in a very precarious position and a lot of what we've been seeing since when it comes to the uh severity of the of the response in Israel comes from the need that Israelis feel the Israeli mil military feels to rebuild um that deterrence to show Israeli might and abilities um that's um the the thing on the table for israelies but but Hamas have pulled that off against the deterrence so is that a win for Hamas then in a way yes and you see a lot of support for Kamas going outside of the Palestinian territory outside of Gaza I mean a lot of support for the IDE of Hamas and for the operation of Hamas for its ability to finally defeat the mighty Israel to bring such a blow to Israel but at the same time Hamas also have lost a lot of support within Gaza and Gaza was this territory where Hamas managed to execute uh uh political Islam in a way that hasn't been you know experienced before and it was also seemed to be leading the Palestinian cause and now all of that has been jeopardized and probably we're not going to see Hamas in a political role as far as the International Community and you know we're looking at the plans ahead definitely when it comes to Israel we'll never let let that happen so they have also lost that and I think they've also lost another key issue now they were expecting bigger solidarity much more um you know when it comes to the the the Arabs Palestinians living within Israel also what's happening in the West Bank of course there's a lot of Oppression a lot of of Israeli military actions trying to prevent that but the fact that Hamas is actually not manage to make this a wider Regional uh conflict that's somewhat of a as well to Hamas and uh as we are moving forward with this you know no end in sight uh both sides might need to maybe acknowledge these Lawes in order to be able to try to find a way out of this terrible tragic situation Shan rosanes thank you very
