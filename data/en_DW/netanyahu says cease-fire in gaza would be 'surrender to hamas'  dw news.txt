Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will not agree to a ceasefire with Hamas speaking earlier in Tel Aviv he said that would represent a surrender to Hamas he called the conflict a battle between civilization and barbarism he added that even the most just Wars have unintended civilian casualties Netanyahu also said he hoped that civilized nations would back Israel's fight I want to make clear Israel's position regarding a ceasefire just as the United States would not agree to a ceasefire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor or after the terrorist attack of 911 Israel will not agree to a sociation of hostilities with Hamas after the horrific attacks of October 7th calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas to surrender to terrorism to surrender to barbarism that will not happen ladies and gentlemen the Bible says that there is a Time For Peace and a time for war this is a time for war a war for our common future today we draw a line between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism it is a time for everyone to decide where they stand our correspondent Ben fulan is in Jerusalem and he told us more about what Netanyahu said uh what stood out to me was this plea to countries to support Israel and seek moral Clarity in Benjamin netanyahu's words he said the future of civilization is at stake uh and went on to explain that it's not Israel indiscriminately uh bombing civilians it's Hamas and Hamas which are using uh the gazan civilians a million of them displaced at the moment and seeking Refuge as human shields in this war mhm Netanyahu took the stage shortly after it became known that an Israeli soldier who had been taken hostage by Hamas had actually been freed how has that been received in Israel well this has been a a more than a glimmer of hope I mean the first good news uh in in days this war has ended its fourth week and it's just been bloodshed from the terrorist attacks on October 7 in which 1400 Israelis are said to have died um the air strikes uh which Hamas says in the Gaza Strip has killed over 8,000 people they are unverified numbers um and then to hear that one of these hostages has been released so far only four had been released um and that was because of medical conditions and elderly uh person uh includ included and uh a number uh also killed in retaliatory air strikes from Israel according to Hamas so um this is really the first rescue uh by the sounds of it uh Israel clarifying an earlier statement saying that URI madish a private uh had been released during the ground offensive uh by Hamas there Ben fulan with the latest from Jerusalem thanks for that and for more we can now bring in Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan conriquez he's a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces good to see you Mr kriz now prime minister Netanyahu categorically rejects calls for a ceasefire equating it with calling for Israel's defeat in the war but what about a humanitarian pause to help innocent civilians get Aid and get out of Harm's Way wouldn't that also be in the idf's interest hello good evening and thank you for having me um it is definitely our interest to make the best possible situation for civilians they are not our enemy and we are not trying to Target them and in order to do so we are facilitating together with the Egyptians and the US and the UN the import of humanitarian Aid I'm happy to say that more than 108 trucks of humanitarian Aid have been provided to Gaza and that there is a humanitarian Zone declared and officially established humanitarian Zone in the southern Gaza Strip all in order to provide exactly as you say some kind of support for the Palestinians the non-combatants but we have to be very clear any sensation in fighting will be used by Hamas for their purposes and that is not on the table I don't see it on the table what we are focused on is in know dismantling Hamas and making sure that this never happens again and of course bringing back our hostages yeah just to clarify about that human humanitarian Aid that is trickling in um 100 trucks have so far since um October 7th been um brought to Gins that is usually what comes in throughout a day if I'm not mistaken now I want to get to something else because Israel describes the AL shifa hospital as a de facto Hamas Command Center the UN says hundreds of people are stuck there and cannot be moved there is an evacuation order that the IDF has issued is there a scenario in which the IDF would consider refraining from bombing what it considers valuable military Targets on humanitarian grounds yes listen we are very respectful of protected sites and we fight according to the laws of armed conflict we distinguish between combatant and non-combatant and we are attacking the combatants full stop second thing is we it's known and widely recognized that Hamas uses civilian infrastructure for their military purposes which is in direct contradiction to humanitarian law it's a crime they shouldn't be able to do that and the unfortunate situation is that even though two weeks have passed almost two weeks have passed since we asked Palestinians to evacuate Gaza City they have had lots of time to evacuate also the shifa hospital if they had been busy doing it now they're in a situation where there are still haven't evacuated and there is significant combat ongoing that is regrettable and I think that everybody in Gaza the aid organizations and Hamas the UN and everybody else should be busy evacuating people and to strip Hamas of that human shield which is the shifa hospital what the UN says though is that there are people on ventilators babies and incubators that just simply cannot be moved and that moving them would would amount to you know putting them In Harm's Way in a different way and and would also suppose a death sentence but um I want to move on because your military managed to free a hostage overnight uh can you give us any details about that operation yeah just to finish that last Point what's really putting them at risk at Mortal danger is the fact that Hamas is using it for their military purposes otherwise we wouldn't be talking about chifa it it's a protected facility and we wouldn't have any issue with regarding the happy news of the release of private Ori Mish she's with her family she is well both mentally and physically and she has been debriefed and she will be debriefed in the future she was released by Israeli forces on a ground operation due to the sensitivity of the matter I cannot elaborate how how many people how it was done where she was held and all of the other very interesting details what I can say and read rate is that we are committed to getting all of our people back not only or mides but all of the 238 hostages that are being held in Gaza by Hamas Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan kriz spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces thanks thank you for having
