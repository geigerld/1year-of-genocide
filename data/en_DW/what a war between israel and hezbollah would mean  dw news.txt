we start in Gaza where the Hamas lead health authority says at least 25 people have been killed and another 50 wounded by Israeli shelling on a camp for displaced people near the southern city of Rafa relatives of those killed in one of the strikes near a Red Cross Field Hospital say Israeli forces fired a second time and that blast killed people who were coming out of their tents Israel's military says the incident is under review and is looking into potential strikes at the locations reported by emergency workers meanwhile Israel says it has carried out a number of strikes on Hezbollah targets across the border in southern Lebanon the Israeli Army says the strikes were in retaliation for attacks carried out by iran-backed militia in Northern Israel since the October 7 Terror attacks and Israel's subsequent war with Hamas there have been daily clashes between the Israeli Army Hezbollah and Allied groups in the Border area between Israel and Lebanon United Nations Secretary General Antonio guish says he's deeply concerned about the crossb hostilities the risk for the conflict in the Middle East to widen is real and must be avoided when rash move when miscalculation could trigger a catastrophe that goes far beyond the border and frankly Beyond imagination let's be clear the people of the region and the people of the world cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza let's talk more about all this with Mara zunshine in Tel Aviv she works for the international crisis group an NGO with the self-imposed goal of preventing Wars worldwide welcome to DW um let me start with my first question you just heard that Stark warning from the UN Secretary General the world in short can't afford another Gaza in Lebanon how close are we to that right now uh hi Michael thanks for having me um in some ways we've been close to that for nearly nine months now since kisala opened up a second front after the Hamas attack um and like he said any miscalculation at any moment could strike a bigger war and I think it's important to keep in mind that we've been at this daily for eight months and it's remarkable that it hasn't deteriorated into more escalation and I think that's a testament to the fact that neither side is interested in an allout War um so the question is how do we get the quiet and I think at this point even if Israel doesn't like it it is linked to a ceasefire in Gaza which is something that Israel's leader has refused uh to do even to get the hostages back um but at this point in time kisala has been quite clear that that would be the prerequisite for at least the beginning of a deao quiet on the North northern border and until that happens we will continue to be in a situation at at any point in time uh it could break out into further escalation Hezbollah of course is allied with Hamas in the Gaza Strip but is considered much more powerful how would a war with Hezbollah differ from the one we're all watching in real time with Hamas uh it would be absolutely devastating for both sides um it was a devastating war in 2006 uh for both sides but primarily in Lebanon andala has uh amassed itself a huge amount of precise weaponry and Munitions and it has been testing out those weapons in Israel and testing Israel's defense systems uh and frankly also after eight months of War uh on two fronts Israel is not really prepared I think um for this kind of escalation um and it's also a question what would it achieve if it invaded Lebanon um and how long would that last uh but either way you know Israel has promised to destroy Beirut kisala has said that it could invade the Galilee which is in Northern Israel um it would be catastrophic for both sides in a situation in which you already have displaced persons you already have uh people being injured being killed um it would be possibly also a wider Regional War the us could be dragged in uh it would be a disaster my ra uh this past week in Washington US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin spelled out the Paradox of this conflict quite simply it's a war nobody wants not Israel not Hezbollah and certainly not the Lebanese so why nevertheless are we heading in that direction at least well I think kisala has decided to link the two fronts uh and I think that that link is now cemented and Israel uh uh understands that um and needs to decide how it wants to position itself uh and so far it has allowed the operation in Gaza despite the fact that it has made no strategic breakthrough to continue even at the expense of what's happening on its northern border even without providing any kind of plan or timeline for the tens of thousands of citizens who want to go back to their homes um so you know I think this is partly it's definitely the onuses on kisala and on the axis of resistance which has decided that it will keep up the pressure on Israel as long as it is in hostilities in Gaza um but it's also on Israel to decide on a strategic plan and a policy for the future security of of its of its citizens this is something that has to do also with uh its occupation and continued military control over the Palestinian people which is something that uh many countries in the Middle East are not willing to tolerate but also in terms of how Israel understands uh its future if it wants to continue with war or if it wants to try at least um to pursue a path of diplomacy right which it hasn't done for a very long time that's Myra zunshine in Tel Aviv from the International crisis group really appreciate your time and your perspective thank you
