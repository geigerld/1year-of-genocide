Israeli forces have surrounded several hospitals in Northern Gaza the biggest alifa says it has run out of fuel and is now closed to new patients the Israeli military says this video shows its soldiers placing 300 lers of fuel near alifa prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Hamas refused to accept the fuel the hospital director has denied that and said the fuel would not have been enough to power Hospital generators for even an hour the World Health Organization has described the situation at alifa as dire and perilous it says the hospital is unable to function due to fighting nearby and the number of patient deaths has increased significantly the Israel Hamas battle intensified around hospitals in Northern Gaza making conditions desperate for the medical centers running out of essential supplies and electricity Samira Alor displaced family fled the alifa hospital with her children she described her experience at the city's major health facility we thought the hospital was safe but it wasn't if we had stayed another 5 minutes we would have been killed they started to bomb us and we ran away from alifa my son got injured so I left him there in the hospital to get treatment I couldn't take him with me I was tired and afraid I went to my nephew and told him to stay with my son and then we fled several thousand displaced people have sought shelter in hospitals medical staff say hundreds of patients are at risk including several newborn babies and incubators in an interview with DW the un's World Health Organization expressed alarm at the situation we understand there are still 600 to 650 inpatients at alifa and between 200 and 500 health workers um there are 45 patients who really need kidney dialysis but they can't get it because the the powers run out and the dialysis machines not working we're certainly hearing that the health workers don't feel they can leave that they they don't feel they can leave safely although many are also saying they will they want to stay because they've got so many vulnerable patients that can't be moved as well the Israeli military says its operation is against Hamas it says the islamist militant group responsible for the October 7th Terror attacks on Israel has a command post inside and under the hospital compound the Israel Defense Forces denied that the hospital was under siege and agreed to help evacuate babies from gaza's Main Hospital alifa although Samira has managed to flee Aid organizations say that Israel's instructions to leave the hospital without any safe haven make it unfair and impossible to evacuate especially for the sick and vulnerable patients trapped inside for more let's bring in shanea loow she works for the Norwegian Refugee Council and is monitoring developments from Jerusalem uh welcome back to DW news uh we hear there are thousands of people taking shelter in gaza's hospitals how much Medical Care can hospitals actually provide given these kinds of conditions you know day by day the situation in gaza's hospitals are getting worse lot many of the hospitals have shut down Services completely or operating uh with very little resources we are uh hearing reports of doctors running out of medicine running out of fuel uh shortages of food clean water we had a colleague over a week ago had to go and find food for his um injured cousin at a hospital in the middle area which is which is ostensibly a bit safer uh and it took him about 2 hours just to find some biscuits uh so that the cousin could take some medication that required food uh doctors and medical personnel are working under the most difficult of circumstances trying to save lives uh and and struggling to do so it's it's our responsibility as the International Community it's Israel's responsibility as the occup in power controlling Gaza to provide assistance including uh medical supplies and medicines in order to prevent unnecessary death and and injury and just to make clear uh for our viewers how is your organization able to stay in touch with people in Gaza are you able to uh speak to staff there we are still in touch with most of our staff on a daily basis we are finding that our daily headcounts trying to make sure that all of our staff is accounted for are getting more and more difficult as Communications become less and less reliable uh we had one one colleague Yousef told me yesterday that another one of his colleagues uh tried to call a hundred times before he was able to get through as as the as telecommunications system in Gaza is extremely weakened we've heard reports from from the major telecom companies just in the last couple of days that they anticipate that with running out of fuel they will soon uh have have uh even more difficulty keeping their operations uh running so major communication difficulties on top of everything else going on I want to ask you about something else we've mentioned earlier in the show uh Israel's military says it has placed 300 lers of fuel outside the alifa hospital um but that Hamas has then blocked the delivery the hospital director has strongly denied that what is your organization hearing regarding the delivery of fuel there you know we haven't we don't have any folks at alifa um any longer so it's very difficult for us to make determinations uh in the fog of war and and with competing narratives I'm not really comfortable saying um speculating on on what in fact is going on but it's the responsibility of all parties to ensure that International humanitarian law is is abided by and and we hope we implore that all parties are doing all that they can to save the lives of innocent civilians who are just caught in the crossfire and what about fuel needs and deliveries more generally can you give us a sense of what the situation is and how much is actually available for hospitals to operate you know the situation with fuel is is um has been it's something we've been warning about for weeks as fuel supplies have run out I know that a number of hospitals have had to shut down uh due to lack of fuel it's not just the hospitals it's it's also in terms of us being able to provide humanitarian response in our Partners being able to provide a humanitarian response without fuel getting into Gaza it makes it impossible for trucks to be able to go and deliver Aid to Across the across Gaza uh and so we desperately need fuel to be coming in not just to run the generators in hospitals but to run ovens and bakeries to wa water desalination plants water pumps and of course to be able to distribute Aid so while we've seen a trickle of trucks Aid trucks coming in there's been no fuel entering Gaza for over a month it's desperately needed and we call on the International Community to continue to push to allow for for fuel to go in in order to save lives and provide uh the assistance that people are so desperately in need of Shana thank you very much for speaking with us that is Shaya loow with the Norwegian Refugee Council and earlier our correspondent in Jerusalem Rebecca ritters told me more about what we have heard from the from Israel on the situation in gaza's hospitals Israel is saying that it's not targeting civilians that it's that it's trying to crack down on this Hamas Command Center that it says is underneath the hospital we know that gun battles have been going on outside the hospital making it almost impossible for people to leave we've been hearing accounts of people trying to leave the hospital being shot at and having to run back sometimes then injured even further so the situation for civilians on the ground really really difficult Israel is saying for people to get out of the hospital but these gun battles are making it almost impossible as I said and I you we seeing that that Israel saying that they want to open up that they have opened up in fact on the Eastern side of the hospital an Escape Route an evacuation route but people just too scared medical staff saying that people are too sick too injured to be able to be moved so the situation just increasingly difficult we know that the death toll uh that the Ministry of Health Hamas uh LED Ministry of Health releases hasn't been updated since Friday because they simply can't get a handle on the toll anymore they're not able to get to places to to see who has been killed in strikes and who has been killed in this these gun battles so you know the situation there shocking Israel saying it's trying to give fuel to the hospital but we we're seeing that Hamas has apparently rejected that offer and saying that it's not nearly enough to be able to operate the hospital as you just heard in that report Israel also offering to evacuate babies but we haven't seen any progress on that yet now Rebecca looking at Southern Gaza the Rafa border crossing to Egypt that's the only Crossing out of Gaza not controlled by Israel uh we understand that reopened on Sunday uh and a few hundred people managed to get out can you tell us a little bit more about that yeah we have confirmation from uh the people who run the the the border the authority there saying that more than 800 people were able to get out yesterday this has been after a few days or several days of it being closed again after it had reopened uh in sort of in the more initial stages of the bombardment and we saw uh a few thousand people coming out it's it's thought that around a little less than 3,000 a few a little fewer than 3,000 people have managed to cross in total and it's hoped that more people will be able to continue Crossing that border we're talking about mainly foreign Nationals though some Palestinians who have been uh severely injured or that are s you know suffering uh serious health concerns have also been able to cross though in fewer numbers uh and you know there's obviously hope that more people will be able to cross soon but we have seen that that border crossing then closed it opened it then it closed again and now it's seeing reopened so people hopeful that that will continue and more people will be able to evacuate and looking elsewhere I also understand there were intensified clashes on the Israeli Lebanese border on Sunday how serious is the situation there very serious CL serious and getting more increasingly tense we heard from hezb Hassan Nala a couple of days ago a similar speech to one he gave you know a week ago or so and it doesn't not very content filled trying to I I think say that they're keeping up the pressure and yesterday we saw some of that pressure we saw another two strikes at least where we saw more than 20 people injured on the Israeli side uh the hezb claiming responsibility for those attacks and now Israel uh stepping up its counter attacks on targets inside Southern Lebanon these have been increasing we've been seeing this tit fortat crossborder fire since the beginning of this conflict and everybody all the International Community uh US President Joe Biden here to try and St not at the moment but has visited and all these other people trying to visit to stop that becoming a wider regional conflict but of course uh it is getting really tense up there and Hass nraa saying he's going to be keeping up the pressure on uh Israel if only not perhaps wanting to get really involved and really start a bit broader conflict but to try and keep Israeli troops uh busy and and and keep their resources tied up in the north our correspondent Rebeca Ritter's in J bruum thank you so much for that update and Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again dismissed calls for a ceasefire unless it includes the release of all the nearly 240 hostages captured by Hamas on October 7th Netanyahu told us media that Hamas was to blame for the situation in Gaza uh and I think every civilian death every dead baby is a tragedy but that tragedy should be placed squarely at the responsibility of Hamas that is keeping its military installations inside hospitals its command posts inside hospitals inside schools inside unra un facilities and so on let's bring in military analyst Frank ledwich on on this issue Frank good to see you again Israel has there alleged that Hamas has command posts in and underneath hospitals in Gaza is there evidence for this well good morning Claire I think it's worth remembering that if you're a pretty ruthless islamist terror group there's no better place to put your headquarters or military positions in hospitals but there we are uh in terms of evidence the Israelis have been looking at this for decades now probably about 20 years they will have 20 years worth of interrogation reports technical surveillance satellite surveillance aial surveillance agents on the ground who will be reporting on this and if you look at the quality of the uh information provided provid you accept it's in good faith I don't think there's any reason for it not to be it does seem that indeed Hamas has placed some of its major installations underneath that hospital now over the past few days uh I've been speaking to to many doctors in Gaza also to Aid workers who have staff there and no one has mentioned or confirmed uh the existence of any kind of Hamas command centers in these facilities do you think it is conceivable that Hamas could be operating there without anybody realizing it well with all due respect and to be blunt about it I would invite you to consider the consequences for anybody uh stating to the media that there were Hamas installations in such hospitals this this is need to know stuff and uh just by way of analogy I lived on a military base for 4 years and I only recently found out there was a big nuclear bunker right underneath where I worked I didn't need to know it was there the hospital workers certainly don't need to know it's there um this is just a reality of of of the situation however I did speak to someone uh there quite a long time in Gaza who said it was a common supposition but that of course is rumor and it's not in any way intelligence but these things are not simply are simply not known to to to most people although I think as I said before the Israelis have some pretty solid information on it so do you expect uh Israeli troops to attempt to enter alifa hospital at some point as part of their military operation I would suspect it's the very last thing they want to do for very obvious reasons but this will be a major Target and I would expect them to deal with it somehow they can be pretty inventive in their operations the Israeli the Israeli Defense Forces but if it has to come to it they will do so uh although I don't foresee firefights in the hospital worth remembering by the way that the last hold out of the Islamic State in raaka was indeed raqqa's Central Hospital so Hamas won't mind doing it well thank you so much for speaking with us as always that's military analyst Frank L witch thank you CL
