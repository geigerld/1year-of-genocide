00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:04.838
Slick propaganda,

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:07.841
a blatant threat and published last year.

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:08.675
Hamas gunmen

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:12.137
training a motorized paragliders.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.055
They also showed meticulous planning

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.057
for fighting in built up areas.

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.767
All an historic failure

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.770
of Israeli intelligence.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:21.771
Hamas videos

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.940
of the start of their assaults from Gaza

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.649
were published

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.776
within hours of its launch.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.111
Once a branch of the Muslim

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.362
Brotherhood, Hamas,

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.280
a Sunni movement,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.283
won Palestinian elections in 2006

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.410
on a platform of social reform

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.871
and resistance to Israel.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:38.997
Riven by corruption

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.874
and incompetence, rivals Fatah

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.459
launched attacks immediately

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:43.585
against the movement,

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.378
which denies the right of Israel

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.338
to exist at all.

00:00:47.338 --> 00:00:51.259
In the end, Hamas won control of Gaza

00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:53.178
and its grip on the enclave of around

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.846
2 million people tightened

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.431
as Israel and Egypt

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.974
largely sealed it off,

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:01.311
causing intense humanitarian problems.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:02.562
Hamas responded with

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.897
waves of rocket attacks

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.648
against Israel that got worse

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:07.692
as the years went by.

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:11.362
Israel counterattacked from the air

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.239
and with ground assaults that left

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.409
thousands dead and Hamas still in charge.

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.453
But Iran's influence has been key

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:20.288
to Hamas's military power.

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:21.873
The Iranians have trained

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:23.208
Palestinian engineers

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:24.626
and how to establish rocket

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.252
manufacturing in Gaza.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.172
We know that the Iranians have provided

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:30.673
production, social production equipment,

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:31.216
which you need

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:31.925
for the production

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.177
of solid propellant rockets to Gaza

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:35.512
and to other places as well.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:36.346
Israel knows

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:37.847
it must battle Hamas on its own

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.432
turf in urban areas,

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.476
latticed with explosive traps

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.686
and riddled with secret tunnels.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:44.354
And Hamas

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:45.814
will draw on the experience

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.440
of Iran backed Hezbollah,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.277
which ravaged Israel's armor in 2006.

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.278
All the while trying

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:53.196
to protect the lives

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:56.533
of at least 130 hostages that Hamas says

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:57.575
they will kill

00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:00.036
if Israel's attacks continue.

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.996
Dealing with violent groups

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:03.456
backed by Iran,

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:04.040
a country

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.334
that's bent on destroying Israel

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.169
and building a nuclear weapon

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.547
that could do just that.

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:15.552
Sam Kiley, CNN.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.262
Some perspective now from New York Times

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:17.929
foreign affairs

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:18.972
columnist Thomas Friedman,

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.557
who's been covering the region

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:22.225
and writing about it since the 1980s.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.726
His bestselling account from Beirut

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:26.104
to Jerusalem is considered required

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.147
reading for students.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:30.150
The Middle East.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.651
Tom, why do you think this

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:32.735
attack happened now?

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:35.822
Why did Hamas choose to strike now?

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:36.614
Was it

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:38.199
divisions within Israel

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.242
that they sense

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:43.037
the the the looming Saudi deal?

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.164
I have to believe that

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.123
the looming Saudi deal

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:46.499
was a big factor in this,

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.126
because we're talking about something

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:48.585
that would have been

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.045
a fundamental geopolitical shift

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:51.880
in the region.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.964
Saudi Arabia

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.091
normalizing relations with Israel

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.427
opens ties up between Israel

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.595
and really the

00:02:58.595 --> 00:02:59.596
the rest of the

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:00.555
of the Muslim world,

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.432
possibly Indonesia, Malaysia.

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:03.850
It would be a huge strategic shift.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.310
But more importantly, Anderson,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.145
it also would have had to have been done

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.396
as part of a deal

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:09.022
that would have,

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:09.898
I think, strengthened

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.066
the legitimacy of Hamas's archrival,

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.235
the Palestinian Authority, in Ramallah,

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.278
because that normalization

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.196
between Israel and Saudi

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.072
Arabia could only have been done

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:19.616
if Israel also made concessions

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.576
to the Palestinian Authority.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.077
Give me a greater control

00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:24.162
over certain areas in the West

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.497
Bank, administrative control,

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.248
putting some kind of

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:28.958
freeze of settlements down

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.085
and and basically reviving hopes

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:32.712
for a two state solution.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.214
So I think both of those were in play.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.131
And at the same time,

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:35.882
I think it sense

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:36.424
that Israel

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:39.427
was completely distracted by a needless

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.054
judicial coup inside

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:46.059
and the two came together properly.

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:46.893
The big question,

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.186
of course, about

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.730
the level of Iran's involvement.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.272
You know, U.S.

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:51.981
officials have said

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.316
they haven't seen a smoking gun,

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.693
but certainly Iran supports Hamas.

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:58.363
Islamic Jihad, certainly.

00:03:58.363 --> 00:03:58.571
Yeah.

00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.322
I mean, again,

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.115
no one, I think, has a smoking gun.

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:02.992
But same time,

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:05.870
Iran's overriding interest in

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.330
not seeing its two arch

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.624
enemies, Israel and Saudi Arabia,

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:12.335
forge an agreement together.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:15.129
I think it is really apparent there.

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.672
Otherwise,

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.675
the thing is, even beyond being barbaric,

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.427
even more senseless and stupid

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:24.055
than that, than it appears if Hamas

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:27.308
just did this on some fleeing

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.726
for no apparent reason

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.812
other than had the resources,

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.230
it's now, you know, visited

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.065
just tremendous

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.608
destruction on itself

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:39.988
on Palestinians in Gaza and maybe lost

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.698
a strategic number of weapons

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.783
that it will it will hopefully

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:44.534
you'll never be able

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:45.576
to threaten Israel again.

00:04:45.576 --> 00:04:47.203
So I can only believe

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.580
it had something to do with that Iran

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.665
with that Saudi Israel

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:53.584
normalization deal.

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:54.502
The Israeli government

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:54.711
has called

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:58.172
for a complete siege of of Gaza.

00:04:58.256 --> 00:04:59.757
Benjamin Netanyahu spoke

00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:01.134
today, did not specifically

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.719
talk about a ground incursion,

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:03.970
but certainly

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.097
that would seem to be in the cards

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:09.559
or certainly a strong possibility.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:12.562
We all know the difficulties of that,

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.480
the inherent dangers in that.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.734
We know the international outrage

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:18.192
that will

00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:19.819
that will grow

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.406
the as conditions deteriorate in Gaza

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:26.409
and the civilian population suffers.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.993
You know,

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.370
Israel risks a lot by a ground invasion,

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.080
not just in blood

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.126
of of of their people, of their soldiers,

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.003
but also in in

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.796
in actually being able to

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:40.048
to get what they want.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.215
I mean, doesn't it?

00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:43.092
It can actually go in.

00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:44.135
It can actually play into

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.679
the hands of Iran, can't it?

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:47.096
Well, you

00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:49.098
know, in these kind of moments, Anderson,

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:50.975
I always ask myself,

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.435
and I'm sure Israel's asking itself,

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:56.314
I hope it is, what does my enemy want?

00:05:56.397 --> 00:05:58.900
And then let's do exactly the opposite.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.318
So what do Israel's

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:01.903
enemies want right now?

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.739
Iran and Hezbollah and Hamas.

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:05.490
They want Israel

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.452
to occupy Gaza, get enmeshed in a,

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:10.870
you know, door to door, house

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.122
to house fighting. There,

00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:16.376
kill a lot of Palestinian civilians

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.543
and completely erode

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:18.836
the moral high ground

00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:19.754
that it has right now,

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.130
which does have real value.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.591
That's what they want.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.093
They don't care less about their people.

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:26.469
If they did, Hamas would have been

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.220
governing Gaza

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.680
in completely different way.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.183
I hope that Israel can achieve its goals

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:35.186
of restoring its detergent, deterrence,

00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:38.606
getting its hostages back,

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:39.607
but doing it in a

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:41.692
way that is not against

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:43.444
the aims of Hamas.

00:06:43.444 --> 00:06:44.779
These are hard calls I recognize.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.572
But you don't want underplay it.

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:47.657
You don't want to overplay it.

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.534
But I hope Israel

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.619
does not have to go into Gaza

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.621
and or if it does,

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.831
doesn't go far or deep.

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:55.206
Is it

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:56.249
possible, though, for Israel

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.292
to avoid going into Gaza?

00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:00.128
I mean, if they want to stop,

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:03.005
Hamas is military capabilities

00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:03.881
moving forward

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:04.632
from being able

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:06.968
to do the same kind of attack?

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.345
What other option is there?

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:09.971
Well, I think that

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:10.513
one of the things

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:12.974
that Hamas has done, again, which

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:13.558
sort of leaves

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.560
you wondering what they were thinking

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.770
among many things, is that

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.938
they've they've shown Israel

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:21.941
every vulnerability it had in Gaza.

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:23.901
And they they did that

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:26.571
for the purpose of inflicting, you know,

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:27.697
seven or 800

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.490
civilian and military casualties

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.784
on Israel.

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:33.870
But now, where are you, Hamas?

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.829
How are you better off?

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.039
Are the Palestinians of Gaza better off?

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:38.916
But you've just shown Israel

00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:41.002
when blessedly for Israel, that

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.336
it had all these vulnerabilities.

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:44.046
They will the Israelis will study this.

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:46.090
They will close them.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.009
Hamas is now fired off a lot of weapons.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.177
Also shown Israel

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:52.805
what new missile technology it had.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.724
So I think there's a lot of things

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.684
that Israel can achieve in the long

00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:58.227
run that will leave Hamas

00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:01.230
much more weakened without

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:02.190
having to go in

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.693
and try to reoccupy the place, because

00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:06.819
if not, you know,

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:07.612
maybe there's only one thing

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.113
worse than Hamas controlling Gaza,

00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:10.990
and that's nobody controlling Gaza

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.242
or Israel happening to control Gaza.

00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:16.245
And so, you know, this is this problem

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.872
hasn't been insoluble

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.665
for so many years for a reason.

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:20.708
And, you know,

00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:22.335
I think this is a time for Israel

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:22.835
to do deep

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.795
thinking about how deep it gets in.

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:27.924
I'm sure they are. But I think

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:29.175
this is a really

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.176
some critical decisions

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:33.346
got to be taken here.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.056
There are, I'm sure,

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:38.017
plenty of the civilians in Gaza who

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:39.644
oppose Hamas,

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:43.689
who don't like the Hamas regime, and yet

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.358
they don't really have anywhere to go.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.817
I mean, Israel,

00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:47.318
you know,

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:49.654
the IDF will say go to other areas.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:52.281
But it is it's so densely packed,

00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:53.324
it is very difficult

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.619
for civilians in Gaza.

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:58.454
And that's why, you know, Anderson,

00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:02.124
some problems are kind of insoluble.

00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:04.544
Unless Israel wants to completely

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.379
occupy Gaza

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.589
and nurture a completely different kind

00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:11.092
of Palestinian government there

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:12.718
and stay there

00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:14.095
probably multiple generations,

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.555
it would take,

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.473
it's going to have to deal with

00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:20.434
some form, most likely, of Hamas.

00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:23.229
I think the point is to put Hamas

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.021
in a situation

00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:25.606
where it can never

00:09:25.606 --> 00:09:27.984
do this kind of attack again,

00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:29.777
where it's on the defensive

00:09:29.777 --> 00:09:33.239
in international circles and is deterred.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.199
But I think deterrence is

00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:36.576
is the only outcome here.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.579
You're not going to remake Gaza.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.582
You know, the notion of you know,

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:45.376
of completely transforming

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:47.378
that situation through military means,

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:48.337
it is not going to happen.
