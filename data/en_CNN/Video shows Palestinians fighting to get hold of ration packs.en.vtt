00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.301
The dwindling supply of

00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:03.470
humanitarian aid into Gaza.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.671
Jordan and France

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.039
carried out the largest aid drop

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.273
airdrop by air

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:08.942
over the besieged territory.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.210
The armed forces say

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.579
they made four aerial aid drops on Monday

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:13.546
in collaboration

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.280
with the French,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.915
sending relief and food items,

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.417
including ready to eat meals

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.185
of high nutritional value.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.253
One journalist tells CNN

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:21.121
he saw four planes.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:21.788
The first

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.523
the first airdrop went into the sea

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.458
while the remaining three were dropped

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.827
in southwestern areas of the territory.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:29.162
More now from

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:29.763
CNN Jeremy

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.866
Diamond reporting in from Tel Aviv

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:33.600
today.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.769
Gaza's humanitarian crisis

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.637
looks like this.

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.272
Palestinians desperate

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:40.673
for food, paddling

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.475
and swimming out to sea

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:43.910
after at least one plane

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.045
airdropping aid

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.047
appeared to miss its target,

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.481
sending pallets of food

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.050
crashing into the sea

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.720
in central and southern Gaza.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.855
Hundreds crowding the beaches

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.157
to try and secure

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:00.393
their piece of the rations

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.295
But this is the other side

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:03.997
of desperation.

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:06.699
Groups of men wielding whips and bats,

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.401
steering crowds away

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.570
from their precious cargo.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.939
Months of hunger and war, triggering

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.707
fights for survival

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.010
when there is not enough for everyone

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.848
This is what they are fighting over.

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:23.450
Ration packs

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.119
a lifeline for the lucky few.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:26.853
In Omaha,

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:28.254
I was lucky and able to get

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.522
one of these aids.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:30.957
But what about all those other people

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.959
who were not able to get this aid?

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:33.827
Look, this one didn't

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:36.296
get any in this way. Didn't get any.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.431
But so much more is needed.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.034
I'm asking from the Arab nations.

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:42.268
We are thankful for the aid,

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:43.470
for the parachutes.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.537
But we need more.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:45.071
And we need it

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:47.207
distributed in a better way.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.808
This will not stop our hunger.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.343
We don't need a capsule

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:52.312
because when we eat this, we will eat it.

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:53.847
And that's it. It's finished.

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:57.450
But nowhere are

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.118
people more

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.486
desperate for food

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.588
aid than in northern Gaza,

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:03.022
where women and children

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.357
wait in long lines

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:06.593
for what now passes for food.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:07.560
A cloudy soup

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.562
mixture made with dirty water

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:11.631
and whatever grains can be found.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:13.199
What am I used to?

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.502
There is no food or drinking water.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.737
No flour or anything.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:19.372
There was no cooking oil.

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.074
Not even drinking water.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:21.508
Oh.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:23.843
Death is better than this.

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:25.478
Humanitarian aid deliveries

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.046
this month dropped by half

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.581
compared to January,

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.183
according to a United Nations

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.518
relief agency

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:32.519
which blamed Israeli

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.020
military operations

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.523
and the collapse of civil order in Gaza.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.291
In northern Gaza.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:38.925
Aid groups

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:39.893
suspending aid

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.194
delivery amid looting

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:43.163
and attacks on aid trucks,

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:43.763
leaving many

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:45.965
with few options to stay alive.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:50.036
I think we are aiding animal feed against

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.071
our will, but have to aid us

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.940
without food or clean water.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.509
Their voices are all they have left.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.944
The savage hit and run

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:59.579
and the suffering of Gaza

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.914
is extremely difficult.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:02.148
Where are the authorities?

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:03.883
Where is the government

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:05.618
is rumored as hungry and a government

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:08.054
made is hungry and people are stealing.

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:09.122
Shame on you, Arabs.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.590
Where are you?

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.992
But after nearly five months of war,

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.695
is the world listening?

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.164
Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.834
Yoni Sciretta is the president

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.236
and CEO of Save the Children.

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:25.371
She is with us this hour from New York.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:26.573
Thank you for taking the time

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:28.474
to speak with us. Appreciate it.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:29.976
Thank you, John.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.044
Okay, so here's what life is like

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:31.911
right now in Gaza.

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:33.413
We'll hear first from a mother

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:34.080
in Gaza City.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.949
Her name is Umm Amir Jamal.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.051
And then we'll hear from Jihad Al Danja

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.385
who is in northern Gaza.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:40.153
Hey there,

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:42.388
If

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.291
there is no food to feed my children,

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:47.126
nor there is any bread.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:47.994
We came to the point

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:49.662
where we are eating cheese.

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:51.798
We are eating the food of this donkey.

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:53.733
All of northern Gaza is starving.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.102
There is no shelter, no drink, no food.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:57.670
There is nothing

00:03:58.438 --> 00:03:59.472
seems to be less than nothing.

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:01.174
According to the UN, $8 in February

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:01.741
a half of what

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:02.709
they were last month,

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.844
which was a fraction of what is needed.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:05.778
So Palestinians,

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:07.947
especially in Gaza, are resilient people.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.582
Kids are used to hardship,

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:10.750
but nothing like this.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.918
And the fear is that now

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:12.752
could get a lot worse

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:13.186
as that Israeli

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:14.954
offensive on Rafah goes ahead.

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:16.889
Describe what worse looks like

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.126
Yeah, thanks.

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:22.228
And it's almost inconceivable.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:22.762
Last month,

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.497
I didn't think

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.132
worse was actually possible,

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.234
but clearly it is.

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:31.271
You remember, there's now 1.4 million

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.572
people in Rafah,

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:35.908
which is what is a smallish city

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:38.478
housing 3000 people this fall.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.281
Now there's three times as many.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.549
There are essentially tents

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:44.317
and people

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:47.186
everywhere on every single street road.

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:48.888
There are people sheltering

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:52.759
under the tarp, in a tent, perhaps,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.763
or in a makeshift whatever shelter.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.132
So and there is a sense

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.302
that this is the last line in Rafah.

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:03.803
There is nowhere to go.

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.104
People can't leave.

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:07.173
People can't go back to the north.

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.175
There are still fighting there.

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:10.443
They're probably

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:11.744
allowed to cross the border

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.913
to Gaza in the middle.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.149
And as we heard, there is no food.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.685
No, not of anything anywhere in the north

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:20.453
anyway, aside

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.288
from a lot of unexploded ordnance.

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:25.525
So it is really, you know, quite

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:27.827
there's no

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.529
thinking what would happen

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:30.663
if there would be an incursion

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:31.764
now into Rafah,

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:34.000
where people are completely stuck,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.302
essentially locked up with nowhere to go.

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:38.371
And because people are so close together,

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.874
it is inconceivable that you would

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.711
go in there with a lot of bombs

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.380
and shelling and and violence.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.816
Those children will, you know, will

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:53.653
absolutely be there the brunt of that of

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.121
of that violence.

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:56.456
It is such a difficult situation

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.657
to even think of the words

00:05:57.657 --> 00:05:58.358
to how to describe

00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.759
what is possible there, because it

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.960
so much has already happened.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.196
So, yeah, it is it is unthinkable.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.098
This is from an opinion piece

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:06.399
by for CNN, rather,

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.468
by UNICEF CEO Katherine Russell.

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:09.869
At least 90% of Gaza's

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.237
children under the age of five

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:12.071
are affected by one

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:13.473
or more infectious diseases.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.007
And that 70% have had diarrhea

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:16.309
in the past two weeks.

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.743
At least

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.978
17,000 children in Gaza

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.079
are now unaccompanied

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:21.047
or have become separated

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:21.748
from their families.

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:23.850
In other words, they are now orphans.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.051
Their parents are dead

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.552
Now, this is the view from above.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:27.120
Khan Yunis,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.621
which is a little bit north of Rafah.

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.223
And as you can see, as a shot

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.157
slowly moves it

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:32.592
as it gets closer and closer and closer.

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:33.659
If you look at that,

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:34.060
you see

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.062
people are just going about their daily

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.663
lives, their living life.

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.532
And this is what life is now like.

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:40.533
For more than a million

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:41.768
and a half Palestinians,

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:42.668
this is reality that

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:43.603
they cramped into these

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:45.004
tent cities everywhere

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:47.006
and they are living in close quarters.

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:48.541
It's perfect for the spread of disease,

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:49.942
to say the least, in many ways.

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:52.178
Are you surprised that the disease

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:53.246
has not spread faster

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.580
and worse than it already has?

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.418
To some extent, yes.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:58.885
I mean,

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:00.153
it's also fair to say

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:02.021
that it's hard to really get

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:04.490
a full picture of all the numbers

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.658
the diseases.

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:06.058
You know,

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:07.860
there is no opportunity

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.662
to test people necessarily for

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:11.431
for a lot of things.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.132
But yes, and also, don't forget,

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:14.167
there is it's

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:16.269
very hard to get clean water in Gaza.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.937
It was hard to get

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:18.738
the water situation

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:20.706
before the conflict wasn't great.

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:22.508
Since October 7th,

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:25.611
it's been completely dismal.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.412
Water plans,

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:28.781
desalination plants are not working.

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:31.083
Water comes in literally drips and drabs

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.585
in bottled water.

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:35.121
And the trucks, if they come in,

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:35.688
which is

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:36.355
and there's not enough

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:37.623
of that happening either.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.525
So no clean water,

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:40.092
I think

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.260
what is it, one shower

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.062
for every thousand people or so.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:44.163
So people

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.699
There's no way to do proper hygiene.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.667
So, yeah,

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.168
it is not surprising

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:50.136
that many, many children

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.804
present with diarrhea

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.606
and infectious infections

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:54.474
diseases will spread.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.042
So in

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:57.543
terms of manmade disaster,

00:07:57.543 --> 00:07:59.178
which this is, it could end tomorrow.

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.012
Either Hamas could stop

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:00.980
using the population

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.415
in Gaza as human shields

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:03.149
or the Israeli government

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.451
could decide to stop killing children.

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:06.819
Is there anything comparable

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.788
to what's happening in Gaza right now

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:09.989
and the outsize impact

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.524
it's having on children?

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:13.826
You're absolutely right.

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.761
And both things need to happen.

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:16.996
It can't happen soon enough.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:20.600
No, I have never seen anything like this

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.502
manmade at this scale.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.136
That has such an impact on children

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:26.239
and civilians writ large.

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:28.074
And neither has the many, many,

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:29.509
many Ontarians

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.011
who made this their life's work.

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:32.912
Either.

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:35.014
You don't see the precedent.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.449
Yeah, it's tragic.

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:37.183
It's unprecedented,

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.151
and it defies words in so many ways.

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:39.852
Thank you for being with us.
