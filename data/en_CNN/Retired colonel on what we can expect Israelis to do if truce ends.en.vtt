00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:03.970
Israel has freed 180 Palestinians

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:04.771
from prison over

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.706
the first four days of the truce,

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:08.842
mainly women and minors.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.510
Many of them were detained

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.911
but never charged.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:12.879
Prison service officials

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.248
say that 30 were released yesterday.

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:15.749
CNN's Ben

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.617
Wedeman is live for us in Jerusalem.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:19.386
Ben, walk us through

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:20.553
the diplomatic efforts

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.622
to release more Palestinian prisoners

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:23.790
and detainees.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.162
Where is that conversation now?

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.330
Well, that's part

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.832
and parcel of the negotiations

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.435
over the Israeli hostages as well.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.603
And, of course, tonight

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:39.873
is the last day of the two day extension

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.641
that was agreed upon.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.277
And the diplomats are doing their best

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:45.945
to try to work out a formula

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.147
to extend it.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.615
We heard Majid Ansari,

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:49.416
the spokesman

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.317
for the Qatari foreign minister,

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:52.052
the Qataris,

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.653
of course, the linchpin

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:54.487
in these

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:55.722
negotiations,

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.857
saying that they are optimistic

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:00.860
that a more an agreement will be reached

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:04.030
to extend it at least for two days.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.965
And, of course, they are now looking

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:09.102
beyond the next two days because

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:12.172
officials negotiators say that

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:14.340
the number of women and children

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.444
currently being held in Gaza

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.579
will be exhausted after two days.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.181
And then it's going to be a question of

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.150
how do you deal with the civilian men

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.054
and the Israeli soldiers who are in Gaza?

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:31.057
And our understanding from the

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.859
foreign ministry spokesman

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:33.993
is that the next phase

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.996
is looking at civilian Israelis

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.732
being held inside Gaza.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:41.367
And we've seen, for instance, yesterday

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.503
William Burns, the head of the CIA,

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:44.170
was meeting

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.638
with Qatari, Egyptian

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.508
and Israeli officials in Doha.

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:50.610
Clearly, they're looking beyond

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.411
this phase

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:53.546
where the focus is on releasing

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.815
women and children in Gaza.

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:56.950
And, of course,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.753
the similar release of detainees

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:04.224
and prisoners held in Israeli jails.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.925
But at the moment,

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.594
there's still is no agreement

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:08.628
for an extension.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.697
So there always is that risk

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:13.099
if no agreement is reached.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.733
If fighting

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:16.736
could begin again, of course.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.670
Ben Wedeman,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.640
thank you so much for that update.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.509
And right now, negotiators are racing

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.910
to try to extend the truce

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.345
between Israel and Hamas.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.913
The current deal expiring

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.581
just hours from now.

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.984
This is more hostages arrive in Israel

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.752
after being released by Hamas.

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:34.921
Two sources telling CNN that at least one

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.890
American hostage is expected

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.392
to be handed over in the exchange today.

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:41.094
Let's get more now with CNN's M.J. Lee.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.096
She's live for us at the White House.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.264
M.J., tell us what you're hearing

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:47.133
from the Biden administration.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:48.334
Well, Brianna,

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.135
the White House

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:51.137
is certainly not commenting right now

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.139
on CNN's earlier reporting

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.241
that an American is expected

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.844
to be one of the hostages freed today.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:58.578
We are, of course,

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.747
still waiting for that day.

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:03.483
Six group of hostages to be released.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.084
If that were to happen,

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.786
it would mark the second time

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:08.855
that an American citizen is released

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.757
during the course of this truce.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:11.858
But just to remind you

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:12.892
what the White House

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:13.960
had initially said,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.429
they were hoping for and expecting

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.498
was for three Americans to be released

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.667
as part of the initial group

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.702
of 50 women and children.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:23.102
Of course,

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:23.903
we saw Abigail

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:25.538
adorn the four year old Israeli

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.173
American release on Sunday,

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:28.608
but no word whatsoever

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:29.209
from the White House

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.477
so far on the two other women

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:32.879
that were supposed to be released

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.380
as a part of that initial 50.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.848
So we are still waiting

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:37.450
for those hostages to be released.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.851
And we will learn

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.387
whether one American woman

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.223
ends up being a part of that release.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.490
But again, no comment on that

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.059
right now from the White House.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.460
Part of this agreement, M.J.,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.095
is that the International Red Cross

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:51.731
is supposed to get access

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.399
to to check on the hostages

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.901
that are still in Gaza,

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.035
and that has not happened.

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:57.303
Hamas has not allowed that.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:04:00.073
How is the U.S. responding?

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:01.040
Yeah, Brianna, a

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.242
part of the deal

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.644
really was that the red Cross officials

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:06.312
would be able to go in

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:07.647
and check on the hostages

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:09.849
that are still being held in Gaza,

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.684
get a sense of how they're doing

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:12.585
and really be able

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.921
to report back on the status

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.055
of some of these hostages.

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:18.057
And that has not happened yet.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.225
And we know that U.S.

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:20.493
officials are among

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:23.329
those that are pushing for this to happen

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:25.298
because it was a part of the agreement.

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.033
Of course, a lot of people are keen

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:28.268
to get a better sense

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.370
of how these hostages are doing,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.904
their conditions, their whereabouts.

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:33.673
Really, we have so little information

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:35.108
to work with right now.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.075
Our understanding

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.243
and our reporting is that

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:39.212
even though that does mark

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:41.314
a violation in the agreement,

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:42.749
that it's not at the point

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.851
where that is about to derail

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:45.718
this deal,

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.220
that it is still going to go on

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.388
as long as hostages

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:49.889
continue to be released.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.159
But we saw a statement from the Red Cross

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:54.093
president

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:55.561
saying that they are ready to go in,

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:56.296
but that they can't

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.864
really forcibly do that

00:04:57.864 --> 00:05:00.199
unless they get permission to do so.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:00.667
Basically,

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:01.234
they were saying

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.303
if they sort of force their force,

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.470
their way in

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.205
to try to check on these hostages, that

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:06.873
that could end up

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:08.408
actually endangering them.

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:10.043
So that's just one more reminder

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:11.511
of the sort of dangerous

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:12.745
and tenuous circumstances

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.347
that we're talking about here.

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:15.715
Yeah, certainly alarming.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:16.282
And obviously,

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:18.318
officials want to get some information

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.253
about those who are still in Gaza.

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.121
M.J. Lee live for us at the White House.

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.023
Thank you for us.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:24.557
Meantime,

00:05:24.557 --> 00:05:26.359
according to senior administration

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:27.360
officials, the U.S.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.661
has urged Israel

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.796
to be more precise

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.331
in targeting Hamas in Gaza,

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.765
especially in the south,

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:33.833
where many civilians

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.835
were told to flee for safety.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.170
The Palestinian Ministry of Health

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.770
in the West Bank

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.440
says that nearly 15,000 people

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.542
have been killed since October 7th.

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:45.011
Tens of thousands more have been injured.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:45.545
Let's bring in

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:47.246
CNN military analyst, retired

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:48.214
Air Force Colonel Cedric

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:49.449
Leighton to discuss.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.385
Colonel, if Israel agrees to this U.S.

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:55.154
suggestion of a more targeted approach,

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:56.889
what does that actually look like?

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:57.557
So, Boris,

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:59.125
there are a lot of different aspects

00:05:59.125 --> 00:05:59.525
to this.

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.094
And precision is kind of

00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:02.628
in the eye of the beholder.

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:03.763
What you're talking about here

00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:06.132
is when you look at the Israeli forces,

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:07.333
the light blue is

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:08.868
where their clearing operations

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:09.602
have taken place.

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:10.002
They're looking

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.871
at the northern part of Gaza

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.406
and the central part of Gaza,

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:15.508
kind of all around Gaza City.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:18.077
The dark blue shows that the furthest

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:20.213
this is the furthest point of advancement

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.181
for the Israeli forces.

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:23.149
Now, when you talk

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:25.852
about precision strikes, let's do it.

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:26.452
Let's take a quick

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:29.455
look at this video right here, because

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:32.892
this is something that is not precise.

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:35.128
What you're dealing with here is

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:36.629
there are certain aspects of this

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.131
where you can see

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:40.133
where they struck certain areas.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:42.602
But all of this has been obliterated.

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:44.404
That is an example of

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.272
not really a precision strike.

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:48.508
This is more of a deliberate strike

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:50.910
that goes across a wide area.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.513
The areas that you're talking about here

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:54.947
are ones that,

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:55.181
you know,

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.749
clearly have civilian applications.

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.684
You see a washing machine right there.

00:06:58.684 --> 00:06:59.852
You see a hole

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:00.153
right here

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:01.087
where a bomb crater

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.623
dragged through this particular building.

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:05.057
That's the kind of thing

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:06.926
that if you targeted directly,

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.294
that is a precision strike.

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:10.463
But all this rest of this destruction

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:13.466
is not emblematic of a precision strike.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:14.233
So precision

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:15.368
being in the eye of the beholder.

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:16.903
It appears that there's a difference

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:18.738
between the US definition

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:20.773
of a precision strike and Israeli.

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:21.674
Is that a fair assessment?

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:22.742
That is a fair assessment

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:23.810
because when the Israelis

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.844
are looking at this,

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:27.079
they really have certain

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.080
they're constrained by

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.515
some of the weapons that they have,

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:31.451
but they are also constrained, by the way

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.152
in which they employ those weapons.

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:33.953
And one of the key

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.054
things that they're doing

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:36.122
is they believe that

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.256
they need to take out

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:39.725
a wide swath of this,

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:40.359
these areas,

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:41.394
because, for example,

00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:44.931
if you go into the map of Gaza itself,

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:46.232
all of this area right

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.367
here was ordered to be evacuated.

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:49.769
And the reason for that

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:52.205
is because of the strikes that we saw

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:53.372
in the example of the video

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:54.774
in Khan Yunis.

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:57.376
The rest of Gaza is also

00:07:57.376 --> 00:07:59.145
subject to these kinds of strikes,

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.980
and that can really result

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.281
in a lot of civilian casualties,

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:04.317
even more than the 15,000

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.252
or so that may have been killed

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:07.487
during this period.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.855
Colonel, let's go back to that

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:09.722
initial map,

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:11.858
because we're a few hours

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.960
away from this sort of temporary truce

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.361
potentially expiring there.

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:16.863
Officials that are working to extend it

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:17.663
right now.

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:18.731
But if it does wind up

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:21.200
expiring and hostilities resume,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.202
where do you see that playing out?

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:26.205
So let's take a look right here at

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.406
these areas right here,

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:27.874
of course,

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.509
where the Israelis have a presence

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.443
right now.

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:31.777
We can expect them to do

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:33.946
is move into these areas

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:35.948
right here, into Gaza City,

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:38.951
basically taking out every single thing

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:41.420
that they can find in in these areas.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.155
They can do that potentially.

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:44.991
They can also come in this way

00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:47.093
and cut off the

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:49.262
any retreat by Hamas

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:51.063
from here into the south.

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:52.598
The southern area is one

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:53.966
in which they are hoping

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:54.600
the Israelis

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.234
are hoping

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.469
to have kind of an area

00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:57.937
where they can put

00:08:57.937 --> 00:08:59.805
a lot of the civilian population.

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.641
They've actually offered an area

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.776
up as kind of a safe haven.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:06.646
But that is something that is very small,

00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:08.447
very small area near Khan Yunis.

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:09.315
And it is an area

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:11.717
that is really not conducive

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.953
to keeping people there for a long time.

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:16.022
And it's also not conducive

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:16.856
to allowing

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:18.958
for further military operations

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:19.425
in this area,

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:21.060
because you could find

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.162
a lot of Hamas fighters in an area

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:24.597
like this, as well as who is

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:24.931
Israel

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:26.365
has kind of double challenges

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.734
in this in this particular situation

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:30.336
when it comes to humanitarian aid.

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:30.870
I want to go back

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.938
to the video of Khan Younis,

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.339
because this, I think, underscores

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:35.074
the point that there is immense

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:37.443
need among the civilian population

00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:38.611
in different parts of Gaza.

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:40.880
Obviously, this is just one example.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.114
What happens to the flow

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:44.016
of humanitarian aid

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:47.720
and the aid that's already in Gaza once

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.121
hostilities resumed?

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:50.723
So the aid that already is

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:51.457
has been sent into

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:54.093
Gaza is at risk of being destroyed

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:56.362
and stockpiles that they have anything

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:58.364
that could be used, food stuffs,

00:09:58.364 --> 00:09:59.532
you know, clothing

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.233
during the cold months of the year,

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:02.368
all of these kinds of things.

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:03.636
Shelter obviously,

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:05.671
with this kind of stuff you see.

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:08.374
But that could all be eliminated.

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:08.941
And Khan

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:09.809
Yunis was an area

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:12.979
that was not specifically set aside

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:14.547
for military operations.

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:15.348
It was supposed to be

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:16.882
in a safer part of Gaza.

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:17.516
And you see what's

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:19.218
happened to that already.

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:20.786
Now, Colonel Cedric Clinton, always

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.655
appreciate the perspective again.

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:23.522
Right now,

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:25.091
the temporary truce

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:26.892
set to expire in a matter of hours.

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:28.260
Officials are working to extend

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.362
that as we speak.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:30.363
Thanks so much for the perspective,

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:31.130
as always. You bet.
