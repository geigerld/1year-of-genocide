Back now to our breaking news here in the Middle East. A massive explosion at the largest refugee camp in Gaza. Joining us now is Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht. He's the international spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces. Thanks so much for joining us. I want to ask you first about this massive blast that we all just saw. We saw the video at the Jabalya refugee camp in Gaza. Is there anything more you can, first of all, tell us about how this explosion happened? I will. Thanks for having me. So we'll be coming out in the next hopefully hour with more data. But I can update you now that there was a very senior Hamas commander in that area. Sadly, he was hiding again, as they do behind the within civilians. And that's all I can say at this point. We're looking into it and we'll be coming out with more data as we learn what happened there. A lot of individuals. So can you confirm it was an Israeli attack that destroyed a big chunk of that Jabalya refugee camp? Yes, I can. We when we were focused on the target as your senior commander, Wolf, I will be updating you with more data as the hour moves ahead. But even if that Hamas commander was there, amidst all those Palestinian refugees who are in there in that Jabalya refugee camp, Israel still went ahead and dropped a bomb there attempting to kill this Hamas campus. Hamas commander. Knowing that a lot of innocent civilians, men, women and children, presumably would be killed, is that what I'm hearing, that the United States and that's not what you're hearing, Wolf. We again, we're focused on this commander, again, who you'll get more Doctor who this man was killed, many, many Israelis. And we're doing everything we can. It's a very complicated battle space. That could be infrastructure there. There could be tunnels there. And we're still looking into and we'll give you more data as there are moves ahead. But you know that there are a lot of refugees, a lot of innocent civilians, men, women and children in that refugee camp as well. Right. This is the tragedy of war, Wolf. I mean, we as you know, we've been saying for days, move south. If aliens are not involved with Hamas, please move south. And just trying to get more information. You knew there were civilians there. You knew there were refugees, all sorts of refugees. But you decided to still drop a bomb on that refugee camp attempting to kill this Hamas commander. By the way, was he killed? And whether or not that is. I can't confirm yet. There will be more updated. Yes, we know that he was killed and by the civilians there. We're doing everything we can to minimize. I'll tell you, I'll say again, badly. They are hiding themselves within civilian population. And again, we are doing this stage by stage, and we're going to go after every one of these terrorists who was involved in that genius attack on the 7th of October Wolf.
