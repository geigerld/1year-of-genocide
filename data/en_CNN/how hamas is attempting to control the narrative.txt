&gt;&gt; BROCK RAVID, THANK YOU SO  MUCH. APPRECIATE IT.  &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, ANDERSON. &gt;&gt;&gt; MORE NOW ON WHAT HAMAS HAS  BEEN SAYING TO THE WORLD ON  ARABIC LANGUAGE PROGRAMS IN THE  MIDDLE EAST, AND WHAT ITS  SPOKESMAN AND LEADERS ARE NOT  SAYING WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE  BARBARITY OF ITS ATTACKS OF  CIVILIANS ON OCTOBER 7th. RANDI KAYE HAS THAT.  &gt;&gt; THE EXISTENCE OF ISRAEL IS  ILLOGICAL.  &gt;&gt; Reporter: HAMAS TRYING TO  CONTROL THE NARRATIVE.  WHAT CAUSES ALL THAT PAIN,  BLOOD, AND TEARS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT'S GAZI HAMAD,  A SENIOR HAMAS OFFICIAL,  SPEAKING OUT ON LEBANESE TV. IN THE CLIP, HE SQUARELY BLAMES  ISRAEL FOR CAUSING THE OCTOBER  MASSACRE CARRIED OUT BY HAMAS  THAT LEFT MORE THAN 1400 PEOPLE  DEAD. &gt;&gt; IT IS ISRAEL, NOT US. WE ARE VICTIMS OF THE  OCCUPATION, PERIOD. THEREFORE, NOBODY SHOULD BLAME  US FOR THE THINGS WE DO. ON OCTOBER 7th, OCTOBER 10th,  OCTOBER ONE MILLION, EVERYTHING  WE DO IS JUSTIFIED. WE MUST TEACH ISRAEL A LESSON,  AND WILL DO THIS AGAIN AND  AGAIN. THE AL AQSA FLOOD IS JUST A  FIRST TIME. AND THERE WILL BE A SECOND, A  THIRD, A FOURTH, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE DETERMINATION, THE  CAPABILITIES AND THE RESOLVE TO  CONTINUE TO FIGHT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: PLAYING THE ROLE OF VICTIM, THE TERROR ORGANIZATION  DESIGNATED A TERROR GROUP BY THE U.S. IS TRYING TO CONVINCE  PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD THAT  HAMAS' ATTACK ON ISRAEL WAS  JUSTIFIED. DESPITE ITS OWN RANDOM KILLING  OF HUNDREDS OF UNARMED ISRAELI  CIVILIANS AND COMMITTING  BARBARIC ACTS, ONE HAMAS LEADER  SPUN ISRAEL'S RETALIATION THIS  WAY IN A SPEECH. &gt;&gt; Translator: WE ASSURE THE  ENEMY AND WHOEVER IS BEHIND IT  THAT YOUR PATHETIC ATTEMPTS TO  CONCEAL YOUR OWN DEFEAT BY  COMMITTING BARBARIC MASSACRES  AGAINST UNARMED CIVILIANS WITH  VILLAIN ANY WILL NOT SAVE YOU  FROM ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN THE AL  AQSA FLOOD.  &gt;&gt; Reporter: AND THOSE HOSTAGES  HAMAS IS HOLDING IN GAZA? HAMAS, IN TRYING TO SOFTEN ITS  IMAGE, NOW REFERS TO THEM AS  GUESTS. &gt;&gt; Translator: WE KEEP A DIVERSE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY  UNDER TEMPORARY CUSTODY, HAILING FROM DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE CONSIDERED OUR ESTEEMED GUESTS AND OUR  PRIMARY GOAL IS TO ENSURE THEIR  SAFETY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THIS HAMAS LEADER  ALSO USED ARAB TV TO MAKE THE  CASE THAT HAMAS DIDN'T WANT TO  KILL ISRAELI CIVILIANS, DESPITE  THE FACT THAT VIDEO FROM THE  GUNMEN'S OWN BODY CAMERAS SHOW  THEM DOING SO ON PURPOSE AND  ENJOYING IT. &gt;&gt; Translator: WE DID NOT WANT  TO HARM CIVILIANS, BUT THERE  WERE COMPLICATIONS ON THE  GROUND, AND THERE WAS A PARTY IN THE AREA WITH POPULATION. IT WAS A LARGE AREA ACROSS 40  KILOMETERS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AND WHEN FACTS GET  IN THE WAY OF HAMAS' MESSAGE,  LIKE DURING THIS INTERVIEW WITH  THE BBC, HAMAS SHUTS DOWN THE  INTERVIEW. &gt;&gt; I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY INTENTION OR DECISION  TO KILL THE CIVILIANS. &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY KILLING  PEOPLE AS THEY SLEEP, YOU KNOW,  FAMILIES? HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY? &gt;&gt; I WANT TO STOP THIS  TELEVISION. I WANT TO STOP THIS INTERVIEW.
