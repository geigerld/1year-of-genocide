00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.459
This is a video of the

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:02.711
aftermath of a strike

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:05.463
in the Al-Shati Refugee Camp in Gaza,

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:07.090
according to journalists working for CNN.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.966
The attack came

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.801
during intense Israeli bombardment

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.136
a bombing Sunday night.

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:12.554
The IDF has not commented

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:13.596
on the incident.

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:14.889
United Nations officials today

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.725
said 70% of people in the Gaza

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:17.809
Strip are displaced.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:18.852
Many living conditions

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.353
and living in conditions

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.814
a statement called, quote, inhumane.

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:23.773
The secretary general said

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:24.941
the Gaza is becoming

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.235
a, quote, graveyard for children.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.446
Israel's ambassador to the U.N.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.448
lashed out at those at the comments

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:32.323
called for the secretary

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.783
general's resignation.

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:36.911
Emily Kelly Callahan is a nurse activity

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:40.123
manager for Doctors Without Borders, MSF

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.624
She was evacuated

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:42.792
last Wednesday and arrived

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:46.087
back in the US just over the weekend.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.131
First of all, how does it feel to be out?

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.801
A lot of people keep asking me that

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:54.095
and I really don't have a good answer.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.974
I obviously have a sense of relief

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:00.435
that I'm home and I'm with my family and

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.191
feel safe for the first time in 26 days

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:09.694
and I'm having a really hard time finding

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:12.822
any joy in any of it.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.657
Because me being safe is the result

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.493
of having to leave people behind.

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:17.160
People watching

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.621
this have seen images from Gaza and

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.623
they've seen the hospital images

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:25.126
they've seen the horror of children dead.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.922
Day after day after day after day.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.966
I mean, they've seen all the images

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.009
but to actually be there

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:33.676
and to experience

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:35.178
it, you're experiencing all these things

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:37.472
which a camera can never capture.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:39.307
So can you just talk a little bit about

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.435
what stand

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:43.478
when you close your eyes at night,

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:45.897
what is it you think about now?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.235
I think

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:52.821
the answer to that question,

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.614
I think I'll start at KITV,

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:55.698
which was we were

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:57.367
we were relocated about five times

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:58.701
over the course of 26 days

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.537
due to security concerns.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.205
And one of the places we wound up

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.582
was the Communist Training Center.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:05.500
We call it quits.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.959
That's when people

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.127
that evacuated to the South Sea

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:07.961
or in the south.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:08.253
And then

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.295
we went to

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.463
below what he calls a line

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:13.508
and there were by the time we left there,

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.218
there were 35,000

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.428
internally displaced people

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:18.930
living alongside us.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.684
There were children with just massive

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:25.145
burns down their faces, down their necks,

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.938
all over their limbs.

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:28.356
And because the hospitals

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:29.440
are so overwhelmed,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.526
they are being discharged immediately

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:32.026
after

00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:33.403
and they're being discharged

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.237
to these camps

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:36.656
with no access to running water.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.449
There's 50,000 people at that camp now

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:39.742
in four toilets.

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:41.369
They're given 2 hours of water

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:42.912
every 12 hours.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.373
And the toilets for 50,000 people. Yes.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:47.750
And that's where we were living too.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.919
And they have these fresh open

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.171
burns and wounds

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.922
and partial amputations

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:54.340
that are just walking around

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.216
these conditions.

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.885
And parents

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:57.969
are bringing their children

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.470
to us, going, Please, can you help?

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.805
Please? Can you help?

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:02.182
And we have no supplies

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.184
when in situations

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.268
where there are

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.686
tens of thousands of people

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.104
and it is a war

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.899
and people don't can't feed their kids.

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:12.775
Things get

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.194
strange very fast

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.987
and things get tough very, very fast

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.322
and people turn on each other.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.908
You saw that up close

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:20.867
at sea.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.328
We were the reason we had to leave

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:24.204
was because we were starting

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.830
to be harassed.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.958
People, desperate people

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.669
who are losing loved ones right and left

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:33.254
are angry.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:35.924
And they would point at me and scream

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.508
American walking past.

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:38.134
And at that point,

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:40.303
we had no idea what was coming

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.763
in the next few days. And

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:43.306
they would

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.766
yell things in Hebrew

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.601
to see if we were Israeli.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.687
They accused our national staff of either

00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:51.606
being traitors or

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:52.690
said, you're

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.108
you're pretending to be Arab.

00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:54.609
We know that.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.611
You're just pretending to be Arab.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:57.695
Stop lying to us

00:03:57.695 --> 00:03:59.197
and our staff had to defend themselves.

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:01.616
And we said to them over and over again,

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:02.617
you don't have to stay.

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:04.327
We understand if you want to leave us.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:05.745
And they said, you are family, too,

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:06.871
and we're not going anywhere.

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:07.580
Your staff,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.831
the Palestinians

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.208
who worked for MSF,

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:10.583
for Doctors

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:11.084
Without Borders,

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.378
we're concerned about your safety.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.921
We would have died within a week

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.005
without them.

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.174
They they are the only reason

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:18.967
we are alive.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:22.595
It's incredible that this took so long

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.723
to get Americans sick.

00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:28.184
People start to move through

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.227
that Rafah border crossing.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.020
It's it's inexplicable.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.188
And we were desperate.

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:33.606
We we did a calorie

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:34.357
count at one point

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.316
based on our supplies

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.067
and figured out that

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:37.485
if all of us there's 50

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:38.069
people with us

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.862
living in a parking lot now,

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:42.240
only eight 700 calories a day,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.366
if that's all we had.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.076
We had two days of food left

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.244
and that's it.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.746
And our national staff took off.

00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:50.206
We had no cell service at that point.

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.457
So we had no idea

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.458
what had happened to them.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.419
There's bombs going off all around us

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.421
because there's no safe place in Gaza,

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.089
even getting through that Rafah

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.008
border crossing. What was that like?

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.885
They didn't leave our side for a second.

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:04.304
You're the national staff

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.055
because they feared for your safety,

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:07.473
even at the border crossing,

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:08.683
they made sure they were standing

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.310
between us and desperate people.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.811
They made sure that they were talking

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:12.603
to every official

00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:14.147
that they could find, trying to push us

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.398
through, trying to get us on the bus,

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:16.316
trying to get us out.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.025
And we're sitting there

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:17.233
and we're

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.485
watching these incredible men

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:21.279
who have sacrificed everything

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.738
for us,

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:22.739
who have sacrificed time

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:23.448
with their families,

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.741
their own physical safety,

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.117
their own water supply.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:27.785
They were giving to us.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:28.953
And we're watching them fight

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.163
to get us across the border

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:30.913
knowing that

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:33.082
we were not bringing them with us.

00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:35.752
And they didn't they didn't waiver.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.296
Abraham was right in the front

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.714
with our passports, fighting

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:40.965
so hard to get us on.

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:43.551
And we get to Irish that night and find

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:44.510
out his parents are dead.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:45.887
They were

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:49.182
losing family members and friends.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.517
You said if

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:52.769
if it wasn't for your national staff,

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.188
you think you would have been killed

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:58.358
by people who were just desperate?

00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.984
We either would have starved to death

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:01.402
or run out of water.

00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:02.737
They were the ones that negotiated

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:03.321
all of that.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.490
They Gaza is a small city,

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.783
so everyone knows everyone.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.409
And they would call in favors

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:09.494
and call their friends and say,

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:10.536
who do you know that has food?

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:11.954
Who do you know that's open?

00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:12.914
Where can we get this?

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.707
And they would drive all over the place

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:16.334
to find water.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.835
And when we ran out of bottled

00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:18.669
water in Gaza,

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.922
they were the ones that were able

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:21.923
to figure out

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.466
that the water truck was coming here

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:24.425
at these times.

00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:26.010
And, oh, I know

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.261
this guy has a grocery store

00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:28.679
and they still have power.

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:29.597
Sometimes I think I can

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:30.848
probably get something from them.

00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:31.849
Like when I say

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:32.809
we would have starved to death

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.228
without them. I'm I'm not exaggerating

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:36.896
And in the

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:37.980
moments of absolute

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.191
desperation of civilians,

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.985
they were steadfast and calm

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:45.196
and just talked to them and said,

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.364
these people are also

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:47.407
in the same boat that you are.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.408
They have no supplies.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:49.951
They also have no food and water.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.035
They are also sleeping

00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:52.578
outside on the concrete

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:56.082
and did it in such a

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:57.667
beautiful way that they were able

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.711
to talk them down with love and kindness.

00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:02.296
There was no violence in their heart

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:03.297
and it calmed everyone

00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:05.508
around them down as well.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:07.135
Would you go back to Gaza?

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.594
In a heartbeat?

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:10.596
In an absolute heartbeat.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:11.639
My heart is in Gaza.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.182
It will stay in Gaza.

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:14.308
The Palestinian people

00:07:14.308 --> 00:07:14.725
that I worked

00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:16.936
with both our national staff

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:17.770
in the office

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.147
as well as my staff at Indonesia

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:21.149
Hospital were some of the most incredible

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.483
people I've ever met in my life.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.778
Whenever a thing

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:26.946
went off

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.322
and we got the notice to move

00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:30.074
south of Wadi, Gaza,

00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:31.367
I was texting my

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:32.952
my nurses at Indonesia Hospital

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.162
and I said,

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:37.623
we we lost a nurse weekend one.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.959
He was killed when the ambulance outside

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.752
the hospital was blown up

00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:43.087
and I was texting them

00:07:43.087 --> 00:07:44.422
when we got the evacuation orders

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:45.840
and I said, Did any of you move south?

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.008
Did any of you get out

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:48.718
or any of you coming down this way?

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.345
And the only answer I got was,

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:52.805
this is our community.

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:53.681
This is our family,

00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:55.725
these are our friends.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.059
If they're going to kill us,

00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:57.685
we're going to die

00:07:57.685 --> 00:07:59.812
saving as many people as we can.

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.147
And I said, If I can ever

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.732
have an ounce of

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.609
the heart

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:06.360
that you have, I will

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.695
I will die a happy person.

00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:09.322
They were incredible.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.948
I would like to send out a reminder

00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:12.283
that there are civilians seeking

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:12.992
shelter there

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.577
and that my doctors and nurses

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.287
didn't leave out of loyalty

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:17.872
to their community.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.790
And I know that there is an idea

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:20.666
being pushed right now

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:21.584
that anyone that stayed

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:22.543
behind

00:08:22.543 --> 00:08:24.086
is going to be considered

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:25.630
some kind of a threat.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.298
And I want to remind people

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:27.924
that the people

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.592
that stayed behind our heroes,

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:30.843
the people that stayed behind,

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.179
are they know they're going to die

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.805
and they're choosing to stay behind

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:35.765
anyway.

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:37.683
We're trying our doctors, nurses

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:38.893
in the hospital.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:41.437
I wake up every morning

00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:43.731
and I send out a text message and I ask

00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:44.941
Are you alive?

00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:46.776
And every night before I go to sleep,

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:47.818
I send another message and

00:08:47.818 --> 00:08:48.611
says, Are you alive?

00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:50.905
Well, Kelly,

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.782
thank you so much for your time.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:53.324
Thank you.
