SIDNER. SHE'S JOINING US FROM JERUSALEM. ISRAEL HAS BEEN CONDUCTING  RAIDING IN THE WEST BANK AS IT  WAGES THIS WAR AGAINST HAMAS. HOW EXTENSIVE ARE THESE ISRAELI  MILITARY OPERATIONS? &gt;&gt; Reporter: VERY EXTENSIVE TO  SAY THE LEAST. THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAID THAT  IT HAD BEEN CONDUCTING WIDE  SCALE WHAT IT CALLS  COUNTERTERRORISM ACTIVITY IN THE WEST BANK WHERE THEY HAVE  ARRESTED MORE THAN 60  PALESTINIANS IN THE LAST DAY OR  SO. I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT THE  TENSIONS IN THE WEST BANK VERY,  VERY HIGH. ESPECIALLY AFTER THAT BLAST AT  THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE THE  PALESTINIANS BASICALLY DO NOT  BELIEVE THE ISRAELI EVIDENCE OR  ISRAELI MILITARY INTELLIGENCE  THAT ISRAEL WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE  FOR THAT BLAST. AND THEY DON'T BELIEVE U.S.  INTELLIGENCE THAT SEEMS TO AT  THIS POINT CONFIRM THE ISRAELI  INTELLIGENCE. THEY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS  UNDERTAKEN BY ISRAEL AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY CERTAINLY  CANNOT FORGIVE AND HAVE BEEN OUT PROTESTING IN VERY LARGE  NUMBERS. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SMALLER  SCALE CLASHES THAT HAVE ENDED IN DEATHS OF PALESTINIANS. THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITIES SAY  THERE WERE ABOUT SEVEN  PALESTINIANS WHO HAVE BEEN  KILLED OVERNIGHT DURING ONE OF  THOSE RAIDS BY THE ISRAELI  MILITARY. AND SO, YOU KNOW, THE ISRAELI  MILITARY SAYS IN THAT OPERATION  IN TOKARENE, THEY WENT INTO A  REFUGEE CAMP AND ENDED UP  ARRESTING ABOUT TEN PEOPLE  THERE. SEVEN PALESTINIANS ACCORDING TO  THE PA, WERE KILLED. THAT IS JUST RATCHETING UP THE  TENSIONS AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE IN THE WEST BANK, WHICH IS NOT RUN  BY HAMAS. IT IS RUN BY WHAT THE  INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY  RECOGNIZES AS THE LEADER OF THE  PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, THE  PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, WOLF. &gt;&gt; HOW FEARFUL ARE PALESTINIANS  ON THE WEST BANK OF ISRAELI  SETTLER VIOLENCE? &gt;&gt; Reporter: THERE HAVE BEEN AN  UPTICK, A BIG UPTICK, OF  VIOLENCE BY SETTLERS AGAINST  PALESTINIANS. I DON'T KNOW IF THE WORD IS  FEAR, BUT IT'S MORE ANGER. IT'S MORE RAGE IN HAVING TO DEAL WITH THAT AS WELL. WE DO KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN  AN UPTICK BECAUSE OF THIS GROUP  NAMED BAIT SALEM AND OTHERS  LOOKING AT THE ACTIVITY OF  SETTLERS IN THE AREA WHICH HAS  ALWAYS BEEN A FLASH POINT OF  PALESTINIANS EVERYWHERE, BUT  PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST BANK. I WANTED TO LET YOU SEE WHAT  BAIT SALEM GROUP, THIS GROUP  THAT TRACKS SETTLER VIOLENCE,  THAT BELIEVES IT'S A FULL  OCCUPATION BY ISRAEL THAT NEEDS  TO END. THEY SAY THE SETTLER VIOLENCE  AGAINST PALESTINIANS HAS RISEN  IN BOTH FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY  WITH SOLDIERS AND POLICE  OFFICERS FULLY BACKING THE  ASSAILANTS UNDER THE COVER OF  WAR. SETTLERS ARE CARRYING OUT SUCH  ASSAULTS VIRTUALLY UNCHECKED. THAT IS THE GROUP, THE ISRAELI  HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THERE ARE ABOUT 700,000 SETTLERS IN THE  WEST BANK BUT CONVERSELY,  THEY'RE TERRIFIED AS WELL AND  THEY'LL TELL YOU SO. THEY CONSTANTLY SAY, LOOK, WE  FEEL LIKE WE ARE JUST DEFENDING  OURSELVES. OUR FAMILIES. SO YOU HAVE THIS AWFUL BACK AND  FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS BUT INTERNATIONALLY, THE SETTLEMENTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AND ARE  CONSIDERED ILLEGAL BUT THIS IS A BATTLE THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON  LONG BEF
