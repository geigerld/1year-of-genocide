00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.967
Just to

00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.635
speak to the significance

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:04.704
of what it means here in Israel.

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:06.272
Everywhere you go,

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:08.541
you see the fliers of these hostages,

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:10.377
the ones that you see in the U.S.

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:12.278
and London and other countries.

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:13.279
And you can see there,

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.381
that is the convoy.

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.216
We don't know who's inside this convoy,

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.717
but you can see, John, that convoy

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:18.418
making its way

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.552
through the Rafah

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:20.053
crossing

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:23.089
that is a crossing between Gaza and Egypt

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.356
right now.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.692
You can hear cheers

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.261
and horns honking

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:37.070
on

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:50.417
again.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.284
We're looking at pictures

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:51.684
right now

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:55.488
from the Rafah crossing of a convoy

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.524
moving through with beeping

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:59.426
and honking at the Red Cross convoy.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.828
We cannot know for certain

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.297
who is part of that convoy right now,

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:06.466
if the hostages are part of it.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.535
But you did hear some honking,

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:09.669
some celebration there.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:10.203
Unclear to me

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:11.538
exactly where that celebration

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:12.305
would be coming from

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:14.040
if it was

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.741
the Red Cross

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.676
convoy carrying those hostages.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.611
But we are seeing that activity at Rafah

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.313
right here, which will be a key

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:21.915
transit point, Katelyn,

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.084
for these hostages as they move through.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.952
And you brought up another point here.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.454
One of the things, the developments

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:28.588
the twists

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.090
today is not

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.358
only has the number of hostages

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:33.626
been turned over

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:34.327
from Hamas

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:34.661
to the Red

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.030
Cross, believed to be Israeli hostages,

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.098
but several

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.933
Thai hostages, people

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.734
from Thailand who had been held.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:42.535
We understand

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.137
they've been turned over as well.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.072
And it's not completely clear

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.674
if those two groups are traveling

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:48.708
together or separate

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:49.642
at this point, Kaitlin?

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:52.579
Yeah, that is still something

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.880
that we're trying to figure out.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.749
And this is a really fast moving process.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.184
I mean, it's taking time for them

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.385
to get from place to place.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.254
But there are several different layers

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:01.821
of government

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.323
involved here, different governments

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.191
that are involved in this process.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.092
This had been something

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:07.260
that as we were hearing,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.161
as Israel and Hamas

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.662
were getting closer to this deal,

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.831
which was being negotiated by Qatar,

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:12.932
that there were also questions

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.167
of other governments

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:15.201
also negotiating

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.469
for their foreign nationals

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.805
who were being held by Hamas in Gaza

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.206
to also be released.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:21.374
You know, a lot of these

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:22.142
that we had heard of

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.377
that had been taken into into Gaza.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:25.778
The point of this

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:26.846
and what we were hearing

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.314
as we were talking about this

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.849
from the ideological perspective is

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.084
a lot of these were laborers

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.552
who were at the kibbutz.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:33.753
And that is something that we heard,

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:34.854
you know, when I went to kibbutz

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:35.622
is a theme.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:36.723
They talked about the laborers

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:38.625
who had just been been working there

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:39.225
at that

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:40.960
that particular kibbutz

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.761
and the fact that they had

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.630
also been taken hostage.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.597
Some of these are people who

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:46.432
they're not Jewish they're not Israeli.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.601
Yet they were also taken by Hamas

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.402
into Gaza.

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:50.370
And so that is something

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.804
we're watching with the numbers here,

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:52.438
because that has been

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.073
another critical part of this

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:54.974
is that ultimately

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:55.375
we're told

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.610
it's 50 hostages that are being released.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.546
We got this additional information

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:00.713
just a short time ago

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.448
ago from Egyptian officials

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:03.783
that these Thai nationals

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:05.251
are also part of this.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.219
It is still a question

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:06.886
of whether or not

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.055
they are moving in this group together,

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.823
whether all of them were in that convoy

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:11.858
that we saw just passed

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.459
through the Rafah crossing.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.227
Those are things

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.895
that we'll have better clarity on

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:17.263
once they've made it through.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:17.931
We do know

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:18.765
Israel expects

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:19.899
to publish a list of

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.768
who has made it into Israel.

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:23.403
Once those hostages have made it here.

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.638
They said they will not do so beforehand.

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:26.573
And so that is something

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:28.074
that we're watching very closely.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:28.308
I know

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:30.376
CNN's international anchor Becky Anderson

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.111
also tracking this closely.

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:32.545
And Becky,

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.346
you've been checking in

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:34.214
with sources

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.748
about the Thai nationals

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.250
who are also being released

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.551
by Hamas today.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.286
What else are you hearing about?

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:40.920
Not just that,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.689
but also what we just saw happen,

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:43.823
that convoy

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.358
the Red Cross convoy passing

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:46.659
through the Rafah crossing.

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:48.728
That's right.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.864
They just left Gaza through that crossing

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:53.366
and they will be making their way

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.101
through that crossing on a few.

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:55.668
If you were doing

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:56.869
that as a normal individual,

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:57.737
it would take some time

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:58.705
to get through that crossing.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:03:59.138
But clearly,

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:00.840
that Red Cross convoy

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.908
will move very quickly

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.143
through that crossing and into Egypt.

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:05.845
As we understand it,

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:07.113
this group of Israeli

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:09.916
hostages are traveling in the same convoy

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:11.951
as these Thai nationals,

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.286
Thai nationals

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:16.723
and their release was a separate

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:20.093
and unconditional deal and struck.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:24.297
And separately from the hostage deal,

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.299
Hamas, Israel,

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.234
that was baked into this wider

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:29.769
humanitarian pause.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.704
I did put this question

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:32.905
about whether there was

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:36.075
any separate tracks being negotiated

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.377
by the

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:38.511
country mediators

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:39.512
to the spokesman

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:41.814
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:42.782
Just yesterday,

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.284
and he described this

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.652
without answering the question

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:46.853
specifically.

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:47.787
He described this

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.923
as a humanitarian effort.

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:52.592
So I think what we can understand

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:53.159
from that

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.228
is that the Thai minister

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:58.765
who was here in Doha a week or so ago,

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.502
had successfully worked with the country

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:04.470
mediation team with support

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.072
from the Egyptians and others,

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:07.373
including the United States.

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:08.641
Of course, he's been

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.143
very, very, very involved

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.045
in what has been going on between

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:13.346
Israel and Hamas.

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:16.749
The Thais have been able to to pull off

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.052
a separate and unconditional deal

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:20.286
to ensure

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:22.455
that some of those Thai nationals

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:24.991
who got caught up in this workers

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.192
at these

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:27.794
at these kibbutzim

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.295
have also been released.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:31.297
Now, I think we have to be very clear

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:33.833
that we are not absolutely sure

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.135
of the numbers as we understood it.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.904
We were looking at 12

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:39.972
Thai nationals to be released

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:44.277
into ICR hands, ICRC hands today.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.612
And of course as we understood it,

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:47.914
there will be 13

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:50.850
Israeli hostages released by Hamas

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.952
as part of the main deal

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:53.820
to be released

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.321
into the hands of the ICRC.

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:56.823
I think what we need to do now

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.391
is just wait to see

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:00.760
who is in those convoys

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:04.364
as they leave Egypt

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:07.934
and then make their way into Israel

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:08.701
if indeed that is

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:09.936
what the ties are doing.

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.604
One probably make a

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:12.672
sort of a loose assumption

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:13.206
that everybody

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.340
will be traveling

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.843
together now into Israel,

00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:18.611
into the hands of the IDF.

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.012
And we've been reporting

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.748
all morning, haven't we, about the

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:23.282
the sensitivities

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:24.183
with which

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:25.017
the IDF

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:25.685
will be dealing

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:27.820
with those Israeli hostages

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.822
and specifically the

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:32.158
and we have to assume that they've got

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:33.192
we know that they got

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:34.260
specific instructions

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.595
about how to deal with the

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:37.130
with the kids who've been,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.899
you know, through this traumatic ordeal.

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:40.800
One can I mean, one

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.001
can't even imagine it.

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:42.969
I mean, I'm a mom,

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.971
but you don't have to be a mom to

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:46.973
to to try and imagine

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:48.975
what it is that everybody's been through,

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:50.843
not least these little kids.

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:52.812
And we don't know who's being released,

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:56.315
specifically the Thai authorities do know

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:59.318
and who is released today in that group.

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:00.720
But what we do know

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.388
is that they are all traveling together

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:03.122
in that convoy

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:03.723
you've just seen

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:06.392
go through the Rafah crossing

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:08.895
from the Gaza side, traveling

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:09.996
into the Egypt side

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:12.064
and then into into Israel

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:13.499
as assets things stand at the moment.

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:14.801
Again, we've been saying this

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:15.435
all morning.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.903
We're nearly 2 hours

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:17.370
after

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.238
what was the scheduled

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.407
release of these hostages.

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:22.341
This has happened

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:23.042
a lot quicker,

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:24.110
I think, than perhaps

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.546
many people had anticipated.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.848
And, you know, that's a good thing.

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:30.049
And obviously,

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.350
now we just have to

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.452
wait to see what happens

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.920
when when when we get

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.456
some sort of iSight on on these hostages

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.924
as they are as they are

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:41.160
delivered to the IDF and then obviously

00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:42.128
into the

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.996
care of psychologists, hospital

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:45.765
workers, medics,

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:46.899
some are going to need treatment.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:48.234
We don't know whom

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.636
we don't know how they are at this stage.

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:51.304
But this is

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:51.804
at least

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.406
just seeing those scenes of that

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:56.642
Red Cross convoy to cheers going through

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.344
that border crossing

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:00.413
it just suggests where we are at.

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:01.347
This is the biggest

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:02.482
diplomatic breakthrough

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.750
since this conflict began.

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:05.384
Let's remember

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:06.519
just a couple of weeks ago,

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:07.887
the UN Security Council

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:11.724
finally got a resolution through asking

00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:12.792
pushing for

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:13.693
not just one,

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:16.028
but multiple humanitarian pauses

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:17.530
at this stage.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.764
We have this one.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:21.000
It's four days plus an extension

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.935
if Hamas are prepared

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:24.470
to release more hostages.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:24.971
But let's just

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:26.806
see how this goes today,

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:30.076
whether all 25 hostages are indeed

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:32.044
in that convoy, whether those numbers

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:33.079
are sufficient

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.815
to suggest that

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:38.050
Hamas has fulfilled its obligations.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:38.784
We don't know that

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:40.253
because we can't see who's

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:41.220
in those convoys.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.456
But we do know that it was expected

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.957
that there would be 13 Israeli

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:46.959
hostages and 12 ties

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.961
At this point, it is not clear

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:50.863
how many people are in those calls.
