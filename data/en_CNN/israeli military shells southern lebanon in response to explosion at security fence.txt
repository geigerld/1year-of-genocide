WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS A BREAKING SITUATION. THAT IS THE SMOKE, FROM WHAT WE'RE TOLD, IS ARTILLERY FIRE FROM NORTHERN ISRAEL. YOU CAN HEAR SOME OF THE BLASTS THERE, INTO SOUTHERN LEBANON. THOSE ARE THE PICTURES NOW, LET ME SHOW YOU ON THE MAP WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. THIS IS THE BORDER BETWEEN ISRAEL AND LEBANON. LET'S GO TO SOUTHERN LEBANON. ARE BEING WEDEMAN IS STANDING BY THEIR. BEN, GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND HEARING. . &gt;&gt; JOHN, IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES, WE HEARD SEVERAL LARGE EXPLOSIONS IN THE MID DISTANCE. RIGHT BEHIND ME, WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THE MOUNTAIN. ON ONE HALF OF IT IS LEBANON, THE OTHERS ISRAEL. AND RIGHT BEHIND ME IS THE ISRAELI COMMUNITY OF MEDULLA. THIS IS A TOWN THAT HAS BEEN UNDER -- ITS A CLOSED MILITARY AREA FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS. BUT IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES, WE HEARD SEVERAL LARGE EXPLOSIONS IN THE DISTANCE. IN ADDITION TO WHAT IS GOING ON TO THE WEST OF HERE, NEAR THE MEDITERRANEAN, ALONG THE BORDER WHERE WE UNDERSTAND, ACCORDING TO THE LEBANESE NEWS, THE OFFICIAL LEBANESE NEWS AGENCY, SEVERAL ROCKETS WERE FIRED IN THE DIRECTION OF ISRAEL. THEY WERE INTERCEPTED BY THE IRON DOME SYSTEM. THE ISRAELIS LEADER APPARENTLY TARGETED, ACCORDING TO THE LEBANESE NEWS AGENCY, AN ARMY OBSERVATION POINT. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE ONGOING EXCHANGES IN THAT AREA AS WELL. NOW, THIS IS SORT OF A CHANGE FROM THE PACE DURING THE REST OF THE DAY. EARLIER IN THE DAY, IT WAS RELATIVELY QUIET. IN FACT, THE ASSUMPTION WAS THAT PERHAPS THE WORST HAVE PASSED. HERE, I JUST HEARD ANOTHER EXPLOSION. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD THAT AS WELL. AND ANOTHER ONE. SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT THINGS ARE PICKING UP. I CAN HEAR THE IMPACT OF THAT ONE IN THIS DIRECTION. THERE ARE LEBANESE SOLDIERS HERE, OBSERVING WHAT IS GOING ON. OKAY, I'M JUST GOING TO STEP OUT OF THE WAY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP OF THAT HILL, THERE'S A PLUME OF SMOKE. I BELIEVE, BUT I'M NOT CERTAIN, THAT THAT SIDE OF THE HILL IS LEBANON. BUT I CAN'T SAY WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY. SO YES, THIS JUST BEGAN A FEW MINUTES AGO. WE DON'T KNOW THE REASON, THE CAUSE, BUT CERTAINLY THE TENSIONS HERE ARE EXTREMELY HIGH. HEZBOLLAH, THE MAIN SORT OF MILITARY FORCE IN THIS AREA, IN ADDITION TO THE LEBANESE ARMY, HAS BY AND LARGE BEEN RELATIVELY RESTRAINED DURING THE OUTBREAK OF FIGHTING IN GAZA. YEAH, I CAN HEAR ANOTHER IMPACT. SO YOU CAN SEE THE SMOKE ON THE TOP OF THE HILL. IT APPEARS MULTIPLE IMPACTS UP THERE. WHAT I THINK I'M HEARING IS OUTGOING FIRE, AND MOMENTS LATER YOU HEAR THE IMPACT. THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE. JOHN? &gt;&gt; WE HEAR THE THUDS. WE HEAR THE THUDS, BEN, AND IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN, AND YOU KNOW THIS REGION SO. WELL WE'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON GAZA, TO THE SOUTH. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE MAP OF A SERIAL. YOU ARE OF COURSE ON THE NORTHERN BORDER BETWEEN ISRAEL AND LEBANON. THE CONCERN THERE IS THAT YOU SAW FLUSH ON THAT HILL. I DID, A MOMENT AGO. &gt;&gt; STEP OUT OF THE WAY. &gt;&gt; THE CONCERN FOR ISRAEL IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS IN LEBANON ISN'T SO MUCH THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT, BUT IT IS HEZBOLLAH. WHY ARE THEY SO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HEZBOLLAH MIGHT DO, AND WHAT KIND OF LINES HAS HEZBOLLAH PUBLICLY DRAWN? IT SAYS, THIS IS ONE WILL GET INVOLVED IN THIS. &gt;&gt; DON, THE ISRAELIS ARE CONCERNED BY THE FACT THAT HAS BELOW, NOT JUST -- GET MY FLAK JACKET ON WHAT I'M TALKING TO YOU. THE ISRAELIS ARE CONCERNED THAT IF HEZBOLLAH BECOMES INVOLVED, IT IS A FORMIDABLE MILITARY ORGANIZATION. MADE SO WITH THE HELP OF IRAN. AND WE SAW EVEN BACK IN 2006 THAT HAS BLOW WAS ESSENTIALLY ABLE TO FIGHT THE ISRAELIS TO A STANDSTILL. SINCE THEN, THEIR CAPABILITIES HAVE ONLY IMPROVED. THEIR WEAPONRY HAS ONLY IMPROVED, THEY HAVE A BREADTH OF EXPERIENCE AND IN HOUSE TO HOUSE AND STREET TO STREET WARFARE FROM SYRIA. SO IF THEY BECOME INVOLVED, IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN WHAT YOU HAVE IN FAR GREATER. I SEE ANOTHER IMPACT UP THERE. NOW, HAS BLOT HAS SORT OF SAID THAT IF ISRAEL ATTACKS LEBANON, IT WILL BECOME FULLY INVOLVED. THE HEAD OF HEZBOLLAH HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT HEZBOLLAH WILL DECIDE A TIME AND PLACE WHERE IT WILL ENGAGE WITH ISRAEL, AND THAT HEZBOLLAH WILL NOT BE DRAWN INTO A WAR, NOT OF ITS CHOOSING. AND BASICALLY, IT DOES APPEAR THAT AT LEAST UNTIL NOW HAS BLOWOUT HAS BEEN HESITANT TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THIS WAR. NOW, THIS COULD BE SIMPLY A PASSING INCIDENT, NOT NECESSARILY THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING. BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES REPRESENT SOMETHING OF A DETERIORATION. &gt;&gt; AN EXCHANGE OF FIRE, TO BE SURE THERE. WE CAN SEE THE SMOKE RISING ABOVE THE HILL BEHIND YOU. YOU'RE BACK IN FRAME, THE SMOKE RISING ABOVE THE HILL. WE DID SEE A SMALL FLASH THEIR. TO BE CLEAR, THAT SMOKE RISING BEHIND YOU IS LEBANON. THOSE ARE THE IMPACT ZONES AT THIS POINT, WHERE THINGS ARE LANDING. THAT IS INSIDE LEBANON, YOU BELIEVE? &gt;&gt; I DO BELIEVE SO, YES. I SORT OF HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO CHECK MY COORDINATES EXACTLY, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IS &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, WE DO APPRECIATE YOU BEING THERE, BEING WITNESS TO THIS. BE SAFE, AND PLEASED TO KEEP US POSTED. BECAUSE THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE SO CRUCIAL TO SEE, IF IT DOES ESCALATE EVEN MORE. ALL RIGHT, BEN WEDEMAN, UP HERE ON THE BORDER BETWEEN ISRAEL WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN HERE NOW TO GAZA. I CAN SHOW YOU THE SITUATION OR ERIN BURNETT IS IN SOUTHERN ISRAEL, NOT FAR. THIS IS THE BORDER, THIS IS GAZA RIGHT HERE. THIS IS EGYPT RIGHT HERE, SHE'S NOT FAR FROM GAZA, SHE'S NOT FAR FROM EGYPT. AND THIS REGION RIGHT HERE, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING NOW? &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE JUST OVER -- FROM A MAJOR STAGING AREA FOR AN ISRAELI TANK BATTALION, JOHN. AND BASICALLY THIS PARTICULAR TANK BATTALION, THEY WERE IN ON SATURDAY AMONG THE ATTACKS, THE FIRST TO GO IN SATURDAY AFTERNOON, AND THEY'RE NOW STAGING, RESUPPLYING, AND THEY SAY THEY'RE READY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING. BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SPENDING TIME GOING UP AND DOWN THIS GAZA BORDER. RIGHT NOW WE'RE ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY FROM THE GAZA BORDER ITSELF, AND AS YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING, WE ARE ABOUT TEN OR SO MILES FROM THE EGYPTIAN BORDER. SO RIGHT HERE, ALONG THE SOUTH, THERE'S BEEN MASSIVE STAGING OF ISRAELI FORCES. WHEN YOU HEAR THAT GOING BY, THOSE ARE ALL MILITARY VEHICLES. I WILL SAY, THEY'RE ALSO BUSING IN TROOPS ON BUSES. LITERALLY COACHES. SO IF YOU SEE 50 OR SO OF THOSE WITHIN THE PAST PIT, WE'VE SEEN 250 TROOPS COMING IN. IT'S A CONSTANT FLOW IN. AND WE'RE GOING TO THINK THAT THEY'VE BEEN SAYING THAT THEY HAVE 350,000 TROOPS ALREADY AT THE BORDER WHERE WE ARE. THEY'VE JUST BEEN ADDING IN CONSTANTLY THROUGH TODAY. CONSTANTLY THROUGH THE DAY, AND WE HAVE SEEN A HIGHER STATE OF READINESS. NOT JUST AT THE TANK BATTALION, BUT ALSO WITH THE TROOPS COMING IN, WEARING THEIR HELMETS, WEARING THEIR PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. THEY ARE READY, AND THERE IS A STATE OF READINESS. OBVIOUSLY, WHAT THAT MEANS, WE CAN'T TELL YOU IN TERMS OF HOW IMMINENT ANY ACTION MIGHT BE. BUT WE HAVE SEEN THAT SHIP BETWEEN TODAY AND THE LAST FEW DAYS. WE'RE CONTINUING TO HEAR THE ARTILLERY FIRE AND THOSE THOUGHTS AND EXPLOSIONS. IN THIS CASE, IN GAZA, SIMILAR TO WHAT OF COURSE BEEN WAS JUST SHOWING YOU LIVE, AS THAT ARTILLERY WAS COMING INTO SOUTHERN LEBANON.
