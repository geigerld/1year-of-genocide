00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
81% of Americans over the age

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.877
of 65

00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:04.170
feel the response

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.130
by the Israeli government

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.006
is fully justified.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:10.343
But just 27% of Americans 18 to 34

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:11.970
years old feel that way.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.096
The humanitarian crisis

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:14.806
is also top of mind for many Americans.

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:16.641
71% of Americans feel

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:17.559
a lot of sympathy

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.935
for the people of Israel.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.645
41% feel a lot of sympathy

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:22.230
for the Palestinian people.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.897
Former U.N.

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:24.399
ambassador and 2024

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:25.692
Republican presidential candidate

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.485
Nikki Haley joins us now.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:28.153
Ambassador Haley,

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:29.529
thanks so much for joining us.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.488
If you were president right

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:34.868
now, would you consider using the U.S.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.453
special operations

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.621
to rescue American hostages

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:39.914
being held in Gaza?

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:41.708
You just heard Jake Sullivan say

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.917
that one of the complications with

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:43.293
that is

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:43.710
we don't know

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.003
exactly where the hostages are,

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:45.837
but I'm wondering how much you

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:49.883
would consider such a thing.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.092
Thanks for having me, Jake.

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:51.217
You know,

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.177
I think it's important

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:54.429
you have to tell hard truth to Americans.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.723
And and when you're talking about this,

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.015
you know,

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.391
when you show those percentages

00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.225
of what people think

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.727
and what they think we should do,

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.936
you have to be honest with them.

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:03.104
This is messy.

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:03.521
Right.

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:04.064
I mean,

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.690
we desperately want to get

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.233
those American hostages out.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.069
But if you saw those kids

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.321
in the hands of those terrorists,

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.906
like with a mom heart,

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.574
it made me sick to my stomach

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:15.700
for all those parents

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.868
having to see their children

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:17.827
in those terrorists hands.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:19.829
So of course, we want them out.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.706
But why is it so easy

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:23.083
that we can do that?

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.292
It's because we don't know

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:25.126
where they are.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:27.337
And I have been in those tunnels

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:28.755
that are massive,

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.465
that are sophisticated

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.342
and that Hamas uses to hide

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:33.843
equipment and ammunition

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:35.678
and to do their dirty work

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:37.305
and maybe to have those hostages.

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:38.932
But where are those tunnels?

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.225
They're underneath hospitals.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:41.684
They're underneath schools.

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.478
They're in hard to find places.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:45.105
So this is incredibly tough.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.941
I feel, for the Israeli families.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.859
I feel for the American families,

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.402
and I feel for any other families

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:52.612
who've lost a loved one

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:53.404
or have

00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:55.240
someone in a hostage situation,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.117
because it's really bleak right now.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.201
And it's hard for anyone

00:01:58.201 --> 00:01:59.410
to feel good about this.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.954
We just showed images that your

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:01.955
your office gave us of

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.541
when you visited Israel in 2017

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.167
and the IDF took you to those tunnels

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.586
near the kibbutz in as well.

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:09.129
You said that

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.547
because those tunnels in Gaza are near

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:11.923
civilian sites, it's going to get bad.

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:13.424
It's already pretty bad.

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:15.009
Obviously, there are more than

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.178
2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza.

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:19.264
More than half of them are children.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:21.766
Do you think the U.S., Israel, Egypt

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:23.768
needs to be doing more

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.395
to help these innocent Palestinian

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:26.646
civilians get out of harm's way,

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.314
although you just heard Jake Sullivan

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.151
say one of the problems is Hamas

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.902
is keeping

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.487
the civilians in Gaza.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:38.783
They don't want them to leave.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.118
There are a couple of things at play

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:40.410
here.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.911
Hamas is going to do everything

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.997
they can to not have them leave

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:44.873
because guess what?

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:46.207
They want them all to die.

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:47.167
One, they want to use them

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.042
as human shields,

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:49.002
but two, they want to blame

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:49.836
Israel and show

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.462
images of dead children and say,

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:53.006
look at what Israel did.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.966
But don't ever forget what Hamas did.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.593
Don't ever forget those girls

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:57.677
running for their life.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.345
Don't ever forget those babies

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.763
that were killed in cribs.

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:01.306
Don't ever

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.140
forget the people

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.016
that they were dragging

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:03.641
through the streets.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:04.809
And what were they saying, Jake?

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.311
They were saying death to Israel.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.562
Death to America.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:08.897
That's who we're dealing with.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:09.898
But I dealt with this

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.316
at the United Nations.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:12.066
You're going to hear

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:13.818
all of those Arab countries

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:17.155
vilify Israel for what's about to happen.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.948
You're going to hear all of them say,

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:20.575
how dare you not do more

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.076
for the Palestinian people?

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:22.869
And you know what?

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:23.745
We should care

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.538
about the Palestinian citizens,

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:26.748
especially the innocent ones,

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:28.208
because they didn't ask for this.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.251
But where are the Arab countries?

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.127
Where are they?

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:32.170
Where is Qatar?

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.047
Where is Lebanon? Where is Jordan?

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:34.964
Where is Egypt?

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:36.549
Do you know we give Egypt over

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.551
$1,000,000,000 a year.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.136
Why aren't they opening the gates?

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:41.888
Why aren't they taking the Palestinians?

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:42.847
You know why?

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:43.848
Because they know

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:44.933
they can't vet them

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.309
and they don't want Hamas

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.685
in their neighborhood.

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:48.978
So why would Israel

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:50.855
want them in their neighborhood?

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:53.024
So let's be honest with what's going on.

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.901
The Arab countries aren't doing anything

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.152
to help the Palestinians

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.654
because they don't trust

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:58.488
who is right,

00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.197
who is good,

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.073
who is evil,

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.200
and they don't want it in their country.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.368
So they're going to come

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:04.452
and blame America.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:06.204
They're going to come and blame Israel

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.872
and don't fall for it

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:09.540
because they have the ability

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.001
to fix all of this if they wanted to.

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:14.712
They have the ability to go in and tell

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:15.713
Hamas right now

00:04:15.713 --> 00:04:17.006
to stop what they're doing.

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:18.675
They have the ability to tell Hamas

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.093
to let those people out.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:20.969
But you know what?

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.011
Qatar is going to continue

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:24.472
to work with Hamas and their leadership.

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:25.723
Iran's going to continue

00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:27.725
to fund all of this and not say anything.

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:28.726
And who's silent?

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.311
Every one of those Arab

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.854
countries are going to be silent.

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:33.564
But expect for the finger

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:34.565
to point to Israel

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:35.108
and the finger

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.568
is going to point to Israel, to America.

00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:38.444
I want you to take a

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.571
listen to this statement

00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:44.033
that Governor Ron DeSantis made about

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.410
all I guess he's talking about,

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.247
all of the 2.3 million Palestinians.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.872
He said

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:50.623
this on the campaign

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:53.626
trail in Iowa yesterday.

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:55.837
If you look at how they behave,

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:57.839
not all of them are Hamas,

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.466
but they are all anti-Semitic.

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.218
None of them believe in Israel's

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.846
right to exist.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.556
Now, just for our viewers, edification,

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:07.181
according to recent

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:09.100
polling earlier this year

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.268
from the Washington Institute,

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.729
which is a pro-Israel group

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.023
using the polling of a Palestinian center

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:16.274
for public opinion,

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:19.569
62% of Gazans wanted the cease fire

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.237
with Israel to stay in place.

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:24.324
50% of Gazans want Hamas to stop calling

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:25.575
for Israel's destruction.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.200
Want Hamas

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.328
to accept a permanent two state solution

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.163
based on the 1967 borders.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.914
70% of Gazans

00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:33.499
wanted the Palestinians authority

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.918
from the West Bank to take over Gaza.

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:37.253
So I'm not really certain

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:39.422
that Governor DeSantis has a real read

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:41.424
on the difference between Hamas

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.676
and the people of Gaza.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.219
What was your response when you heard

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.015
what Governor DeSantis said?

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:50.058
You know, I dealt with this

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:51.434
every day for two years.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.187
And you know, what I can tell you is

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:55.313
you have to realize that

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:56.230
whether we're talking

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.442
about Gazans and Palestinians,

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.569
you know, all of them don't.

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:02.737
You've got half of them.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.197
At the time that I was there

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.366
didn't want to be under Hamas's rule.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.867
They didn't want to have terrorists

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:08.534
overseeing them.

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.577
They knew

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:11.079
that they were living a terrible life

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.288
because of Hamas.

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:13.498
You had the other half

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:14.624
that supported Hamas

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:15.666
and wanted to be a part of that.

00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:16.709
We see that with Iran

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.711
to the Iranian people

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:19.837
don't want to be under

00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:21.255
that Iranian regime.

00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:21.672
They don't.

00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:22.673
We saw what happened.

00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:25.426
Amasa meaning we saw how they treat them.

00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.345
There are so many of these people

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:28.429
who want to be free

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:29.889
from this terrorist role.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.599
They want to be free from all of that.

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:32.350
And America's

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.810
always been sympathetic

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.478
to the fact that you can separate

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.146
civilians from terrorists

00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:38.481
and that's what we have to do.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.399
But right now,

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.691
we can never take our eyes

00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:41.567
off of the terrorists.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.652
I mean, what Hamas did

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:46.322
was beyond thuggish, brutal and sick.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.865
What the Iranian regime

00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:50.451
is doing to help them is terrible.

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:53.663
But let's look back at what did Biden do.

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.039
Biden turned around and fell

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:55.873
all over himself

00:06:55.873 --> 00:06:57.083
to get into the Iran deal.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.418
Obama did it before that.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.836
You gave all of this money

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:00.670
and what did you do?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.462
You empowered

00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:02.713
Iran to go

00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:03.881
and strengthen Hamas,

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:05.550
strengthen Hezbollah, strengthen

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.300
the Houthis

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.177
to spread their terrorist activity.

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:10.096
We went and strengthened those sanctions

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.014
and decimated Iran's economy.

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:12.807
And what happened?

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.684
Biden has loosened the sanctions.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.310
Now we've got the fact that he gave

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.895
6 billion and hostage money.

00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:19.605
Okay, now you've frozen it.

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:21.691
But we have all these American hostages.

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.234
Guess what they're going to want?

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.902
If you gave them 6 billion

00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:27.363
for five people and released hostages,

00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:27.864
guess what?

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:28.656
They're going to be asking

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.616
for all these others that we have.

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.368
So we've created this scenario

00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:33.619
where you've given Iran,

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:34.495
the Iranian regime,

00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:35.913
too much power

00:07:35.913 --> 00:07:37.165
and too much Poland

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:38.332
to be able to do this.

00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:39.459
We've got to be strong.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.877
We've got to have Israel's back.

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.086
And remember,

00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:44.005
as awful as these images are,

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:45.548
and we have the back of Israel

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.258
because they've been hit terribly.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:48.885
We have to have the back of them

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.470
when they hit back as well.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.180
So speaking of having Israel's back,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.763
I want you to take a

00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:54.599
listen to what Donald Trump

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:55.099
had to say

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:56.893
about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin

00:07:56.893 --> 00:08:00.062
Netanyahu a few days ago.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:00.688
He has

00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:02.482
been hurt very badly

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.941
because of what's happened here.

00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:05.443
He was not prepared.

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.569
He was not prepared

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.738
and Israel was not prepared.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:09.822
And under Trump,

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:12.575
they wouldn't have had it be prepared.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.368
He went on to call Hezbollah,

00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:15.161
which the U.S.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.454
classifies as a terrorist group,

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:17.205
very smart.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.082
He called the defense minister a jerk

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:21.709
and he went on and on.

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:23.252
This was, I think, Wednesday.

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:24.045
So four days

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.546
after the deadliest day

00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:26.214
for the Jewish people

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.089
since the Holocaust.

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:27.882
What was your response

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:30.801
when you heard that?

00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:32.220
It's why I continue to say

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.639
it is time for a new generational leader.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:35.681
We've got to get past

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:36.807
the headlines of the past.

00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:37.683
I mean, look,

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:38.684
he congratulated

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.186
the Chinese Communist Party

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.229
not too long ago.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.147
He's saying Hezbollah is smart.

00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:45.483
I can tell you at the United Nations

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:46.275
when I was there

00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:48.277
and I dealt with all of them every day,

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:51.155
you don't go and compliment

00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:52.240
any of them,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.407
because what that does is

00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:54.909
that makes America look weak.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.619
It doesn't make America look strong.

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:57.703
It doesn't make America

00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:58.955
have friends with them.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.498
What you do is you show strength.

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:02.750
You let them know what we expect of them.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.669
So complimenting Hezbollah

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:05.211
and going

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.045
and complimenting

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.630
the Chinese Communist Party

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.131
or criticize

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:09.882
a leader

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:11.384
who has just watched

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.469
so many of his citizens

00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:14.679
brutally murdered,

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.639
it's the wrong place at the wrong time.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.391
This isn't about Trump.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.809
It's not about him.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.519
It's not about what happened in the past.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.937
We've got to look forward.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:25.064
This is going to be tough days ahead

00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:26.607
for everyone involved.

00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:27.984
This is not the time to sit there

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:28.901
and bash a leader.

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.361
This is a time to sit there

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:32.154
and give him the support he needs,

00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:33.698
Give the Israeli people

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:34.865
the support they need

00:09:34.865 --> 00:09:36.200
and to help us get through this

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.785
in the best way possible.

00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:38.744
Before you go,

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:40.538
the House still doesn't have a speaker.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.206
For the first time in American history.

00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:43.541
This is nearly two weeks after Kevin

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.543
McCarthy was stripped of his leadership.

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.169
They still can't even pass a resolution

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:49.005
condemning the Hamas attacks.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:49.922
It's starting to look like

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:50.923
there is not one House

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:53.926
Republican who can get 217 votes.

00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:55.845
Republican Congressman Austin Scott said

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:56.554
the chaos, quote,

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.055
makes us look like a bunch of

00:09:58.055 --> 00:10:02.935
idiots, unquote. Is he right?

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.228
Well, I'll tell you, what's right

00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:05.313
is under the Biden

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:08.274
administration, we've seen chaos within.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.525
You can't blame the fact that you.

00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:10.735
Can't blame that on Biden.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.695
You can't blame this on Biden.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:13.779
No, you.

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:15.156
Well, you have to let me finish.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.617
We have seen chaos with inflation.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.492
We've seen chaos

00:10:18.492 --> 00:10:19.785
with the lack of transparency

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:20.369
in education.

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:21.746
We've seen chaos on the border.

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:22.538
We've seen chaos

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:23.497
with crime on the streets.

00:10:23.497 --> 00:10:24.624
And now we're seeing chaos

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.625
around the world.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.168
What I'm saying is

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.378
you can't fix Democrat chaos

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:30.796
with Republican chaos.

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.214
They need to get it together.

00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.341
They need to get in a room

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:34.967
and figure out who this is going to be

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:36.344
and come out unified.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.179
That's what Republicans need to do.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.639
This is not a good look.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.432
This is not good for our country.

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:43.184
We saw what happened to Israel

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.685
when they were distracted.

00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:46.896
America looks so distracted right now.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.105
When America is distracted,

00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:49.565
the world is less safe.

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:50.775
We can't sit there

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.777
and act like this is September 10th.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.111
We better get it together

00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:55.154
and remember what it felt

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:56.447
like September 12th,

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:57.198
because we've got

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.491
a lot of threats around us

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.034
and a lot of chaos around us.

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.160
And we need some strength.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.536
We need some stability.

00:11:02.536 --> 00:11:03.037
And again,

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:04.830
I'll say we need a new generational

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.998
leader to right this ship.
