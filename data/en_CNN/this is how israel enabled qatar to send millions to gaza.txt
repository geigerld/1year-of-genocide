THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER  BENJAMIN NETANYAHU MAY HAVE  BEEN PROPPING UP HAMAS, WITH  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, OUT FRONT.  &gt;&gt; ISRAEL'S MORNING CONTINUES  EVEN AS BENJAMIN NETANYAHU  GROWS.  IN A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS WITH  KEY ISRAELI PLAYERS, CNN AND THE ISRAELI PLATFORM OR TOLD HOW  BENJAMIN NETANYAHU ALLOW CASH  DONATIONS TO HAMAS FOR YEARS  WITHOUT SUPERVISION.  DESPITE CONCERNS FROM WITHIN  HIS OWN GOVERNMENT.  &gt;&gt; $360 MILLION. SIMPLE  MATHEMATICS.  &gt;&gt; IT'S A LOT OF MONEY.  &gt;&gt; THE DOLLAR IN GAZA IS LIKE  $20 IN THE U.S. FOR THEM, IT  WAS LIKE OXYGEN.  CAN YOU LIVE WITHOUT OXYGEN,  NO.  IT'S A HISTORIC MISTAKE.  &gt;&gt; FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER  BENNETT SAID HE WAS AMONG THOSE  REPEATEDLY RAISING CONCERNS TO  BENJAMIN NETANYAHU I STOPPED TH  BECAUSE I BELIEVED IT WAS A  HORRENDOUS MISTAKE TO ALLOW  HAMAS TO HAVE ALL OF THE  SUITCASES FULL OF CASH THAT  GOES DIRECTLY TO REARM  THEMSELVES AGAINST ISRAELIS.  WHY WOULD WE FEED THEM CASH TO  KILL US?  &gt;&gt; THE CAST DELIVERIES WERE  SUPPOSED TO HELP AMONG OTHER  HUMANITARIAN NEEDS, PAY CAUSES  CIVIL SERVANTS AND PICTURES IN  2018 SHOWED WORKERS LINING UP  TO RECEIVE $100 BILLS.  ISRAEL APPROVED THE DEAL IN A  SECURITY CABINET MEETING IN  AUGUST 2018, DURING A PREVIOUS  BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TENURE AS  PER MR. AND AN ISRAELI OFFICIAL  DEFENDED THE DECISION TELLING  CNN, SUCCESSIVE ISRAELI  GOVERNMENTS ENABLED MONEY TO GO  TO GAZA, NOT IN ORDER TO  STRENGTHEN HAMAS BUT TO PREVENT  A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.  THAT'S TRUE, BUT NO ONE ELSE  APPROVED IT IN CASH.  FORMER MINISTER BENNETT SAID  THAT BENJAMIN NETANYAHU  UNDERESTIMATED HAMAS.  &gt;&gt; I THINK THE APPROACH TOWARDS  HAMAS WAS ONE OF SORT OF A  LUCID TYPE TERROR ORGANIZATION  THAT CAN SHOOT ROCKETS, CAN  CAUSE A BIT OF HAVOC HERE AND  THERE BUT NOT MUCH MORE THAN  THAT.  &gt;&gt; SO UNDERESTIMATED.  &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.  AND IN THAT SENSE, WE'VE  LEARNED A LESSON.  WE HAVE TO BELIEVE OUR ENEMIES.  &gt;&gt; THIS LESSON HAS BECOME A  TURNING POINT FOR ISRAEL.  ONE, EVEN LONGTIME BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU ALLY LIKE SPEAKER  HAUSER, ACKNOWLEDGED.  &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A STRATEGIC LESSON  FOR THE SOCIETY THAT YOU CAN  TALK A LOT ABOUT PEACE AND DO A  LOT OF THINGS, YOU CAN COME TO  THE WHITE HOUSE AND GET SOME  NOBEL PRIZES, BUT IN SOME  POINT, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, AND IF  YOU ASK ME, WHAT SYMBOLIZED  OCTOBER SEVENTH? IT MOSTLY  SYMBOLIZED THAT THE SOCIETY NO  MORE TAKE RISKS.  &gt;&gt; HEATING THE TOLL OF HUMAN  SUFFERING AND INTERNATIONAL  CALLS TO SLOW THE PUMMELING OF  GAZA, BEFORE ISRAEL IS  SATISFIED HAMAS HAS BEEN  DESTROYED.  WHATEVER THE COST.  AND THAT CLAMOR TO COURSE  CORRECT IS NOT JUST THE  MESSAGE.  MANY INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS  HAVE BEEN TELLING US THAT THEY  ARE WORRIED THAT THIS PRESSURE  ON BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TO BE  SEEN TO CORRECT HIS MISTAKE  COULD BE IMPACTING THE  WILLINGNESS OF THOSE IN
