00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:01.876
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:02.502
I'm

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:06.172
so sorry for what you're dealing with.

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:08.800
Or nine family members

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.469
were taken by Hamas

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.557
to have been released, three killed.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.600
How how are you coping?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.768
You know, coping is a

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.895
is a really big word.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.648
I think each and every day

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:26.818
I wake up and I just start doing

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.863
everything I can,

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.906
everything in my power

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:33.533
to try to bring them back

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.535
in any means necessary.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.372
Two of your family members were released.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:40.373
Judith and her

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.376
teenage daughter, Natalie Renan.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.755
Describe the moment when you saw

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.714
those two

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:48.631
family members

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.634
walk across the border from Gaza.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.805
They've been through hell.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:56.681
They got back

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:57.766
in the same clothes

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.893
that they were kidnaped in.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.480
We were relieved by their release

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.566
and thankful for the

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.109
American administration

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.694
and President Joe Biden

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.780
for the efforts to bring them back.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.741
They gave us a lot of hope for returning

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.950
the other family members

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.369
and all the other hostages.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:20.080
Have they spoken to you about

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.875
those weeks in captivity?

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.002
We spoke a lot.

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.005
What has been said in these conversations

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:30.006
are between us.

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.217
We're just happy to have them back

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:33.676
and with that,

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:38.223
we don't have the privilege to celebrate

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:40.100
as well as

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.725
the privilege

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:45.021
to mourn our dead family members,

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.189
which was

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.566
buried through through these days.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:53.196
I can't allow myself to really

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.030
open myself

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.367
to feel something because

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.785
it can break me down.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:02.539
And I really need to to keep going

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:06.167
every second until they're all back.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:08.419
Of all the family members

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.840
that have been taken hostage by Hamas.

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:17.929
The youngest is just three years old.

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:20.223
What are your hopes for the

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.349
for the coming days,

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.809
the coming weeks in terms

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.436
of getting news of your loved ones?

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:27.814
When you see the innocence

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:31.609
of someone who has her

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.653
literally her whole life

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.656
ahead of her and then you

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.534
you try to imagine where she is now

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:41.703
under a tunnel

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:42.996
at gunpoint.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.498
She's three years old.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.750
We are at the point that any

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.753
any news is good news.

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:53.756
We hope for any sign of life.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:56.134
Shunick, Your

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.511
your cousin Rehman

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:02.515
and her husband were captured by Hamas.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.349
What do you know

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.226
about what happened to them?

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:06.895
My cousin got into a safe room,

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.147
and at seven in the morning,

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:10.190
she started to say that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.357
she sees terrorists

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:14.027
outside of her window.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.696
The kibbutz is built on line by line.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.864
The houses are line by line.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:21.951
So she saw them moving line by line

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.996
using explosives,

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:27.248
yelling, shooting.

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:30.710
So at 825 in the morning, she texted her

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.422
mum and said, Mom, they're shooting

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:37.008
at us.

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.676
The window is shattered.

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:39.761
She then left her

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.638
mum a voice message at

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.723
830 in the morning.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.516
She told her that she loves her.

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:47.268
She loves her dearly

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:50.730
and she's sorry she's not there with her.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:53.233
And that was it.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.944
And it's 330

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.238
when the army reigned control

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:58.905
in the kibbutz.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:02.242
They found the house

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.494
glass shattered,

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:07.413
bullet holes, signs of struggle,

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.915
some blood.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.417
And they were gone.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.253
Anthony,

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.423
Hamas has released a video of your cousin

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:19.175
pleading for a ceasefire.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.010
We're not going to show that video,

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.763
but I would like to gauge your reaction

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.056
upon seeing that

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:28.559
and hearing what she said.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:29.519
So, first and foremost,

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:33.815
thank you for not showing it.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:37.902
Secondly,

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:41.155
when I saw the video,

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.658
my first reaction was to smile

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.369
because she's alive.

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:49.455
Just imagine for three weeks not knowing

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.040
over three weeks now,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.749
not knowing

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:53.710
if she's alive or dead, not knowing

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.753
if she's well.

00:04:55.753 --> 00:04:59.007
Several hostages have been released

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.174
or rescued.

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:02.468
Does that give you hope?

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:05.930
It's a very tricky question

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:09.350
because I have hope.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.561
I've had hope for the past

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.439
three and a half weeks.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.148
But we're dealing

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:18.151
with a terror organization.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.278
The Israeli prime minister has said

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.113
has rejected calls for a ceasefire,

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.948
saying now is the time for war.

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:27.035
Qatar, which is negotiating hostage

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:28.411
releases, has said

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.706
that would jeopardize our negotiations.

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.125
What do you think about that risk?

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:38.629
I plead and even demand

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:39.922
that anyone

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:43.843
who has any influence on this matter

00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:47.221
put the hostages on the first priority.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.057
The community that was affected

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.476
the most on October 7th was a community

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.895
that fought the most for coexistence

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.438
and believed in peace.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.440
And it everything in their power

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.859
to push for it.

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:01.152
We are peaceful people.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.780
We want peace. We don't want revenge.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.491
If I can turn to you, Ellen,

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:09.202
your sister in law, Aviva,

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.287
and her husband Keith, aged

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:12.455
in their sixties,

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:16.334
grandparents taken hostage by Hamas.

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:20.630
What can you tell us about them?

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.298
Aviva

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:25.301
has dedicated her life to

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.720
the kindergarten,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.263
to a caretaker.

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:31.974
She takes care of babies.

00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:35.812
Are her life is family.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.563
My wife, Sandy, says all the time

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:41.567
that if Aviva is in Gaza and

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.736
and if she's taking care of babies,

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:44.946
she's going to be okay

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.364
because that's her life.

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.157
Keith

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:49.367
is just like one of these,

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:52.120
like very friendly.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.830
It comes to any any place.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.705
It comes says hello to

00:06:54.705 --> 00:06:57.250
everyone is just super friendly.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.584
Both of them are just,

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.294
you know, gentle people.

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:02.171
The last thing I would ever imagine,

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:03.923
you know, for them.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.258
Thank you so much

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.968
for sharing your stories.

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.971
And I really hope that you reunited

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.765
with your loved ones very soon.

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:13.307
Thank you.

00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:14.892
Thank you. Thank you for having us.
