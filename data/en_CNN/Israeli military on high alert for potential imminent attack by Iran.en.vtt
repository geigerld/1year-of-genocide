00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.669
We begin here in the Middle East,
as the Israeli and U.S.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.241
military's are ramping up preparations
for a possible revenge attack by Iran,

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:12.479
a strike
that potentially could happen at any time.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:15.548
CNN's Oren Liebermann is standing by
for us over at the Pentagon.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.984
But first, let's bring in CNN's
Nic Robertson.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.886
He's here with me in Tel Aviv Nic.

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:24.691
What's the latest on a potential
retaliation strike from Iran on Israel?

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:27.961
I think is less optimistic
than it was just a couple of days ago.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.831
Diplomats I've been talking to say that
the mood music around these talks set for

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:35.802
Thursday is not as positive and optimistic
as they were hoping for.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.372
We have heard from a diplomat
in the region saying that there is

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:43.076
a likelihood
that Hamas will now attend the talks.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.679
I think you're seeing a lot of posturing
in the run up to the talks.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:50.350
We've heard that the Iranian president
today has had conversations

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.352
with the British prime minister, German
chancellor,

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:55.355
the Chinese foreign minister,
and to all of them.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:59.359
Iranian media is reporting
he has said that Iran has the right

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.728
to respond and strike back at Israel.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:05.398
So it's a very tough narrative
on all sides at the moment.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.301
People here are bracing for a worst case
scenario.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:12.038
The Iranians attack
a real concern that Iran is building up

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:16.443
for what may be more than just a limited
attack, that this could be a wider strike.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:17.610
Of course, the U.S.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.382
naval assets coming into the region will
provide protection for Israel and for U.S.

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:23.583
troops in this region.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.553
But the fact that they've been speeded
up, the fact that they've been announced

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.722
all indicates
that the tensions are rising.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:33.126
The talks Thursday may not even happen.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.794
We might not even get that.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:38.164
That said, again,
we have to read the machinations

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.332
and the language

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:42.936
we're hearing at the moment
as as as the sort of thing that you hear

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.972
leading up to high stakes talks
where everyone

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:49.242
setting out their maximalist position,
trying to pressure the other.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:52.946
There is room for diplomacy, but there's
also room for mistakes and strikes.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.548
There certainly, as our. Nic, standby,
I'm going to get back to you.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:57.450
Oren Liebermann,
you're over at the Pentagon for us.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.987
The United States has ordered, what,
a submarine, major submarine

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.957
to head to the Eastern Mediterranean
aircraft carrier.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.593
Battle groups are on the way as well.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:10.330
This is
this is a huge decision by the Pentagon.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:11.030
Absolutely.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.199
And it is arguably the largest buildup
of U.S.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.768
forces in Central Command
in the Middle East

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:18.505
that we've seen since
very early in the war.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.941
In a call with his Israeli
counterpart, Defense Secretary

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:25.912
Lloyd Austin said that he'd ordered
the USS Georgia a cruise missile submarine

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:27.514
that was already in the Mediterranean

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.883
towards Central Command,
towards the Middle East.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:33.653
That is an offensive weapon,
although the Pentagon has described

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:37.757
these adjustments to force posture
as, quote, defensive in nature.

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:41.294
A submarine with its land attack
cruise missiles with its anti-ship

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:45.999
missiles is first and foremost a message
of deterrence to Iran and its proxies.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.200
But it also gives the U.S.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.671
a very powerful offensive weapon
should it choose to use them as it sees

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:56.042
how Iran and its proxies choose
to carry out this anticipated attack.

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:59.479
Austin also ordered the USS Abraham
Lincoln Carrier Strike Group

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.615
to accelerate its movements
towards the Middle East.

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:04.817
Just a couple of days ago,
it was in the Pacific Ocean.

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.452
So that will take time.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:07.820
But it's worth noting that

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.524
Austin ordered it sped up, essentially
get there as quickly as possible,

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.060
and once it arrives,
that means it will have the Abraham

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.528
Lincoln Carrier Strike Group,

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:19.432
the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier
Strike Group, at least for the time being,

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.335
as well as an amphibious ready group,
which includes

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:25.271
destroyers and other warships
in the Mediterranean Sea.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.006
So you see that buildup.

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:29.742
Of course, the crucial question is
what is Iran planning?

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:33.379
What are its proxies planning,
and how large will this attack be?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.316
You can see in
the US is force posture changes.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.619
The US is preparing for
what could be a very large attack,

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:43.856
at least the possibility
of a large attack.

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.693
And Oren, I spent several years
as a Pentagon correspondent.

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:49.829
It's pretty extraordinary
for the Pentagon to be announcing

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.832
publicly the deployment of submarines,

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:56.736
especially here in a sensitive area
like the Eastern Mediterranean.

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:59.706
Aircraft carrier battle groups,
they announce where they're heading,

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.541
but not necessarily submarines.

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.543
This is pretty amazing, isn't it?

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.144
Absolutely. Aircraft carriers,

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:08.147
you can track that publicly
and there are accounts that do that.

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.716
Not so with submarines.

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:10.917
The movement of U.S.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:14.821
submarines, whether it's a cruise missile
sub, a fast attack sub, a ballistic

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:15.688
missile sub.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:18.758
These are very secret
and nearly always done.

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.527
Not publicly.
They're they're rarely ever announced.

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:24.364
And if they are, that in
and of itself is a message.

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.733
The US publicly saying that the U.S.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:30.937
is Georgia is headed to the region
that's very public signaling to Iran

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.307
and its proxies
that the US effectively means business

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:38.211
here, that the US has very powerful forces
in the region and depending

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:41.948
on what Iran chooses to do,
the US retains the option to use them.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.284
Wolf, it's worth noting
this is not the first time

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:48.388
we have seen the US publicly announce
the moving of a submarine during this war.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:51.991
Back in November and early November,
the US very publicly moved

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:56.462
the USS Florida, another cruise missile
submarine, into the Middle East again.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.531
That then was a warning to Iran

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:00.700
and its proxies
about what they should choose to do.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.104
This is that same message delivered
with a tremendous amount of other U.S.

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:07.807
forces in the region as well.

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:10.877
You know, the public announcement of these
submarines, where they're heading.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.211
It's a message to Iran.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.913
Clearly, you mess with Israel,

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:15.548
the United States
is going to mess with you.

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:18.251
That's the message
that's being delivered clearly.

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.385
Oren, thank you very much.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:21.788
Nick, thanks to you as well.

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:23.289
I want to get some analysis right now.

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.592
Joining us, CNN political and global
affairs analyst Barak Ravid,

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:29.529
along with CNN military analyst,
retired U.S.

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.398
Army Major General James Spider Marks.

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:35.101
Let's talk a little bit, Barak,
first of all, you've been doing amazing

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:36.669
reporting on what's going on.

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.373
What are you hearing right now
about the timing and preparations

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:45.745
for a possible Iranian attack on Israel?

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:46.713
Good evening, Wolf.

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:47.613
So several things.

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:52.018
First, what I heard just in the last hour
from at least four sources,

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.252
two of them U.S.

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:55.788
officials
and two of them Israeli officials.

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:59.325
The assessment is that
this is not happening tonight.

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:01.361
That's that's what I heard from
both sides.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.530
They think it will still
it might happen tomorrow.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:07.967
It might happen the day after,
but it is not happening tonight.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.069
Another sign for that.

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.806
President Biden's top Middle East
adviser, Brett McGurk, is

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:17.643
traveling to the region tonight
to Cairo to start working

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:21.647
or to continue working on the hostage
deal, on the Gaza hostage deal.

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:22.281
So the U.S.

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:26.419
is trying to to say by that
that, you know, business

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.922
as usual, plans
as usual, they're moving forward.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:33.393
And the next thing
is that what I hear from both U.S.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.962
and Israeli officials
is that they see two things.

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.830
First, with Hezbollah.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.933
They see the Hezbollah's weapons
systems, long range

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:43.936
missiles are ready to fire at any minute.

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:48.674
And once Nasrallah will give the order,
they can fire on the Iranian side

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:53.012
extensive and significant
steps on the ground in the drone

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:58.851
units in the missile units
for a possible attack on Israel.

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:01.320
The people
are really worried about all of this.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.257
General Marks,
give us your analysis of the U.S.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:09.228
move to send this missile guided submarine
and to speed up the arrival of the USS

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:12.899
Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier
battle group to the region,

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:18.604
to the eastern Mediterranean, right near
where I am right now.

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:22.575
I think it's a very wise move
on the part of our Department of Defense

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:27.213
to try to get another carrier
strike group into the region

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:30.683
to make sure that that capability has now
doubled

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.186
in size and capacity.

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:36.189
The announcement of a sub movement,
I think is

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:39.559
unnecessary
when you have a carrier strike group.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:43.963
You have submarines that are a part
of that carrier strike group.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.800
The additional announcement,
I understand it sends a strong message,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.869
but that's out of the norm.

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:53.406
What we should try to do
is simply move the capacity in there

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:57.643
and then we've got a very broad array
of capabilities

00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:02.114
from which to choose in terms of what
type of a response we want to try to make.

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:06.452
And I think what's important at this
point is if those carrier strike groups

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:11.290
or any element within
those are under attack or get in the way

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.694
of what Iran tries
to do, the United States

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:19.966
then has a choice to make in terms of how
it wants to try to respond very directly.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:24.804
Is it just in support
to help defend Israel or is it to go out,

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:28.641
go after those capabilities
that the Iranians or their proxies

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:34.480
might use to harm
the United States capabilities as well?

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.583
And that offensive potential military
capability

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:40.920
is very, very impressive indeed.

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:44.790
Barak, how much would a possible
Iranian retaliation

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.027
undermine Thursday's
scheduled ceasefire talks

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:53.933
that are supposed to take place either
in Cairo or Doha, Qatar?

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:56.636
Well, first,
the talks, as far as I understand,

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:59.639
are expected to take place in Doha.

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:04.310
This is still the plan,
at least the US and Israel and the Qatari

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:09.382
and Japan mediators all still say that
they're going to be there on Thursday.

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:12.251
But there's there's Hamas.

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:16.188
And Hamas announced that they don't want
another round of negotiations.

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:21.861
And one of the interpretations of this
statement is that Hamas and its leader

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:25.631
in war in Gaza, in the bunker
100 feet under the ground in Gaza,

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:30.436
is waiting for this Iranian attack
and for a Hezbollah attack, hoping

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:35.041
that after such an attack,
he can get better terms for the deal.

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:38.578
So the possible
the possibility of an Iranian attack

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:43.316
when attacked by Hezbollah
will influence the talks in any case.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:47.353
So I think this is a very
those two things are intertwined.
