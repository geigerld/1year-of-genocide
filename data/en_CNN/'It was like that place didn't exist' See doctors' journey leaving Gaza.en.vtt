00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:05.338
This is what leaving Gaza looks like

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:07.574
driving through the dust and debris.

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:09.376
16 health care workers

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.511
finally evacuating the Gaza

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.079
European Hospital,

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.082
a journey many outside Gaza haven't seen

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.085
and most inside are unable to make.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:22.622
Among them Doctor Adam Hamhuis, a U.S.

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:24.524
combat surgeon and humanitarian,

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.259
first responder.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.528
He recently chose to stay behind

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.330
when an initial evacuation

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.165
was only offered to U.S.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.967
citizens.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.135
This is the first wave.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.170
Another one usually starts around 2 a.m..

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.138
These are the conditions

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.774
Hamoudi and his colleagues worked under.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:41.274
They just wait

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.143
until everyone really falls asleep

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:45.078
and then they try to wake you up again.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.913
He wrote a letter to President Biden

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.982
saying he had never witnessed, quote,

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.483
the level of atrocities

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.419
and targeting of medical colleagues

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:53.953
as he had in Gaza,

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.021
urging the president

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:56.923
to allow a humanitarian corridor

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:58.058
to be established

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.126
and for his colleagues and himself

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.228
to be allowed to evacuate.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.831
Days later, the team were on their way.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.332
Our farewell was marked

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.101
with many tears on both sides.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.203
We gave them everything we had, like

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.739
we left really with the the,

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:13.840
the clothes we were wearing

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.408
and in a small backpack.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.843
But even then they were giving us

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:18.812
little gifts to remember them by.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:22.182
And and, with promises that now

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:23.116
we will come back

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.518
and we will continue to help them

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:27.287
and and, we won't forget.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:29.956
You do want to go back, right?

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:31.324
All of us want to go back.

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:34.627
There are people who are not able

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:35.595
to leave like

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.964
the Palestinians themselves.

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:39.599
And we can't forget them.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.768
The local level.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:42.969
And while getting permission

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.004
was one thing,

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.106
making the treacherous

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.874
journey was another.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:48.908
It was very dystopian.

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:49.776
The way it happened.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.712
Everything was through instructions,

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:56.416
by phone, with very choppy, service.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:06.593
everything I believe was was observed,

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.796
through to the, overhead drones to come

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.934
It took us about three hours to do that

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.202
15 minute drive

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:19.172
that normally takes to get the word out.

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:20.607
It was a level of destruction

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.308
I had not seen before.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:22.909
It was.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.245
There was nothing left standing.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:26.379
the the unusual part

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.482
which was really like I said, it was like

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.651
out of a science fiction movie.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.286
You know, once you left the gate

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:34.554
and when we were driving to Israel,

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:36.055
was that that crossing,

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.357
it was a completely another world.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:40.360
It was I went from what I just described

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.862
to driving through California.

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:44.998
It was like that place didn't exist.
