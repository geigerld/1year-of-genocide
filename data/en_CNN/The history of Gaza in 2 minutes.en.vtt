00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:03.294
Gaza is only about 25 miles

00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:05.380
long and seven miles wide.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.965
But this small strip of land

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:07.841
is one of the most

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.176
fought over in history.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.803
It was an Egyptian base,

00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:13.930
a royal city for the Philistines

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.597
and the place

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:15.682
where the Hebrew hero,

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.726
Samson, betrayed by Delilah,

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.394
met his death.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:22.939
Since then, much blood has been spilled.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.150
The most recent contest for Gaza began

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.942
at the end of World

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:26.818
War Two,

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.153
when persecuted Jews

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:30.321
traveled to Israel from Europe

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.990
looking for a new start

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.117
After the horrors of the Holocaust.

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:35.618
In 1947,

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:36.619
the United Nations

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:37.996
created a plan to split

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.123
Palestine into two lands

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:42.959
one for Jews and one for the Arab people.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:43.835
Backed by the U.S.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.545
President, Harry Truman.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.297
David Ben-Gurion, Israel's

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:48.590
founder, proclaims

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.549
the establishment

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.469
of the State of Israel in 1948.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.179
Egypt then attacked Israel

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.680
through the Gaza Strip.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.098
Israel was victorious,

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:58.391
but Gaza remained

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.101
under the control of Egypt,

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:02.479
and an influx of Palestinian refugees

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:03.480
began.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.816
In 1967, war broke out between Israel,

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.235
Egypt, Jordan and Syria

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.654
in what became known as the Six-Day War.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:13.782
Israel seized the Gaza Strip

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:16.409
and held it for 40 years.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.744
Israel pulled its forces

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.413
out of Gaza in 2005.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:23.625
In 2006, Hamas, a group sworn

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.043
to destroy Israel

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:27.128
and listed by the United States,

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:28.254
the European Union

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.256
and others as a terrorist group,

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.841
won a landslide victory

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.344
in Palestinian legislative elections.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:35.428
Hamas was now in

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.097
control of the territory.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.307
However, Israel's deal controls

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:41.101
much of the areas access

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.186
to and from the Gaza Strip.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.230
Since then, Israel and Hamas

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.023
have been exchanging blows.

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:48.066
Israel maintains

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.901
that Hamas is a violent terror

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:51.152
organization.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:52.445
Of Hamas says

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.614
that they represent an oppressed people

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:57.075
being victimized by the Jewish state.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.910
The international community continues

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.954
to press for a cease in violence.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:01.955
But for now,

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:02.413
the strip's

00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:05.416
population of 1.8 million people

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.210
are trapped in the crossfire.
