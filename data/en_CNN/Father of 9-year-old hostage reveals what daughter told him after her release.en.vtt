00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.134
Nearly two months after

00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:04.170
being ripped from their homes
and torn apart from their families,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.141
freed hostages are returning
to completely different lives in Israel.

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.877
Some of them are waiting
for other family members to be released.

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:12.879
Others are just learning
for the first time

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.683
that their loved ones
were killed by Hamas.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.386
Clarissa Ward
spoke with one father, Thomas hand.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:20.820
You might remember him.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.823
He initially thought
that his daughter had been killed.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:27.527
He was actually grateful for it because
of what he imagined Hamas might do to her.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.163
Then he found out that she was alive.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:35.869
And now nine year old Emily is home safe
and she is slowly sharing the details

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:42.442
of what happened to her after
she was kidnaped by Hamas on October 7th.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:46.312
So the jets should be here
in a couple of minutes like, oh,

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:49.616
family and

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.652
all of a sudden the door opened up

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:57.090
and just ran.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:59.292
It was beautiful.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.062
Just like in

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.930
just like I had imagined it,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.201
you know, running together.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:12.372
I squeezed the probably squeezed too hard.

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:15.942
It was a moment
Thomas had thought would never come.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.979
Told his nine year old daughter
Emily had been killed in the October

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.752
7th attacks, then that she was believed
to be held hostage in Gaza,

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.288
finally reunited with her family

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:31.658
after 50 days in captivity free,

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:34.494
but visibly haunted by her ordeal.

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.130
The most

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.535
shocking, disturbing
part of the meeting was

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:47.240
she was trying to bring

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.178
I had to put my ear on her lips
like this, closed

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:55.715
and say, what did you say?

00:01:55.782 --> 00:02:00.353
I thought you said
I thought you were kidnaped.

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:03.423
She thought I was in

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.224
captivity.

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:06.693
And what has she told you?

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:09.162
About what she's gone through?

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:13.099
I thought she was in the tunnels,
but she wasn't in the tunnels.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.435
They were actually

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:18.705
fleeing from house to house.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:19.472
She didn't like it.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.007
People prefer referred to as Gaza.

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.943
She says the cuffs, that the box.

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:27.413
So you have to say, like,
how long were you in the box?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.482
The coop?

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:33.186
She said, a year.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:40.393
And apart from the whispering,
that was like

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.097
a punch in the gut.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.666
There's that one photograph

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.502
right after your reunion

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.238
and you're holding her. And

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:55.074
there is this sort of seriousness

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:58.511
to her facial expression.

00:02:58.578 --> 00:02:59.312
Yeah, she's.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:02.715
She's almost staring, isn't she?

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:07.287
She a disconnect with everything
going on around her.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:11.224
Has she cried? I

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.494
said last night

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.128
she cried

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:19.065
until her face was red and blotchy.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:21.301
She couldn't stop. She.

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.203
She didn't want any comfort.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:23.536
I think.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:26.539
I guess
she's forgotten how to be comforted.

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:29.642
I just had to wait
until she came out of it by herself.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:32.912
And she knows how to do that.

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:38.952
She's a very determined little girl,
very strong.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:42.956
I knew that her spirit
would get her through it.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:46.025
There have been glimpses of the old Emily

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:50.797
happily walking the family dog, Jauncey,

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:54.834
but many moments of pain,
like when Thomas was forced to break

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:58.805
the news to her
that his ex-wife Naki, had been killed.

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:03.176
Does Emily understand
what happened on October 7th?

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.944
Yeah.

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:07.013
Yeah, unfortunately she does.

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:11.451
And how do you tell her?

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:16.623
You know,
your second numbers dead, killed, shot.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.525
When we got back to the hospital
after psychiatrist.

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:22.295
You know what? Weather.
What should I do? What should I do?

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:24.631
She said you've just got to tell her
straight.

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:27.467
The best way.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:30.436
Okay?

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:32.005
Yeah, that was.

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:37.610
That was very hard,
because we told her and,

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.648
you know, her little eyes closed up
and she just went

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:45.852
to the shop shopping and take a breath.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.321
Terrible thing to tell, child.

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:53.393
And as they recommend
that, you have to close the book.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:57.864
It sounds cruel,
but you have to stop that hope.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.933
So you you you've got to stop that.

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:04.070
It has to be. I know.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.637
Oh, kisses.

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:07.640
That.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.710
And so.

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:12.545
What is the next step now?

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:14.280
How long do you stay here?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.483
How do you start a new life?

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.420
The future is obviously

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.288
to get Emily back to health.

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:25.224
And we will do that along the way.

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:30.463
But the next thing is, along the way
is that we have to get all the children.

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:32.298
Obviously,

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:36.769
all the women, all the men,
all the hostages have to come back.

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:39.872
They have to be brought back.

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:44.310
Now, Jake, you heard Thomas talking about
getting Emily back to health.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.747
Now, she is in good physical condition.

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:51.851
There's no indication
that she was physically abused in any way.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.786
She lost a lot of weight.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.321
She was very, very pale.

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:57.623
She said that they didn't
have enough to eat.

00:05:57.623 --> 00:06:00.927
But obviously
there is the psychological component here.

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:04.831
The very fact
that she was only able to whisper because

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:08.234
she's so frightened of raising her voice,
he said that the only word

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:12.338
she appeared to learn in Arabic
was the word for be Quiet,

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:16.442
which gives you an indication of the fear
that she was living through.

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:20.847
He also talked about how she has very bad
head lice,

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:24.917
but all things considered, she is in
reasonably good health physically.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.686
And one other important thing,
when he talks

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:29.822
about bringing the hostages
back, he's very focused at the moment

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:33.426
on the mother of Emily's
very good friend, Kayla.

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:36.262
This is the girl
he had gone to the play date with.

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:37.597
She had gone to the playdate was spend

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:40.867
the night with was kidnaped
with, was held with along with Heller's

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:44.570
mother, Reya Rotem,
who acted like a second mother to her

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:48.841
and then inexplicably at the last minute,
two days before they were

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:52.712
due to be released,
Raya was separated from Emily and Kayla.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:55.715
You can imagine
Kayla was released with Emily

00:06:55.815 --> 00:07:00.987
and the anguish that she is going through
now, being separated from her mother.

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:04.123
And and this is a very important point
for Tom.

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:04.590
As he says,

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.661
going forward, we need to keep fighting
for all the hostages, but particularly

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:12.198
for Ryan,
and try to get to the bottom of why it was

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:16.903
that she was separated from her daughter
just ahead of their release.
