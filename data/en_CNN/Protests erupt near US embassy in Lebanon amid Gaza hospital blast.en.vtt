00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.835
A US defense official

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:04.546
says that the US had to shoot down

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:05.630
two attack drones

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.756
that were targeting U.S.

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.717
forces in Iraq.

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:10.343
There were no injuries there

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:11.803
and it is not clear

00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:13.638
who exactly launched the drones.

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:15.223
But such attacks,

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:16.766
they say, are frequently attributed

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.559
to Iran

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.893
or Iranian

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:20.770
backed militants in the region.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.938
The news comes, of course,

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:22.480
as American

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.314
embassies

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:24.607
have been facing protests

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.401
in a number of Middle

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.485
East countries

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:30.155
because of the war in Gaza.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:30.822
Right now

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:31.990
in Beirut,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.324
the capital of Lebanon,

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:35.076
hundreds of protesters

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.453
are gathered in the streets

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.621
as they were overnight.

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:41.666
This is video I think, of overnight.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.168
They tried to break through

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.753
security barriers near the U.S.

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.254
embassy.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:47.505
And these are live. Okay.

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:48.381
So I can't it's

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.924
difficult for me to see where

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:50.800
I'm from, my vantage point.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.843
But, yes,

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:53.094
these are live pictures

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.721
happening right now.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.348
You see lots of smoke.

00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:59.976
You see people in the streets.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:03.772
They are clearly, clearly terribly upset

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.440
about what is happening

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.192
next door to Lebanon.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.735
In Gaza in particular,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.987
you can hear the chants,

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:12.697
hundreds of people.

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:13.406
Let's

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.408
bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman,

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:19.037
who is in south Lebanon live for us.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.247
Ben, can you just give us a sense

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.875
of what you've been seeing on the ground

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.752
and what you've been hearing

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.421
from from your sources

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:33.259
about these protests?

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:34.719
Well, we're hearing some

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.137
large explosions

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:37.263
just to the south of here

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.224
near the border with Israel.

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:40.183
But these protests

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:43.186
are very much reflective of

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:46.856
many people in Lebanon, particularly.

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.149
It's been simmering

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.151
since the 7th of October,

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:51.194
but particularly

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:54.155
since that strike on the hospital in Gaza

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:54.739
yesterday.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:57.117
Last night, we saw protests outside

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.118
the US embassy.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.119
It's north of Beirut.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.286
It's actually not in Beirut.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.288
It's about eight miles north of Beirut.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.373
And of course, again,

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:04.332
we're seeing it today

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:05.500
with protesters

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.459
throwing rocks

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.670
and shooting fireworks

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.713
at the Lebanese police.

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:11.047
Police

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:12.924
responding with water cannons

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:14.926
and lots and lots of tear gas.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:15.969
It's important to keep in mind

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.053
that behind

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:18.096
those barriers, it's

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.890
about half a mile up the hill to the US

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:21.975
embassy itself.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.935
There's another explosion

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:26.479
and this embassy is highly fortified.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.230
The staff

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.107
are allowed to simply walk out the door

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.317
and enjoy the pleasures of Beirut

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.653
because of security concerns.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.321
Now, speaking of the embassy,

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.032
the State Department has said that

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:41.536
the families of US embassy staff members

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:42.787
and non-emergency

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.956
personnel are now authorized

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.666
to leave the country

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.585
should they so desire on a case

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:49.878
by case basis.

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:51.880
The United States has also advised

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.799
Americans not to travel to Lebanon,

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.509
and we're seeing a similar advisory

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.929
coming out of France as well.

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.890
Now, regarding the situation

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.016
in south Lebanon.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.642
And we've had two strikes

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:07.187
by Hezbollah on Israeli positions.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.438
Hezbollah puts out

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.690
videos of these strikes,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.401
and it appears that, among other things,

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:15.612
they have struck a tank.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:16.070
Overnight,

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.740
we heard a fair amount of explosions.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.200
There's another one in the distance.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.993
I don't know if you can pick that up,

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.996
but certainly reflective of the ongoing

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:27.957
tensions here on the border

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:32.879
between Lebanon and Israel. Sara?

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:33.880
Ben, you

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.964
have been in this region

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:36.132
for a very long time.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.509
And just to get your sense of things,

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:40.386
for example, during the second intifada,

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:42.263
what things look like in places

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:43.181
like Beirut

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:43.890
and in places

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.683
like Jordan in comparison

00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:47.435
to what we are seeing now,

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:50.521
because Jordan also has a huge number

00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:53.233
of Palestinians that live in Jordan

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.693
and that have reacted in a very big way

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:57.987
to what has happened in Gaza.

00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.322
All of these protests coming,

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:03.493
of course, after a hospital was struck

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.410
by someone.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.497
We do not know who at this point in time,

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.165
we have not independently confirmed

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.875
any of it, but Israel blaming

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.210
Islamic Jihad

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.045
and, of course, Hamas blaming

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.546
Israeli airstrikes.

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:16.506
Can you give us some sense

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:17.924
of just context

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.592
of what we're seeing now

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.887
in neighboring countries to Israel?

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.265
You?

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.307
Well, what we're seeing is

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:27.642
where it's boiling over

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:28.309
the anger

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.519
that people have been watching

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.813
very closely, intensely,

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.314
what's going on in Gaza.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:34.899
There's been scattered protests,

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.401
but certainly yesterday

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.486
I think that anger boiled over.

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.571
It boiled over in Amman,

00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:41.823
where protesters

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.992
went to the Israeli embassy,

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:46.995
set fires around it, tried to get in,

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:49.956
but were pushed back by Jordanian police.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.040
In Ramallah, Ramallah

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.043
is a particularly important city place.

00:04:54.168 --> 00:04:54.794
It's essentially

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:55.628
the capital

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:58.965
of the Palestinian Authority there.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:04:59.757
We saw

00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:01.092
protesters clashing

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.720
with Palestinian security forces.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.138
The protesters were calling

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.097
were condemning

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.348
what is happening in Gaza.

00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:08.766
But in addition to that,

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:09.767
they were calling for

00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:12.312
the downfall of Mahmoud Abbas,

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.813
the 87 year

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.315
old president

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.900
of the Palestinian Authority,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.446
who many Palestinians see as ineffectual.

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:22.488
He's been passive

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:25.491
during this current war.

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:27.577
He doesn't seem to have any sway

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:28.870
with the Israelis

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.957
who don't respect the system of of zones,

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.959
the areas that exist in the West

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:35.835
Bank, where

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:36.502
in theory,

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.171
the Palestinian Authority

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.840
is supposed to be in control.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.967
But the Israeli security forces

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:44.427
go in as they

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.721
please without any coordination

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:47.638
with the Palestinians.

00:05:47.638 --> 00:05:48.556
In short,

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:51.517
it's a very shaky regime in the West Bank

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:52.643
and much of the anger,

00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:54.187
in addition to being directed

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:57.065
at Israel, is directed at what is seen

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.983
as a corrupt and ineffectual

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:04.906
Palestinian Authority. Sara,

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:06.074
really good reporting,

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.450
really good contacts.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.410
Thank you so much, Ben Wedeman,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.828
for being there on the ground.

00:06:10.828 --> 00:06:12.622
Are you still hearing some munitions,

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:16.918
it sounds like, behind you

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:18.127
are scattered.

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:18.586
Yes.

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:24.801
But at this very moment, no matter.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:25.510
Okay.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.927
All right.

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:26.427
Keeping

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:28.054
you and your crew

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.138
as safe as possible

00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:30.515
in these difficult conditions.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:31.724
Thank you, Ben.

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:32.100
Kate, I'm

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.892
going to go ahead and

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:33.643
send it back to you.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:34.310
I just want to mention

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.770
we are watching these live pictures

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.605
of an extraordinary number of people

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:39.273
who have come out to the streets.

00:06:39.273 --> 00:06:41.275
This is in Beirut.

00:06:41.275 --> 00:06:42.777
We are watching this live.
