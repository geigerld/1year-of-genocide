00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:00.800
potties,

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.968
attempting to kill anybody

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:03.503
who may have been inside.

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:05.338
We have not yet been able to verify

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:06.506
if people were actually killed

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:07.007
in this moment.

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.775
If you're actually looking at people die

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:09.909
behind those doors.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.411
But obviously, that was the plan.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:12.245
That was the intent.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:13.446
That's what they were doing.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.647
And CNN is analyzing

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:17.317
and verifying more than 50 videos

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:20.053
like this one, piecing together exactly

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.355
how many of the brutal killings

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.691
the slaughter unfolded that morning.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.159
Katie Polglase is OUTFRONT

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:33.533
with an in-depth investigation.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.168
It's 6:30 a.m.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:36.269
on October 7th,

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.570
and things are getting into full

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.339
swing at the Nova Festival

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.175
in the south of Israel.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:43.710
We were having fun.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.045
You know, peace, love,

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.913
good vibes and an hour

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:47.647
or an hour and a half

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:50.216
after we are running from bullets,

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:54.421
suddenly the music stops.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.289
And then

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.357
there's the station.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.125
But no sense yet of the horror

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.760
about to unfold

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.194
as news

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:02.062
spreads of rocket

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.696
attacks from Gaza, people

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.198
begin seeking shelter,

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.567
crouching close to the ground.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:08.535
But even this doesn't

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.170
lead to outright panic.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.937
Rocket attacks

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:11.404
visible

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.073
here are a regular occurrence

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.475
in this part of southern Israel.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:16.843
About 10 minutes later

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.412
and some start heading to their cars.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.580
The decision of when

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.449
and how to leave the festival

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:28.221
would mean life or death for many.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.990
Some fled early to nearby bomb shelters.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.292
It's 7:10 a.m.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.860
and many are crammed inside.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.196
This one to the north of the festival.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.498
But they've been followed.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.867
At 7:24 a.m., Hamas

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.435
threw a grenade inside,

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:45.171
causing horrific damage.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.139
This man, Noah,

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.042
emerges stunned into the daylight

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:50.376
and is not the only shelter

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.344
to be targeted.

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:52.479
30 minutes later

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.314
and further down the same road,

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:55.582
Hamas militants are caught

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:56.950
on dashcam footage

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.985
outside another shelter.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.521
They throw a grenade inside.

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:03.389
In total, CNN has identified

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:04.657
four different shelters

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:05.658
near the festival.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:06.993
The Hamas attacks

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:10.163
all full of people over the next 6 hours.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.165
Hundreds of civilians were killed,

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:13.566
hunted down as they tried

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.135
to flee the festival

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.236
by examining over

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.037
50 videos of that morning

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:19.939
and speaking to 12 survivors.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.841
CNN has established that Hamas

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.409
surrounded the festival,

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.878
blocking three approaches

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:26.279
to the south, north

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.247
and west,

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.048
forcing people to flee across

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:31.384
the fields to the east.

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.620
Even then, they were hunted.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.022
It's now 8:15 a.m., and Gal Brooke

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:38.124
Chopin survives along with others

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:39.859
by running across the fields.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.295
He's pictured here in the white T-shirt.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:43.796
Local police and security

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:44.764
told them to drive

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:46.466
east across rough land

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.501
due to roadblocks on the main road.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.737
But many end up fleeing on foot.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:51.604
We're like ducks.

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:52.672
It was like a range.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.675
People were running in their hundreds.

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:57.744
And you can hear the bullets coming.

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.979
Were you seeing anyone get shot?

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:00.480
Yeah.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.682
You can see people fall.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.050
It's 8:30 a.m.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.151
and as Gale and others

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.786
continued running east,

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:08.188
others running north met

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.790
with more bullets and a police blockade,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.393
causing further panic.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.627
As a result, revelers

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:15.995
start running back down

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.231
the main road towards the festival,

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.966
not knowing there were more militants.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:23.069
Just a few kilometers further down

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.237
on that same road.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:26.139
Chilling dash cam footage shows

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.241
Hamas militants shooting directly

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.776
at an approaching car

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:32.178
just an hour earlier.

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:33.313
Those festival goers

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.615
that remained closer to the concert site

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.017
hid behind anything they could find,

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:39.419
even behind trees

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.120
waiting while the bullets closed.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.722
And

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.757
many did not survive.

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:47.260
260 are reported dead,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.129
but that toll could rise.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.331
Just 3 hours

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:52.899
after the start of the massacre,

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.734
a 9:39 a.m.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:55.602
videos emerge

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:56.769
of some festival goers

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.405
already held hostage in Gaza.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.707
This man still wearing

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:02.208
a festival wristband

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.276
and another visibly

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:05.578
wearing the security uniform.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.114
Their fates remain unknown.

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:09.983
Google and others are still processing

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:11.784
the trauma of what they went through.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:12.986
I know people who were like

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:14.287
12 hours in the bushes

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.955
and they didn't move.

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:17.957
I know people who tried to hide

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.292
and they died.

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:21.995
Humanity never seen this

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.530
in the last couple of hundreds of years

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.900
since maybe the Holocaust.

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:30.336
But this is just this is just horrific.

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.138
Horrific.

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:34.741
It would be 10 hours until help arrived

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:35.675
for some.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:37.176
Others are still missing,

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:40.146
feared dead or held hostage in Gaza.

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:41.914
The scale of this tragedy

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:43.449
may grow greater yet

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.285
after those 6 hours of horror

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.219
in the desert.

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:51.391
Katie Polglase, CNN, London.

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.326
And OUTFRONT now, Wolf BLITZER.

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:53.826
Of course,

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:54.994
he's been following this

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.262
story for decades

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:57.964
and he knows it better than anyone.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.300
So, Wolf, when you look at that report

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.335
and how intricately planned

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.837
the massacre was at the music festival,

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:05.672
the slaughter of at least

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:06.906
260 people,

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:09.075
that the footage of someone

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:09.909
shooting up the port

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.011
a potties for shelter to shelter

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.179
because they knew where they were

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:14.113
waiting to be brought in them

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:15.982
and then throwing in grenades.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.517
The more we find out, the harder

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:18.618
it is to see a way for this

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:19.285
to to

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:19.986
to de-escalate,

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.388
for anyone to to back away.

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:24.157
And I know yesterday you and I spoke,

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.259
you thought there was a very tiny chance

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:26.926
that this

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:27.393
this could

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:28.161
this could calm down

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.395
and de-escalate

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:30.396
as that chance

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:32.298
basically gone to zero now?

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:34.300
Yes, it's basically zero

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.234
based on everything I'm

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:37.937
hearing from my Israeli sources.

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:39.706
The Israeli military does not

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.574
mobilize 300,000

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:43.876
or maybe close to 400,000 troops,

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:46.746
deploys them to this area around Gaza

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.881
and is not about to try to achieve

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:50.450
two major objectives.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.784
The first objective

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:52.919
to either capture

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.221
or kill the Hamas leadership.

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:55.688
The second

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:56.823
objective to either

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:59.826
capture or destroy the Hamas weapons.

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:00.760
They'd like to capture

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.627
a lot of those weapons

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.663
because if they do capture the weapons,

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.198
they can determine presumably

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.232
where they came from.

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:08.167
Did they come from Iran, for example?

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:10.269
And if they did come from Iran,

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:12.472
that that creates a moment

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:13.339
for the Israelis

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.708
if they want to continue the escalation

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.044
to target some sort of objectives

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.145
in Iran as well.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.613
This could really escalate

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:23.349
not just in Gaza, but elsewhere as well.

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.018
And I'm convinced that the Israelis

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:27.186
are not going to back away.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.522
They want achieve those two objectives.

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:31.324
It could happen within a matter of hours.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:31.958
It could happen

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.726
within a matter of a few days.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.094
But everyone should brace

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:36.462
for a major Israeli

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:40.366
ground invasion of Gaza.

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:41.334
And interesting,

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:42.468
the Colonel Conricus,

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:43.636
I know you've been speaking to him,

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:44.137
too, Wolf.

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.405
He said they still don't know

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.373
the depth of that arsenal

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:48.908
and those special Forces raids today.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:49.175
Right.

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:50.710
They were about

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.244
trying to get

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.678
that information of the names,

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:54.680
who was involved, exactly what. Right.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.248
That that seems like

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.249
they're being extremely

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.817
they're trying to be surgical

00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:00.119
to get exactly what they need

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:00.953
because it's very clear

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:01.687
what the intent is.

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:02.188
As you said,

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:03.923
who puts 400,000 or close

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:06.259
to 400,000 troops along a 25 mile border?

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.528
If you're not going to do something?

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:09.529
Yeah, they're going to do it.

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:11.464
And it's just a matter of when.

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:16.369
And in my opinion, it'll be fairly soon.

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.005
All right, Wolf, thank you very much.
