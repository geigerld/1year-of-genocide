00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.869
I think Israel will, for

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.604
an indefinite period will have

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:07.440
the overall security responsibility

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.142
because we've seen what happens

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.011
when we don't have it.

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:13.246
One month into the war with Hamas,

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:13.980
Prime Minister Benjamin

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.982
Netanyahu is giving his first indication

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:17.350
of Israel's plans for Gaza

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.685
after the fighting ends.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.552
This comes

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.554
as more airstrikes could be seen slamming

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:22.822
Gaza City overnight.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:24.157
The IDF says it has secured

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:25.825
a Hamas military stronghold

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:26.760
in northern Gaza

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.127
and struck

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.162
a cell of about ten terrorists

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.231
in an anti-tank missile cell.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.632
Joining us now is White House

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:34.334
Security Council spokesman John Kirby.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.835
Admiral, I appreciate your time.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:37.103
I want to start with what we heard

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.605
just heard from the prime minister

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:40.206
There has been a lot of discussion

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.374
about what would happen

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:44.344
after the military conflict is done.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.345
The president has made

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:49.149
very clear he believes that holding Gaza

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.616
that that

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.551
a essentially

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.686
a reoccupation is not a good idea.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:54.587
What was your take

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:55.121
on what you heard

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.623
from the prime minister?

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.525
Well, the president still believes that

00:00:58.525 --> 00:00:59.793
a reoccupation of Gaza

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.428
by Israeli forces is not good.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:02.529
It's not good for Israel,

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:03.797
not good for the Israeli people.

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:05.331
Will that

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.866
Prime Minister Netanyahu speak to

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.401
whatever is post-conflict plans?

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.436
Or I can tell you, though,

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.837
that one of the conversations

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:11.905
that Secretary Blinken's

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.406
been having in the region is, you know,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.842
what does post-conflict Gaza look like?

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:16.609
You know what?

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.411
What does governance look like? In Gaza?

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.712
Because whatever it is,

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.848
it can't be what it was on October six.

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:22.882
It can't be Hamas.

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.218
One of the conference is Saudi Arabia.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:26.686
They're hosting a summit

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.021
of Muslim leaders this weekend.

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:28.755
There are reports

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.023
that Iran's president

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:32.325
Raisi will attend that summit.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.193
What does that tell you?

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:34.928
What's your response to his attendance?

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:37.430
I know that it tells

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.332
us anything too specific.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.568
So I think we're going to have to wait

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:42.769
to see how this plays out

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:43.803
and see what kind of a role,

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:44.737
if they actually show up,

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.172
what kind of role they play.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:46.840
I mean,

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.274
our perspective is

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.009
Iran is a destabilizing actor

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:50.477
in the region.

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:51.010
They support

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.545
groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.314
They're supporting these militia groups

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:55.515
that continue to fire rockets

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:56.716
at our bases in Iraq

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:58.418
and in Syria and there.

00:01:58.418 --> 00:01:59.986
And they're also supporting Putin's war

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:00.553
in Ukraine.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:02.889
So it's difficult for us to see

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.591
whether Iran would have some sort

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.925
of meaningful, constructive,

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.894
productive discussion about

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:09.896
about conflict resolution at this point,

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:11.598
given that they're the arsonist here.

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:12.765
But again, we'll have to see

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:13.833
what happens at this

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:15.168
at this meeting this weekend.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.170
You mentioned the rocket attacks on U.S.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.637
personnel.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:18.338
They've also been one way

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:19.472
drone attacks as well.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.341
I believe there's as many as 38

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:22.876
or 39 U.S.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.177
personnel who have been injured

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.513
in those attacks or a number of attacks

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.681
that have occurred.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.382
Does the U.S.

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:30.650
believe that at this point,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.952
the threshold for an expanded conflict

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:33.953
has not been crossed yet?

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.122
We are

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.290
still working very hard

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.192
to keep this conflict from widening.

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:40.727
Deepening, escalating.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:41.794
The attacks on our troops

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:43.329
obviously are deeply concerning.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.998
You've seen us retaliate

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.033
in the last week or so.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.401
We'll evaluate what we're going to do

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:49.369
in terms of next steps.

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:50.170
We're obviously going to do

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.738
whatever we have to do to protect our

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.506
our troops in Iraq and in Syria.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.176
Make sure that we make a strong statement

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.177
about force protection

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.811
and how much that means to us.

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:02.148
But we haven't seen another nation state

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:03.316
or actor

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:04.817
move in demonstrable

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.753
major muscle movement ways

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:07.954
to try to deepen and widen

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.055
this conflict as yet.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:09.856
That's one of the reasons

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.658
why the president has added

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.626
so much more force posture to the region

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.128
now, including a,

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:18.398
you know, an Ohio class submarine

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:20.200
which is now in the Central Command

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.668
area of responsibility.

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:22.602
We're going to keep watching this

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:23.803
if we have to make additional force

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:25.438
posture changes where we'll do that, too.

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.807
Did you think you'd see the day where

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:28.908
CENTCOM would tweet out

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:30.977
a picture of an Ohio class submarine

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:32.278
in transit?

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:34.647
Well, look, it's

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:35.014
you know,

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:35.415
as you know,

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.217
it's it's rare for the United States

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.818
Navy or our combatant commanders

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:39.719
to talk about

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.987
where our submarines are

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:41.988
and what they're doing.

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:42.922
But in this case,

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:44.357
I think it makes perfect sense

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:45.191
when we're trying to send

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.426
a strong signal of deterrence

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.460
to actors in the region

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.462
so that they don't widen this conflict

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:50.430
to let them know

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.297
that we've got yet

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:52.999
additional military capability

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.167
at the ready

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:55.668
to defend our national interests.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:56.269
The president spoke

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.004
with the prime minister again yesterday

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.239
They've been speaking on a very regular

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.139
basis.

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.007
Admiral, I was struck

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.076
by the former prime minister, Ehud Barak,

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.178
gave an interview yesterday

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:05.878
where he was talking about

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.447
if he could see the window closing

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.481
for the military operation

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:09.749
due to the pressure

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:10.717
from regional allies,

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:11.851
the pressure also of domestic

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.720
political pressure at the United States,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.988
as the president conveyed

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.055
that to the prime minister,

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:17.790
that there is a very small window

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.359
of time to conduct these operations.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:20.960
Well, I won't

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.495
talk about the private conversation

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:23.997
between the president and prime minister.

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.565
They have a routine

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:27.267
now sort of dialog

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.769
as these operations are are ongoing.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.105
And again, they spoke again yesterday.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.573
One of the things that the president

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:34.841
made clear to the prime minister

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:36.409
is that we're going to continue

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:37.377
to stand with Israel.

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:38.044
We're going to continue

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:38.478
to make sure

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:39.946
that they have the security assistance

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:40.780
they need, the tools,

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.148
the weapons, the capabilities

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:43.516
to go after Hamas.

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:45.652
That hasn't changed since October 7th.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:46.819
And it's not going to change

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.888
going forward with these.

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:49.656
I wanted to play for you

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:51.491
sound from Jordan's Queen Rania.

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:52.759
She's been very outspoken.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.127
She's also

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:55.561
Jordan is a very critical

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.530
ally in the region for the United States.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.997
Take a listen.

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:01.367
If you

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:03.703
manage to eliminate all of Hamas,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.238
what next?

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:07.240
The root cause of this conflict

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.208
is an illegal occupation.

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.944
It is routine human rights abuses,

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:16.049
illegal settlements, a disregard to U.N.

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:18.084
resolutions and international law.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:21.487
If we do not address these root causes,

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:24.057
then you can kill the combatant,

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.659
but you cannot kill the cause.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:28.895
She is of Palestinian

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:30.730
Palestinian descent.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.166
I guess the question is to that point

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.702
and for regional leaders

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.036
who say the same thing.

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:39.472
What is the response right now?

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:42.642
So we certainly agree that Hamas isn't

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:43.810
just an organization.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.345
There's an ideology behind this

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.281
this terrorist group that slaughters 1400

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:50.817
Israelis on the 7th of October.

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:51.718
And while you can go

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:52.452
after the leaders

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:53.553
and eliminate the leaders

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:54.554
and disrupt the network,

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:55.154
and we've proven

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:56.322
that we know how to do that

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.291
against groups like al Qaeda and ISIS,

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.193
it is difficult to kill the ideology.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.961
Now, she's also talking about

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:02.995
history here and

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:04.163
and how things ended up

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:05.398
the way they did in Gaza

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:06.866
and in the West Bank.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.267
And I think that the history

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:09.635
is obviously long.

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.671
It's complicated, it's complex.

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:12.138
And it's good

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:14.240
for all of us to remind ourselves

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.742
of of how we got here.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.777
But it's also important to remember that

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:19.712
we still believe in a two-State solution

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:20.646
in the United States.

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.682
We still President Biden still supports

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:23.449
this as a

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.284
is a viable vision and a promise

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:27.920
for both in a Jewish Democratic state

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.422
and a free and independent

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:30.556
Palestinian state.

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:31.190
That is a way

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.625
we believe that both sides

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:33.259
can live in peace

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:34.527
and security going forward.

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:35.428
And even though we're

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:36.996
in the middle of a conflict, Bill,

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:38.564
President hasn't given up on that.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:39.532
And we're continuing

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:40.500
to talk to our partners

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.567
throughout the region

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:43.102
about how to get back on track

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:45.037
to some sort of viable two state,

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:46.305
two state solution here.

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:46.806
John Kirby,

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.107
we appreciate at the time

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:48.674
and your ability

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:50.410
to fight through the leaf blowers

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.677
behind you. Thank you, sir.

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:53.780
I appreciate it as always. You bet.
