00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.626
The Rafah crossing into Egypt

00:00:01.626 --> 00:00:03.003
was briefly opened this morning

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.295
to allow the first convoy

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:05.588
of aid trucks to enter

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:08.008
the besieged Gaza Strip.

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:08.591
For the latest,

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:09.884
I'm joined by CNN's

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:12.679
Clarissa Ward in Cairo. Clarissa.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.055
When all was said and done,

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.599
what was actually on those trucks

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.480
and what is needed but was not provided.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.899
So, Michael, on those 20 trucks,

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.153
you basically had food, water, medicine,

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.405
all those things desperately needed.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:31.948
But one thing that wasn't on

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.034
those trucks was fuel.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.160
The Israelis have had

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.494
serious reservations

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:38.621
about allowing fuel to go in.

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:39.164
They're worried

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:40.999
it could be diverted by Hamas.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.001
But the UN is really concerned

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.753
that fuel supplies are now down

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.254
to maybe two or three days

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.298
and that fuel is so desperately

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.675
needed to power generators,

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:51.760
which are the only things

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.803
that are allowing these hospitals

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:55.680
to continue to function to the extent

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.515
that they are still able to function.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.559
Also important to note, 20

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.311
trucks is nothing

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:02.979
in the grand scheme of things

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.523
before this latest spasm of violence.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:08.318
You would have 455 trucks a day

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:10.236
according to the UN, of aid

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.654
going into Gaza.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:13.031
Now you've had two weeks.

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.532
Relentless bombardment.

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:16.743
No aid. Mass displacement.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.578
Humanitarian catastrophe.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:21.456
So 20 trucks, the WFP is saying,

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.541
could maybe meet the needs

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:26.294
of 30,000 people in terms of food.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:29.255
And they need to reach about 900,000.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.590
That's why you're hearing

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.341
full throated

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:32.926
calls from the U.N.,

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.303
other humanitarian organizations, saying

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:37.180
this needs to be a sustained,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.349
continuous humanitarian corridor

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.477
and not a one off. Michael?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.020
Clarissa, big picture,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.855
among the reasons for Rafah

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:47.774
being such a choke point

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.567
is that at this stage

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.402
it's the only perimeter of Gaza

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:53.029
not sealed by Israel.

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:56.616
True.

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:57.492
That's right.

00:01:57.492 --> 00:02:00.286
The Rafah border crossing is controlled

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.996
by the Egyptian side

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:03.915
and the Egyptians have said

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:06.543
they also don't want to have

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.503
a massive outpouring

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:09.921
of potentially hundreds

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.923
of thousands of Palestinians

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:14.092
into the Sinai Peninsula,

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:16.094
which is where that border crossing is.

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:17.387
Egypt has been fighting

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.722
an insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:21.182
for many years now.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:25.186
Egypt already has huge social problems,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.146
poverty.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.522
And so you've heard Egypt's

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:28.815
president say, listen,

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.818
the answer to this is not us taking

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:33.486
a million refugees

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.655
that we simply can't care for.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:36.281
The answer to

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.408
this is agreeing upon

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.034
a sustained, continuous

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:41.411
humanitarian corridor,

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.579
establishing

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.872
humanitarian zones

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.665
inside of southern Gaza.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:46.749
We heard Secretary of State

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.169
Antony Blinken talk about that, too.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.337
But the issue is getting all sides

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:52.463
to come together

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:54.007
and agree on the conditions

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.216
that would allow for that.

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:57.427
And in the meantime, Michael, of course,

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.636
it sounds like a cliche,

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:00.221
but it could not be more true.

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.055
Every day,

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:03.224
every hour is so crucial

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.268
for the people inside of Gaza

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.728
who are not only facing

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.146
relentless bombardment.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.731
But what the UN is calling

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.065
an unprecedented

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:12.734
humanitarian catastrophe

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.153
that is unfolding.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.030
Clarissa Ward, thank you so much.
