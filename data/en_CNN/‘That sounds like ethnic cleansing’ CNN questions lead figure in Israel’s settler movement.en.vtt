00:00:01.042 --> 00:00:02.252
High in the hills of

00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:04.004
the occupied West Bank.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:04.629
A flag

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:05.922
flies in the face of a

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:07.674
Palestinian village.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:11.803
God is king, it says to young settlers.

00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:14.139
Guard this illegal outpost.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.725
Construction hasn't even begun.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:20.061
But we are not welcome.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:21.938
So they are asking us to leave.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.190
They don't want to talk to us.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.525
They said they've been here

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:29.696
for about nine months.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.406
Dotted across the landscape,

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:32.949
more signs of the fight

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:33.575
to assert

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:37.037
Israeli control over Palestinian land.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.788
The Arabic names on signs

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:41.166
post crudely erased.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.792
Under international law,

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:43.793
the beating Douglas

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.378
settlement is illegal.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:46.921
But last February,

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.006
the Israeli government

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.507
officially recognized it,

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:52.343
along with eight others, a move the U.S.

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:54.471
strongly opposed.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:55.805
Come on.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:56.389
We're here

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.725
because God promised us this land,

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.686
as real, Bekaa tells us.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.479
Now, these

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:03.563
settlers have set

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.565
their sights on a new prize,

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.776
one that seemed utterly impossible

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:10.779
before October seven.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.615
Returning to Gaza, they cheer.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.450
That is the goal of Zionist

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.036
settler organization Nahla.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:20.121
One of more than a dozen groups

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.164
now advocating

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:22.540
for the reestablishment

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.086
of Israeli settlements in Gaza.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.962
A recent promotional video

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:28.755
even boasts

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.216
that Gaza will become the next Riviera.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:32.092
Don't sit on it.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.844
Not live here.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.971
Daniella Weiss is the godmother

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:37.972
of the movement

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:40.266
and she's already started recruiting

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.310
from the 700,000 strong

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.270
settler community of Israel.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.523
We're just arriving now at a settlement

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.316
in the occupied West Bank,

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:50.276
and we're heading to a talk

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:50.985
that Daniella

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:52.904
Weiss is giving to a group of people

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.823
who are potentially interested

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.324
in resettling Gaza.

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:58.034
And I know that it is.

00:01:58.034 --> 00:01:58.993
We are for the land

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:01.996
of Israel and Ben-Gvir, she says.

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.999
About 20 people gather in the living room

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.085
of a family. Farm on Miriam.

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.086
Way snows that

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.796
for many in this community,

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:12.757
there is deep nostalgia for Gush Katif.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.510
A block of 21 Israeli settlements

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.178
that were forcibly evacuated

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:19.514
by the IDF in 2005

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:22.475
when Israel left the Gaza Strip.

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.228
Then this is the vision of Gaza,

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:26.187
she says.

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:29.315
You see all the nucleus groups in Sheba.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:31.568
A map has already been drawn up,

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:32.235
with six

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.403
groups laying claim

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.488
to different parts of the enclaves.

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.115
So they've just been handing out

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:38.408
these little booklets

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:41.786
that say people of Israel return home.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.079
And then underneath.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.289
A call to return

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.667
to the settlements of Gaza, to Florida.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.794
One of the organizers tells the group

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:51.045
they have a representative

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:54.048
flying to Florida to raise money.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.675
Nicola gets support

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.760
from a number of groups in the U.S.,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.053
including AFC

00:02:59.053 --> 00:03:01.514
Americans for a Safe Israel,

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.850
which cosponsored a recent webinar

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.768
on the return to Gush Katif.

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:07.896
Even as the Biden administration

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.522
has cracked down on settlements

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.857
in the West Bank, there is.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.276
A very strong support

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:16.696
from very prominent from very, yeah,

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:20.074
I would say wealthy people.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.076
Wealthy Jews in the US.

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:22.952
In the US.

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:24.120
Can you name any names?

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.707
No, I cannot. No.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.333
Back at her

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.251
home in Cardamom settlement,

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.462
Weiss tells us she's already enrolled.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.881
500 families.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:35.882
I even

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.717
have on my on my cell phone

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:40.053
names of people who say to enlist

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.096
me, enroll me. I want to join.

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:43.514
I want to join the groups

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:45.141
that are going to settle Gaza.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.100
I have to ask you, though,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.894
because we're sitting here talking

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.230
and we're listening. I'm listening.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.731
I hope you are listening to it.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:52.857
Is a reminder,

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.067
I think, of

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.818
the people who live here,

00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:57.570
but also the people who live in Gaza.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.322
What happens to them

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:00.281
in this vision

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.158
of this new settlement with

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.327
Jewish settlers, even in Gaza City?

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.037
What I think about Gaza,

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:09.499
the Arabs of Gaza lost the right

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:13.002
to be in Gaza on the 7th of October.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.629
Yes, I do hear the mosque.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.091
I do hear the the the that the the prayer

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:19.634
things where different

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.594
until the 7th of October.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:22.387
No Arabic

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.348
speaking about more than 2 million Arabs.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.225
They will not stay there.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.227
We Jews will be in Gaza.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:32.230
That sounds like ethnic cleansing.

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:35.566
The Arabs want to annihilate the state

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:36.651
of Israel.

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.653
So you can call them monsters.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:41.656
You can you can call their

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:44.492
call them cleansing of Jews.

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:47.078
We are not doing to them.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.539
They are doing to us.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.290
I couldn't

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.418
make it clearer when I said that myself

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.335
as a person

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:55.545
who is preoccupied

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.088
with settling the land

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:59.674
until the 7th of October.

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:03.177
I didn't have plans of returning to Gaza.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:03.886
It's clear

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:07.015
I'm not interested in cleansing.

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:08.850
What is clear is that Weiss

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.143
has views traditionally

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.103
seen as extreme in Israel

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.563
have become more popular

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.606
since October 7th.

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:17.984
In late January, jubilant crowds

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.360
packed an auditorium

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.195
in Jerusalem for the victory

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:22.780
of Israel conference,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.783
calling for the resettlement of Gaza.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.119
A poll that month from the Jewish People

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.329
Policy Institute

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:29.787
found that

00:05:29.787 --> 00:05:32.373
26% of Israeli eyes

00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:34.083
advocate the reconstruction

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:35.752
of the Gush Katif settlements

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:37.920
after the war is over.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.756
Among supporters of Prime Minister

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.382
Benjamin Netanyahu's right

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:42.258
wing coalition

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:46.220
government, that number jumps to 51%.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:48.181
Several ministers were present

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.223
at the conference,

00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:50.433
including far right

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:54.896
Heritage minister and the High Eliyahu

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:57.607
in a rare interview with Western media.

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:58.358
He tells us

00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.859
his political decisions

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.944
are guided by the Torah.

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:02.653
But is there.

00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:04.697
Anything about Gush Katif in here?

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.366
Yes. Yes.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.575
The because the Muslim.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:08.576
And the settlements

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:09.369
in Gaza

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.661
are needed to prevent

00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:12.455
another October seven.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.874
A look at the language of the land

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:15.541
says that

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.251
wherever there is a Jewish settlements,

00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:19.003
there will be more security.

00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:19.545
Doesn't mean

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:21.255
there will be absolute security,

00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:22.965
but there will be more security.

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:24.550
Why would you advocate for

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.804
something that many would say is illegal,

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.555
is immoral,

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.599
is not supported

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.268
by the majority of Israelis,

00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:37.188
and is also very harmful to Israel

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:39.774
in terms of its international standing?

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:42.068
Lamont enclosed incredulously.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.152
Why do you think it's immoral

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:43.861
to take land

00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:46.072
from someone who wants to kill me?

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.366
Why is it immoral to take my land

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.034
which my ancestors live there,

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:51.452
which I've even given up

00:06:51.452 --> 00:06:51.994
to someone

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:54.705
who slaughters, rapes and murders me?

00:06:54.705 --> 00:06:57.417
What is more and more than that?

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.418
Netanyahu has

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.294
called resettling Gaza, quote,

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:02.296
an unrealistic goal.

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:04.882
And most Israelis.

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:06.676
But that hasn't stopped scores

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:08.010
and IDF soldiers
