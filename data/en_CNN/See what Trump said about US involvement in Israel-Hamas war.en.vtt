00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.735
Former President Donald Trump now

00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:03.069
suggesting the U.S.

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:04.004
should take a hands off

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.072
approach to the Israel-Hamas war.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:06.673
Here's what he said

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:07.307
during an interview

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:08.708
with Univision on Thursday

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:10.510
when asked how America might help

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.746
stop the civilian killings in Gaza

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.416
So you have a war that's going on

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:16.750
and you're

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.384
probably going

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:18.818
to have to let this play out.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:19.719
You're probably going

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:20.820
to have to let it play out

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.189
because a lot of people are dying.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.458
There is no hatred like

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:29.429
the Palestinian hatred of Israel

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.164
and Jewish people.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:34.267
And probably the other way around also

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:35.235
I don't know.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:35.502
You know,

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.403
it's not as obvious,

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.571
but probably that's it.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:39.572
All right.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.274
Let's bring in CNN's Max Foster,

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.143
who is live from London.

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:44.844
Max, always wonderful. To see you.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:45.812
Trump also said

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:46.513
Israel needed

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:49.749
to do a better job of public relations,

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.518
and he pointed to this rash

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.987
of pro-Palestinian protests in the U.S.

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:56.222
and obviously earlier in all of this.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.325
He went after Prime Minister Benjamin

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:02.095
Netanyahu for not being prepared.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.030
What what is your sense of

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.432
what's going on here?

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:06.666
Well, I think that clip, you know,

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.569
if you move away from a lot of,

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:10.904
you know, how he says it

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:11.571
and you know

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:12.839
specifically what he's saying

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.707
and what he means,

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:15.608
which is what I try to do

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:16.176
with Donald Trump

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.310
when it comes to international policy,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.412
at least it's pretty significant.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.682
What he's effectively saying is,

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:22.982
you know,

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:23.450
he doesn't

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.585
see if we look back

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.587
at his previous tenure as well

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:28.955
and how he played that out

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.023
and what he's saying here

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.291
about this Middle East crisis,

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:31.991
it's like

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:33.326
he doesn't see America

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:35.862
as that international policeman,

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:37.097
which actually the rest of the world

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:37.764
has relied on

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.332
for decades and decades and decades.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:42.702
So focusing more on American problems

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:45.004
which a lot of Americans will relate to.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.039
But outside America,

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.407
that does have a huge impact

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:48.541
because you and I

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.142
are talking a lot

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:49.542
about this

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:50.343
new world order

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:52.612
that China and Russia want to create

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:54.447
America pulling back

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:55.515
for the international stage

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:56.149
and saying they're not going

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.251
to get involved in like crises like

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.153
the Middle East does create a vacuum.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:00.687
And you know

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:01.855
who's going to step into that?

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.923
So it has huge repercussions.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.959
That little soundbite for me when I

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:06.993
when I look at it

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.428
and if he does get into power,

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:09.729
are we going to see

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.030
America less president

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.132
on the international stage?

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.634
So certainly militarily, it seems.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:15.969
Yeah, honestly,

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.537
it's really, really interesting.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:17.837
You know,

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:18.805
I'm thinking about

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:19.672
how Vladimir Putin

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:20.473
is backing off

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.142
of Israeli

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:22.842
support for Israel

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.677
that he previously had in the context

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:25.145
of this.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:25.845
And Trump does

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:28.581
have a way of picking up on things

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:29.849
that are going on in the electorate

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.284
and really putting his finger on things

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:32.886
as uncomfortable of a reality is

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.287
that might be

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:35.788
he does have a really strong nose for it.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:36.589
And it's interesting to me

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.391
that this is what he's picking up.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.261
Let's also, Max, talk about Nikki Haley,

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.730
because in the Republican primary debate,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.732
she did seem to gain more ground there.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:46.533
She's sort of

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.601
becoming the person who is first

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.236
in the race for second place

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.307
But she did make this statement

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:57.410
about Vivek Ramaswamy on the stage

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.012
because the two of them really tangled.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.247
Take a look at what she said.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.185
I am telling you, Putin and President

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.686
Xi are salivating

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.154
at the thought that someone like that

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:09.122
could become president.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:12.058
They would love to come back to the mat.

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.660
What's your your take away from there?

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.993
I mean, what

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.161
what does the international community

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:15.828
think, if anything?

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:15.962
I mean,

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:16.663
are these two known

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:17.630
on the national stage?

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.899
What's what's the impression?

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:20.600
Well, you know,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.468
people know about international policy,

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:23.703
certainly know about Nikki Haley.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.305
She is this sort of towering figure.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:26.506
She's got a lot of experience

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.941
and certainly stands out in that sense

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.541
from the

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:29.442
in the line up

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:30.810
with all the other candidates.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.212
But if you're not into

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.980
international policy,

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.215
I don't think you would

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.183
necessarily know who she is.

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:39.953
People aren't watching these debates

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:41.554
in big numbers at all here

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.122
because Donald Trump isn't involved

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:43.957
and they wonder why

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.658
they're taking place, that they're not

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:46.693
learning about her there.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.661
I think you really need to be

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:49.596
looking at running a swarm

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:50.296
if you're talking about

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.531
international profile

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:54.434
because he is a big deal and tick tock.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:55.635
My kids will show me

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.403
tick tock with him in them.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:58.538
Very serious

00:03:58.538 --> 00:03:59.572
and they never show me

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.607
tick tock from Nikki Haley.

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:02.442
And let me just say that,

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.110
I mean, in terms of profile,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.011
I would say he's

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:07.213
the only person my kids and their friends

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.048
to pick out in that entire lineup.

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.550
Apart from Trump.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.885
That is wild and extremely,

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.287
extremely interesting.

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:14.721
You know,

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:17.290
the fake one after Nikki Haley's daughter

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.091
over tick tock.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.659
So the fact that

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.327
people overseas know him

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:23.196
for being on tick tock.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:23.596
Okay.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.231
Well, it's not necessarily his

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:26.165
own profile.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:27.400
I mean, it is that as well.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.435
It's also people just picking up

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.870
clips from the debates

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.238
and they're always about him

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:33.106
and they're the ones that go

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.774
viral over here.

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:35.975
I guess that is kind of the

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:37.477
what he set out to accomplish.

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:37.710
All right.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.678
Max Foster,

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:39.612
thank you as always, my friend.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:40.179
Have a great weekend.
