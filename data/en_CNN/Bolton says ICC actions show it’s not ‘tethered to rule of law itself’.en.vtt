00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:01.668
Tonight, President

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:02.068
Biden is

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:03.169
openly rebuking

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.671
the International Criminal Court

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:05.672
prosecutor

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:06.639
for seeking an arrest

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.842
warrant against both Hamas's

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.510
and the leader in the Israeli

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.746
Prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:16.883
for what they say are war crimes.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:18.485
Let me be clear.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.653
We reject the ICC application

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:25.525
for arrest warrants against Israeli,

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.260
whatever these warrants may imply.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.294
There is no equivalence

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.263
between Israel and Hamas.

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:31.431
Contrary to allegations

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.265
against Israel made

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.034
by the International Court of Justice,

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.603
what's happening is not genocide.

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:39.973
We reject that.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.508
That is a notable comment

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:42.375
from President Biden

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.009
there, flatly

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:44.677
rejecting accusations

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.980
that there's a genocide underway in Gaza.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.049
I should note those accusations

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.816
which have been made

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.851
in the International Court of Justice

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:52.552
are separate

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:53.586
from today's actions

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.922
in the International Criminal Court,

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.857
which seeks to hold individual Hamas

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:00.493
and Israeli leaders both accountable.

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.129
The ICC chief prosecutor, Karim Khan,

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.998
convened a group of legal experts

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:05.832
that also included

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:08.001
the human rights attorney, Amal Clooney,

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.136
to advise on these warrants.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.271
He defended this in

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.472
an exclusive interview

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:16.709
with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:18.044
Nobody is above the law.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:21.247
No people, by dint of birth or passport,

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.382
religion, nationality

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.250
or the color of their skin,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.952
how they get out of jail

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:26.453
free card,

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:27.987
have a free pass to say

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.556
what the law doesn't apply to us.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:31.825
Every human life, every baby

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:32.659
that is killed,

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:33.860
whether it's a baby

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.029
that's cruelly abducted by Hamas

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.597
and killed or a baby

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.032
that's been

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:40.033
bombed or killed

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.202
or has died in incubators

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.636
because of no electricity

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.506
or water or food in Gaza

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.574
for them, for their families

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:48.842
and for humanity, humanity.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.043
It's a tragedy.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:51.678
And this is why we have a court.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.546
It's about the equal application

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.648
of the law.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:56.983
Here tonight to discuss,

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:57.717
John Bolton,

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.452
the former national security adviser

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.020
under former President Donald Trump,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.955
also the former U.S.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.690
ambassador to the United Nations.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.225
Ambassador Bolton, first.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.360
Let me get your reaction to what we heard

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.428
from President Biden.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.263
He had a pretty blunt rebuke

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:10.730
of what

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.298
we just heard there from the chief

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.400
prosecutor at the ICC.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.869
And this idea that they are going

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.270
to seek these warrants

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.705
for both the leaders of Hamas,

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.940
but also the Israeli prime minister

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.444
and the defense minister.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.379
Well, Biden is half right.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.714
What's really illegitimate

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:28.882
here is the International

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:30.683
Criminal Court itself.

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:31.651
It's a fantasy.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.653
It's a piece of government,

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:34.687
not a whole government,

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:35.688
a piece of government

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:36.823
floating around

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.691
in the international ether,

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.960
unchecked by executive

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.595
or legislative power,

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.598
utterly unable to enforce its judgments

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:47.267
and acting in a way that's

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.002
predictably irresponsible.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.003
For many years,

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.571
people have referred to Israel

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.806
as the canary in the coal mine

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.475
on behalf of the United States.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:56.809
This is another example,

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:57.510
because what

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.045
this rogue prosecutor,

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:01.681
this utterly unaccountable court

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:03.883
is doing here against Israel,

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:05.051
they're going to do against us

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.619
soon enough. Well, so what do you mean?

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.655
That the President Biden is half right.

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:09.556
He was he's

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:10.723
basically agreeing with you

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.358
that both of you agree

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.359
this is it's

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.894
wrong to say that you're going to go

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.095
after the leaders of Hamas

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.064
and also the Israeli leaders

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:19.532
and kind of create this equivalence

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.901
between the two of them.

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:22.769
No, I'm

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.404
saying it's wrong to go after

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:26.639
and this court is not the body

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.774
to prosecute anybody.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.475
The court has also

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:30.977
indicted Vladimir Putin

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.145
in connection with Russia's

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:33.813
invasion of Ukraine.

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:35.415
That's the wrong way to do it, too.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:36.549
You can't the

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.552
the the charge of moral equivalence

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:41.521
gives legitimacy to the court.

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:42.088
In effect,

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:43.323
if they indict really bad

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:44.991
guys, they're in favor of it.

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:47.560
And the fact is, it's the court itself

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.963
that's fundamentally flawed.

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:52.298
The example is right here in this case,

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.834
this unaccountable prosecutor

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.469
is interfering right

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:57.337
in the middle of

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:58.471
active conflict

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:01.407
now in a real government with real power.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:02.075
In our case,

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.110
the president has both the war power

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.778
and the prosecution power

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:07.880
and sometimes has to make a trade off.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.083
This utterly unaccountable prosecutor

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.085
didn't make any trade off at all.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.153
And I think people should ask,

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:16.723
does this now make settling the conflict

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:19.292
in the Middle East easier or harder?

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:20.927
It won't matter to the prosecutor

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.328
because he'll never be held

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:23.630
responsible for it.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.330
Yeah, and obviously,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.732
you mentioned Putin there

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:27.867
and he's not really traveling a lot

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:29.335
maybe to China or something, but.

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:31.271
But what does this move mean

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.239
if they do get the judges

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:34.340
to sign off all these warrants?

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.341
And we don't know that they will.

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.910
But but if they do and they're executed,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.112
what does that mean

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:39.879
for Israel's

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.949
allies who are parties to this court

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.151
and they're technically supposed to

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:46.719
to arrest them

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.121
if they travel and they

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:51.557
have an ICC warrant?

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:54.160
Well, it should be a wake up call to them

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.994
that they've stepped

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:58.898
into a very dangerous territory here.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.199
And I think this is

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.000
the sort of thing

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.235
that that US

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:03.536
officials need to worry

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.505
about in particular.

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:06.939
You know, the one silver

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.641
lining in this cloud,

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.277
when you look at the self-righteous,

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:12.979
grandstanding, publicity

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.814
seeking prosecutor there,

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.984
I think this is the ICC digging its grave

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:18.651
in this country.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.687
I think I would be happy to predict

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:21.921
right here.

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:22.989
I don't think

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.825
the US is going to join the ICC

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:28.261
within within the life span of anybody

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.796
watching this program

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:32.532
because the targets of this prosecutor

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:34.400
are fundamentally irrational

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.837
to proceed against a free, law

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.673
abiding democratic society

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:41.941
in the way that it did.

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:42.675
Shows it's

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:45.678
not tethered to a rule of law itself.

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.247
But, Ambassador, when you look at this,

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:50.049
there is growing criticism

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:51.918
of how Israel has conducted this war.

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:52.752
I mean, do you believe that

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:54.187
Israel has upheld

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:58.691
international law since October 7th?

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:00.126
I haven't heard

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:02.061
legitimate charges that it hasn't.

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.596
And I think there's been a lot of hype

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:04.230
propaganda.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.531
One very important point,

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:06.866
just to prove that

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.468
there's a lot of United Nations,

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:10.503
the United Nations, the Palestinians.

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.238
Well, okay, let's let's talk

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.339
let's talk about that.

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:17.343
The United Nations just cut in half

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.412
the number of women and children

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:22.248
it reports killed in the Gaza conflict.

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:23.816
Now, this is the United Nations

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:27.687
accepting now the figures of the Hamas

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:28.654
ministry of Health

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:30.590
as opposed to the Hamas

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.158
information office.

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:33.226
But the fact is

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.128
the total number of casualties

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:36.829
and the number, particularly of women

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:38.431
and children killed

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:39.832
has been out of whack.

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:40.466
The U.N.

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:43.136
by its shift concedes

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:46.005
that numbers that have been used

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:46.606
on women

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:49.609
and children have been double what what,

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:51.811
what even another part of Hamas says

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:54.013
and I think this is a media problem, too,

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:55.314
if I may say so,

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.850
you know, these numbers have come from

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.918
Hamas entities

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.520
right from the start of this.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.955
And normally what media outlets do

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.390
when they're given a fact like that,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.258
they think it's important

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.426
enough to report that's fine.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.827
They then go on to say,

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:10.096
we have not been able to verify

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.297
this independently.

00:07:11.297 --> 00:07:11.898
Well, Ambassador,

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:13.966
were any media outlets in the country

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:16.202
because that is verified those numbers.

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:17.103
We have been deeply

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.038
skeptical of the numbers because we

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:20.139
they don't let free

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.340
and independent journalists go.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.743
And CNN is tried on multiple occasions.

00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:25.111
But while

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.013
even if you are skeptical of that

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:28.181
figure, as we've seen, even

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:30.149
President Biden expressed skepticism,

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:31.951
we do know that a lot of women

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.253
and children and Palestinian civilians

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:37.123
have been killed.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.858
Have they been colluding with Hamas?

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:41.427
Do you have any information on that?

00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:42.962
Palestinian babies?

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.664
Can women collude with Hamas?

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:46.299
Can women collude with Hamas

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:46.999
little children

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.301
that we're seeing, Ambassador,

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:48.968
who were in hospital

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:52.338
early 16 or 16 inside this

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:55.441
on this 16, 17 year old,

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.209
four years old.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:56.509
All right.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:59.312
Let's let's take that fun.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.613
Let's let's take that.

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:01.447
The question

00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:03.716
in conflict in urban conflict,

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.685
which the United States itself

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.053
has faced as recently

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:09.322
as Iraq with Fallujah and Mosul,

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.958
is is Israel targeting

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.061
legitimate military targets A and B,

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:16.562
has it taken into account

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:18.898
the proportional collateral effects

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:20.967
if it goes after those targets?

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:22.802
There's no prohibition

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:24.504
about civilian casualties,

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.338
otherwise you wouldn't

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.839
have urban conflict.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:27.640
And the studies

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.842
that were done of American action

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.244
in Fallujah and Mosul

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:33.179
and other places in

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.847
Iraq and Afghanistan

00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:36.816
have shown ratios of civilian

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:38.184
to military casualties

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.686
in the range of 5 to 1 in Gaza

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.989
by Hamas's own statistics.

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.724
The range is 2 to 1.

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:46.325
So I just think it's important

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:49.328
to understand that when Hamas

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:51.330
cynically barbaric

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.967
uses its own population as human shields,

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:58.037
the morally culpable party here is Hamas,

00:08:58.237 --> 00:08:59.972
and no one is defending Hamas.

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:01.140
It's a good conversation to have.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.108
Ambassador John Bolton,

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:04.877
thank you for your time tonight.

00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:05.545
Glad to do it.
