00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.002
Just moments ago, a flairs

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:03.970
seen across the sky and Gaza

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.405
just as we were coming to air.

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.606
We are right now

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.108
witnessing in the midst of this.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.210
Wherever you're watching in Gaza

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.911
the biggest air assault,

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:14.247
anyone who is there on that 25 m

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:16.916
since this war began on October 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.752
And it comes as our CNN team in 

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:19.652
Israel is also now

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:20.420
witnessing rocket

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.955
fire from Iranian backed

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.324
forces in Lebanon into Israel.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.692
This is a pivotal moment,

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:26.526
a crucial moment.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:27.360
The leader of Hezbollah,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.995
in fact, is about to speak

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.231
for the first time since the war

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.866
And what he says could change

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.501
the trajectory of the war.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.536
Jim Sciutto is OUTFRONT on the g

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:36.870
And Jim,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.371
what have you been seeing there 

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.610
Well, this whole past week and l

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.478
we've seen an exchange of fire

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.181
along this northern border, most

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.784
artillery fire, mortar fire.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.318
Today, though, we saw

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.187
the sky filled rockets

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:56.156
coming from Lebanon

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:58.324
into into northern Israel.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.793
And then we also saw

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:00.727
Israeli missile

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.728
defense

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:02.695
high in the sky

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.065
taking out some of those rockets

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.100
Did not appear. They got all of 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.903
Israeli fighter jets higher up i

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.871
responding as well.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.306
Helicopters moving

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.474
in both directions,

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.709
just a level of activity in the 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.013
that shows the level of alarm to

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:21.114
on the border

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:24.017
as the attacks stepped up, comin

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.984
from Hezbollah

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:25.952
in southern Lebanon

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:28.555
and fears of the opening of a ne

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.260
A rocket fired from southern

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.828
Lebanon

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:38.131
sets the street on fire in Kirya

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.166
today in northern Israel,

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:40.800
suffered under

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.735
one of the biggest barrages of r

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.437
since the start of the war.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.406
Our team witnessed the Iron Dome

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:46.773
missile

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:47.640
defense system

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.110
intercept two incoming rockets

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.145
though at least one other caused

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.780
substantial damage.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.648
In response, the Israeli militar

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.383
fired back at what it says

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.319
is the culprit, Hezbollah,

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.720
in southern Lebanon.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.222
Hezbollah sits on a massive

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.424
stockpile of rockets and missile

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.160
far bigger than that of Hamas,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.662
numbering more than 100,000

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.831
Many have the range and accuracy

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:14.067
to strike deep into Israeli terr

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.269
including all the way to Tel Avi

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.403
And this is one sign

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.472
of how seriously Israel is takin

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.473
the Hezbollah threat

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:24.110
Today, we watched Israeli

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.178
special forces

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:26.513
and tank units conduct

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:29.015
a live fire exercise

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.950
training to defend Israel

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.153
in case of invasion from the nor

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.857
These are combined arms exercise

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.025
Israeli Special

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.060
Forces, IDF Special Forces here.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.730
There's also two tanks involved 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.865
It is live fire.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:48.034
It's a measure of the seriousnes

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:50.403
with which they're keeping their

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:51.271
trained up,

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.673
ready to go if necessary in the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.175
But also,

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:55.842
given that we're

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.744
within sight of Syria here

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:58.745
and just a few miles

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.580
from the Lebanon border,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.016
this is also a show of force

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.217
to Iran's proxies.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.285
In the region,

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.521
a show of force perhaps to this 

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.491
Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezb

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.760
to his admirers in the Muslim wo

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.196
He is a leader of the resistance

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.031
credited with forcing Israeli

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.767
forces out of southern Lebanon i

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.403
after an 18 year occupation.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:24.871
To Israel.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.906
He is an existential threat

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.474
on its northern border.

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:30.510
Tomorrow he will address his fol

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.244
and the world

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:32.312
for the first time

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.614
since the October 7th Hamas atta

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.649
The question for many.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.117
Will he order his forces

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:39.152
to join the war

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.221
against Israel more aggressively

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.122
They have the capacity.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:44.057
To do enormous.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.091
Damage,

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:46.526
but I'm not certain

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:47.527
that they really want

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:48.027
to be

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:49.262
on the receiving end of what

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:51.297
Israel is going to send their wa

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:52.865
The threat of escalation

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.901
extends beyond Hezbollah.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.269
Yemen based Houthi

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.371
rebels, also backed by Iran,

00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.272
are firing

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.473
long range missiles

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:02.242
at Israel from the south east.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.644
Another potential front in a war

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.946
that would see Israel surrounded

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:10.783
As the world

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:11.451
awaits the

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:14.621
words of Hezbollah's leader, Nas

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:15.121
Hezbollah

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:17.257
fighters issued their own public

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.358
earlier this week

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.493
saying that their hands,

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:22.629
their fingers are on the trigger

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:23.696
Israeli officials

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.265
have have their own strong words

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.667
communicating to Hezbollah via

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.535
interlocutors in Europe

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:30.570
that if Hezbollah

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.505
gets into this war in numbers,

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.574
that Israel will strike back dee

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:36.175
into Lebanon.

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:37.710
Strong words now.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.178
And now all eyes

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:41.281
tomorrow on the words of the Hez

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.382
leader Erin.

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:43.116
Very sobering.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.385
Jim, thank you very much.

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:47.220
And more breaking news on this,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.855
because CNN is now learning

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:50.757
that Syria has agreed

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:52.592
to provide Hezbollah

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:54.327
with a RUSSIAN-MADE missile

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.261
defense system.

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:56.663
And Oren Liebermann is OUTFRONT

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:57.297
at the Pentagon.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.165
Breaking this news and Oren,

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:00.066
you are just getting these

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.868
breaking details from your repor

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:02.769
This obviously would be

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:03.870
a very significant

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.872
and very serious development.

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:06.839
What more are you learning.

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:08.741
Erin, according to two

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.510
sources familiar with the intell

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.712
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:13.613
has agreed to provide

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:14.113
a Russian

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:16.816
made aerial defense system to He

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.184
And it is the Russian mercenary

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:19.352
group, Wagner,

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:20.887
that will transfer that as,

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:23.489
say, 22 or panzer missile defens

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:25.258
from Syria to Lebanon,

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:26.959
where it could be set up to be u

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.061
Now, what's unclear

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:28.828
from the intelligence,

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:29.996
according to these sources,

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.164
is whether the system

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.832
has already been transferred.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.335
It is a medium range air defense

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.770
and would add to Hezbollah's cap

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.772
if and when it arrives in Lebano

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:41.040
Now, the Israelis have dealt

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.909
with this system in the past in 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:43.776
Take a look at this video.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.878
This is from May 2018.

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:47.947
This is video from the IDF

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:50.850
of them striking say 22 in Syria

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.852
that was operated by Iran

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.054
or being used by Iranian proxies

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:56.689
So they have shown the capabilit

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.191
to handle these systems

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.625
and to strike them from the air.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:00.526
But of course, now

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.362
the situation is entirely differ

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.397
with Israel embroiled with a war

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:05.965
and the possibility

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:07.400
that Hezbollah could enter this

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.202
in a much more significant fashi

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.803
So even if Israel has dealt

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:12.605
with, say, 22 before,

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:14.907
certainly not under these circum

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.242
And that's what everyone here

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:17.944
is watching very closely.

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:20.380
According to other sources on th

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.647
So far, the U.S.

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:22.982
believes that Iran and its proxi

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:25.284
don't want to get involved in a 

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:25.785
But, of course,

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:27.053
as Jim pointed out, the speech

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.988
from Hezbollah leader Hassan Nas

00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:30.757
everyone is watching that speech

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:33.459
to see where this goes and what 

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.161
It's also worth pointing out the
