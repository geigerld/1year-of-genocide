&gt;&gt; REPORTER: CIVILIANS AND GAZA HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE THE WAR INTENSIFIED THEIR. ONE YOUNG BLOGGERS VIDEO DIRECTOR HAS DOCUMENTED THE STRUGGLES AND TRAGEDIES PEOPLE HAVE ENDURED IN THE ENCLAVE AMID THE CONFLICT. CNN'S JOMANA KARADSHEH HAS THAT. UP YOU &gt;&gt; LIFE BEFORE THE WARS FELT LIKE A DISTANT MEMORY FOR VIDEO BLOGGER AYAT KHADDOURA. THEY WERE THE DAYS WHERE SHE WOULD SMILE IN HER VIDEOS, TAKING HER FOLLOWERS BEHIND THE SCENES OF HER WORK IN GAZA. FOR WEEKS NOW, HER POSTS HAVE BEEN ABOUT LIFE AT A TIME OF WAR. &gt;&gt; TRANSLATOR: WE NOW WAKE UP AT 5 AM TO QUEUE FOR BREAD, WE NOW WALK MORE THAN SIX KILOMETERS TO FURTHER -- OF FRESHWATER. WE CHARGE OUR PHONES ON THE STREETS USING THE SOLAR POWER WE CAN FIND. WE CRAVE OUR FAVORITE FOODS, BUT THERE IS NO POWER, NO GAS OR WATER, SO WE HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH CANNED FOODS. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: SHE SHOWED PEOPLE HOW GAZANS SURVIVE, NEIGHBORS SHARING THE LITTLE THEY HAVE TO BAKE BREAD IN CLAY OVENS AND AT TIMES, ABOUT HOW CLOSE DEATH FELT, AS BOMBS RAIN DOWN ON GAZA. &gt;&gt; TRANSLATOR: THIS MIGHT BE MY LAST VIDEO. THEY DROPPED LEAFLETS ASKING PEOPLE TO EVACUATE THE AREA. MOST PEOPLE FLED. PEOPLE WERE RUNNING IN THE STREETS LIKE CRAZY, NOT KNOWING WHERE TO GO. THE SITUATION IS TERRIFYING. GOD HAVE MERCY ON US. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: AS THE WAR INTENSIFIED IN THE NORTH, AYAT DID NOT LEAVE. THE SAFETY THEY WERE TOLD TO EVACUATE TO IN THE SOUTH WAS AN ILLUSION. NOWHERE IN GAZA IS SAFE, SHE SAID. &gt;&gt; TRANSLATOR: DEATH AND DESTRUCTION IS EVERYWHERE IN THE OCCUPATION HAS NO MERCY ON ANYONE, NOT FOR ELDERLY, NOT THE CHILDREN, NOT THE WOMEN, NO ONE. ALL CIVILIANS ARE UNDER FIRE IN WHERE ARE THE DECISION-MAKERS? WHERE'S THE WORLD? GAZA IS BEING ANNIHILATED. WE ARE DYING. SOMEONE DO SOMETHING, ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: BUT THESE DESPERATE CRIES OF SO MANY, LIKE AYAT, I HAVE NOT STOPPED THIS SEEMINGLY ENDLESS NIGHTMARE FOR THE PEOPLE OF GAZA, WHERE BURYING THEIR DEAD HAS WE COME THERE EVERY DAY. EVERY MOMENT FEELS LIKE IT MAY BE THEIR LAST. ON MONDAY, IT WAS AYAT'S KILLED ALONG WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS IN A NIGHT OF INTENSE BOMBARDMENT--. HER LAST VIDEO, THE HAUNTING WORDS OF 27 YEAR OLD, THE FINAL MESSAGE FROM GAZA TO THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; TRANSLATOR: WE ARE HUMANS, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. WE HAD BIG DREAMS. NOW OUR DREAM IS IF WE ARE KILLED, WE ARE A BODY IN ONE PIECE, SO WE CAN BE IDENTIFIED, BURIED IN A GRAVE, NOT BODY PARTS IN A BAG. WHEN WILL THIS WAR END? WHO WILL REMAIN TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED TO US? WHAT WE LIVED THROUGH, WHAT WE WITNESSED. &gt;&gt; REPORTER: JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN, LONDON. &gt;&gt;&gt; HAPPENING NOW, THE TRUCE  BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS APPEARS TO BE HOLDING. MEANING OTHER PIECES OF THE DEAL ARE KICKING INTO GEAR. CONVOY OF UNITED NATIONS TRUCKS  PACKED WITH TONS OF HUMANITARIAN AID NOW MOVING IN TO GAZA VIA  THE RAFAH CROSSING. LET'S SPEAK TO ELENI GIOKOS WHO  IS LIVE FOR US IN CAIRO. SO PLAYING OUT AS YOU EXPECTED. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF AID. NOT QUITE ENOUGH, NOT NEARLY  ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM  THERE, BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT  THAT THOSE TRUCKS ARE GOING IN. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IT IS SIGNIFICANT. AND IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY WAY MORE THAN WE'VE SEEN SINCE OCTOBER 7. IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT  BEFORE THE WAR BEGAN, THERE WERE OVER 445 TRUCKS GOING INTO GAZA  ON A DAILY BASIS ON A GOOD DAY. SO THIS WAS A POPULATION THAT  ALREADY HEAVILY RELIED ON AID. AND THEN YOU SEE THE WAR  BREAKING OUT AND NOW WE ARE  HEARING THAT JUST ABSOLUTE  CATASTROPHIC SCENARIOS ON THE  GROUND AND REI WILL RATED BY THE INTERNATIONAL AID ORGANIZATIONS. BUT I WANT TO TAKE YOU THROUGH  WHAT WE'VE SEEN TODAY. YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING  ABOUT HOW MANY TRUCKS HAVE BEEN  GATHERING AT THE BORDER OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS IN ANTICIPATION  FOR THIS TRUCE TO KICK IN. BECAUSE THERE IS AN  UNDERSTANDING OF JUST HOW MANY  DELAYS OCCUR BECAUSE OF THE  CHECKPOINTS, BECAUSE THEY NEED  TO FIGURE OUT THE LOGISTICS. NOT ONLY ON THE EGYPTIAN SIDE,  BUT ALSO ONCE THEY CROSS OVER  INTO GAZA. 90 AID TRUCKS HAVE NOW GONE INTO THE GAZA SIDE OF THE BORDER,  THAT IS SIGNIFICANT. SO THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH THE  INITIAL CHECKPOINTS, THEY THEN  GET CHECKED ON THE ISRAELI SIDE  AS WELL. AND THEN OFFLOADED AND MOVED  STRAIGHT INTO GAZA. SEVEN FUEL TRUCKS AS WELL GOING  IN. IDF SAY THAT THE GAS QUOTA THAT  HAS GONE IN ALREADY TODAY IS  SPECIFICALLY FOR COOKING  PURPOSES FOR HUMANITARIAN NEEDS  AND HUMANITARIAN INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR TO SAY THAT THIS WAS PART OF THE DEAL. OVERALL OVER FOUR DAYS, 200 AID  TRUCKS ARE EXPECTED GO IN,  130,000 LITERS OF DIESEL FUEL  TOGETHER WITH OTHER GAS TRUCKS  AS WELL EXPECTED TO GO IN. YOU'VE REITERATED THE POINT IT  IS A FRACTION OF THE NEEDS EVEN  QATARIS SAY THAT YESTERDAY, YOU  KNOW, THE TESTIMONIES WE'VE  HEARD FROM PEOPLE INSIDE OF  GAZA, THAT THEY WERE SCRAMBLING  FOR JUST PIECES OF BREAD,  RUNNING OUT OF WATER, DRINKING  DIRTY WATER AND OF COURSE  DISEASES PLAYING OUT RIGHT NOW  WHICH HAS CREATED ANOTHER LAYER  OF THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. WE ALSO HAVE HEARD EGYPTIANS THAT PALESTINIANS  STRANDED IN EGYPT, IF THEY WISH  TO RETURN TO GAZA, THEY ARE ABLE TO DO SO THROUGH RAFAH. THAT IS QUITE IMPORTANT TO  REMEMBER. WE'VE HEARD SOME MOVEMENT ON  THAT THAT IT COULD BE OCCURRING  TODAY. INJURED PALESTINIANS ARE COMING  THROUGH THE RAFAH BORDER, SO TOO ARE FOREIGN NATIONALS AND DUAL  PASSPORT HOLDERS. JUST TODAY SEEING SOME OF THE  IMAGES GOING THROUGH, THERE WERE ACTUALLY BANNERS ON SOME OF  THESE TRUCKS THAT READ TOGETHER  FOR HUMANITY AND THEN ALSO FOR  OUR BROTHERS IN GAZA. SO EVERYONE TRYING TO TAKE AN  OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WINDOW THAT  HAS OPENED UP, BUT THE  LOGISTICAL SIDE WE SHOULD NOT  FORGET WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE  AID DISTRIBUTED IN THE SOUTH OF  GAZA IN THE VERY LEAST. &gt;&gt; AND SPEAKING TO OXFAM  EARLIER, THEY WERE DESCRIBING  HOW THEY HAVE THIS HUGE  CHALLENGE BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF AID AGENCIES THAT WERE USING  CROSSINGS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND  GAZA IN THE PAST, AND THEY HAVE  HAD TO MOVE ALL OF THEIR  LOGISTICS, ALL OF THEIR  OPERATIONS INTO EGYPT, WHICH HAS BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE. SO THIS HASN'T BEEN EASY GETTING THOSE TRUCKS THERE FOR A START. &gt;&gt; Reporter: YEAH, EXACTLY. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS  THAT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IS  JUST CAN WE GET MORE AID INTO  BUT IT IS THE WAREHOUSING AND  LOGISTICAL SIDE OF  CHAINS THAT  THINK OF. AND THEY HAVE TO BE OFFLOADED  INTO TRUCKS BY THE RED CRESCENT. SO THERE IS SO MANY ELEMENTS TO  THIS AND IT IS ALSO THE  CHECKPOINTS THAT REALLY SLOW  THINGS DOWN. U.N. FAR IT INMARTIN GRIFFITH S  THAT THEY HAVE BEEN A PART OF  THE DEAL IN TERMS OF THE FUEL  QUESTION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT  HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STICKING POINT BECAUSE IT COULD END UP IN THE  HANDS OF HAMAS. &gt;&gt; ELENI GIOKOS, THANK YOU. WE'LL BE WITH YOU WITHOUT THE  DAY AS THE AID TRICKLES IN.
