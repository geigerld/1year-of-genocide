00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:05.105
This is the Netzah Yehuda Battalion,

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:07.374
an Israeli army unit

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.309
showcasing their military might.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.511
In a promotional training video

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.146
unavailable for.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.515
But the unit has a decades long history

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.050
of abusing Palestinians

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.284
in the West Bank,

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.284
and the Americans know it

00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:23.857
. A State Department investigation found they had committed

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.359
gross human rights violations,

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.328
but this finding never led to U.S.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:29.295
sanctions.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.430
Even media reports

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.533
of possible sanctions outraged Israel in.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:38.338
Bits on Angela Bassett.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.907
The whole Qatar.

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:43.143
So despite their track record,

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:43.643
the Natalie

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:45.745
Yehuda Battalion is still receiving

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:46.713
American arms

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.382
and is now operating in Gaza.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:50.216
We tracked down

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.352
one former soldier from the unit.

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.353
In a rare interview,

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.054
he remembers

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:54.888
fellow soldiers

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.656
bragging about their excessive

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.591
violence towards Palestinians.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:59.793
We've hidden his identity

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.795
and voice as he fears reprisal.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:02.695
There were some kids

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.731
throwing rocks in a small village

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.666
that normally isn't a big deal,

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.568
but the company commander decided,

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.403
let's throw them a party.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.272
So they took the emergency response team

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:13.840
and 20 soldiers.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.974
They walked door to door,

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:16.843
throwing flashbangs and gas grenades

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:18.211
into people's homes

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.112
as a punishment

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:20.580
for the kids throwing rocks.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.714
Collective punishment?

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.416
Yes. Collective punishment.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.051
The commander said it was fantastic

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.686
to see the look on their faces.

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.421
When we look at those abuses

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.756
that have happened

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.925
in that state over the years.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.760
There's a chain of command here. Yeah.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:36.196
What responsibility

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.931
does the battalion commander?

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.532
The person at the very top.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:40.700
What responsibility

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.302
does that commander have

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:43.470
for what happened?

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.106
I think he has all the responsibility.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:46.940
If these commanders

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.041
don't put their foot down

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.009
and punish them for their behavior,

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:50.810
then they are in fact,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.512
condoning their behavior.

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:54.447
He told us his years in the battalion

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.483
changed his outlook completely.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.585
He now feels compelled to speak out

00:01:58.585 --> 00:01:59.519
about the battalion's

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:01.855
mistreatment of Palestinians.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.490
The officers he's talking about

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.391
follow a chain of command.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.993
What happens under their watch

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.862
is their responsibility.

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:09.963
But despite this,

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.899
we found some of these same commanders

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:13.766
who were in charge

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.068
when allegations of human

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.936
rights abuses emerged

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:19.572
have been promoted again and again

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:22.142
into senior roles in the IDF,

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.277
using facial recognition technology.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:26.312
CNN found this commander,

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.681
Lieutenant Colonel Amitai Okasha,

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.550
now in Gaza, in a senior role

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.552
running ground operations. Be

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:35.622
back in 2019.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:40.260
He ran the Netzer Yehuda battalion Way

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.094
and was in charge

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.762
when these soldiers seen him

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:44.764
laughing as they beat and humiliate.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:47.267
A Palestinian man and his son

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.202
both arrested for assisting the killer

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:51.838
of two fellow Netanya Yehuda soldiers.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.673
That journey to the police station

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.376
left the father with three broken ribs.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.210
Five were later

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.946
jailed for their actions and

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:00.747
their commander,

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.849
Okasha told investigators.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.350
While he condemned the violence,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.418
he said deploying

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.287
the soldiers was necessary

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:08.855
to make the killer pay

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.590
and to create a sense of success

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.858
among the fighters.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.226
He remained as commander

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:16.229
and has been promoted since.

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.531
But Akashi is not the only Netanyahu.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:21.534
The commander with a dark past

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.603
coming in for them.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:26.739
I'm going to see that it's normal.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.540
I'm going to die.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.808
This is Lieutenant Colonel

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:29.943
Marty Sheva

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.645
rousing troops before deployment.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:34.080
But just over a year later,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.949
soldiers under his command

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:36.849
left for dead

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.752
this elderly Palestinian-American man.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:41.287
Oh, more sad here.

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:42.689
Lying on the ground,

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.224
bound and blindfolded

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.325
as a soldier watches.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.693
On his death,

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:49.495
the IDF admitted a moral failure.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:50.296
But no soldier

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.931
faced charges for his death,

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:52.799
and their commander

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.334
faced only a reprimand.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:57.136
Yet still he was later promoted.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:58.538
Now training Israeli ground

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:00.540
troops, preparing to enter Gaza,

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.308
even featuring in high profile

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:04.277
interviews with American media

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:05.545
boasting of his soldiers

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.581
enthusiasm for war, the major concern for

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.383
most of the soldiers

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:11.985
is we're going to have to stop.

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:12.752
We asked the man

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:13.987
previously in charge

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:15.021
of investigating

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.623
the Netanyahu does abuses

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:17.824
for the US government,

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.759
what he made of these promotions

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.728
that is very bad news.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:25.098
that shows, first of all, that Israel,

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.332
that the government of Israel

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:27.734
has no intention

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.402
of holding the Netanyahu

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.037
to battalion accountable.

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.138
He says the US

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:33.873
is not following their own laws

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.408
by sending them weapons.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:35.942
Of course,

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.610
we treat Israel differently,

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.746
and that really undermines,

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:41.514
our human rights advocacy

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:42.582
and the rest of the world.

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:46.019
The law that Congress passed and

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:47.420
our taxpayer

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:50.023
funded assistance

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:52.358
is going to Israeli units

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:53.426
that have committed gross

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:56.429
violations of Human Rights Watch

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.930
this assistance

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.566
despite the growing evidence of abuse.

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.402
CNN exclusively obtained

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.270
the names of three more Israeli

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.039
units found by U.S.

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.440
officials to have committed

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.141
gross human

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:11.144
rights violations prior to October 7th.

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:13.646
All are still operating,

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:14.847
including the Yemen

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:16.349
seen here in Gaza

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:17.216
in an operation

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:19.452
that rescued four Israeli hostages

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:20.853
but left nearly 300

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.155
Palestinian dead,

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.657
according to local health authorities.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:25.091
The Israeli

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.292
military dispute

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:28.861
that the toll was so high,

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.797
such as the death

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.165
and destruction, mounts.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.032
It is U.S.

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:35.935
weaponry supporting these units,

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.070
begging the question

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.771
for how much longer will Israel's

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:41.774
greatest ally choose to turn a blind eye?

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:44.610
