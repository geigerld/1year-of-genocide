00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:03.128
While the Israel Defense Forces say
that they are currently conducting

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:07.090
what they're calling a large scale
strike on terror targets

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:09.801
belonging to Hamas in Gaza,

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.887
that is, the top US diplomat is in Israel.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.808
And the aircraft carrier
Gerald Ford has now moved into

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:19.894
the region as Israeli forces are mass
along the border.

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:20.687
With Gaza.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.565
And there's so many questions
now happening of what comes next.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:28.403
And the real question is how could the
next phase of this conflict unfold?

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.990
I want to bring in CNN military analyst
and retired Air Force Colonel

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.575
Cedric Leighton.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:35.702
Also, actor James Clapper is also back.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:39.748
He's a retired Air Force
lieutenant general, Colonel Leighton,

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:43.626
let's begin with you because
I try to understand, what do we know

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:48.006
about where the Israeli troops are moving
and then what might be coming?

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:49.966
Laura, that's a great question.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.845
Tonight,
we have about 300,000 Israeli reservists

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:56.306
that are actually deployed on the border.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:01:00.018
And so where are they actually well,
this is probably

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:03.730
a pretty good indication
right around all of these areas.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.317
Right here
is where you will find Israeli troops

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:10.361
concentrated
and what are they concentrating with?

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:14.365
Well, equipment like these tanks right
here, they have tanks, armored personnel

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:19.454
carriers and other equipment that they can
potentially use to go into Gaza.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:23.833
And that, I think, is going to make
a big difference in what they could

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:27.378
potentially do with some kind of ground
incursion on their part

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:32.675
It's hard for most people to imagine
just how densely populated Gaza is.

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:34.219
I mean, just we've heard about it.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.346
We've been hearing about comparisons
that are drawn.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:41.893
Tell me about the impact of that
on the next phase of a potential ground

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:42.727
incursion.

00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:47.148
Yeah, that's a very interesting area
as well, Laura, because the most densely

00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:50.443
populated
part of Gaza is the city of Gaza itself.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:56.783
So that's this part right here that has
over 25,000 people per square mile.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.913
Other areas like North Gaza, Darryl
Paula Khan Yunis, which is a major refugee

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.291
camp,
and Rafah, have less population densities,

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:10.004
but still everything in Gaza is basically
with little bit of an exception.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.882
10,000 people or more per square mile.

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:18.012
So you think of a lot of people
that are packed into a very small area.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:22.559
And just by comparison, there are places
that have higher population density

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.980
per square mile around the world,
but Gaza has more populations density

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.401
per square mile, about 21,000 people
per square mile in the urban areas

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:35.321
compared to Tel Aviv, Los Angeles
or here in the Washington, D.C.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.072
area.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.449
Wow. When you look at that comparison,

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.828
it really drives home the point of just
how densely populated and also

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:45.665
what would take place
if you had troops moving into those areas.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:49.085
This is civilians we're talking about
in those areas in particular.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:52.297
And so the US has moved
assets into the region.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:56.259
What role could US firepower play,
if any, going forward?

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:59.888
Well, there are a lot of things
that we would have to contend with here,

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.056
and one of them are the dense streets.

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:04.100
So you look at how narrow things are.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.229
This is what General Clapper
and I would call battle damage assessment.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.315
Perfect video for that.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.275
You see what damage has been done here.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.402
But look how cavernous all of this is.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.448
Look at all the different buildings
and look at how difficult it would be

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.743
to maneuver something through each
and every one of these streets.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.996
So a lot of things
that would be coming into the area

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:29.334
include deliveries of munitions like you
see here from this Israeli cargo jet.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:33.296
You have the USS Gerald
R Ford with its aircraft

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:37.425
is 70 to 90 aircraft depending on
how they did the carrier battle group.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:41.262
And you've got them
coming into the eastern Mediterranean,

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:45.433
along with Air Force F-35s and F-15s,
as well as A-10s.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:48.853
All of those play a huge part
in putting the U.S.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.856
presence in this area and making sure that

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.735
this conflict doesn't go
any further than that.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:56.778
It really has already.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.281
Colonel Leighton, that's so important
to think about and just seeing all that,

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:03.868
Director Clapper, I want to ask you
about what we've been seeing from

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:07.664
Colonel Leighton,
because that population density,

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:11.167
there are hostages likely in Gaza.

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:13.878
You don't know where they are.

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:18.716
You see what is ahead and trying
to move ground troops into that area.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:23.846
What strikes you as the most difficult
aspect of trying to get people out?

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.017
Well, a very compressed geography,

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:31.354
very crowded, urban, urbanized

00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:33.940
terrain.

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.566
Urban terrain.

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:39.070
And so you wonder how, given

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.699
that sort of situation,
how they're going to move all that

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.911
heavy equipment, those tanks down these
very narrow streets that are in the Gaza.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:52.375
So the question that comes to my mind
is what rules of engagement

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.921
is the Israeli Ministry of Defense
and the IDF chief

00:04:57.505 --> 00:05:00.800
instructing,
providing to these the troops?

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.428
How exactly do they conduct themselves

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:08.308
if and when they actually enter enter
into the Gaza?

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:11.102
They've got so
many things to consider here.

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:12.645
A very

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.189
difficult terrain to start within operate

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:19.360
equipment, even in a passive environment,
which are benign environment,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.945
which this is not.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.406
They've got to contend with booby traps,

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:26.492
IEDs, snipers,

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:30.621
and plus the presence of a very dense
civilian population.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.750
And also to to be

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.544
considered
are the location of the hostages

00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:41.215
probably dispersed widely,
probably underground.

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:44.385
So what I wonder

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:49.515
about is, you know, the operations order
that is being issued

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.853
to or will be
issued to the Israeli attacking force

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:58.649
and what the rules of engagement are on
how they are to conduct those operations.

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:00.526
Mindful of all these factors,

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:03.071
there's so much to consider
and we're going to continue to unpack.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:05.323
Colonel DeLay,
and thank you so much to Clapper.
