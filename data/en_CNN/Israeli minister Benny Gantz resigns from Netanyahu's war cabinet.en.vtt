00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.201
We start with breaking news

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.202
out of the Middle East.

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:03.036
A short time ago,

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:03.303
Benny

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:04.237
Gantz, a key

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:06.606
minister of the Israeli war cabinet,

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.308
announced that he is quitting

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:12.512
the emergency government.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.815
We leave the government,

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.917
the emergency government

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:19.219
with a heavy heart,

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:23.323
but your complete heart.

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:25.625
We stand again

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.928
for the campaign for Israel,

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:30.296
for General issues

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:33.733
in order to get real victory.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.702
So we are going to go

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.671
for elections carefully

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.608
and at the end of it will have

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:42.242
a government

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.476
that will have the

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:46.880
confidence of the people.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.081
GANTZ His resignation

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.282
marks a pivotal moment

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.117
in Israel's war against Hamas

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:53.219
and a major blow to Israeli

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.055
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.656
who was facing mounting pressure

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.625
to end the conflict in Gaza.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:00:59.826
His departure comes

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.394
just a day after Netanyahu

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:02.629
failed to meet Gantz's

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.363
ultimatum,

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.131
which was calling for a postwar

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:08.401
plan in Gaza. By June eight,

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:11.071
Gantz delayed his announcement

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.572
after Israeli forces

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.541
rescued four hostages

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.409
from Hamas militants in Gaza.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:16.743
Gantz

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.545
was to make his announcement yesterday,

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.380
which was that deadline of June 8th,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.915
but instead had it.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.450
Today, CNN

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.617
has correspondents tracking

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:25.618
all of these developments

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:26.653
around the world.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.287
Let's begin

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.588
with CNN's Paula Hancocks

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:31.157
live for us in Tel Aviv Paula.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.059
So Gantz had been facing pressure

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.095
to stay in place in recent days.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.229
Netanyahu publicly

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.232
asking him to stay even members

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.300
of the Biden administration

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.402
were urging him to stay.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:48.041
So why did he come to this decision?

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:48.608
Well, Fred,

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.477
what he said in that statement

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:51.478
just a little earlier

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:52.812
this Sunday evening

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:54.514
was that with the Israeli

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:55.081
prime minister,

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.950
Benjamin Netanyahu, at the helm,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.985
that the state of Israel

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.653
could not be victorious.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.656
He said that Israel needed somebody

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:07.227
who put the hostages ahead of politics.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.827
Now,

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:09.028
he has been very

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:11.764
critical of Benjamin Netanyahu

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:12.932
in recent months.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:13.600
Just last month,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.767
he said that if there weren't

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.503
certain conditions that were met,

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.037
then he was going to have to walk away

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.073
from the emergency government.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.841
Now, those conditions were

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:24.410
a definitive and decisive plan

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.146
to get the hostages back.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.781
We know that Gantz has been very vocal

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.183
about his support

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:30.950
for the proposal

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.252
that's on the table at the moment,

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.287
the proposal that U.S.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:35.155
and Israeli officials

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:35.722
are waiting

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:38.324
for an official response from Hamas.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.527
He also said he wants to have a day

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:41.794
after strategy

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:43.997
so the day after the war ends.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.799
What exactly is the plan for Gaza?

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.335
Now, Netanyahu has been very vague

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.337
over recent months when it comes to that.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.540
And then he also wanted a plan

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.874
to calm down the situation

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:56.342
on the northern border

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:59.145
with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon,

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.613
saying that there are tens of thousands

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:02.348
of Israeli residents

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:03.116
who want to be able

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.284
to move back to their homes.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:06.186
They've been evacuated for many months

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.221
now because of tensions there.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.255
So he has said that

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:10.256
those were the reasons

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.891
he needed to step down.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.026
Now, what this means,

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.761
it doesn't mean that

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.896
the government collapses.

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:19.899
Netanyahu still has a slim majority,

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.168
so can continue.

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.336
But it does mean that

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.871
he is far more isolated now.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.807
Both domestically and internationally.

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:30.443
We know that he has a very far right

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.011
element to his coalition.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.680
And Gantz had been seen

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.915
as a counterweight to that.

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.551
He was a key member of the war cabinet.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.053
There was three

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:40.820
members

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.223
that were the main members of that.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.892
The prime minister, the defense minister,

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:46.526
Benny Gantz.

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:48.094
So a third of that key

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:51.097
war cabinet has now stepped down.

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:52.232
And we know that

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.233
that the far right

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.802
wing of Ben-gvir for example,

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:57.637
the Minister for National Security,

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:59.939
wants to be part of that war cabinet.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.909
So there is a fear that that could be

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.010
less of a counterweight

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.845
to the far right elements,

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:09.249
and that is certainly not welcome here

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.017
for many in Israel.

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:12.819
He is a popular figure.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.653
Benny Gantz,

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.622
we've also heard as well, though,

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:16.756
fears of what this means

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.458
for the hostage deal, the cease fire deal

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.892
that is on the table.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:20.593
At this point,

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.328
we've had a statement from the

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:23.630
the group that represents

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.731
the families of those

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.432
that are being held hostage.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.001
And they say they hope

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.336
it won't make a difference to that deal.

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.672
That deal remains as it is,

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:34.507
and they hope that it will be signed

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:36.743
and agreed to very quickly Fred.

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.845
All right, Paula, thank you so much.

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.313
Let's go now to CNN's Ben

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:42.015
Wedeman in Beirut Ben.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.683
You know, officials in Gaza

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:44.350
claim Israel's

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.288
raid left more than 270 people dead.

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:50.223
Israel disputing that number, saying

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:52.592
the casualties were under 100.

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:58.665
What is the reaction like where you are?

00:04:58.765 --> 00:04:59.599
Well, certainly, I think

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:00.800
across the Middle East,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.868
across the Arab world,

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:02.935
there's one of shock

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:06.205
at the high number of casualties

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.174
as a result of that operation

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:09.842
that happened yesterday.

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:11.210
Now, we did get a breakdown

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.713
from the Palestinian Ministry of Health

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:14.847
in Gaza.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:18.084
Of that 274 dead yesterday,

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.321
they said 64 of the dead were children,

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:25.792
57 were women and 37 were elderly people.

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:26.326
And certainly

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.996
from the video we saw yesterday,

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:33.266
there were a lot of wounded children

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:36.102
and women among those being treated

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:37.470
in the hospitals

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.106
in the central part of Gaza.

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:40.673
And, of course,

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:41.407
keep in mind

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:42.842
that many of the people

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.677
who had taken refuge

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:46.245
in Rafah in the far

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.181
south of the Gaza Strip

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.482
had moved north

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.751
because of Israel's operation there.

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:54.320
So they do say that refugee camp

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.322
was teeming

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.424
with people who thought

00:05:58.424 --> 00:05:59.492
they would be safe.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:00.727
And of course, the operation

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:04.397
took place at 11:00 in the morning

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:05.431
on a Saturday

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:07.333
when people were out and about.

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.635
There was a market nearby

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:12.939
where many of the Israeli

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:16.008
ordnance landed, and that would explain

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.112
why there's such a high death toll.

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:22.081
And, of course, people who were there

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:24.784
describe a scene that was absolutely

00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:26.652
horrific.

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:27.987
So, of course, the

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:29.122
increasing bombardment

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:31.224
started hitting everywhere,

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.025
something we never witnessed before.

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:36.129
You can maybe 150 rockets fell

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.097
in less than 10 minutes

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:39.766
while we were running away.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:42.535
A lot more fell on the market

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:44.604
for good reason.

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:45.738
And

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.173
there are children torn apart

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:48.841
and scattered in the streets.

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:51.344
And they wiped out Nusrat.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:55.248
It is hell on earth.

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:57.083
And the worry, of course, now

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:00.086
is that after this operation where

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:02.755
Prime Minister Netanyahu can brag

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.290
that military action

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.925
brought about the freedom

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.160
of some of the hostages,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.461
that perhaps Israel

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:11.330
will be putting that 31st of May

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.632
Biden cease

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:14.801
fire proposal on the back burner

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:15.902
and will continue

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:19.272
with the military option Fredricka.

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:21.240
All right, Ben Wedeman in Beirut,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.575
thank you so much.

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:24.310
On to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.245
now in Wilmington, Delaware,

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:27.213
where President Biden

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:28.614
will soon be returning

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.516
following his overseas trip.

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:31.350
Priscilla,

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.251
how is the White House

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:33.953
reacting to the news of

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:38.925
Benny Gantz's departure?

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:39.692
Well, the White House

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.761
is not commenting on it at this point,

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:42.829
but we do know that U.S.

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.464
officials have been concerned

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.832
about his departure,

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:48.301
jeopardizing those ongoing hostage

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.036
and cease fire negotiations.

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:51.571
And behind the scenes, U.S.

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:53.339
officials have been urging him

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:54.907
not to leave the government,

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:57.009
making the case that it could impact

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:58.778
those ongoing talks.

00:07:58.778 --> 00:07:59.812
And, of course, Benny

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:02.548
Gantz had visited Washington before.

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:04.517
He had met in March with Vice President

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:06.285
Kamala Harris and national security

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:07.687
adviser Jake Sullivan

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:10.690
to talk about the ongoing cease fire

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.325
negotiations and also the day

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.060
after planning for Gaza.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.062
Now, that was in opposition

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:17.663
to Israeli Prime Minister

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:18.631
Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:19.966
and the White House defended

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.167
those talks at the time,

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.235
saying that it was appropriate,

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:23.769
given his position

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:24.871
and that the discussions

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:28.107
were focused on the Israel Hamas war.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.709
Now, of course, leading up to today,

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.010
the other question was

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.744
whether or not

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:33.679
President Biden's proposal

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.948
that for the release of hostages

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:37.750
in exchange for that cease fire

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.285
would reverse his decision,

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:41.521
that he had outlined that on May 31st,

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.989
that those three phases

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.757
and really put pressure on Israel

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:45.525
and all of the parties

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.293
involved to reach an agreement.

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:48.728
But we now know today

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:50.663
that that did not reverse his decision.

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:51.697
And instead, Benny Gantz

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:53.866
is departing the government.

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.501
This also, of course, coming on

00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:56.435
the heels of the operation

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:57.537
that you just heard Ben

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.605
talk about, that rescue operation

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:00.873
that occurred yesterday.

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:01.741
Now, today,

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.075
the national security adviser,

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:04.310
Jake Sullivan, was asked

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.545
about that on CNN.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.246
And whether the US was comfortable,

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:10.049
given the toll on civilians.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:13.452
Take a listen to what he had to say.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.021
The president himself has said

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:15.821
in recent days

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:16.856
that the Palestinian people

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:17.690
are going through sheer

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.358
hell in this conflict

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:21.360
because Hamas is operating

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.062
in a way that puts them in the crossfire,

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:24.196
that holds hostages

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:25.932
right in the heart of crowded

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.033
civilian areas.

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:28.901
Unfortunately, we are going to continue

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.603
to see ongoing conflict

00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:32.204
and military operations

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:34.440
in which Israel makes efforts

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.975
to recover its citizens and frankly,

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:37.577
to recover American citizens.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.580
What we would much prefer to see

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:41.814
is a cease fire

00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:47.053
where the hostages come out peacefully.

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:48.421
So you heard the national security

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.922
adviser there continuing to push

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.490
for a diplomatic solution.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.125
That is what we continue

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.360
to hear from senior U.S.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.962
officials across the board.

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:57.296
Of course, the president

00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:58.764
currently on his way back

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:00.166
from France to here,

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:01.367
Wilmington, Delaware,

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:03.035
where reporters will have a chance

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.637
to ask him questions about this

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:05.972
latest news Fred.

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:06.305
All right.

00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:08.608
Priscila Alvarez, thank you so much.
