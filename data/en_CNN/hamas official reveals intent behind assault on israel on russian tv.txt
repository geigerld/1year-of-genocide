I really like you. A brazen political move. Hamas demands that the US negotiate the release of American hostages on Russian TV. In the end, for long, there are also prisoners in the U.S.. We want them, of course. There are Hamas members sentenced to life in the U.S.. We demand that the U.S. freeze our sons from their prisons. The U.S. conducts prisoner swaps. Only recently it did one with Iran. Why wouldn't it conduct one with us? Confirmation of part of the intent behind the Hamas assaults in Israel. They were enabled by a failure of Israeli intelligence, but plotted by a shadowy Hamas officer. They call Aldin death the guest. Only two photographs exist of Mohammed Dhiab, Ibrahim al-Masri, who's nearly 60. He's known as LDA because he billets as a guest in a different location every night. He's the mastermind or monster behind the murder of more than a thousand in Israel and the kidnaping of about 150 hostages. At the beginning, he was very much interested in fighting before the occupation in the mid 1990s. He was believed to be behind a wave of atrocities in Israel. And in 2014, he's believed to have lost an arm and a leg in an Israeli airstrike aimed at him that killed his wife and daughter. For the last two years, though, Hamas has pretended to focus on welfare, not warfare. All the while under the table, Hamas was preparing this big attack. Israel, meanwhile, invested in automation and sensors, a high technology iron wall around Gaza, and focus forces on the West Bank. Under Deif, Hamas encouraged Israeli complacency. Then last weekend, it hit hard, attacking communication towers and automated machine guns, with drones overrunning command and control centers, killing senior officers, among them three colonels. But the and unleashing terror on thousands of civilians. The Israel Defense Forces found Hamas anti-tank mines and other heavy weapons, a sign they may have planned for a longer stay. The shock infantry attack was either deliberately brutal from the start or degenerated into a massacre. As Israeli defenses collapsed, it shifted attention and power to Hamas. He has become like a god to some, to some of the Palestinians because of what he has done. Many Palestinians are dismayed by the massacre and the bloodshed that's followed. But with the lives of hostages in his hands, the guest now has an unwelcome place in America's mind. Sam Kiley, CNN.
