00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:05.672
And welcome

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.340
back to a special edition of OUTFRONT

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.675
live from Israel.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:09.943
We've got breaking news.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:10.643
We are now learning

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.012
that the death toll from the Hamas

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.913
attacks on Israel has gone up

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:14.914
significantly.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:18.718
That number is now at least 1200

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:19.953
people, according

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:21.821
to an Israeli public broadcaster.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.356
And we have been saying about a thousand.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:24.124
So that

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.459
number going up by at least 200 here.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.696
And it comes as as questions grow about

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.698
who was behind the attack.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.033
And today,

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.335
Vladimir Putin had a very tepid response

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.269
to Hamas's attack,

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.303
which killed at least

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.772
two Russian citizens.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:42.142
Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.846
But it was a double foot high

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.181
after hundreds of Israelis

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.283
were slaughtered by Hamas near Gaza.

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:52.585
Condemnation and condolence is poured

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.120
in from around the world,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.688
but not from Russian leader

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:56.856
Vladimir Putin.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.958
Even now, in his first comments,

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.293
instead of empathy,

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:02.429
Putin blasting the U.S.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.663
yet again.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:04.397
This is a clear

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.465
example of the failure

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:06.466
of the United States

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.967
policy in the Middle East,

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.235
which tried to monopolize

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.070
any settlement

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.605
between Israelis and Palestinians.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:13.339
She also visited

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.707
Nero in

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.077
Kiev, the Kremlin controlled TV following

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.912
suit, mocking both America

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:19.779
and Israel

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.314
for allegedly being caught off

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:23.483
guard by Hamas's attack.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.150
Yes, not no.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.118
Mozart's VI

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.219
is the meaning of the contrast

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.686
with Mozart

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.354
and its famous counterintelligence,

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.322
as well as the U.S.

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:30.223
and its CIA

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:32.292
slept through Hamas's invasion.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.060
It's the biggest Israeli failure

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.362
in security since 1973.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.999
Russia has long been allied with Israel's

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.568
staunchest adversaries

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:42.735
and Hamas's

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.337
most important backers

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.738
bombing Syrian rebels

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.874
in support of pro Iranian fighters

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.442
battling on the side of Syrian

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.343
President Bashar

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:52.579
al-Assad during Syria's civil war.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.050
But Russia also maintained strong ties

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.285
and security arrangements with Israel.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:00.987
Putin meeting

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.489
Israel's prime Minister Benjamin

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.491
Netanyahu on many occasions.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.360
We in no way underestimate

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.028
the importance

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:12.232
of measures that would ensure

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.033
very strong

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:17.137
security of the state of Israel.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.072
But since Putin launched his full scale

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.406
war against Ukraine,

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:23.042
Tehran has become a key ally for Moscow

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.644
at Israel's expense,

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.846
fostering economic and military ties

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:27.614
with Iran.

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:27.947
While

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.883
Tehran provides the Russian army

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.818
with scores of showerhead drones.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.220
The Russians used to hit Ukrainian cities

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.122
and infrastructure, Kiev says,

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:38.491
even though Tehran denies it.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:39.392
Ukraine's president

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:41.427
Vladimir Zelensky, claiming Moscow's

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.962
allegiance in the Middle East

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.031
has shifted towards Tehran.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:46.566
But when we are crises

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:47.867
Kiev propagandists,

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.135
we see how Russian

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:51.171
propagandists are gloating.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.639
We witness how Moscow's

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.907
Iranian allies

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.375
openly lend support

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.277
to those who attacked Israel.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.711
And, Aaron, the Kremlin has denied

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.446
Vladimir Lewinsky's allegation

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.548
that the Russians are trying

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.249
to inflame the situations

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.450
between the Israelis

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.718
and the Palestinians.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:06.486
However, the former

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.721
chief rabbi of Moscow, who, of course,

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:09.889
fled Russia

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:10.890
about two weeks

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:11.491
after the

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:13.026
full on invasion of Ukraine,

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:13.593
he today

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.528
said that the lack of show

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.563
of support

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.130
of Russia

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.232
for Israel is an ominous sign

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:20.700
of deteriorating relations

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.568
between those countries.

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:23.836
Erin.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.306
Fred, thank you very much.

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:26.906
And OUTFRONT

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.575
now, the former Israeli ambassador

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:29.742
to the United Nations

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:31.444
and Israel's former deputy

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:32.946
defense minister, Danny Danon.

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.514
And I really appreciate your time.

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:35.348
Ambassador, so

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.116
friends reporting

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:37.884
Russian citizens

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:38.885
are killed in the attack.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.621
Putin silent really for days.

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:43.890
Many Russians live in Israel.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.958
There are very close ties

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.093
between those two countries as well.

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:48.361
And yet Putin showing virtually

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.230
no sympathy at all for Israel.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.731
Nothing at this point.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.167
Why do you think that is unacceptable?

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.569
We have witnessed the whole attack

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.570
against Israelis.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.372
1200 people were killed,

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:01.307
butchered in a daylight.

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:03.309
So we expect more than a leader.

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.011
We saw President Biden's speech

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:06.546
and we appreciated the speech.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.014
It was very emotional.

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.349
It was a remarkable speech,

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.849
I have to tell you,

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.018
because we are still digesting

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:13.019
those attacks.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.120
It was very hard for us.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.222
The pain is still in our stomach

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:16.923
and we are grateful

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.825
for the support coming from the U.S..

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.093
For you, hope for more

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.761
almost all over the world.

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.896
I cannot explain Putin's behavior.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:26.733
So the Fred Pleitgen Pleitgen pointed out

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.501
Russia has long been allied with Iran.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:28.868
And, of course,

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.870
we've seen that intensify.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.372
If I could use that word

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:34.440
with the Ukraine war as well.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.876
Iran is a key backer of Hamas.

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:37.810
Do you think that

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:40.813
if Iran had any advance knowledge

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:42.081
that Russia would have had advanced

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:42.448
knowledge?

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:42.582
I mean,

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:44.150
do you see any ties here

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.985
that you're starting to tie together?

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:47.453
Well, Iran is very involved

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:48.588
in what's happening here.

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:50.556
They are funding Hamas and Hezbollah

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:51.491
for years.

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.526
They are training Hamas operatives.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.128
We know that Hamas experts

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.162
went to Tehran

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:57.864
to get training about explosives

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:59.032
and other things.

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:00.733
Do we know what Iran is involved in?

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:01.968
Maybe. I don't know for sure.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.269
But maybe what we saw in the last

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:04.037
few weeks,

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.371
the relationship between Israel

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:06.572
and Saudi Arabia,

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.608
it wasn't very good for Iran.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:09.976
So maybe that is the reason

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:10.576
for the timing,

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:11.144
because it wasn't

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.279
until a vocal attack against Israel.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.447
Nobody can find logic

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:16.783
for the timing of this vicious attack.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.651
So how how involved do you think

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.085
Iran was?

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.553
I mean, the White House has been careful.

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:21.821
They they've sort of said

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:22.755
that there's ambiguous

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:25.658
ties, that Iran is broadly and complicit,

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:27.026
but that there's no intelligence

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:28.328
directly linking

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.330
Iran to this actual attack.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.365
Do you buy that? No.

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.633
When you fund the Hamas

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:34.967
and you give them a hundred

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:37.036
of billions of dollars every year,

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:38.404
you control Hamas.

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:40.540
So basically, both Hamas and Hezbollah

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:42.475
are proxies of Tehran.

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:43.643
They control them.

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:44.577
And that is why we are sending

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:45.845
a very clear message today

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:48.081
to Hezbollah and to Tehran.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.048
Watch very carefully

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:50.450
what we will happen in Gaza.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.617
Don't mess with us.

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:52.885
We are not playing anymore.

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:55.021
We will not hunt down Hamas.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.557
And if anyone will try to play with us,

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.858
either from north

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.360
or somewhere else,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.562
it will be under our guns as well.

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:04.597
So as you are massing

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:05.565
IDF forces,

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:06.566
paratroopers, snipers

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:10.837
along that Gaza border, is there anything

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:11.971
that will be off limits

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:14.707
when if I

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:15.074
assume at

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:17.243
this point is when Israel goes in,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.046
we will do whatever is necessary

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.647
to eliminate Hamas.

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:22.915
We going to come from the sea.

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:24.283
We're going to come from the land.

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:25.518
We're going to come from the air.

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:26.953
We're going to hunt them down.

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:29.188
They butchered 1200 Israelis

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:31.224
and they went to the communities.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:31.891
We did not attack

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.693
soldiers, attacked women.

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:34.260
Today, we

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.928
we actually saw the pictures

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.130
of innocent babies

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.332
that were tied up and burned alive.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:42.001
Those are animals. We have to fight them.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.603
We have to hunt them down.

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:44.904
And we are committed to do it.

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:45.138
You know,

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:47.340
we are still in in pain, in shock.

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.308
And I think in a few days,

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:50.676
we will start to show

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:52.245
the might of the IDF,

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.913
the strength of the Israeli people.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.114
We put politics aside.

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:56.616
Now we are united

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:57.784
and we going to go into war

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:59.185
against Hamas.

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:00.887
Ambassador Danone, thank you very much.

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:01.954
I appreciate your time.
