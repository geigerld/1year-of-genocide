00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.709
A Palestinian

00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:01.626
American family

00:00:01.626 --> 00:00:02.377
is in mourning

00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:04.713
after 42 of their relatives

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:07.048
were killed by airstrikes in Gaza

00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:08.591
in just one days time.

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:10.051
Three generations of this

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:11.553
family were gone.

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:12.762
The youngest among them,

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:15.015
just three months old.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:15.932
Some of the images

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:17.809
you're about to see are disturbing.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:19.394
CNN's Isabel results

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:23.773
brings us their story.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:24.941
A crowd of neighbors

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:25.859
and survivors

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.862
working together to bury loved ones

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.031
wrapped in white burial shrouds.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.699
Their bodies are carried

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.993
and lined up inside a mass grave.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.412
They belong to one family

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:39.080
thousands of miles away in the U.S..

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.873
Family members

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.876
across three states are united in grief.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.377
I'm still in this nightmare.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.545
I'm still not

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.589
I haven't woke up here in Florida.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.882
John, Abu Shaaban

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.134
can't bear the unimaginable loss.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.469
That's my cousin, his son.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.805
Three generations gone in a single day.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:56.806
Back to back air

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:57.599
strikes, a family

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.769
says, in Gaza, killing 42 relatives.

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:03.396
The youngest just three months old.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.440
Abu Shaban tells CNN

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.149
a video shot

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.108
by a neighbor shows

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.194
charred ruins and rubble.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:10.236
All that's left

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.363
of the so-called family compound.

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:15.700
We've never seen in this day and age, one

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:16.868
where the whole world is

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:20.038
watching, innocent people just being torn

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:20.955
apart, family,

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:23.833
whole families just wiped off the map.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:24.876
The family blames

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:27.670
the deaths on Israeli airstrikes.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.965
CNN cannot independently confirm that.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.426
Israel has launched numerous airstrikes

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.427
on Gaza City

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.678
since the terror attacks

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:37.013
on October seven,

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:39.265
including multiple strikes in the area

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.308
that day.

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:41.976
The Israel Defense Forces

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:42.894
did not comment

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:44.562
on the purported airstrikes.

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:45.855
I mean, in my family members,

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:48.191
we have no Hamas members.

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:50.026
They're just ordinary people.

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:53.822
Doctors and grandmothers and grandfathers

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:57.534
and uncles and aunts and and children.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.620
I mean, if you want to exterminate Hamas,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.871
you should go to the source.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.748
Among the dead, four brothers,

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:05.166
all doctors.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.042
Family members say

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:07.127
they operated Gaza's

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.294
largest network,

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.213
a family owned by clinics

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:11.339
and independent journalists

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.675
on the ground captured the aftermath

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:16.302
and the moment survivors pull body

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.680
after body from beneath the rubble,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.141
including Mona Abu Siobhan's uncle,

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.143
his wife and son.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.061
The three had recently left their home

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:26.312
in a different part of the city

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.231
to stay at the second wheel compound.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.315
Mona says

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.358
their previous home,

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:32.110
where they were at before

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.403
they were told to evacuate,

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.445
so they assumed that

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:35.655
they were going to be safe.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.115
So they went to a safe area,

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:38.616
a safe house, basically.

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:40.326
Watching from afar, an Ohio,

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.327
Mona is pleading

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.371
not only for a ceasefire,

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.789
but long term action.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.040
You know, we can't just say,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.292
okay, we're going to stop bombing

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.293
and then it's over.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:49.961
You have to give them,

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:50.962
you know, their dignity.

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:52.255
You have to give the Palestinians

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:55.550
a place to call home. In Minnesota,

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:56.676
community members

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.052
fill up an Islamic center,

00:02:58.052 --> 00:02:59.429
praying in support

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.598
of the so-called family. Alone.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.224
In the face of so much loss,

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:04.559
their family has no time

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.811
to properly mourn, overcome

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:08.188
by constant worry

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.522
for the more than 2 million

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.982
Palestinians in Gaza

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.358
caught in the crossfire.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.902
There's a sense of helplessness.

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:15.195
There's no

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:15.737
you know,

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.363
the only thing we can do is pray.
