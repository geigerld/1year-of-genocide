00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.434
The Palestinian Authority

00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:02.669
is lashing out

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:03.103
at Benjamin

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:05.171
Netanyahu's proposal for Gaza's

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:06.539
postwar future,

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:07.741
calling it a plan

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.843
for the reoccupation of Gaza.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.911
This after the Israeli prime minister

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.513
unveiled a day after plan

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.081
to members of the security cabinet

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:15.915
Thursday night.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.684
It includes the complete

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.953
demilitarization of the enclave

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:20.754
Closing off

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.455
Gaza's southern border with Egypt,

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.457
as well as the overhaul of Gaza's

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.825
civil administration

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.060
and education systems.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.896
It comes as Israel joins talks in Paris

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:31.197
aimed at a ceasefire

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.065
in its war with Hamas

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:32.999
to the potential

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:34.501
release of hostages as well.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.803
There's a growing sense of urgency

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.438
to find an agreement here.

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:38.972
After Israel

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.407
threatened to expand its assault

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:41.341
in Gaza's

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:42.842
southernmost city, Rafah,

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.744
if hostages are not released

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.212
by the start of Ramadan

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.381
in about two weeks from now.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.649
CNN's Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.550
for us with the latest.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.419
So let's just talk about this plan.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:54.587
Nic, demilitarization of Gaza,

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.056
indefinite military control

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.690
by the Israelis.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.758
Also, Israel

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.160
would have basic control

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.261
of all sort of access points

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.562
to Gaza as well.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.264
Just give us more detail

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:04.664
in terms

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:05.465
of what is in this plan

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.700
and how the US will likely respond

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:08.768
to certain parts of this

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:13.239
Yeah, we've actually already heard

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.240
from Secretary of State

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.075
Antony Blinken,

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.010
referring to a couple of parts of it.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.978
He said he'd just seen reports about it

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.347
and had yet to get into the detail of it.

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:24.651
One of the things that stands out in this

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:27.821
proposal by Prime Minister Netanyahu is

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.657
the full control of Gaza,

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.524
all the borders,

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.093
which means taking control

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.028
of the southern border

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:35.728
along

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:36.296
what is now

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.698
the border between Gaza and Egypt.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.267
And he says that is to stop

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.402
any smuggling

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.205
underground using tunnels or overground.

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.507
That would be a significant change

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.742
and could well be contested

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.779
and of course, that thing alone.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.381
And there are other issues as well.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.851
But that just that one point alone

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.487
brings into question

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:03.123
the idea of Palestinian statehood

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.458
if it can't control its borders.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.793
But, of course,

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:07.494
another point

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:08.728
that Prime Minister

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:09.629
Netanyahu

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.797
put in his plan

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.799
is that there will be no independent

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.434
Israel will certainly not recognize

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.603
any independent recognition

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:18.605
of a Palestinian state.

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:19.472
And that's a message

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.774
to the United States.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:22.942
One of the other points,

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:24.377
and this is one of the points that

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.680
Secretary Blinken picked up upon

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.850
is that in the plan, there is

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:32.986
there will be, according

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.487
to Prime Minister Netanyahu,

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:39.058
a border area inside Gaza giving security

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.461
for Israel outside of Gaza

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.230
for as long as is deemed necessary.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.365
And that is something

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:46.499
that the United States

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.636
had previously opposed specifically.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.070
So that

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.273
also seems to sort of fly in the face of

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.442
of what Israel's allies are saying.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.212
Another point that's raised as well

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.247
is Israel

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:02.282
passing over

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.984
or giving some sort of civilian control

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.319
to unnamed,

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.989
unspecified civilian bodies or persons.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.093
But also it talks about de radicalizing

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.230
inside schools, inside

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.733
and welfare institutions.

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:25.605
Again, that that does not really sound

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:28.174
like an independent Palestinian state,

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:28.908
in fact.

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:30.944
This is, I think, the point that that

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.947
the Palestinian Authority are making,

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:35.381
that this is really

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.483
a reoccupation by by Israel,

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.152
although Israel is saying

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.054
it will completely

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:43.923
it will completely demilitarize

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.291
the whole area.

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:48.361
But it clearly wants to be able to have

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.397
the operational ability

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.498
inside the freedom

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:53.633
of operational movement

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.401
for for security measures.

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:56.970
So this is what the Palestinian Authority

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.971
is talking about.

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.072
So this is,

00:03:59.072 --> 00:03:59.706
it appears,

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.307
a very maximalist plan

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.342
that's been put forward

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.943
by the prime minister.

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:05.445
This is not set in stone.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.714
It's something that will be discussed.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:08.982
But I think it indicates

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:11.618
even to allies like the United States

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:15.622
that Israel's position is on on

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:18.124
Gaza is really as strong

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:20.293
and as hard as it has ever been.

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:21.961
Yeah.

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:22.462
I mean, a lot of people

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:23.396
will look at this plan

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.832
and see as a reoccupation of Gaza

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.467
or at the very least preventing

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.535
any kind of Palestinian sovereignty,

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:30.803
at least in the short term.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:33.273
What sort of regional reaction

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.440
are we getting

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.078
so far?

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:39.779
We've yet to

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.881
hear from some of the regional partners,

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:44.584
in particular Qatar, that is,

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.520
that is the interlocutor at the moment

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.821
between Israel and Hamas

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.323
to get the hostages released.

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:52.525
And the language that's been put forward,

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:54.327
although it doesn't specify

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.361
Qatar by name,

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:58.364
but the language seems to imply that

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:01.801
Qatar would not be part of the plan

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:05.004
going forward for having an involvement

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:08.308
as it has had until now,

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:10.877
helping essentially helping

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.046
finance through Israel

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:15.181
in the United States.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.717
The authorities inside inside Gaza,

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.186
that would appear to be ruled out.

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:22.055
Israel is saying that the

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.123
the Arab partners that it would have

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:26.959
to help administer and finance

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:27.960
what happens inside

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.363
Gaza would be of its choosing.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.665
And the indication is that Qatar

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.234
not named but would not be one of them.

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:38.071
So how they'll respond is unclear.

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.572
Obviously, the plan

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:40.707
to control

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.241
the southern border is going to

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.176
affect Egypt.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:45.111
We haven't heard them yet

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.380
reply specifically to this,

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.182
but it will have potentially

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.584
territorial implications for them

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.252
in other implications as well.

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:54.654
And we know that right now

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:56.989
the Egyptians are building a buffer zone,

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:58.791
an additional security zone

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.927
along that southern border,

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.663
potentially in preparation

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.598
for for those Palestinians

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:07.100
who are stuck in Rafah,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.068
if they try to get over the fence

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:10.269
and escape out of Gaza,

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:12.505
if there's an Israeli ground incursion.

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:13.673
But this could also be

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:17.610
potentially because Israel is

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.711
going to it's going

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.813
to take control of that of that border.

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:23.216
Right.

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:23.883
Nic Robertson

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.719
live for us that thank you so much.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:27.854
Israel is rejecting

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:30.289
disturbing allegations reported by UN

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.058
experts of its forces killing,

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.359
imprisoning and raping

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:34.761
Palestinian women and girls,

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:35.061
saying

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.096
the allegations are motivated

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:39.198
by hatred for Israel.

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:41.033
Earlier this week, UN experts

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.335
said they were distressed

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:43.770
by reports of multiple

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.138
forms of sexual assault

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.172
against Palestinian women

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.740
and girls in detention,

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.308
including being stripped naked

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:51.244
and searched by male Israeli

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.378
army officers.

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:52.779
As U.N.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:53.713
experts are calling

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:55.782
for an independent investigation.

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:57.917
And the unique toll on women

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:00.119
in this conflict cannot be ignored.

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:01.921
Statistics from the UN show

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:02.221
that around

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:05.224
70% of those killed in Gaza

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:07.660
are estimated to be women and children

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.962
and that two mothers are killed

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.297
every hour.

00:07:11.297 --> 00:07:12.331
Earlier, my colleague Becky

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:13.833
Anderson spoke to the UN

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:15.568
Special Rapporteur on violence

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:16.369
against Women and Girls

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.770
about these allegations.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.205
Reem al-Salam said that

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:21.841
some of these allegations are not new.

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:24.710
I want you to listen to what was said.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.646
We must remember that

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:29.048
these reports of sexual violence,

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:30.550
especially, I would say,

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.284
committed against

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.118
Palestinian women,

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.320
is one of many egregious human

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.022
rights and humanitarian law violations

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:36.956
that Palestinian women

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.491
are being subjected to,

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.660
including an unfolding genocide

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.962
occupation for decades,

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.097
arbitrary killing, forced starvation,

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.400
the use of reproductive violence

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.501
in particular

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:50.570
as a tool of war against them.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.571
And I would say that

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:53.706
these allegations that we've heard

00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:55.141
also are not new.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.042
They've been pointed out

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:56.876
by human rights

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:58.244
organizations on the ground.

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:00.112
My colleague, the special rapporteur

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:01.414
on the occupied territories.

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:03.583
And our last report also pointed out

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:06.285
that there have been longstanding reports

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:07.854
of Ill-Treatment

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:08.588
and torture

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:10.022
that Palestinian women

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.224
and sexual assault

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:12.124
that they have faced

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:13.359
in Israeli detention.

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:15.194
So we are not talking about something

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:17.563
that has just emerged after October 7th.

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:20.132
UN Special

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:20.766
Rapporteur on

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:22.134
Violence Against Women and girls, Reem

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:23.936
Musallam, speaking to CNN earlier.
