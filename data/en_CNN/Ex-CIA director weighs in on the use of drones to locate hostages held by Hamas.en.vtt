00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.301
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin

00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:02.469
Netanyahu says there will be

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.304
no temporary ceasefire

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.939
unless all hostages held

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.507
by Hamas are freed.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.275
That is despite Secretary of State

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:10.010
Antony Blinken

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.711
calling for a pause today as he met

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.880
with Israeli leaders in Tel Aviv.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.849
Meantime, in his first public remarks

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.317
since the conflict began,

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:18.752
Hezbollah's leader, Hassan

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:19.919
Nasrallah, praised

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.955
Hamas's attacks on Israel

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:22.522
while adding

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:23.256
that Hezbollah's

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.759
primary goal is a cease fire.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.027
He said the possibility

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:27.560
of a larger

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.596
regional conflict with Israel

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:31.698
is a, quote, realistic option.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.766
Joining us now to discuss

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.767
is Leon Panetta.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.468
He's a former secretary of defense

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:36.603
and CIA director

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.304
in the Obama administration.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.740
Sir, thank you so much for being with us.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.175
The leader of Hezbollah

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:43.443
making a lot of threats,

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:46.146
not offering many specifics, though.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.347
How precarious do you think

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.581
the situation is right now

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:53.353
along Israel's northern border?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.088
I don't think there's any question

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:55.922
but that

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:59.325
the situation remains so precarious.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.226
You know, we're

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.462
we're in the middle of the war.

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:05.265
But Israel is proceeding to

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:07.333
go after Hamas.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.502
If they're right and they have, in fact,

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:12.138
taken out Hamas leaders

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:14.841
and are continuing to do that,

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.043
if Hamas feels

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:20.046
that their back is against the wall.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.714
There's no question in my mind

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.451
that they're going to ask for help

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.319
and they'll turn to Iran,

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.188
obviously turn to Hezbollah.

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:31.658
But all of Iran's proxies in the region

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:34.394
from Iraq down to Yemen.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.062
And so I think

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.398
the potential for a possible expansion

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:41.401
of this war is real as secretary.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.403
CNN has learned that the U.S.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:46.005
military is sending surveillance drones

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.407
to fly over Gaza

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:50.310
to try to help the IDF locate hostages.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.111
What can you tell us

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.580
about the capabilities of those drones,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.781
especially in a situation

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:55.949
where the hostages

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:56.916
are likely being held

00:01:56.916 --> 00:02:01.588
in tunnels underground?

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.690
Well, I think it's very important

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.824
if you're going to do

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:05.959
the kind of targeting

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.861
that I think is necessary

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.663
to be able to go after Hamas.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:11.264
You're going to

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:12.532
you're going to have to

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.834
not only use drones.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.336
You're going to have to use

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.738
human intelligence as well.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:21.241
But that's pretty much what we did

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:25.678
in going after al Qaeda after 911.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.014
And we could not have been able

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:30.316
to establish those targets

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:33.353
without the help of drones, but also

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.788
without the help of human intelligence

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.290
people on the ground.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.758
So I'm hoping they can get

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:40.093
that kind of combination

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.261
working with them,

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:44.230
because that is the most effective way

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.532
to make sure

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.133
that you are accurate

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:50.136
in going after Hamas.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.738
President Biden

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:54.407
and his administration has been urging

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:55.642
Israel and Prime Minister

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:56.543
Benjamin Netanyahu

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:59.546
to consider pausing its operation in Gaza

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.181
for a series of different

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.183
humanitarian objectives.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.384
And then Yahoo!

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.152
Is determined to press ahead

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:08.521
and not have any kind of cessation

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.023
of hostilities.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.824
What's the correct course of action,

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.459
you think, from both a political

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.461
and a military perspective?

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:21.134
If you were advising the prime minister?

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:22.368
Well, first of all, I'm

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.970
glad that Secretary Blinken

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.372
went to the area

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:28.641
and asked for that kind

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:30.343
of humanitarian pause.

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:31.444
I think it's very important

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:32.478
for the United States

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:33.780
at the highest level

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.481
to stay in touch with the leadership,

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:38.851
not just in Israel, but in the

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:42.822
the countries that adjoin Israel.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.290
Look,

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.692
this

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:46.926
this is a situation

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:49.929
where the issue is going to be

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.900
is the price right for Netanyahu?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.637
He obviously is in the middle of a war.

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:58.771
His tanks are there.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:00.974
His troops are there.

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:03.343
They're going after Hamas.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.612
He's not particularly interested

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:07.981
in slowing that process down.

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:09.882
We all understand that.

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.251
On the other side,

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.586
Hamas is holding these hostages

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.822
and very frankly, they don't care a lot

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:19.525
about the human side of these hostages.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:20.727
The question is going to be

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:22.862
what kind of price do they get

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.031
if they're going to release the hostages.

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.199
So so right now,

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.468
I don't know that the price is right

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.902
on either side.

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:31.771
What could possibly help

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:32.972
is to be able to

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:35.341
develop an approach where

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:36.442
you want Hamas to

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:39.445
release the hostages, but in return,

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.780
they're going to get the release

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.049
of Palestinian prisoners.

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:46.319
That that could, I think, be possibly

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.520
the kind of price

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.589
that might result in that kind of deal

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.424
being fulfilled

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.893
as those negotiations,

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:55.862
those conversations are ongoing

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:58.498
specifically to get hostages out.

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:01.200
I'm wondering what you make of that

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.402
apparent disagreement

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.237
between the United States

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:05.038
and Israel

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:06.272
over the correct course of action

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:12.312
to take on on a pause?

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:13.112
Well,

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:13.613
you know, look,

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:14.714
I think the president's

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:16.549
been right to urge a pause.

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:18.885
There is a pause that is necessary

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.486
in order to be able

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:23.489
to provide the humanitarian relief

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:26.726
that is critical for the Palestinians

00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:27.427
and it's critical

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:27.994
for others

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.128
that obviously

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:31.364
have been injured in this war.

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:32.699
So it's the right

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.367
it's the right thing to do.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:35.802
And I think,

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:37.570
you know, from my own experience,

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.239
I think the key is to continue

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:42.809
to pressure the Israelis

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.278
to be able to provide

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:50.283
not not only a pause, but to make

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.684
make it possible to

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:55.621
get humanitarian aid into Gaza

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:59.225
so that we can provide the food

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:02.295
and the the care that is essential

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:03.663
to deal with those

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.131
that have been injured.

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:08.601
I think if Israel needs to know that

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.103
while there is a lot of support,

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:12.071
obviously for their ability

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:13.239
to defend their country

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:15.108
and go after Hamas,

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:18.478
that in order for them to be able

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:20.413
to maintain their credibility,

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:22.415
they also have to keep an eye

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:23.483
on how to provide

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:25.051
humanitarian relief

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.520
to those that have been hurt.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.755
Secretary Leon Panetta,

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:29.989
thanks so much for sharing your time

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.992
and perspective with us.

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:34.360
Good to be with you.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.761
Of course.
