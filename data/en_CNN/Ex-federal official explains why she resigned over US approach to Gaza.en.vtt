00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.667
Another U.S.

00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:01.209
official has

00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:02.836
publicly quit their government

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.754
job over the Biden administration's

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:07.090
handling of the Israel-Hamas war

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.258
until yesterday.

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:08.675
Doctor

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.510
and now she line was a foreign affairs

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.720
officer at the State Department,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.596
working in an office that promotes

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:16.016
human rights in the Middle East. Dr.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.142
Shi Line details

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.226
the reasoning behind

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:19.811
her public resignation

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:22.063
in a CNN Opinion article,

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:23.356
and she joins us now.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:24.441
Thanks so much for joining us.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.692
Thank you for having me.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:26.860
You write

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.069
regarding the forced

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.822
displacement of Gaza civilians,

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.282
the lack of aid, violence

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.534
by Israeli settlers in the West Bank.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.286
You say, quote, These actions which

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.620
which experts on genocide

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.621
have testified meet

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.665
the crime of genocide,

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:41.416
are conducted

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:42.917
with the diplomatic and military

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.377
support of the US government.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:47.047
And that's the basis of your resignation.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:47.464
As you know,

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.632
genocide is a very specific

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:51.426
definition here.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:52.510
How do you feel

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.595
Israel's behavior there

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.430
meets that definition?

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:56.473
I mean, I would

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:57.599
leave that to the experts.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:58.141
As you said,

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.351
it is a very specific definition.

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.645
But I, I would argue that in general,

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.064
the actions that Israeli

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.315
military is taking

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:06.733
are are seeking

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.485
to wipe out the population of Gaza.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:09.611
We've also heard

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:10.278
such statements

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.030
made by Israeli

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.406
officials, political officials

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.242
and military officials.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.952
The

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:18.828
UN, unfortunately,

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:20.080
we're also hearing plans

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.081
being made now for people

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.540
to take over the territory

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.416
of the Gaza Strip.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:24.417
We had Jared Kushner

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.502
come on and talk about

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.462
how he's going to build highrises

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:28.171
on this beautiful

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.174
beachfront properly property.

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:32.342
You know, as you said,

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:33.551
the crime of genocide

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.053
does not need to meet

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:36.638
a particular legal definition.

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:38.306
But

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:40.391
I would I would posit that there are

00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:41.226
there are many experts

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:42.560
who are who are arguing that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.145
that is what Israel is doing.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:45.355
Well, intent is key,

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:45.730
of course,

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.023
because here let's be clear,

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:49.150
Hamas is a terrorist organization.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.860
It deliberately killed civilians,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.194
as it did

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.195
on October 7th,

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:54.197
and it deliberately hides behind

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:55.490
civilians in Gaza.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.866
I understand

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:57.534
the argument

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:58.576
that there has been

00:01:58.576 --> 00:01:59.828
insufficient attention

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:02.247
to protect civilian lives there. But.

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.123
But I wonder,

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.749
who do you hold responsible?

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.209
Who do you hold responsible for it?

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.794
Is it Israel alone?

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.088
Is it Israel and the US for its support?

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:11.047
But is Hamas?

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:11.548
Does Hamas

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:12.715
also bear responsibility

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:14.551
for the civilian losses?

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:15.260
Absolutely.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.844
I mean, Hamas

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:17.679
is a terrorist organization.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.597
I just think that the way Israel

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:20.974
and as well as the United States

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:21.808
have been involved

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.226
in conducting this war,

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:23.893
it could have been done

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:24.936
in a very different manner.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:27.063
The the levels of the casualties

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:28.857
that we're seeing, the use of starvation

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:30.191
as a weapon of war,

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:31.442
the fact that the United States

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:32.694
isn't using its leverage

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:34.779
to insist that aid get in

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.447
and that a cease fire

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:38.324
be put in place, in particular,

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.868
we're seeing from the Israeli public

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.327
their frustration with the fact

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.328
that their own hostages

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:44.247
are not actually being prioritized.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.166
Instead, we have the prime minister,

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.375
whose political future

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:48.334
depends on this war

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.836
going on for as long as possible.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:50.920
He's he's talked about

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.714
going after Lebanon as well.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:53.882
I know that the US government

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:55.216
is trying to do everything they can

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:55.800
to prevent that,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.135
but thus far

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:57.969
I shouldn't say everything

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.220
they can there.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.430
They're not doing everything

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.514
they can to prevent that.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:02.182
I would argue

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.601
they need to use all the leverage

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.810
to make sure Israel

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.937
neither expands the war and

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:09.731
and agrees to a ceasefire,

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.858
an exchange of hostages from both sides

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.694
and to to bring in the necessary aid.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:15.612
You told my colleague

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.322
Christiane Amanpour today

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.072
that you speak for,

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:19.365
quote, many people

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.075
when standing against the US government's

00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:21.826
Gaza policy.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.745
I wonder when you when you left,

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.455
when you made your resignation public,

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:26.873
when you wrote this opinion

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.791
piece for CNN,

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:29.626
did many people

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:30.793
that many of your colleagues

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:34.005
come to you and say, we're backing you?

00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:34.714
They have.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.382
I was not planning initially

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.176
to to go public.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.552
I was only at the State

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.930
Department a brief time.

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:43.431
But when I started to tell people

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.308
that I was planning to resign

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:46.476
quietly, they said,

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:47.227
you know, please

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.519
reconsider, please,

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.439
please go public if you'd be willing to.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.649
So I decided I would.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:53.566
And since then,

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.194
I have had people reach out to me.

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:57.987
I think my my greatest concern

00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.697
is that by going public,

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:01.115
I might somehow undermine

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:01.991
some of these efforts.

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:02.784
And the State Department

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.078
is doing very important work here.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.038
But I do think that public pressure is

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:07.664
why we're starting

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.666
to see the administration shifting here.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.167
And it is the administration

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.335
that is making these decisions.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.127
It's the president

00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:14.087
who is deciding

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.839
what our policy towards Israel and

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.341
regarding Gaza is going to be.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:18.883
So even though

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.260
there are many people inside state

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.512
who disagree with this, it's

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:23.388
going to take the president

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.097
changing his mind

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.015
before we see a new policy.

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:26.599
Let me ask you this,

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.309
because as you as you say,

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.686
there has been both private

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:30.770
and public pressure

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.438
increasing from President Biden

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.481
and the White House

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.399
in recent days

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.775
and weeks on Israel, for instance,

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:38.444
not to go into Rafah in Gaza.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.071
That's insufficient, in your view.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.115
What would be sufficient, in your view,

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.700
from the U.S. side?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.826
I think the U.S.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.452
needs to uphold our own laws.

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:48.371
We have the Leahy laws

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.374
that would that stipulate that U.S.

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.583
foreign military assistance

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:55.044
cannot go to units of a foreign military

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:56.254
that that are engaged

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.298
in gross human rights violations.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.049
Also a foreign government

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:03.261
that is preventing US humanitarian aid

00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:05.096
is no longer eligible for for U.S.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.431
military assistance.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.724
We're not upholding those laws.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.517
So I think we could start there,

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:11.311
just start upholding our own laws.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.729
I think this is particularly crucial

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.188
not only for the people of Gaza,

00:05:14.188 --> 00:05:15.690
but this administration

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.150
has tried to distinguish itself

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.651
from the previous administration

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.236
as one that not only

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.238
believes in the rule of law,

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:23.656
but that believes in America's

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:24.449
role in the world

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.200
and wanted to reestablish America

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.201
as a leader,

00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:28.786
not only in terms of, you know,

00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:29.829
I know you've done

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.040
work on great power competition,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.458
but if America is

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.335
is not going to distinguish itself

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.669
from some of our adversaries

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.463
that engage in these sorts of human

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.214
rights violations,

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:41.549
why should the rest of the world

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.051
look to us as a leader?

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.886
You said the loss of soft power,

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.304
Doctor and she line.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.138
Thanks so much for sharing

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:47.764
your point of view.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:48.681
I appreciate having you on.
