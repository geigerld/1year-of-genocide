HERE TO DISCUSS IS -- Sanam Vakil DIRECTOR OF THE MIDDLE EAST PROGRAM AT LONDON'S CHATHAM HOUSE THINK TANK. WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM. DO YOU FEEL, LIKE APPARENTLY THE SECRETARY OF STATE DOES, THAT THINGS ARE REALLY TEETERING ON THE EDGE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THE WAR EXPANDING FROM GAZA AND ACROSS ISRAEL'S NORTHERN BORDER INTO LEBANON? &gt;&gt; THERE IS A DEEP CONCERN. WHAT IT'S BECOME ALMOST NORMALIZED, SIMMERING TENSIONS COULD REALLY BOIL OVER. THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE ARE. WE'VE HAD ATTACKS COMING FROM THE HOUTHIS IN YEMEN THAT HAVE ATTACKED MARITIME SHIPPING. WE HAVE SEEN BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN HEZBOLLAH AND ISRAEL AT A DANGEROUS LEVEL DESPITE THE REGULAR MESSAGING FROM HASSAN AS LAURA THAT THERE IS NO INTENTION OF REGIONALIZE-ING THIS WAR. ATTACKS AND, SYRIA TAX AND IRAQ AND THIS COULD WELL LEAD TO A MISCALCULATION. &gt;&gt; CAN I JUST POINTED EMPHASIZE WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT NO STRATA, -- WE READ-BASED JOURNALIST TWEETED THAT HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN HAVE SIGNALED REPEATEDLY THAT THEY WANT TO VOID WAR -- AT SOME POINT THEY WILL MISCALCULATE. THIS WAS AFTER THE ASSASSINATIONS WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE REGION. EVERYBODY THINKS THEY HAVE -- THEY ARE PLAYING A VERY CLEVER GAME, TARGETED JUST SO, CALIBRATED JUST SO. BUT IS MISCALCULATION SOMETHING THAT COULD HAPPEN? THE ISRAELIS ON THE LEBANESE EVERY WENT HAPPENED ACROSS THAT BORDER IN 2006, MOST NOTABLY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE CLEAR RISK AND THIS WAS PART OF ANTHONY BLINKEN'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR THIS TRIP. TO MESSAGE THAT ESCALATION IS NOT AN ANTIBODIES INTEREST. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND TIMELINES UNDERWAY IN THE REGION. NO COUNTRY, NO STATE OR NON STATE ACTOR UNDER REGION IS REALLY PUSHING FOR ESCALATION. WHEREAS THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO RESET IT'S DETERRENCE LEVELS SINCE OCTOBER 7TH AND THAT REQUIRES THEM NOT ONLY TO TRY AND DECAPITATE HAMAS LEADERSHIP, WHICH WE KNOW, 94 DAYS ON FROM OCTOBER 7TH, THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO. BUT ALSO TO TRY TO PUSH BACK HEZBOLLAH MADE CLEAR THAT THEY'RE PORTERS ARE SAFE AND THAT IS WHAT IS ONGOING RIGHT NOW. WHERE IS THE REST OF THE REGION, UTERINE, YET HEZBOLLAH, BEAT THE WIDER ARAB PARTNERS OF THE UNITED STATES, HAVE NO INTEREST IN SEEING THIS EXPLODE BECAUSE IT COULD TAKE THINGS INTO A NEW ORBIT. &gt;&gt; REMIND EVERYBODY, I COVERED THE 2006, WAR IT WAS NOT A VICTORY BY ISRAEL OR HEZBOLLAH. AT BEST IT WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE BEEN FOUGHT TO A DRAW. THERE WAS A U.N. RESOLUTION, 1701, THAT REQUIRED THEM TO MOVE BACK FROM DEMARCATED LANDS. APPARENTLY NONE OF THEM KEPT TO THAT COMMITMENT. IS THERE A POLITICAL SOLUTION THAT ACTUALLY CAN REINFORCE AND DE-ESCALATE THE LEBANON OR HEZBOLLAH ISRAEL TENSION RIGHT NOW? &gt;&gt; HAMAS HOCHSTEIN, ANOTHER U.S., OFFICIAL WAS JUSTIN LEBANON FOR THIS VERY ISSUE. TRYING TO FIND A FACE SAVING SOLUTION TO PUSH HEZBOLLAH BACK. ACCORDING TO U.N. RESOLUTION 1701, PASSED THE LAW TONY RIVER. AND ALSO FIND A FACE EVENING WAY FOR HEZBOLLAH TO DO THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTIONS THAT HEZBOLLAH IS PULLING BACK, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU SEE ISRAELIS KEEP PRESSING AND KEEP STRIKING AT COMMANDERS IN LEBANON. THIS MIGHT BE LOW-LEVEL ESCALATION, BUT THERE WILL BE, ONE DAY WHERE THIS GOES TO. FIRE THIS COULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT MORE THAN 2006. &gt;&gt; THEY SPOKE WHEN ALL OF THIS FLARED UP TO THE LEBANESE FOREIGN MINISTER WHO AT THE TIME WAS IN WASHINGTON, GOING TO VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE AND TALK ABOUT THESE TENSIONS. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID TO ME. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT ANY ESCALATION IN THE WAR. WE DON'T WANT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SOUTH COULD BE SPREAD OVER LEBANON. WE DON'T LIKE A REGIONAL WAR, BECAUSE IT IS DANGEROUS TO EVERYONE. DANGEROUS TO LEBANON, DANGEROUS TO ISRAEL AND TO THE COUNTRIES SURROUNDING ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; HE HAS PRETTY MUCH LAID IT OUT, BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER OF THAT COUNTRY, AN ALLY OF THE UNITED STATES, TO BE SAYING THAT. HOW DOES ISRAEL, IF IT DOES BROADEN INTO A BIG, OR HOW DO YOU SEPARATE A WAR AGAINST HEZBOLLAH FROM A WAR AGAINST LEBANON ITSELF AND THE WESTERN-BACKED LEBANESE ARMED FORCES WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN TARGETED? &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK YOU CAN, REALLY. &gt;&gt; THE ISRAELIS SAY WE'RE NOT STRIKING THE LEBANESE STATE. &gt;&gt; THIS WILL BE SEEN AS A BROADER WAR. IT IS A WAR THAT WON'T JUST BE ABOUT HEZBOLLAH. THIS WILL INVOLVE THE WHOLE SYSTEM, HEZBOLLAH ITSELF IS EMBEDDED INTO THAT SYSTEM AND IT IS PART OF THE GOVERNING SYSTEM, WHETHER THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OR THE LEBANESE LIKE IT OR NOT. THAT IN ITSELF IS THE PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. AND THE TIMES OF LONDON THE, SUNDAY THE SUNDAY, TIMES YOU MIGHT HAVE READ, IT THERE'S A FRONT PAGE ARTICLE BY AN ISRAELI JOURNALIST WHO TALKED ABOUT THE STASH OF PAPERS AND DOCUMENTS AND MAYBE OUR DRIVES THAT SOME OF THE ISRAELI FORCES HAD FOUND APPARENTLY IN HIYASSY NOIR'S OFFICE. IT TALKED ABOUT HOW, FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO, TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO DISRUPT ANY NORMALIZATION AT THE TIME BETWEEN TURKEY AND ISRAEL. AND IT TALKED ABOUT THEIR STRATEGY. BEFORE, THERE IS ALSO, I THINK CHAD AMASSED EVEN PUT THIS OUT, BROWN WHEN MATT EXCUSE TO BE A JOURNALIST HAD INTERVIEWED, YEARS AGO, THE HAMAS LEADER WHO IS ASSASSINATED. HE HAD SAID TO HER THAT OUR AIM IS TO RADICALIZE, IN HER WORDS, THE PALESTINIAN POPULATION. SO THAT THEY DO NOT GO TOWARDS PEACE. HAMAS WANTS TO DELEGITIMIZED THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AND SORT OF DISABLE ANY SENTIMENT TOWARDS PEACE. DO YOU THINK THAT IS STILL WHAT THEY THINK? IN WHICH CASE, HOW DOES ONE GET OVER THIS? HOW DOES ONE GET TO A DAY AFTER? &gt;&gt; CERTAINLY THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP, HAMAS LEADERSHIP THAT HAVE MORE RADICAL SENTIMENTS. WHERE WE ARE TODAY, NORMALIZATION HAS SLOWED IF NOT STOPPED COMPLETELY. IT WILL BE VERY FAR AND HARD TO ACHIEVE WITHOUT A CEASE-FIRE AND WITHOUT ATTENDING TO THE HUMANITARIAN ISSUES ON THE TABLE. AS WELL AS WITHOUT A PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY ABANDONED. THAT'S, I THINK, A PRIMARY TASK HERE. BUT BEYOND, THAT WHAT IS URGENTLY NEEDED IS A PATHWAY THAT CREATES A PROCESS FOR PALESTINIAN LEADERS TO WORK TOGETHER FOR REFORM, ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNANCE WITH ELECTIONS AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PALESTINIANS THEMSELVES TO ELECT FUTURE LEADERS SHOULD CERTAINLY BE AN OPPORTUNITY GIVEN TO PALESTINIANS, NOT ONE THAT THEY'VE HAD FOR WELL OVER TWO DECADES NOW. &gt;&gt; THEY HAVEN'T GONE TO ELECTIONS. LAST QUESTION, YOU'RE AN EXPERT AND A STUDENT OF THE IRAN PIECE OF THIS WHOLE PICTURE. IT ALSO SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO BE STAYING OUT OF A DIRECT CONFRONTATION. HOW LONG CAN THAT LAST? WHAT REALLY DOES IRAN WANT OUT OF ALL OF THIS? &gt;&gt; IRAN'S MOTIVATIONS ARE MULTIPLE. ULTIMATELY, THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC HAS ALWAYS BEEN DRIVEN BY ITS OWN SENSE OF SURVIVAL ABOVE ALL AND ITS SECURITY AND STABILITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN PARAMOUNT. IT HAS RELIED ON THE ACCESS OF RESISTANCE, THIS NETWORK IT IS CULTIVATED AND CREATED OVER A NUMBER OF DECADES. AS ITS PRIMARY TOOL OF DETERRENCE AGAINST ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES. TWO COUNTRIES THAT IT HAS DEFINED AS ITS THREATS IN THE IT WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE ACCESS OF RESISTANCE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HERENDA SEE THE U.S. AS A DECLINING INFLUENCE IN THE REGION. HATE DESTABILIZING REGIONAL INFLUENCE ABOVE ALL. AND IRAN HAS OVER THE YEARS RESTORED TIES WITH THE GULF ARAB COUNTRIES AND IS LOOKING TO FORGE STRONGER ECONOMIC LINKAGES AND BE PART OF AN INTEGRATED MIDDLE EAST AS WELL THAT, OF COURSE, IT'S HARD TO ACHIEVE THIS OPPOSITIONAL STANCE WITH THE UNITED STATES, ACCELERATING NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND, OF COURSE, THIS UNDERLYING TENSION WITH ISRAEL THAT IS, I THINK, TEHRAN'S CALCULATING IT WILL INCREASE OVER THIS YEAR IN PARTICULAR. &gt;&gt; VERY BRIEFLY BEFORE I LET YOU GO, DO YOU THINK THERE IS A WAY TO PULL THINGS BACK? THE ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER TOLD THE U.S. FOREIGN MINISTER TODAY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION. &gt;&gt; YES, I THINK THERE IS, AND IT BEGINS WITH THE CEASE-FIRE. THAT CEASE-FIRE CAN SET THE PATHWAY FORWARD TO RELEASE HOSTAGES THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY NEGLECTED, AS GIDEON LEVY BROUGHT UP IN YOUR PREVIOUS INTERVIEW. BEYOND THAT, OF COURSE, THE ARAB STATES, PARTNERS OF THE UNITED STATES, ARE GOING TO NEED TO PLAY A REALLY IMPORTANT AND INTEGRAL ROLE IN GUARANTEEING PALESTINIAN SECURITY, ISRAELI SECURITY, PROVIDING A BRIDGE TO IRAN AND MAKING SURE THEY ARE NOT A SPOILER AND WHAT COMES NEXT. THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG PROCESS WAITING FOR THE DAY AFTER TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS A BIT TOO LATE TO. OR &gt;&gt; SANAM VAKLI, CHATHAM HOUSE, THANK YOU INDEED FOR JOINING US.
