00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
For two weeks now, Israel and Gaza

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:03.211
have been at war.

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:04.796
Israel and Hamas have been at war.

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:06.589
And the region is confronting

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:07.882
all the horrors of what

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:08.925
that actually means.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:10.301
I want to bring in now

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:11.386
Amy Galliano,

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:14.723
a volunteer medic with United Hatzalah.

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:15.348
Now, Naomi,

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.392
on the afternoon of the Hamas attack,

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:18.393
and I just want everyone to know

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:19.060
when they're looking at you

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.645
now you're at work,

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:22.063
you're out saving your lives.

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:24.149
That's what you do.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.150
Yeah, I know you are.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.651
So I really appreciate you

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:28.153
just taking a few minutes to talk to us

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:29.446
because I know that

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:30.697
you want the world to know

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.741
and to be very aware of what happened.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.285
And you think it's important that day.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.078
On the afternoon of the Hamas attack,

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:38.204
you were

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.247
you were on call

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:40.665
looking for anyone who survived.

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:41.833
You were you were getting those calls.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:42.917
You were going to the

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.503
kibbutzim along that border.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:46.921
How do you even

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.673
cope with what you saw

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.216
before we even talk about what you saw?

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.634
How do you cope with it now?

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:54.095
Naomi?

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.513
So right now,

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.515
thanks to United SLA

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.893
and other organizations in Israel,

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.229
I have a full psychological treatment

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.938
and the other.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:08.026
Day special treatment is called EMDR.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:08.610
It's a system

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.904
that works on the brain

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.740
that helps you cope with traumatic events

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.866
before you develop

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:18.912
post-traumatic symptoms.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.955
So I have that.

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:21.915
Sort. Of like.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.042
You're getting.

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:25.502
Yes.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.837
Now, me, I know that you witnessed

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:29.297
horrific things

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:30.256
with your own eyes

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.633
as you were trying to save lives.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:32.509
I know that, again,

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.636
you have chosen to talk about this

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.429
because you don't want the world

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.890
to be able to turn away and forget

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.101
what happened, what you saw

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.061
with your own eyes.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.979
What do you want people to know

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.526
about what you saw?

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.443
The first thing that I

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.446
want them to know that probably.

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:54.280
Hamas is.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.824
ISIS,

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:56.866
the act

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.536
and the horrific things that we suffer

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.454
are beyond not worse

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:04.833
than anything compared to

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:08.294
her or any movie or any horror movie

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.213
that you could ever, ever imagine

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.340
being or

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.135
anywhere.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.054
Begin with the babies that we saw dead.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.348
Bleeding, beheaded

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:21.850
to the women that we saw

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.768
in the same situation, the same.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:27.647
Poses, the blood to the elderly.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.939
Yeah.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.774
Let me your

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:30.859
take your pick.

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:36.030
Everything

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:38.199
Naomi, I have,

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.701
I think along with many others,

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:41.452
I felt frustration that

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:43.079
beheading became a part of this,

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:43.580
that that

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.998
the horrific things

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:45.790
that everyone knows

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.458
occurred, that why that would be

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.043
something that needed to be proven

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:51.880
when so many horrific other things also

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.298
happened.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.215
But I just want to be

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:58.511
clear that you did see those acts.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.388
You did see

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:03.558
people who had been beheaded.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.603
Fortunately, I have seen that.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:09.606
I've seen people that.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.983
Their limbs have been taken. Out.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.151
I've seen

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.029
mothers dead on top of their babies.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.864
That were also dead.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.616
I've seen

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.202
burned bodies of young.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:25.205
Girls, young men,

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.122
people of.

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:27.040
All ages.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.083
Babies burn, baby.

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:30.835
Burn them.

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:31.669
They're like,

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.963
I can't even start to describe the smell.

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:35.215
But at the beginning,

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.132
you don't even realize

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.634
what you're smelling.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:40.637
It smells like barbecue, you know?

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:43.681
Doesn't make any sense.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.726
And when you take a look

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:50.688
a little bit closer to both sides,

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:52.690
you realize that.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.608
It is.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:56.319
Bird meat. And its.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.153
People.

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.530
Yeah, it's people.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.074
Yeah.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.534
And

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:05.912
it's something that

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:06.579
I don't think I

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.790
will ever be able to raise from my head

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.666
or from my mind.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:15.421
Or my dream.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:16.839
Naomi,

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.175
Was there anyone that

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:19.968
was in a position

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.303
that you were able to help them

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:25.181
when you got there?

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.141
Yes, it was.

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:30.144
It was around.

00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:31.896
It took us so, so much time

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:32.814
till we found people

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.440
that were actually alive.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.401
And when we did, we were able to help.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.860
Yeah, thank God.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.029
But compared to the dead people and.

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:41.406
The amount. Of dead, it wasn't.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.283
It wasn't a lot.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.075
It wasn't a lot.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.576
But yes, we were able

00:04:45.576 --> 00:04:47.120
were able to save a few families

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.997
from Bury

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.957
that we loaded

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.458
the ambulance with four

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:53.626
or five injured

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:54.335
at the same time

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:55.336
because there was no time

00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:56.170
we were under fire

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.672
and we have to load the ambulance

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:58.506
with as much.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:00.633
Injured as we can.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:01.968
And they were severely,

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:02.885
severely injured in

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.013
their lungs because they.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:05.930
They breathed

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.098
smoke for

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:08.558
at least three or 4 hours

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.518
because the terrorists, Hamas,

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:11.602
burned their houses.

00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:12.395
Once they realized

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:15.398
they cannot go into the safe room.

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:17.692
So they just burned the whole place down.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:18.443
And the family.

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.445
That stayed inside, some of them.

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:21.112
Were alive

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.281
and we were able to help them and

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:29.412
and save them and some of them not.

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:29.954
My God,

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:31.289
the fact that some of them were alive

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.915
and you were able were able to save them.

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:34.500
I mean, what a miracle.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.294
What a miracle that is.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:36.794
I mean, Naomi,

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:37.837
who obviously

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.881
this is how you reacted in a moment

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:40.965
that no one can comprehend

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:43.551
being in, you reacted by going in.

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:45.636
You talk about being under fire

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:47.847
as you're trying to save people.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.058
Did you realize that you could have died?

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:50.850
Did you realize that

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.976
this was all still happening

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:52.935
while you were there or did

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:55.980
you even process it.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:56.856
At that time?

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.524
You don't stop to process it.

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:01.527
You just think I'm here.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.321
I'll do my best to stay alive

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.615
because I have to save more life.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.909
I have to get back to my family.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.245
So even you under fire, you try the best

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:13.081
as you can to stay alive.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.832
If it's lying on the floor,

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:18.211
if it's try to hide behind cars,

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.129
if it's staying really, really quiet.

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:21.506
Even though with you an ambulance,

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.006
even though you're

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:23.758
driving through the night,

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:26.094
but you don't turn the light on,

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:29.389
you drive in complete, complete darkness

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.431
because, you know,

00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:31.808
if you stay alive,

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:35.061
then you could save more lives.

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:37.146
And that's what you do.

00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:40.817
Hour after hour.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.110
Well, that's what you do.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.196
I think so many of us I listen to you and

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.573
it's it's truly unbelievable.

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:48.408
It's an inspiration

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.701
that it's hard to even comprehend.

00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:52.036
And you're still doing it, Naomi.

00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:53.788
You're still you're still going out.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:56.290
You're still able to work now.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.583
Yeah.

00:06:57.583 --> 00:07:00.211
Well, I took few days off this past week.

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:01.003
Now I'm back here.

00:07:01.003 --> 00:07:03.047
I'm in Ashkelon right now.

00:07:03.047 --> 00:07:05.133
I have my crew with me and my ambulance

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:08.803
on the other side over here.

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.305
I have the ambulance behind me right now.

00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:13.891
I can be inside the ambulance.

00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:15.768
I can't be inside the ambulance.

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:16.769
We have to be outside.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:17.937
We have safe places here.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.230
Because if there's any alarm

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.023
on, we have to go into the safe place.

00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:23.651
And only when it stops, we could go out

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:27.113
and start safe with the rescue people and

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:28.990
and hoping that no one got hurt.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.077
That's our best hope.

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:33.369
Well,

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:36.372
Naomi, I want to thank you very much.

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:37.290
Before you go,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.624
I just want to ask you

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:40.293
a very simple question,

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.253
which is now that you've taken the time

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:43.629
to share these horrors

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:44.380
and to relive them

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.883
because you want people to hear that,

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:47.633
is there anything else

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:48.676
you want to tell anyone

00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:49.802
watching about

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:50.887
what's happening in Israel,

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.930
about how you feel?

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.556
Is there anything else

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.391
you just want the world to hear?

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:57.643
Thank you so much for doing this.

00:07:57.643 --> 00:08:00.855
I just want the world to know that

00:08:00.938 --> 00:08:02.773
these things should never happen again.

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:05.443
You should know that Hamas is ISIS.

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:05.985
The acts.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.028
That we saw

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:11.199
are against any humanity that possibly.

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:12.533
Be existing in this world.

00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:14.243
And go home to.

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:14.827
Your families

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:17.830
and hug your kids and love them and

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:18.414
be with them.

00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:20.625
Because from what I saw, maybe.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.460
You could never know if.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.544
It's the last day or the.

00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:25.922
Last moment and you're

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.632
just tell your family

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:28.591
that you love them every day.

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.093
And if you're in a situation,

00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:32.929
try to do your best

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:33.888
to help others,

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.348
because sometimes

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.557
even the smallest help

00:08:36.557 --> 00:08:41.604
could change the world for someone else.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:44.649
Naomi, thank you very much.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:45.566
Thank you.

00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:48.194
Thank you so much for taking the time.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:48.986
Nima Galliano,

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:51.614
as you can see in Ashkelon, Israel, out

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.492
empty out right now, going to save lives

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:56.827
even after what she has endured and

00:08:56.827 --> 00:08:57.995
taken the time and agony

00:08:57.995 --> 00:08:59.288
to share it with all of us.
