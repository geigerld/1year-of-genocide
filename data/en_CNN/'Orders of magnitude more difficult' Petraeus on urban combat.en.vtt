00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.567
Retired U.S.

00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:03.837
Army General David Petraeus,
also the former director of the CIA.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.174
He has a brand new book titled
Conflict The Evolution of Warfare

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.311
from 1945 to Ukraine.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.514
General, always good to have you on.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:18.051
One of the things
that struck me about the book,

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.353
which is an area of expertize
which is something that I hope

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.990
the Israelis are reading
is about urban combat

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.527
and the 2004 battle of Fallujah,

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.630
the largest of the Iraq war Bloody

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.832
costly street by street.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.836
And we had General Kimmitt here
not long ago

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.607
and he was saying that what Israel
is going to face, what the Israeli forces

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:47.347
are going to face in Gaza will be probably
even more grueling than Fallujah.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.249
What do you think it will be?

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.751
Orders of magnitude more difficult.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.621
The enemy has had months
to prepare the defenses.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.758
They'll undoubtedly employ
improvised explosive devices, suicide

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:02.762
bombers, car bombs, tunnels,
a lot of infrastructure that they have.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:05.231
They know the territory very, very well.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.267
And it's many times the size of Fallujah.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.270
We did a number of urban operations
over those years.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.007
And then more recently, we watched one
that might be more appropriate

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:17.410
as an analogy,
which was the Iraqi security forces

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.215
supported by a US led coalition
clearing the Islamic State

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:26.252
out of Mosul, a city about the same size
as Gaza City.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:31.191
And again, it's very, very challenging
fighting in this hospital bombing.

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:36.396
And by the way, I'll take the side
of the IDF spokesman any day over Hamas.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:39.632
Needless to say, there are in a democracy,
the truth is going to come out.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:40.800
They know it.

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:44.871
And they've done apparently a very good
and thorough investigation quite quickly.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:48.374
But in the case of urban combat,
you're going

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.778
to have tremendous damage
to civilian infrastructure.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.347
You're going to have considerable civilian
loss.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.616
You're going to take
a lot of friendly casualties.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:02.822
You don't just have to clear every
building floor, a room basement tunnel.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:07.193
You have to leave substantial forces
behind, or else the enemy will REINFELDT

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.629
And you have to do this
progressively sequentially.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.400
You have to clear and hold and then
continue farther, spread the oil spot.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.638
In fact, it really should be thought
of as a counterinsurgency operation,

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:19.139
not just a

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.642
conventional military operation,
because you are fighting among the people

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.912
and because of the importance
of not overlooking

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:29.883
what happens after Hamas is destroyed.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:34.854
And by the way, a spokesman today said
they also intend to dismantle the Hamas

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:38.725
political structure, the political wing
that's different from the military wing

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:42.562
which is the Hamas terrorists
and also the Islamic Jihad terrorists.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.797
Right.
But then the question is, what next?

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:45.899
Who's going to take over?

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.034
Who's going to oversee?

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:49.402
There has to be nation building.

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:52.772
There's going to be restoration
of basic services, repair of damaged

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:56.609
infrastructure, getting schools,
markets, clinics all reopened.

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:59.746
You know that we've learned all of that
sometimes the hard way.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.781
We learned in the fight to Baghdad

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.585
that you've got to have a very good plan
with a lot of different assumptions,

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.422
because once you take down the regime
and you turn to the folks

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:12.225
that said, just get us to Baghdad, Dave,
we'll take it from there.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.160
That plan proved inadequate.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.265
So I think the big subject of discussion,
I suspect already between

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:25.438
the Israeli generals and the political
authorities is about what comes after.

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:28.908
They're going to take enormous casualties
to do this.

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:32.545
I believe that is right to destroy Hamas.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.014
But you can't have that for naught.

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.083
This can't be another case
where you mow the lawn

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.452
all the way down to the dirt in this case.

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:40.920
But then you pull back out

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.523
and the remnants will be able
to reconstitute themselves.

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:44.390
So what follows?

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.826
Could there be an interim
international authority? What is it?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.196
I don't I doubt
I mean, the ambassador told me

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:54.434
Sunday
that they do not want to reoccupy no.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:55.001
Gaza.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.403
So, I mean, I think the president has said
don't do it.

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.172
So it has to be some other.

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:02.942
So what the United Nations
or the Arab League or some group

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:06.512
is going to have to fight
because there will be an insurgency

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:10.283
you know, they'll try to retake, control
the remnants of Gaza and there will be

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.352
of Hamas.
There will be some of those there.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.487
So this is the real challenge, Jake.

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:17.757
And I'm not sure it's getting quite enough
attention.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:20.526
In the book, we talk about the importance
of a strategic leader

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.862
getting the big ideas right.
This is crucial.

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.731
Getting the strategy right.

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.567
Vengeance is not a strategy
And that's my next question.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:29.569
Component is some,
but you have to do more.

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:32.639
And that's my next question
because I've been thinking about

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:37.210
how and understandably so,
but how immediate and swift the response

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.381
by the Israeli
military was in the aftermath of Hamas's

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:46.586
barbaric terrorist attack on October 7th,
which, of course, reminds me of nine 11.

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.622
And you remember when I interviewed you

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:53.259
when I did the documentary,
about 20 years of war in Afghanistan.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:56.329
And I also interviewed General McChrystal

00:04:57.597 --> 00:04:59.299
for that same documentary.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:03.303
And he told me something interesting,
and I want to get your your take on it,

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:06.539
because I said, if you could go back,
what would you do differently?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.542
Listen to your your colleague
and friend, General McChrystal,

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.346
right after the nine 11 attacks.

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:15.448
I would have made a decision
inside the U.S.

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:18.785
government
to do nothing substantive for a year.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:22.689
What I mean by nothing, no bombing,
no strikes, etc.

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:25.825
I would have gone around the world
as the aggrieved party

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:30.697
and built up a firm coalition for what
what we do about al Qaeda.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.701
I would have done a mass effort to train

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:38.037
Americans in Arabic Pashtu,

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:41.240
Urdu, Dari, to get ourselves

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.610
ready to do something that we knew
would be very, very difficult.

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.613
Now, I said to him,

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:50.350
if you were a president,
you also would be impeached for not doing

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:53.519
it, for not doing anything
after the nine 11 attack.

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:56.489
He has a point, but but he has a point.
And guys have a point.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.825
And I want you to talk about that,
about the idea of

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:04.230
you get you get horrifically hit,
but you take a breath before responding.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.401
Yes. Keep in mind, this is much worse
than nine elevenths in relative terms.

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:11.270
It's like 35,000 people being killed.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.907
Jake, it's actually over 40,000
now because they're up to 1300.

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:15.842
So. Yes.

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:20.713
And so that response, the desire for
vengeance is absolutely understandable.

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.548
And there should be vengeance.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:25.685
There should be destruction
of the organization that did this but

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:29.489
not if you haven't thought through
what comes after that.

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:33.793
And that's, I think, the component of this
that certainly is not yet visible.

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:35.495
I'm sure that they're wrestling with this.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.130
I'm sure part of the reason

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.700
the president is going to Amman,
Jordan, is to start discussing that.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.370
And one would hope that
some of the Arab countries in particular

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:48.174
in the region that have often
expressed sympathy for the Palestinians,

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:51.811
will contribute to some kind of effort

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:57.350
that would enable the rebuilding
and so in Prime Minister Netanyahu,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.453
I think, should provide a vision

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:03.689
for what life will be like
for the Palestinian people,

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:07.627
not just in Gaza, by the way,
but also in the West Bank, something

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:10.630
that has just been looming out there
for quite some time In any event,

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:12.698
let's let's let this be a catalyst.

00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:15.301
Remember, after the 73 war,

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.505
all of a sudden you
had peace between the two warring factions

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:24.076
between Egypt and Israel and arrangements
with Syria and Jordan as well.

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:26.012
Of course, a very different situation.

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:28.581
Henry Kissinger,
I was just in a meeting with him.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.517
He could call for people and get that deal
done.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:33.853
President of Egypt

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:38.591
Assad in Damascus, the king in Amman,
and Golda Meir.

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:40.460
Yeah, there's nobody here to do that.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.162
So you've got this is much
more challenging in that regard.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:47.834
And I'd contended the military task
here is more challenging as well.

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:50.002
It's not tank on, tank out in the desert.

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:53.306
Certainly,
there was an existential moment for Israel

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:55.541
when Egypt achieved the early success.

00:07:55.541 --> 00:08:00.346
But once that was resolved, that was a
straightforward military operation.

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:04.951
This is much more than just an offensive
operation, a clear hold and build.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:07.687
You have to
then have what's going to follow.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.354
Absolutely.

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:10.923
Retired General David Petraeus,
maybe they should call you.

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:12.959
You'd be you'd be good to help this.

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:18.064
The book is Conflict the Evolution
of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine.

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:18.831
Please check it out.
