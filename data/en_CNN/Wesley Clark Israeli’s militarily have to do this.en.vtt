00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.468
You should talk about that a lit

00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:03.169
Just from a military standpoint,

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.004
in all wars

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.606
when there are civilians around

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:09.109
and there are targets of that,

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:12.112
that are believed to be of milit

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.913
necessity, there are calculation

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.615
essentially done

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.284
about how valuable is the target

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.221
What is the risk of civilian los

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:24.290
and how much civilian loss is ac

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.325
And these are horrible

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:26.393
calculations that are

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:27.727
but these are calculations

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:30.030
that armies make during war

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.297
a situation like this

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:32.966
operating on the ground in a hos

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.402
has got to be extraordinarily di

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.470
Sure.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.305
And you're exactly right, Anders

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.274
About the way you cast it.

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:42.942
You know what the target is?

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.677
You know how valuable it is.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.646
You try to estimate what the ris

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.748
are of hurting civilians

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:50.116
and then you have to make the ju

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.151
as to whether the target

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.252
going after the target,

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:53.186
taking out the target,

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:56.956
is worth the risk of injuring pe

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:57.824
who are innocent

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.260
and not part of the enemy force.

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:02.762
But here you're dealing with the

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.931
and control node of Hamas.

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.066
You're dealing with Hamas

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.400
that has deliberately,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.135
cynically located

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.770
its most valuable assets

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.805
in a hospital

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.007
deliberately to try to provoke

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.708
outrage in the world

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.811
community and discredit Israel

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.746
Israelis know this.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:22.515
They've got really great intel o

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.118
When those soldiers go in

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.653
in armored vehicles first

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.655
and then dismounted into the bui

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.990
and it is a very complex compoun

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.359
as you saw from the overhead cov

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.494
that helicopters

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:36.162
will have drones overhead.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.397
They'll be able to mark

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.199
and many positions with lasers.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:42.335
They'll be able to deliver preci

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.671
if there is an opponent there.

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.140
And then they've got to go insid

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.476
and if Hamas is there,

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.010
yes, there could be a shootout

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.545
in a hospital corridor

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.413
and they're going to have to

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.981
get to the bottom of it

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.449
and they're going to have to sea

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.685
for the tunnel entrances around 

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.887
So every at every step,

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.189
the soldier on the ground,

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.157
the tank commander

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.092
and so forth is at risk.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.094
He's putting himself out there.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.830
He's likely to draw fire.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.166
He has the right to self-defense

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.301
no matter what always.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.170
And he's going to respond

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.671
if he is attacked.

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.939
But he's got a lot of assets

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:20.573
backing him up,

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.642
a lot of other eyes on the battl

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.910
So it's everything

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.712
that can possibly be done

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.147
to protect civilians

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.715
and still go after the command

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.517
and control at the hospital.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.085
And the Israelis militarily,

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.253
they have to do this.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:34.821
One of the things I'm surprised

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.223
there is not more outrage out

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:39.993
internationally about is that Ha

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.294
two years, say,

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:43.897
to preparing this attack or a ye

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:44.797
however long it was.

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.132
We don't know the exact amount o

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:47.033
that they've been preparing,

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.368
but certainly they've been prepa

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:49.569
for quite some time.

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:51.871
They have not made any effort

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:52.305
to build

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.373
any bomb shelter

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:54.507
for any civilian,

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.843
it seems, in the Gaza Strip.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.012
They built tunnels for themselve

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.747
to store supplies and weapons

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:03.249
and to protect themselves.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.552
But there are not bomb shelters 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.521
the kind of shelters that you se

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:09.589
on the sides of the road

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:10.290
in Israel

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.525
by bus stops to protect against 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.027
Those don't

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.596
exist on the streets of of Gaza.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.665
Have you in your military experi

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:22.335
have you seen many countries

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:24.304
or territories

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:26.406
with a military that does not

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:30.043
prepare or have some sort of saf

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:33.213
harbor for its civilians?

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.249
Well, no, but on the other hand,

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.919
Hamas deliberately wants these c

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:40.920
to be at risk.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.355
Well, that's I mean, that's the 

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.289
Yes, but

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.425
but I still find it stunning tha

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.494
that doesn't seem to register wi

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:49.195
a lot of people.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.830
Well,

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.865
the thing about it, Anderson, is

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.934
we call Hamas a terrorist orders

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.069
I suppose actually,

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.738
the government of the Gaza Strip

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:00.540
they're in charge of everything.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.307
And they have had

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:03.076
received hundreds of millions of

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.944
from Qatar and other places

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.279
and they have not built

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.381
any bomb shelters for their peop

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.049
Right.

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.517
Because they're not interested

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:13.253
in protecting their people.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:13.853
They're interested

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:14.821
in provoking

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.357
international outrage against Is

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:18.491
They knew that

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.260
when they launched this attack

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.762
and they hoped to draw Israel in

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.797
bog Israel down, cause

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.666
a lot of casualties,

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:28.401
do exactly what they're doing wi

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:30.169
opinion, have a lot of voices ou

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.671
saying cease fire, cease fire,

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:32.672
cease fire,

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:35.508
and try to stop the Israeli assa

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.810
and then declare victory.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.178
That's that's the goal

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:41.381
and show the more civilian casua

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.216
that the Israelis inflict,

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:43.816
even though they don't

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.151
want to inflict any.

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:45.918
The greater

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:49.222
Hamas believes its chances of su

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:50.623
And, Nic,

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.292
I mean, it's accurate to say

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.360
that the health officials

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.496
in Gaza have denied repeatedly

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.533
that Al-Shifa Hospital or others

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:03.603
are being used by Hamas for any

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:06.706
I don't even want to call it

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:08.241
military purposes because,

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.610
I mean, for any of their own pur

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:14.781
they have.

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.482
And and it's something.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.950
Health officials in Gaza,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.421
Hamas run health officials say i

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.456
for other hospitals that

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:25.525
we've been speaking.

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.592
CNN has been speaking

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:29.062
with officials from the hospital

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:30.697
over the last few days.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:32.332
And just going through

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.034
our latest information on that,

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:37.303
it appears the most recent over 

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:38.871
couple of days, data

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:39.405
that we have

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:40.740
from the hospital itself,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.008
from our Shifa Hospital

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:45.678
they say there are about 7000 ci

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:47.280
taking refuge there

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.981
or there were until recently.

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:49.615
It's not clear

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:50.650
how many of those

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.021
might have left and about 1500 s

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:57.256
100 or so doctors,

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:59.425
other medical officials

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:00.727
and included in that.

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:03.830
1500, of course, several hundred

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.933
as well as well as sort of suppo

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.900
in the hospital.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.969
So it's still a big complex,

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:11.237
a complex, complex

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:12.438
and it still appears

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:13.473
a significant

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.842
number of people working there.

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.244
You would have to assume

00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:20.246
that these health officials

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:21.848
would have knowledge

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:23.616
of the whole complex.

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:24.650
There's a lot of people

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.319
there would have knowledge

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.788
of the nooks and crannies, if yo

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:29.989
There wouldn't be places

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:31.657
that they wouldn't know about wi

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:33.559
within the hospital complex.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.228
So they continue to say

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.296
Hamas isn't there.

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:38.664
But I mean, they're considering 

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:40.266
about and about Israel.

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:40.533
Yeah.

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:41.968
I mean, anybody who has operated

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:44.003
who has reported from Gaza.

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:46.372
No, I mean, you see rockets bein

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:47.273
from civilian areas.

00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:49.709
You see rockets being fired from

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:50.443
the building where you're at.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:51.611
You're the building.

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:52.645
You know, the time

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:54.447
I was the last time I was in Gaz

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:56.115
I can see where rockets are bein

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:58.351
from in buildings nearby me.

00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:58.885
People,

00:06:58.885 --> 00:06:59.185
you know,

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:00.553
even the doctors in the hospital

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:02.655
no Hamas,

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:03.322
as long as Jihad

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.724
and others are firing rockets

00:07:04.724 --> 00:07:06.259
over their hospitals.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.660
But they don't speak out about i

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.662
because they don't want to get k

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:10.763
I mean, they obviously

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.765
nobody speaks out against Hamas

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:14.667
for fear of their own safety.

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:15.768
Maybe they agree with Hamas.

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:16.969
Maybe they don't.

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.471
And a lot of people don't in Gaz

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.272
don't like Hamas.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.741
But but people aren't don't spea

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:23.810
But people know

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.045
do they know where the tunnels

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:28.614
locations are or where the the

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.149
the rockets are being fired from

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:30.850
You can see it

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:35.288
and this is

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.924
in a nutshell, people people, pe

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:39.559
people are scared.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:40.159
I mean,

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.628
be when Hamas was voted

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:43.930
voted in by the electorate

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.701
and Gaza to power in 2006, 2007,

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:50.536
they went round throwing out

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:52.472
of windows of high buildings

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.106
the political opposition

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:55.541
and they might have won

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:57.443
an election in 2006

00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:59.645
but they've maintain control eve

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.948
Through fear and intimidation

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:02.448
they might have

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:04.016
a hardcore base of supporters

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:06.152
that hoo hoo hoo ha,

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.120
you know who genuinely believe i

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.721
But the vast

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.656
majority of people would would n

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:11.791
to speak out against them.

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:14.126
Would fear speaking out against 

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:14.894
Like you, Anderson,

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:15.895
I've been to Gaza

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:18.531
and had those private conversati

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:20.166
away from cameras with people

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:20.900
who will tell you

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.567
precisely

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:23.903
that we are too afraid to speak 

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.705
Hamas has done this to me

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:26.706
the last time I was there.

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:28.207
And I why am I

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:28.975
the last time I was there,

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:31.110
I watched as the Hamas

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.246
two guys on motorbikes

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:35.281
dragged two human beings

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:37.383
along on the ground,

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:38.851
their legs tied together

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:41.220
with rope or chains to the motor

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.288
And they were dragging them

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:43.556
through the streets

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:45.625
as a warning to other people.

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.592
I don't know what those people

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:47.627
have been accused of,

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:48.961
but they were Palestinians

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:50.696
and they were dead.

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:51.697
And they were being dragged.

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:52.732
They were accused

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.634
probably of being collaborators.

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:55.434
And they dragged them

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:56.002
through the streets

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:57.403
as a warning to everybody else

00:08:57.403 --> 00:09:00.640
to stay silent and to not collab

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:02.708
we're over time.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:03.543
Nic Robertson, thank you.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.144
General Wesley Clark, thank you
