&gt;&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT BIDEN SOUNDING OFF ON THE WAR BETWEEN ISRAEL AND  HAMAS IN A SWEEPING INTERVIEW  WITH "60 MINUTES." HE TOUCHED ON BRINGING THE  AMERICAN HOSTAGES HOME AND  WHETHER U.S. TROOPS COULD BE  SENT INTO COMBAT. ALSO TALK ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN CORRIDOR IN GAZA AND HIS MESSAGE TO HEZBOLLAH. &gt;&gt; WE'LL TO EVERYTHING IN OUR  POWER TO FIND THOSE WHO ARE  STILL ALIVE AND SET THEM FREE. EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER. AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO  DETAIL OF THAT, BUT WE'RE  WORKING LIKE HELL ON IT. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU FORESEE U.S. TROOPS  IN COMBAT IN THIS NEW MIDDLE  EAST WAR? &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THAT IS  NECESSARY. ISRAEL HAS ONE OF THE FINEST  FIGHTING FORCES IN THE COUNTRY. I GUARANTEE WE'LL PROVIDE THEM  EVERYTHING THEY NEED. &gt;&gt; YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE A  HUMANITARIAN CORRIDOR THAT  ALLOWS SOME OF THE 2 MILLION  GAZA STNS OUT OF THE AREA? &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE  HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES BROUGHT  INTO GAZA. &gt;&gt; SO YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE  ISRAELI TOTAL SIEGE OF THE GAZA  STRIP? &gt;&gt; I'M CONFIDENT THAT ISRAEL  WILL ACT UNDER THE RULES OF WAR. &gt;&gt; WOULD YOU SUPPORT ISRAELI  OCCUPATION OF GAZA AT THIS  POINT? &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A  BIG MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE HAMAS MUST BE  ELIMINATED ENTIRELY? &gt;&gt; YES, I DO. BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE A  PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, THERE  NEEDS TO BE A PATH TO A  PALESTINIAN STATE. &gt;&gt; I WONDER WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO HEZBOLLAH AND ITS BACKER  IRAN. &gt;&gt; DON'T. DON'T, DON'T, DON'T. &gt;&gt; DON'T COME ACROSS THE BORDER, DON'T ESCALATE THE WAR. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; CHRISTIAN AMANPOUR IS LIVE IN LONDON WITH MORE. AND OBVIOUSLY THEY TRY TO DO  WITH WORDS EVERYTHING THEY CAN  TO AVOID A LARGER WAR. BUT NONETHELESS BIDEN SAYING  THAT WHILE HAMAS MUST BE  ELIMINATED, REOCCUPYING GAZA  WOULD BE A MISTAKE. HOW DO YOU READ BETWEEN THE  LINES HERE OF WHAT HE IS SAYING  BUT MOST IMPORTANT WHAT ISRAEL  AND ITS ENEMIES ARE HEARING? &gt;&gt; THERE AREN'T ANY LINES TO  READ. WE DON'T KNOW AND NOR DID THE  ISRAELIS OR AMERICANS KNOW WHAT  THE FINAL END GAME IS. WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU DESTROY  AND D DEC DECEMBER A MATE HAMAS. WHAT IS THE FINAL END GAME. WIDER WAR THAT THE UNITED STATES IS TRYING TO HEAD OFFA MATE HAM. IS TRYING TO HEAD OFF WITH THE  SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY, THAT IS ALSO  A REAL PROBLEM. WHAT HAPPENS. HE SAID DON'T WHEN ASKED ABOUT  HAMAS -- RATHER HEZBOLLAH AND  IRAN'S FOREIGN MINISTER MEETING  WITH HAMAS, HAVING BEEN ALSO TO  MEET WITH HEZBOLLAH, HAS  BASICALLY NOW SAID THAT IRAN  WILL NOT STAND IDLY BY IF THE  AIRSTRIKES AGAINST PALESTINIANS  CONTINUE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THE UNITED STATES -- ISRAEL  RATHER HAS ALREADY BOMBED AIR  STRIPS IN SYRIA IN DAMASCUS AND  ALLEPO AND THERE ARE CONSTANT  SKIRMISHES ACROSS THE BORDER. ISRAEL HAS NOT SAID THAT IT SEES A SMOKING GUN FROM IRAN. CLEARLY NOBODY WANTS TO GET INTO THAT KIND OF WAR. AND THEN ON THE HUMANITARIAN  SIDE, THIS IS ALSO HUGELY  COMPLEX BECAUSE, YES, IT IS  CLOSED TO ALL INTENTS AND  PURPOSE, BUT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING  TO ARAB LEADERS WHO ARE  CONCERNED ABOUT A, QUOTE, E EXODUS, WHERE ARE ALL THESE  PALES PALESTINIANS BEING PUSHED. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE  PALESTINIANS PUSHED PERMANENTLY  OUT OF GAZA AND THEN POTENTIALLY NEVER BEING ALLOWED TO COME  BACK. THEY ALSO DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT AS A PRECEDENT, WHAT HAPPENS IF  CERTAIN ISRAELIS, THE RIGHT  WINGERS WHO HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT  FOR INSTANCE JORDAN IS A  PALESTINIAN HOMELAND, THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT KIND OF PROCESS HAPPENING IN THE WEST BANK. SO THIS IS HUGELY COMPLICATED  RIGHT NOW AND NOT AS SIMPLE --  WELL, CLEARY NOT SIMPLE, BUT  JUST THE IDEA OF HUMANITARIAN  CORRIDORS IS ALSO VERY, VERY  COMPLEX. &gt;&gt; AND TRY DEVOCAL CRITICISM OF  CIVILIAN SITUATION THIS GAZA  FROM THE KING OF JORDAN AND AS  WELL AS THE LEADER OF EGYPT  MAKING IT CLEAR HOW THEY FEEL  THERE. BUT ANTONY BLINKEN JUST CAME  BACK HERE AND HE IS MEETING WITH THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER. NO ONE HAD EXPECTED HIM TO COME  HE WAS HERE LAST WEEK AND IT WAS ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT THAT HE  WOULD RETURN. THE QUESTION WAS WHAT IS HE  RETURNING FOR, WAS HE RETURNING  TO GET NETANYAHU TO PAUSE OR TO  CONSIDER OR PULL BACK OR IS HE  SIMPLY COMING TO ASSIST IN  NEGOTIATIONS OVER BORDER  CROSSINGS. WE WILL HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE  FROM THEM IN A FEW MOMENTS, BUT  DO YOU REALLY THINK IS HAPPENING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS? &gt;&gt; I THINK ALL OF THE ABOVE  FRANKLY. THE UNITED STATES IS TRYING TO  KEEP IT FROM SPILLING OVER. IT HAS TO SUPPORT ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE, BUT IT WANTS TO MAKE SURE IF IT IS AT ALL  POSSIBLE TO KEEP IT TO WITHIN  CERTAIN PARAMETERS. ALSO, YOU KNOW, THE UNITED  STATES IS IMPLICATED, IT IS  INVOLVED BECAUSE 29 AT LEAST OF  ITS CITIZENS HAVE BEEN KILLED  AND THERE ARE APPARENTLY  POTENTIALLY ISRAELI AMERICAN  HOSTAGES. SO THE U.S. IS ABSOLUTELY  INVOLVED. BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE CAUTIONING,  YOU KNOW, THE U.S. WAS ASKED  WOULD THEY PUT BOOTS ON THE  GROUND AND BIDEN SAID DON'T  THINK IT IS NECESSARY. THEY ARE SENDING STRIKE FORCES. WHAT FOR, IS THAT FOR COVER,  WHAT IS IT FOR. AND JUST GO BACK ALL THE WAY TO  1983 WHEN THE U.S. SENT WARSHIPS OUTSIDE LEBANON AND IN SUPPORT  OF ISRAEL, WAS INVOLVED IN THAT  WAR AND IT HAD A TERRIBLE,  TERRIBLE BACKLASH AGAINST THE  UNITED STATES. MASSIVE KILLINGS AT THE BARRACKS IN BEIRUT AND ON AND ON AND ON. IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF REALLY  SERIOUS ANTI-AMERICAN BACKLASH  IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD. SO THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED AS  WELL. &gt;&gt; AND ALSO THE HOSTAGES. LAST NIGHT, HE DID POINT OUT IN  THE "60 MINUTES" INTERVIEW  SAYING NO NEED FOR U.S. TROOP ON THE GROUND. OF COURSE JOHN KIRBY HAD LEFT IT ON THE TABLE THAT WHEN IT COMES  TO U.S. HOSTAGES, WE WON'T TAKE  ANYTHING OFF THE TABLE IF YOU  NEED U.S. MILITARY POWER  INVOLVED IN THAT. NOT TAKING IT OFF THE TABLE IS  NOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IT, BUT NONETHELESS THERE IS  STILL THAT UNCERTAINTY. YOU HAVE AMERICANS BEING HELD  HOSTAGE AND THAT IS A WHOLE NEW  THING HERE. &gt;&gt; IT IS. AND AS I SAY, THOSE HOSTAGE  SITUATIONS, MOSTLY STARTED BACK  THERE IN LEBANON AFTER A  CERTAIN, YOU KNOW, AFTER WHAT I  TOLD YOU ABOUT. THE THING IS, THE HOSTAGES  ACCORDING TO ISRAELI EXPERTS AND FORMER HOSTAGE NEGOTIATORS AND  IDF PEOPLE, THEY WILL NOT BE  ABLE TO BE, YOU KNOW, RELEASED  OR FOUND WITHOUT A GROUND  INCURSION. IT IS ONLY ON THE GROUND THAT  YOU CAN GET TO THOSE HOSTAGES. YOU ALREADY HAD A DISCUSSION  ABOUT THE PARAMETERS ADDRESS  DA -- AND DANGERS OF THAT. IF IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF THOSE HOSTAGES HAVE ALREADY BEEN  KILLED IN AIRSTRIKES, AND WE  HAVEN'T HAD CONFIRMATION, BUT  THAT IS WHAT HAMAS HAS SAID, IS  ISRAEL'S FIRST PRIORITY TO SAVE  THE HOSTAGES OR IS ITS FIRST --  AND I'M TALKING ABOUT IN A  GROUND INCURSION. OR IS IT TO DECIMATE HAMAS. THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT WE  WELL, CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
