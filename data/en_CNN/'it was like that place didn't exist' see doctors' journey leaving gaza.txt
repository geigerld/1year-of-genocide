This is what leaving Gaza looks like driving through the dust and debris. 16 health care workers finally evacuating the Gaza European Hospital, a journey many outside Gaza haven't seen and most inside are unable to make. Among them Doctor Adam Hamhuis, a U.S. combat surgeon and humanitarian, first responder. He recently chose to stay behind when an initial evacuation was only offered to U.S. citizens. This is the first wave. Another one usually starts around 2 a.m.. These are the conditions Hamoudi and his colleagues worked under. They just wait until everyone really falls asleep and then they try to wake you up again. He wrote a letter to President Biden saying he had never witnessed, quote, the level of atrocities and targeting of medical colleagues as he had in Gaza, urging the president to allow a humanitarian corridor to be established and for his colleagues and himself to be allowed to evacuate. Days later, the team were on their way. Our farewell was marked with many tears on both sides. We gave them everything we had, like we left really with the the, the clothes we were wearing and in a small backpack. But even then they were giving us little gifts to remember them by. And and, with promises that now we will come back and we will continue to help them and and, we won't forget. You do want to go back, right? All of us want to go back. There are people who are not able to leave like the Palestinians themselves. And we can't forget them. The local level. And while getting permission was one thing, making the treacherous journey was another. It was very dystopian. The way it happened. Everything was through instructions, by phone, with very choppy, service. everything I believe was was observed, through to the, overhead drones to come It took us about three hours to do that 15 minute drive that normally takes to get the word out. It was a level of destruction I had not seen before. It was. There was nothing left standing. the the unusual part which was really like I said, it was like out of a science fiction movie. You know, once you left the gate and when we were driving to Israel, was that that crossing, it was a completely another world. It was I went from what I just described to driving through California. It was like that place didn't exist.
