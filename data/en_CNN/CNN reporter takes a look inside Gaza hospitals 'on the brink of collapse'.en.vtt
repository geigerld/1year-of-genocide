00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.334
CNN's Salma Abdelaziz

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.128
joining us now with the latest.

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:06.715
Salma, Gaza's hospital are facing

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:07.424
the hospitals there.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:08.675
They're facing severe shortages.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:09.300
And, of course, there's

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.678
no fuel on these aid trucks.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:12.595
What more can you tell us

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:14.681
about the aid that's coming in

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:18.435
and how that is going to play out?

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.436
I think it's crucial

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.147
we put this aid into context.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:24.232
We understand from local officials

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:27.360
that these 20 trucks are 3%, just

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.447
3% of what was normally coming in

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.323
on a single day

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:33.074
in Gaza

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:34.826
before this crisis

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:35.827
even began in

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.120
these trucks have to distribute

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.706
this aid as airstrikes continue

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.041
to rain down without.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.418
Fuel to put.

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:44.544
Into these trucks.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.880
And they're feeling this huge gap,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.673
this huge deficit.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.258
Hospitals are running out of medicine.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:51.676
Kids are drinking seawater

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.762
because there's no clean drinking water.

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:57.015
The humanitarian crisis is just huge.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:57.432
I want to

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:58.266
I want you to take a look

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.310
at the situation on the ground.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.188
I do warn you, these images are graphic.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:09.235
As these aid convoys enter Gaza.

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:12.072
Hospitals in Gaza are crumbling.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.364
Everything is running out

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:16.201
from surgical equipment to medicine

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.286
and the tiniest lives are left

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:21.247
hanging in the balance.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:22.499
Of their lives.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:23.374
We need power.

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:25.210
We need access to clean water.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.004
This doctor says without basic services,

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:32.008
this will be a humanitarian catastrophe.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.552
Already, seven hospitals and 21

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:36.221
primary health care facilities

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.056
here are out of service,

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:40.058
according to Palestinian officials,

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:43.436
because of shortages

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:45.897
after intense diplomatic efforts.

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:47.232
Prayers of relief

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:48.149
at the Rafah border

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.900
crossing

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.110
as a trickle of aid

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.070
was allowed in from Egypt.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.073
But the tow truck convoy is only a drop

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.324
in the ocean

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:59.327
of need here, equivalent to just 3%

00:01:59.536 --> 00:01:59.869
of what

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.121
entered this enclave

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.873
daily prior to the conflict.

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:04.958
More than 200

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.626
additional trucks of assistance

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:09.170
remain stalled on the Egyptian side,

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.588
according to the U.N..

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:14.425
And every hour costs lives.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.926
And so

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.302
far, no civilians

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.971
can leave beyond Cleeve.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:18.346
Ten year

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.431
old Palestinian American Aiden

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.100
is among those trapped.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.643
And we have no place to go.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.895
All the streets are bombed.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.231
There they're literally gone.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.316
How are we. Supposed to go out?

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.861
And how it's all closed.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.988
Even if people are allowed out,

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.614
it will be a limited number.

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:37.907
Most likely only those

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:39.826
with foreign passports.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.411
Sealing some 2 million

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.371
others, half of them children,

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.040
into this hellscape.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.834
But some refuse to go,

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.169
even if they could.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.129
Fearing Israel intends to bomb

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.173
and besiege them out of their homes,

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.633
never to return.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:58.094
Even as Mahmoud buries his children,

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.804
he says he will keep fighting

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:02.140
just to exist here.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.224
Sorry.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:04.517
We will still be patient.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.394
As long as we are alive on this earth,

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.479
we will be patient, he says.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.524
We will never leave this land.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.318
After the October 7th terror

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:14.736
attacks, when Hamas killed

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.322
more than 1400 people in Israel

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.781
in a brutal surprise

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:20.408
incursion, Israel

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:23.077
vowed to wipe out Hamas.

00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:24.829
But with hundreds of airstrikes

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.581
pounding the densely populated

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.999
enclave a day,

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.336
innocent blood is being spilled.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.129
Innocent children were struck down

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.339
while they were sleeping.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.548
This woman shouts.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:36.382
What did they do?

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:37.717
Did they carry weapons?

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.052
These are innocent children

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.136
who know nothing.

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:43.556
Tell us, when will this end?

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.016
There are calls for a cease

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:46.351
fire to get civilians

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.352
out of the war

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:50.355
zone and allow more aid into Gaza.

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:53.441
But the pleas fall on deaf ears so far.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.902
Israel is preparing for the next phase

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.320
of its operations,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.113
a potential ground incursion

00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:04.827
that can only bring more suffering.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.412
And when we talk about this

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.664
trickle of aid,

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.165
I also want you to think about

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.833
just how much it required

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:13.503
to get such a small amount of help

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:14.879
into the enclave.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.048
President Biden was directly involved

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.341
in these negotiations.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.425
There was intense

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:20.593
diplomatic efforts,

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.345
a flurry between Egypt

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:22.929
and Israel

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.013
in the United States

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:27.350
to just bring in this tiny amount of help

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:28.268
that, again,

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:28.810
aid workers

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.313
say is going to be used up immediately.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.273
And we're looking at

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.565
a humanitarian crisis

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:36.943
that isn't just unfolding on the ground,

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.070
but is actually being expanded,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.197
added to intensified hour

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.032
by hour by those airstrikes

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:44.534
that continue to push.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.869
Wounded people, displaced people.

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:47.704
Into places

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.664
where shelters are overwhelmed.

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:52.208
Hospitals are overwhelmed,

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.419
that the fear here is that

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.379
this is simply not enough

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.006
and there could not be enough

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:01.551
coming in the days in the days ahead.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.094
Some Abdul-Aziz

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:04.095
with the reporting for us.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:04.804
Thank you so much.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:05.138
Joining us

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.347
now is Cindy McCain,

00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:08.975
executive director of World Food Program

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.184
and former ambassador

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:11.853
to the UN Agencies

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.980
for Food and Agriculture.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.772
Ambassador McCain,

00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:16.357
thank you for your time.

00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:17.066
I want to fill out

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:19.485
the picture of perspective,

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:23.281
what was sent in on these first 20 trucks

00:05:23.364 --> 00:05:25.992
compared to what is needed.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:30.121
So fill that out for us if you could.

00:05:30.204 --> 00:05:30.788
Well,

00:05:30.788 --> 00:05:31.247
first of all,

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:32.290
thank you for having me

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.707
and thank you

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.500
for talking about this issue.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.419
I witnessed the container,

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.212
all the trucks for medical supplies.

00:05:38.212 --> 00:05:38.546
Of course,

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:42.300
we took in food, water taken in.

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:43.676
And as we said,

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.053
it was a very small amount.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:49.557
Is 20.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.516
As for this

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:53.394
convoy, convoys like this to be sustained

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:54.729
and to be safe

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.356
and continue to run

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.441
and continue to go into the country,

00:05:58.441 --> 00:05:59.984
this is a catastrophe

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:01.778
going on on the ground there.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.071
People are starving to death.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.822
There's no water, as you know.

00:06:04.822 --> 00:06:07.241
There's no electricity. There's no fuel.

00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:09.869
This this is ripe for disease

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.496
and much, much more.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:14.290
So I'm really pleading with the world

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.168
community to please get in here and help.

00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:18.252
Ambassador, as you've heard

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:19.962
from some of our reporters,

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:21.005
especially Clarissa Ward,

00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:22.298
who's been there on the ground

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:23.174
near the crossing,

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.050
I mean, she's been saying

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.636
this is just a drop in the ocean

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.263
because you have 28 trucks coming in.

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:31.516
Compare that to 450 trucks

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:32.266
that have been coming in

00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:34.477
every single day into Gaza.

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.437
What is the World Food Program?

00:06:36.437 --> 00:06:38.689
What are you doing to

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:39.899
I guess, what kind of conversations

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:40.691
are you having to

00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:42.402
to open a sustained

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:46.572
humanitarian corridor?

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:47.949
Well, I have talked to

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.076
everybody involved that I can find,

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.911
and that includes the secretary general

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:52.954
as well as our

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:53.746
our other folks

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:56.707
with our various partner agencies around.

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:57.583
This is something

00:06:57.583 --> 00:07:00.169
that has got to be sustained and saved

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:01.838
and, of course, has to be

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.798
it has to be much more of it.

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.466
This cannot be the only

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:08.719
or the last convoy that simply can't be.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.471
So I'm looking to I'm

00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:11.556
helping the leadership

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:14.350
in various countries around this around

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.643
this can help us.

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:16.769
I help remind the world

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:17.728
that we need to get in here

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:18.146
to help

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.106
those who cannot help themselves

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.150
and are about to starve to death.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.234
What are you hearing from

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.278
your partners there in Gaza?

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.363
Understand that there were

00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:28.990
dozens of bakeries

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.033
that the World Food Program

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:31.868
partnered with,

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.578
and now there are just a couple

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.705
that are operational.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.708
Give us some context on the

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.126
the capabilities.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:43.296
Once supplies reach people there,

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:46.841
what they can do with it.

00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:47.800
Right.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.218
Well, first of all, we

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:51.512
Djibouti was already in Palestine

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:53.264
and we were already in the area.

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:56.225
And so so we are people are still there.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.435
So what does this mean?

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:58.561
We have the capability

00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:58.936
and have

00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:00.021
logistics ability

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.230
to bring in large

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.191
quantities of food, etc..

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.151
But right now, what's left on the ground,

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:05.610
as you know,

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.111
many of the bakeries were bombed.

00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:09.655
Many of them just don't have supplies.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.407
And the ones that are operational

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:13.117
are have very minimal ability

00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:14.327
to do just that.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:17.163
We are bringing in emergency food rations

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:17.747
right now.

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:18.289
This is

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:18.956
this is food

00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:20.625
that people can eat immediately,

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:21.709
Do not have to cook.

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:22.335
Sure,

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.836
we can sustain themselves

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:24.712
a little bit longer

00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:26.339
until we can get the longer

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.591
lasting items that they need in there.

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.594
But once again, 20 trucks will not do it.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.929
We need as as

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.514
Clarissa said, there are 400

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.557
some trucks going every day.

00:08:36.557 --> 00:08:38.184
We need those 407

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:39.227
trucks filled with food

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.145
to go in every day.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:41.979
All right.

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:43.272
And in terms of

00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:44.941
your message to the people on the ground,

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:46.025
because logistically, I mean,

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.568
I wonder how this is going to work.

00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:47.735
Right?

00:08:47.735 --> 00:08:49.987
28 trucks coming in.

00:08:49.987 --> 00:08:51.989
There's way more need than that.

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:53.741
How do you know how the people on

00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:55.785
the ground are going to prioritize

00:08:55.785 --> 00:09:00.081
who gets what?

00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:00.831
Well,

00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:02.375
in the case of World Food Program,

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.252
we we that's what we do.

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:05.336
We prioritize.

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:06.629
We know where it needs to go.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.422
We know where the where the people are.

00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:09.882
Also staying with regard

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:11.926
to hospitals, community centers,

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.053
where they've been, where they fled to.

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:15.012
So we're going to make sure

00:09:15.012 --> 00:09:16.180
that the food gets right

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.223
where it's supposed to go

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.099
and that it makes it

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:19.475
to the correct people.

00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:21.352
Let's be very clear about that.

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:23.020
We have the kind of capabilities

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.897
to track and trace our food.

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:25.815
And more importantly,

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.233
we are able to on the ground

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.734
make sure that our beneficiaries

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:30.403
are the real beneficiaries

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.321
that should be getting the food.

00:09:32.321 --> 00:09:33.864
So we're going to do everything

00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:35.533
we can to make sure it goes right

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:36.826
where it's supposed to go.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.494
And that's what he's good at.

00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:39.662
We're good at logistics.

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:40.788
We're good at this.

00:09:40.788 --> 00:09:41.706
And so that's why

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:43.958
we we're the largest organization.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.459
That's why we continue

00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:47.336
to do the kind of work that we do.

00:09:47.336 --> 00:09:49.839
Most of most Americans

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:50.464
first met you

00:09:50.464 --> 00:09:51.924
when your late husband,

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:52.925
Senator John McCain,

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.552
was running for president.

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:57.346
He was the Republican nominee in 2008.

00:09:57.346 --> 00:09:58.180
One of the candidates

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.182
for the nomination this time around.

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:00.975
Florida Governor Ron

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.143
DeSantis has said that

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:04.270
not a single dollar of U.S.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.273
aid should go into Gaza.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:11.944
I wonder what your reaction to that is.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.696
Listen, it's not just Gaza.

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.364
This problem is worldwide.

00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:17.783
We have the Sahel. We have Sudan.

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:19.243
We have

00:10:19.243 --> 00:10:20.745
hundreds of thousands of refugees,

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:22.663
millions fleeing into Chad.

00:10:22.663 --> 00:10:23.748
This is not a problem

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.709
that's solely in Gaza. This is worldwide.

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:27.793
So to say somehow

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:30.796
you're not going to give aid to anybody

00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:32.673
is is just cruel.

00:10:32.673 --> 00:10:34.425
There are people starving to death.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:35.593
And the United States

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.595
always steps up is always

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:39.388
the first and we're always the largest

00:10:39.388 --> 00:10:41.682
because that's who we are as Americans.

00:10:41.682 --> 00:10:43.893
So I would challenge Mr.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:46.395
DeSantis on that, on that topic.

00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:47.563
Well, thank you for taking time out

00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:48.648
on a very busy day.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:49.607
Appreciate the work you do,

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:51.317
Ambassador Sidney McCain, Thank you.
