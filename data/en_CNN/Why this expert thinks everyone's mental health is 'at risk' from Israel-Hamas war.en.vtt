00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:00.875
People were

00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:01.751
just watching

00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:04.754
the images out of Israel and Gaza.

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.756
It's incredibly disturbing.

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:09.134
The war shows no sign of ending

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:10.135
any time soon.

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:10.969
As a result,

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.263
it is taking a toll on people's

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.348
mental health around the world.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:16.057
Joining us now

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.642
is psychiatrist and host of the

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.269
How Can I Help podcast.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.520
Dr. Gail Saltz.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.356
Doctor, thank you so much for joining us.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:23.690
You know,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.359
even if you don't have family members

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.776
or people

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:27.444
you know,

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.487
who are impacted by

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:32.115
what's happening in Israel,

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.452
I think people are just shocked

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.663
at the level of carnage.

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:42.208
How would you advise the general public

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.501
in terms of how much

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.378
they should be consuming

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.255
and when they should know

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:50.508
when to take a break?

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.302
I think you have to know yourself.

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.220
So for people who know,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.805
they tend to be anxious.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.640
They tend to struggle with mood.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.350
They have a history of trauma

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.976
of some sort

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:01.478
or any really any sort

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:02.062
or history

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.521
of probable problems

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:05.607
in terms of mental health.

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:06.399
They're more at risk.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.692
People, as you pointed out,

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.152
who are connected to this

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:10.695
in any sort of way.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:11.696
They're more at risk.

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:13.323
But I would say to you

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.158
that actually all of us

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:16.076
are somewhat at risk

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:16.910
because we

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.995
have never had this level

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.705
of graphic image

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:23.625
coming to us on such a constant basis.

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.543
So it's not only on the news,

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.712
it's on everybody's social media feeds.

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:30.715
And today, children, adolescents, adults,

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.760
we're receiving these images and images

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.470
tend to stick in your mind

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.764
in a very intrusive way,

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.766
making it difficult to concentrate,

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:40.433
feeling like it's

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.102
repeating all the time,

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.770
making it difficult to sleep.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.772
And those things will further

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:46.940
impact your mental health.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.526
So I would say a little bit to all of us,

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:53.822
we really limit how much we are seeing

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.990
and possibly even take a break

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.952
and take your news in there reading it

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.370
or listening to it.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.538
But picking

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:04.999
a source and limiting how much of the day

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:06.668
you actually expose yourself.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.671
So maybe like 30 minutes and not doing it

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.339
close to bedtime,

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.758
we are likely to be even more stirred up

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:15.969
and therefore have difficulty sleeping.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.138
There's a point at which

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.390
we have to turn it off,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.432
and then there's a point

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:23.309
at which for some people

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.936
they need some help. Yeah.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:27.230
How do you know when you've gotten

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.605
to that

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.275
second level, that second degree there

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:31.484
where you need to talk

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:32.360
to a professional

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.404
about what you're watching

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:37.282
and what you're experiencing?

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:38.324
Well, I think, first of all,

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.492
most a lot of people

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.869
can do things for themselves

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.162
before they get there.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.205
They can add some coping tools

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.249
that help with anxiety during the day,

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:50.378
deep breathing aerobic exercise,

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.213
talking to people around them

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.506
that make them feel better,

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.716
stay away from doomsday.

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:56.384
People can tap

00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:57.677
catastrophizing people

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:00.221
that will make you actually feel worse.

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.055
But talking to people

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:02.390
can also really be helpful.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.641
But beyond that,

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:07.145
if your anxiety and concern about this

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.229
are disturbing you such

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.231
that you can't concentrate at work,

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:11.316
you can't get things done

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:12.442
the way you normally would,

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:15.111
you can't sleep well at night.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:16.779
It's affecting your relationships,

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.823
basically, if it's intruding into

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:20.366
and affecting your day

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.243
for more than a few days.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:23.286
This might be the time

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.162
that you want to say,

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:25.830
Hey, I need to get an evaluation

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.414
or something.

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:28.666
A process may have started here

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:31.377
that I have to really look into

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:31.961
and think about

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:33.755
whether I need a little extra help with.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.882
I can't stop thinking about,

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.383
you know, so many of the people

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.635
that we and

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.178
our CNN colleagues have interviewed.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:42.555
They're out in this war zone.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.389
The family members

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.682
who have seen

00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:46.142
the horror happen

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:47.685
before their eyes, people

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:49.145
losing their children,

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.730
people being on the phone

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.148
while the abduction

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:52.982
and the screaming

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.400
was happening in the background.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.363
How do we begin to help them recover

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:02.325
from the trauma?

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:05.078
So obviously, the closer that you are,

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.079
as I said to this event,

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.872
the more likely you are

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:08.206
to have

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.999
what's called an acute stress reaction,

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.542
which is a whole collection

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:12.043
of symptoms

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.086
of the intrusive

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.003
thoughts of the event

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:16.214
repetitively of feeling

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.465
like you have to avoid anything

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.342
that reminds you of the event of trouble

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:20.718
sleeping and concentrating

00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:21.970
or taking pleasure in anything

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.805
and trouble with your appetite.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.266
But again, the closer you are to this,

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:26.975
the more likely

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.726
you are to go on and develop

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.520
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.939
So what's important is to intervene

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:33.731
early.

00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:34.816
An intervention

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.778
means, again, any kind of thing

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:39.862
that would help you

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:42.282
decrease your overall anxiety level.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.658
So there are lots of,

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.910
as I alluded to earlier, exercises

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.203
one can do that

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.205
do take down your anxiety level,

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.208
which helps you manage trauma more.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.335
You want to pay attention to your mood.

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:55.586
So actually

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:56.713
spending time

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.548
talking about anything positive,

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.466
anything positive.

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:03.928
And in fact, we hear or someone anywhere

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:05.638
and they too can think about

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:08.641
what can they do to help their situation.

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:10.685
Because helping and being involved

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:11.144
in something

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.646
that feels like an active action

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.773
really does help with it.

00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:17.233
Managing the trauma of this.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.485
So those sorts of things are going to be

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:20.737
very important

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.905
to the people who are involved.

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:24.282
And of course, you know, people

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:25.116
like myself

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:26.826
who are getting involved in mental health

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.536
care for those people as well.

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:29.287
Yeah. Dr.

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.998
Gail Saltz, some great advice there.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:32.915
Thank you so much.
