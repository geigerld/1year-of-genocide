00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.543
Joining me now is Secretary of State

00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:02.627
Antony Blinken.

00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:04.045
Mr. Secretary, thanks for joining us.

00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:05.463
So the U.S.

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:07.215
stood alone at the U.N.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:08.299
Security Council on Friday

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:09.300
to block the cease fire

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.135
and the administration

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:11.344
is sidestepping Congress

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:12.971
to rush more weapons to Israel.

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:13.847
You said this week

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.849
that there is, quote, a gap

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.183
between the intent

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.436
to protect Palestinian civilians

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.021
and the actual results

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.023
that we're seeing on the ground in Gaza.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.774
Can you describe that gap?

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.484
What is Israel doing right now

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:28.153
that you think does not

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:31.239
demonstrate enough care or protection

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:35.535
of Palestinian civilians?

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:36.995
Jake, we think there needs to be

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.705
a premium put on protecting civilians

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.247
and making sure

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:40.415
that humanitarian assistance

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.459
can get to everyone who needs it.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:43.585
And as I said,

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.253
I think the intent is there,

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:47.922
but the results are not always

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:48.923
manifesting themselves.

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:50.258
And we see that both

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:51.342
in terms of civilian protection

00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:52.385
and humanitarian assistance,

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.970
we want to make sure that is

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.096
Israel continues

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:57.766
this this campaign, because, remember,

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.225
they are dealing with

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.518
a terrorist organization

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:01.186
that engaged

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:02.645
in the most vicious possible

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.314
brutality on October 7th

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:05.482
and has made clear

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.025
that it would do it again

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:07.776
and again and again

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.069
if given the opportunity.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.570
So Israel needs to be able to deal

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.529
with this to protect itself,

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:12.530
to prevent October 7th

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.656
from happening again.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.242
But as it does that, it's imperative

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.660
that civilians be protected.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.578
And here,

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.621
the critical thing

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:20.371
is to make sure

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:21.915
that the military operations

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.042
are designed around civilian protection

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:25.126
and to focus on that

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:27.545
when it comes to humanitarian assistance

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:30.006
that we, as you know,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.507
made the

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.008
argument many weeks ago

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.551
to get humanitarian assistance in.

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:34.636
It started to flow.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:35.762
We got a doubled during

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:36.763
the humanitarian pause

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.931
for the hostage releases

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.349
that we helped to negotiate.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.684
But now what's critical is this.

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.103
Even as Israel has taken

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.562
additional steps, for example,

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:47.565
to designate safe areas in the south

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.275
to focus on neighborhoods,

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.568
not entire cities,

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.070
in terms of evacuating them.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.863
What we're not seeing sufficiently

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.031
is a couple of things.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.783
One, making sure that

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.618
the humanitarian operators

00:01:58.618 --> 00:01:59.285
who are there, starting

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.286
with the United Nations,

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.746
performing heroically,

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.706
that there are deconfliction

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:06.167
times, places and routes

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:07.752
so that the humanitarians can bring

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.462
the assistance is getting into Gaza

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:10.672
to the people who need it.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:11.381
Similarly,

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:11.965
we need to see

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.968
the same kind of deconfliction time

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.012
pauses, designated routes, plural.

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:19.931
Not not not just one

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.433
and and clarity of communication

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:24.310
so that people know when it is safe

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.853
and where it is

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:27.230
safe to move to get out of harm's way

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.982
before they go back home.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:29.899
These are the kinds of things

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.693
we're working on every single day, again,

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.653
to make sure that that gap between intent

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.947
and result is as narrow as possible.

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.657
The IDF told CNN,

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.159
I believe Alex Marquardt earlier today

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:39.701
that they estimate

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:44.122
they've killed about 7000 Hamas fighters.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:45.290
When do you anticipate

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.167
this phase of Israel's

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.210
military campaign is going to end?

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.627
Obviously,

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:52.005
they can't kill every member of Hamas.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.840
And even if they did, 150,000

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.675
new ones would show up the next day.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.343
Are the Israelis telling you anything

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:58.553
about when this phase

00:02:58.553 --> 00:02:59.262
is going to ramp up?

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.598
Because obviously the civilian death toll

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.766
is mounting. It's unimaginable.

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:05.894
Secretary Austin suggested

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:06.519
that Israel

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.770
might ultimately be facing

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.771
a strategic defeat

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.316
by chasing so many Palestinians

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:15.528
into the arms of Hamas.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:16.613
Jake,

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.114
we have these discussions with Israel,

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.782
including about the duration,

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:22.702
as well as how it's prosecuting

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.787
this campaign against Hamas.

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:26.873
These are decisions for Israel to make,

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.876
but Hamas has decisions to make, too.

00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:31.669
It could get out from hiding

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.379
behind civilians tomorrow.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.215
It could put down its arms tomorrow.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.466
It could surrender tomorrow.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.426
And this would be over.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:39.469
Right? Obviously.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.720
But will the U.S.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.598
continue to back Israel

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.183
the way it's backing Israel right now

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.227
if this continues for months and months

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:51.064
as opposed to days or weeks?

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.023
Again, Israel has to

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:53.399
make these decisions.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.944
Of course, everyone wants to see this

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.487
campaign come to a close

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.405
as quickly as possible.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.949
But any country faced

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.742
with what Israel is facing,

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.452
a terrorist organization that attacked it

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:05.495
in the most horrific way

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.414
possible on October 7th, and as I said,

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:08.831
has said

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.208
repeatedly that it would do it again.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.417
And again and again.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:14.379
It has to get to the point where it is

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.256
confident that that can't be repeated.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.257
But you make another point

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.508
that's very important.

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:19.842
When the major

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:22.387
military operation is over,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.680
this is not over

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.430
because we

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.601
have to have a durable, sustainable peace

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:29.769
and we have to make sure

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.396
that we're on the path to a durable

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:32.522
and sustainable peace.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.773
From our perspective,

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.525
I think from the perspective of

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.026
many around the world,

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:39.779
that has to lead to a Palestinian state.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.114
This is we're not going to have

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:41.739
durable peace.

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.574
We're not going to have durable security

00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:44.742
for Israel

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:46.452
unless and until Palestinian

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:48.246
political aspirations are met.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.623
And of course, what happens

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.542
the day after in Gaza itself,

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:53.876
once a military operations

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:55.420
major military operation is over,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.589
that's also usually important and urgent

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:01.551
to make sure that governance, security,

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.594
reconstruction, all of that is in place

00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:05.263
so that there's no vacuum.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.514
The Committee to Protect Journalists

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:07.598
says at least 63

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:09.309
journalists and members of the news

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.769
media have been killed,

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:16.107
56 of them Palestinian, in this war,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.567
presumably mostly,

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.111
if not entirely by IDF strikes.

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.864
Is that acceptable to you?

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.782
You've made of press freedom

00:05:24.782 --> 00:05:27.243
a hallmark of your of your term.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.245
How do you explain all these

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:30.496
deaths of journalists?

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:34.917
How do the Israelis explain it?

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.794
Jake, as I see

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:37.628
journalists, including

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:38.504
some of your colleagues,

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.131
but also from many other news

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.507
organizations,

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:43.801
putting their lives on the line to

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:44.635
just bring the news,

00:05:44.635 --> 00:05:46.637
bring the facts, bring information

00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:47.805
to the world.

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:49.724
I have

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:50.808
extraordinary admiration

00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:52.018
for what they do,

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.436
for the courage that they show

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.063
and for the vital

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.272
importance of their mission.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.482
And we want to make sure

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:59.609
that just as every civilian

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:00.276
is protected

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:01.652
to the greatest extent possible.

00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:04.447
Of course, journalists are, too,

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.825
and they're when it comes to instances

00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:10.078
where journalists have been killed,

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.621
we want to make sure that

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.790
that's investigated

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.291
and we understand what's happened.

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.169
And there's accountability.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.087
Congress is scrambling

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:20.546
to reach a deal to pass

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.090
foreign aid for Ukraine and Israel.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.175
Republicans are insisting

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.426
on more border funding

00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.011
and new asylum restrictions

00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:29.138
that that be added to the to the bill.

00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:30.640
What would it mean for Ukraine and Israel

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.308
if Congress does not pass

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:33.309
any additional support

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:34.102
by the end of the year?

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.603
And why not agree

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:36.938
to tougher border protections,

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.356
which is an issue

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:42.276
of national security as well?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.361
Well, Jake, the

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:43.778
the border

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.488
piece, as you know, is out of my

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.240
is out of my purview. But I can say this.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.074
I know

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.368
on day one of this administration,

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.786
or at least day two,

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:53.204
the president put before Congress,

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.414
I think the first bill

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:55.790
on immigration reform.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.624
Unfortunately, Congress

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:57.875
hasn't acted on that.

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.878
In this request for additional funds,

00:07:00.878 --> 00:07:04.632
there are $6 billion to enhance border

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:05.341
security,

00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:07.677
including having more people, more agents

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:08.428
on the border.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:09.429
So I know that's very much

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.680
part of the discussion

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.139
and something

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.557
the president's fully prepared to

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:13.558
to engage on.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:14.559
But in terms of what it would mean

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:15.101
for Ukraine,

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.686
what it would mean for Israel,

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.855
what it would mean for our efforts

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:21.691
to be competitive in the Indo-Pacific.

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:22.733
I think the only people

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:23.443
who would be happy

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.111
if this supplemental budget request

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.571
is not voted on

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:27.822
and approved by Congress

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.615
are sitting in Moscow,

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:32.118
sitting in Tehran, sitting in Beijing.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.120
For Ukraine, this is absolutely vital.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.330
They've made remarkable progress

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.416
over the last year in pushing back

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:39.459
Russian aggression,

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.001
taking back

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:41.377
more than 50% of the territory

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:44.297
that was seized since February of 2022.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.090
But they're in a ferocious battle

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.592
now in the south, in the east.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:50.011
We are running out of funding for them,

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:50.595
by the way.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:51.888
90% of the assistance,

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.514
the security assistance that we provided,

00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:55.016
Ukraine is actually invested

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:57.018
right here in the United States

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:59.228
to our companies, to our manufacturers.

00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:00.396
Similarly,

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:01.689
we've had extraordinary burden

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:02.982
sharing with our allies and partners.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:03.733
We provided

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.276
very significant assistance,

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.611
about $70 billion

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.029
over the last two years.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.363
Our European friends

00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:10.990
and partners beyond Europe,

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.326
more than $110 Billion for Ukraine.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.243
So we have the

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:16.245
burden sharing that we need.

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.288
This is a time to

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:17.955
really step up

00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:19.832
because if we don't,

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:21.167
we know what happens.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.710
Putin will be able to move forward

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.253
with impunity.

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:27.006
And we we know he won't stop in Ukraine

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:28.216
and he may well end up going

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.300
after a narrow country

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.301
that would bring us in,

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.428
given our obligations to our NATO allies.

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:35.097
So here an ounce of prevention

00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:37.683
is really worth £10 of cure.

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:38.559
Anthony, as you know,

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.144
CNN has has led the coverage

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:42.271
when it comes to the evidence

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:45.191
mounting in Israel of rapes

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.400
and sex crimes

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.485
committed by Hamas

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:48.486
against women and girls.

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:51.405
Maybe even against men on October 7th.

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:53.199
Why do you think the United Nations

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.575
and the international community

00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:56.118
has been so slow

00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:58.329
to condemn these atrocities?

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:01.123
I can't think of a real reason.

00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:02.583
Well, let me just put it this way.

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:05.503
I've heard anti-Semitism hypothesized

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.129
as a reason why the U.N.

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:08.673
and the international community

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:11.676
might be so slow to acknowledge this.

00:09:11.842 --> 00:09:14.595
What do you think,

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:15.263
Jake?

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.889
First, I really

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.641
applaud these ordinary work of CNN

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.226
in bringing this to light

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.436
and bringing this before the world.

00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:23.854
You've performed a remarkable service

00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:24.939
in doing that.

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.274
As to your question,

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:27.191
I don't have an answer.

00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:30.069
I don't know why

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:32.029
countries, leaders,

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:33.531
international organizations

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:36.158
were so slow to focus on this,

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:37.618
to bring it to people's attention.

00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:38.828
I'm glad it's finally happened.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:41.831
The atrocities that we saw on October 7th

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.000
are almost beyond human description

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.085
or beyond our capacity to digest.

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:47.837
And we've talked about them before.

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.464
But the sexual violence

00:09:50.464 --> 00:09:53.467
that we saw on October 7th

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:56.554
is beyond anything that

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.180
that I've seen either.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.849
So thank you for doing that.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:00.516
And look,

00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:01.392
I don't have a good answer

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:02.018
to that question.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.769
I think it's a question

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:05.730
that these organizations,

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.691
these countries need to ask themselves.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:09.942
Secretary of State Antony Blinken,

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:10.776
thanks for joining us today.

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:13.529
Appreciate it.

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:13.988
Thanks, Jake.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:14.530
Good to be with you.
