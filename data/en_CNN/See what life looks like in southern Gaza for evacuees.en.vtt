00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.919
Aid groups are warning of
an imminent public health crisis in Gaza

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:05.463
if supplies of water and fuel remain
cut off.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.634
CNN's Thelma Abdul-Aziz has more on
the growing desperation inside Gaza.

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:12.512
And a warning
some images in her report are graphic

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.475
This is what life looks like in places.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:22.439
Israel told families to flee towards
for their safety, where constant

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.985
bombardment has reduced homes to rubble
and wiped out entire families.

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:29.237
The survivors say,

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.905
I lost all my relatives.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:32.949
15 people, this man says.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.160
We were not on the front line or anything.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.995
We were just sitting at home.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.247
What have we done wrong?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.957
The U.N.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:43.209
warns there are no safe places.

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:46.546
About half a million
people fled here to southern Gaza

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:50.759
after an evacuation order
by the Israeli military But families

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:54.345
desperate for refuge
are still trapped in the war zone.

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:58.141
The dead and injured flooding
a health care system on the brink.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.769
Civilians are caught in the crossfire.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:04.564
With the death toll mounting,
just over a quarter of those

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:08.234
killed are children,
according to Palestinian officials.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:10.028
And a

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:13.531
week long siege is strangling the enclave,
the U.N.

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:18.912
says, amid fears food, fuel, water
and medical supplies may soon run out.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.373
Some 2 million
people are crammed into this.

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:25.085
140 square mile territory.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:29.130
Now, many of them pushed into
an even smaller corner of the enclave.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.050
About half the population are children.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.221
There are not enough shelters to house

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.517
the sheer number of civilians
and even those who do find spaces

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:43.645
in overwhelmed schools
turned refugee centers.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.523
It is little comfort
to the youngest victims.

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:48.316
For Shadi Hamid.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:49.984
There is no one to protect us.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:52.987
This little girl says
there's no one to come save us.

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:54.906
How are we supposed to live?

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:57.826
How? Answer me.

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:02.705
Prime Minister

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:08.211
Netanyahu has vowed to annihilate Hamas
after a terror attack by the group left.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.463
1400 killed in Israel.

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:13.466
But with Hamas so deeply embedded within

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:17.137
Gaza's population, rights groups
fear a bloodbath.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:20.473
What we're seeing right now, the direction

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.852
that Israel is going to be is going in.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.646
They have said they want to destroy Hamas,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.441
but their current trajectory
is going to destroy Gaza.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.113
Hamas
does not answer to the people of Gaza.

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:39.492
No elections have been held here
since the group seized power in 2007.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.163
Still, it is these residents
that will pay the price.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.999
And with a potential ground
incursion expected

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:48.835
not cost is unfathomable.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:52.046
Some Abdel Aziz, CNN, London.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.802
Joining me now from Tel Aviv is Jonathan

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.389
Conricus, international spokesperson
for the Israel Defense Forces.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:04.184
Colonel, good to see they can be with us.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.311
Good morning. Thank you for having me.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.145
It's a pleasure, sir.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.981
I wonder if you could just
comment on a report we've just received

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:14.068
from Palestinian sources within Gaza
that there were Israeli airstrikes

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.071
around the Rafah crossing in the south,

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.241
killing at least 28 people.

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:21.075
Also,

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.370
airstrikes in the region of Khan Yunis,
which, as you know, is in the center

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.330
of Gaza.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.750
These are all areas which the Israelis
urge the Palestinians to head towards,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.171
to be out of danger for Israeli operations
that were taking place in the north.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:35.840
What more can you tell us
about those airstrikes in the south?

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:40.803
Yes, the combat operations continue.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:45.225
We continue to hunt Hamas operatives
to attempt to degrade

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:51.481
their military capabilities, whereabouts
locations, tunnels and rocket launchers

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:56.903
and of course, other things that are part
of this war that has been forced upon us.

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:59.948
And I am not aware of any strike
specifically

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.742
in those areas,
but they could have happened.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.828
And anyhow, we continue to operate

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:09.457
and strike Hamas targets
as we have defined before.

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:12.252
And we try to do that
according to the law of armed conflict.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.504
And, of course, to minimize
civilian casualties.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.590
And just as we have
you talked about Rafah,

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.801
what is the situation
there as far as you know,

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.761
with regards to that border crossing?

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:25.515
Actually, being open so that all the
trucks on the Egyptian side of the border,

00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:28.768
trucks filled with humanitarian
assistance, will be allowed into Gaza

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:32.063
because right now the people's lives
are counting on that aid being delivered

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.317
Yes, I know that an attempt.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:39.237
First of all,
I am aware of lots of discussions, report

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:41.906
and quite a lot of conflicting information
about that.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:45.159
And sorry to say,
I don't have clarity myself.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:48.246
The only thing I can say
is that the last attempt that I am

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:51.666
aware of that we were involved
in was three days ago

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:55.753
when there was an attempt to evacuate
foreign nationals, Americans and others,

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.632
which failed
because Hamas refused to open the gate.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:02.969
Other than that,
I don't have any updates on the situation.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:08.182
We understand the complexity and perhaps
there will be news later in the day

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:12.854
about the Rafah and about other issues
pertaining to humanitarian needs.

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:16.065
Confusion in war,
I guess comes with the territory, sir,

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:17.942
but we appreciate
whatever you can do to clarify.

00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:20.445
We've just had the news as well

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:24.615
on on Monday that the US President
Joe Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.744
There is an imminent ground
operation in Gaza.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:30.913
Does the President's visit to Israel,
does that complicate or delay

00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:34.459
that ground incursion in any way?

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:37.545
Not as far as I understand.

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:41.507
And I think what I understand
from public statements,

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:46.721
the statements made by Secretary Blinken,
the president is here to show his support

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:50.725
for Israel and that he stands with Israel,
our right to defend ourselves.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.353
And, of course, any

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:57.106
enhancement of our operations
is part of our right to defend ourselves.

00:05:57.523 --> 00:06:00.693
I think the president also said
that the Hamas

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:04.155
needs to be destroyed,
and that is exactly our military aim.

00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:08.993
We want to dismantle Hamas and make sure
that never again will any terrorist

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:13.539
organization in Gaza have the ability
to perform the atrocities that Hamas did.

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:14.999
On the 7th of October.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.419
With regards to

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.130
the military operations and the exodus

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.883
from the north of Gaza to the south
that we're just talking about months ago,

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:27.553
that did seem fairly clear
message to Hamas

00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:30.807
that a big operation was on its way.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.058
Can you say how long and specifically

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.769
where these operations will take place
in the north around the Gaza City,

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:37.980
and what are the risks facing
those who stayed in that area?

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:40.274
And is there a danger of telegraphing

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:42.318
your punches,
if you like, to Hamas militants?

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:44.070
What's coming down the line?

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:47.990
Yeah, three good questions in one lesson.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:51.702
It is generally not wise for a military

00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:54.664
to be advertising its intentions.

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:58.292
And we are aware of the fact that we have
just advertised our intentions

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:01.546
by telling civilians
in northern Gaza to go south.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.256
Why have we done that?

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.968
Because we want civilians out of fighting
and we don't want them to be killed.

00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:10.888
So there is a balance here
between achieving a military objective

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:14.225
and minimizing civilian damage.

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:18.855
And in this case, which is very evident
and you cannot argue with it.

00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:20.648
We have chosen to

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:23.109
you know,

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.155
that the sanctity of life
and the helping Palestinian civilians

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:31.325
to go south and not be stuck in an area
that there will be significant

00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:32.869
combat activities.

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:36.247
There is a risk
and we will have to mitigate this risk

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:39.584
with the tactics, the weapons and the time

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:42.295
that we use when a knife will operate.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:47.258
And there is tremendous,
you know, desire in Israel

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:50.803
to see Hamas defeated, to see the scourge

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:53.556
and the terror gone from Gaza.

00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:58.978
But Israelis, of course,
also want the IDF to operate it smartly

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:03.149
and in a way that doesn't
expose our troops to undue danger

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:08.571
in an environment that already is among
the most dangerous on any battlefield.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.366
And very quickly, one of the other reasons
why President Biden

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.410
is coming to the region, coming to Israel,

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.497
and the secretary state, Antony
Blinken, has been there is concerned

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:21.125
that this this conflict with Hamas
in Gaza could spread

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:26.464
and erupt into a much bigger
regional confrontation with actors.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.633
For Iran, in particular, warning of,

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:29.258
you know,

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:31.385
if there are any more Palestinian
civilians who are killed,

00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:34.055
if this continues, that
there will be consequences for Israel.

00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:35.264
What's what's your response to that?

00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:39.185
Well, I read it the same way.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:44.190
I mean, I see that President Biden
and Secretary Blinken and many

00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:49.153
American statements are made exactly
in order to prevent a regional escalation.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:54.242
The common denominator
or let's say the reason or the power

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:59.288
that could escalate the Middle East
into regional escalation is Iran.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:00.915
They have their tentacles.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:04.835
They have their proxy organizations around
Israel, Hezbollah in the north, Hamas,

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:09.090
Islamic Jihad in the south,
and lots of proxies in Syria and Iraq.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.635
And if they decide so,
then maybe they would want to

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:16.430
throw more of their properties
towards Israel.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:20.434
That would be unwise and definitely not
something that would serve the interests

00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:22.478
of the people of the region.

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:24.689
Maybe it would serve Iranian interests,
but definitely

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.440
not the people of the region.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.901
And I think that's a very strong message
that the U.S.

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.236
is delivering to Iran.

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.572
If you're thinking about doing it, don't.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:37.159
What we are saying is we are prepared
along our northern border in the south,

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.580
whoever threatens us
and whoever challenges

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.791
our safety and security of our civilians,
we will defend

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:47.712
and we will make sure that they don't
have the ability to do so.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.880
Colonel Corica,
thanks so much for being with us.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.425
We appreciate your time.
Thank you. Good morning.
