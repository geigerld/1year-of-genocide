&gt;&gt;&gt; WE'RE GETTING NEWS IN WHEN  WE TALK ABOUT THE 320 AIRSTRIKES ISRAEL LAUNCHED OVERNIGHT IN  GAZAS,  HOW THEY ARE DEALING WIH PRECISION TARGETING. AND NEWS THAT THERE IS A NEW  WEAPON THAT THEY ARE DEPLOYING. M MADE GELLEN COMMANDO UNIT. AND I WANT TO GET TO NIC  ROBERTSON. THIS IS NEW INFORMATION IN ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY ISRAEL IS DOING. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT THIS WEAPON AND THIS UNIT THAT WE  UNDERSTAND CALLED THE MAGELLAN  COMMANDO UNIT? &gt;&gt; Reporter: YES, A SPECIALIST  UNIT USING A SPECIAL NEW WEAPON. THIS IS A WEAPON THAT ADVANCES  TECHNOLOGICALLY THE OLD  FASHIONED MORE TAB. OLD FASHIONED IS SORT OF A CLOSE INFANTRY TOOL THAT YOU USE IT  CLOSE TO THE FRONTLINE OR A  LITTLE FURTHER BACK, IT FIRES  REALLY HIGH IN THE AIR, GOES  RIGHT UP AND COMES RIGHT DOWN. TYPICALLY IN THE PAST YOU NEED A FORWARD SPOTTER WHO CAN SEE  WHERE IT IS HITTING AND IT TAKES MAYBE THREE ROUNDS FOR A GOOD  MORTAR TEAM TO PUT A ROUND  PRECISELY ON THE TARGET. THIS NEW SYSTEM APPARENTLY DOES  AWAY WITH THAT, IT IS COMPUTER  CONTROLLED, YOU DIAL IN THE  DESIGNATED LOCATION OF THE  TARGET A THIS MORTAR FIRES AND HITS THAT TARGET WITH PINPOINT  ACCURATE. THAT IS WHAT THE IDF IS SAYING. SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN? IT MEANS WHEN THEY SEE A SMALL  JIHAD OR HAMAS UNIT OUT IN THE  FIELD WITH ANTI-TANK UNIT, THEY  CAN PINPOINT THEM PRECISELY AND  HIT THEM QUICKLY AND READILY. WE WEREN'T AWARE OF THIS BEING  OPERATIONAL IN THE REGION, WE'RE USED TO HEARING THE I EXPLOSION  AND ARTILLERY, BUT THIS HAD A  WHOLE NEW SOUND. AND WHEN WE HEARD THIS ONE, WE  WENT FOR COVER BECAUSE IT MADE A HUGE WHOOSH AND WE DIDN'T KNOW  WHAT IT WAS. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE  IDF REALLY HOPES CAN HELP IT  TARGET PRECISELY SMALL GROUPS. &gt;&gt; AND IT IS INTERESTING THAT  YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU CAN BY  AUDIO HEAR THAT IT IS VERY  DIFFERENT, THAT YOUR PHYSICAL  REACTION IS DIFFERENT. VERY SIGNIFICANT. AND OF COURSE IN UKRAINE YOU  HEAR ARTILLERY AND ARE USED TO  ALL OF THE SOUNDS. JUST SOME CONTEXT HERE THOUGH. 320 STRIKES OVERNIGHT. THEY SAID 205 I THINK THE DAY  BEFORE YESTERDAY. SO I'M JUST PUTTING IT OUT HERE  TO MAKE A POINT THAT IS MORE  THAN 500 STRIKES IN ANY GIVEN 48 HOUR PERIOD. AND EVEN THE PALESTINIAN HEALTH  AUTHORITY IS NOT SAYING THAT  THERE IS ANYWHERE NEAR THAT  NUMBER OF DEATHS A DAY. SO I'M MAKING THIS POINT TO MAKE USE OF THE WORLD PRECISION. THAT THEY ARE INCREDIBLY PRECISE AND IT SEEMS LIKE IN SOME CASES  THEY ARE ACTUALLY TARGETED AT  OPERATION COMMAND CENTERS NOT  NECESSARILY INDIVIDUAL HAMAS  OPERATIVES, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU, ERIN. WITH US NOW, EDITOR AND FOREIGN  AFFAIRS COLUMNIST AT BLOOMBERG  BOBBY GOSHE AND ALSO CO-AUTHOR  OF A NEW BOOK COMING OUT, GENIUS OF ISRAEL. THAT YOU THINK BOTH FOR BEING  HERE. -- THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING  I WANT TO BEGIN WITH WHAT WE  HEARD FROM THE KING OF JORDAN. DAN, THIS IS A U.S. ALLY, BUT HE WAS EMPHATIC CHOOSING HIS WORDS  CAREFULLY AND SENDING A MESSAGE. HERE HE WAS. &gt;&gt; THE RELENTLESS BOMBING  CAMPAIGN UNDER WAY AS WE SPEAK  IS CRUEL AND UNCONSCIONABLE ON  EVERY LEVEL. IT IS COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT OF A BESIEGED AND HELPLESS PEOPLE. IT IS A FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF  INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW. IT IS A WAR CRIME. &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR THAT COUPLED WITH  OUR REPORTING THAT THE U.S. IS  URGING ISRAEL TO PAUSE, TO WAIT, TO TRY TO ALLOW MORE TIME TO GET HOSTAGES OUT. AND THE IDF SAYS THERE IS NO  CEASEFIRE, THERE IS NO PAUSE. WHAT IS YOUR READ? &gt;&gt; TWO THINGS GOING ON. WHEN YOU HEAR LEADERS IN THE  REGION MAKING THOSE STATEMENTS,  I THINK THEY ARE CONCERNED  PARTICULARLY KING OF JORDAN WHO  IS WORRIED ABOUT REAL VOLATILITY IN HIS OWN POPULATION IN JORDAN  AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TENSIONS  BETWEEN ISRAEL AND XWGAZA, ISRA  AND HAMAS, COULD HAVE CASCADING  EFFECTS FOR HIS OWN SECURITY AND HIS OWN ARAB WORLD  ARE QUITELY SAYING I HOPE ISRAEL WIPES OUT HAMAS ONCE AND FOR  ALL. SO WHAT THEY SAY PRIVATELY AND  PUBLICLY ARE TWO DIFFERENT  THINGS. &gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS THE COST. HIS WIFE WHO IS PALESTINIAN  REALLY CONCERNED AS WELL ABOUT  THE TREATMENT OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; I THINK THERE ARE LEGITIMATE  CONCERNS ABOUT THE PALESTINIAN  CIVILIANS. THE QUESTION IS WHO IS  RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT, WHO CAN  ULTIMATELY CONTROL THEIR FATE. IS IT ISRAEL OR HAMAS. THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION'S AGENDA IS DIFFERENT. I BELIEVE THAT THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION HAS MINOR MILD  HOPE THAT THEY WILL GET OUT SOME OF THE HOSTAGES PARTICULARLY  HOSTAGES WITH AMERICAN  PASSPORTS. WE SAW TWO RELEASED LAST WEEK. I THINK HAMAS IS PLAYING A VERY  CLEVER GAME WHERE THEY ARE  STARTING TO DRIBBLE OUT  HOSTAGES. I THINK YOU WILL SEE MORE OF  THAT. SO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS  SAYING IF WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT A COUPLE HOUSE DAMAGES HERE AND  THERE, THERE IS A FAMILY I'M  MEETING WITH HERE TODAY WHO HAS  A SON AS A HOSTAGE. SO A LOT OF THE PARENTS ARE  ORGANIZED AS WELL THEY SHOULD BE AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS  SAYING GIVE IT TIME. THIS PUTS ISRAEL IN A REAL  CONUNDRUM BECAUSE THEY CAN WAIT  AND THEY CAN WAIT AND THEY CAN  WAIT A. AT SOME POINT THE CONCERN THAT  WILL UNDERMINE THEIR OWN FUTURE  OPERATION AND IF ALL THAT IS  RELEASED AT THE END OF IT ARE  HOSTAGES EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT  ARE JUST ISRAELI PASSPORTS. &gt;&gt; DAN GETS AT THE COMPLEXITY  HERE WHICH I'VE SPENT A LOT OF  TIME TRYING TO GET MY HEAD  AROUND IT. WHILE I'M CERTAINLY NOT A  FOREIGN POLICY EXPERT, I'VE  COVERED THIS STUFF LONG ENOUGH  TO KNOW THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT  GIVEN HOW MANY CROSS CUTTING  VARIABLES. YOU TALK ABOUT LEADERS IN THE  REGION WHO SAY SOMETHING  PUBLICLY FOR EFFECT AND SAYING  U.S. WANTS HOSTAGES OUT BUT ALSO MOVING IN SIGNIFICANT FORCE  POSTURE INCREASES FOR DETERRENCE PURPOSES, ALSO POTENTIALLY  GETTING DRAWN INTO SOMETHING  BIGGER. WHILE ALSO TRYING TO HUG ISRAEL  AND ITS LEADERS WHO THEY KNOW  WILL EVENTUALLY LAUNCH A GROUND  INCURSION. HOW DOES THIS ALL MOVE FORWARD  IN THE WEEKS AHEAD GIVEN WHAT  DAN IS TALKING ABOUT, THE  HOSTAGES WHERE ISRAELIS ARE,  GROUND INCURSION, ALL THESE  ELEMENTS? &gt;&gt; IT WILL MOVE FORWARD VERY,  VERY SLOWLY UNTIL THE GROUND  OFFENSIVE TAKES PLACE AND THEN  IT MOVES VERY QUICKLY. SO THAT IS THE NATURE OF THESE  THINGS HAPPEN SLOWLY UNTIL THEY  SUDDENLY HAPPEN VERY, VERY  QUICKLY. THE TRIGGERING EVENT NOW WILL BE THE GROUND INVASION. UNTIL THEN, THERE WILL BE ALL  THE DIPLOMACY GOING AROUND IT,  THERE WILL BE MORE DEPENDING ON  HOW LONG THE SORT OF --  DEPENDINGING ON HOW MUCH TIME  ISRAEL TAKES TO LAUNCH THE  GROUND OFFENSIVE. I IMAGINE THERE WILL BE MORE  GATHERINGS OF REGIONAL LEADERS. S SECRETARY BLINKEN WILL BE ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME TO TRY TO HERD ALL THE CATS TOGETHER. THERE WILL BE A LOT OF  NEGOTIATIONS BEHIND THE SCENES  FOR THOSE HOSTAGES AND THERE  WILL BE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS  BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND  NETANYAHU. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SAY TRIGGERING, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT DOES IT TRIGGER? THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THE BIG  CONCERN WHEN YOU TALK TO U.S.  OFFICIALS.  &gt;&gt; CALCULATION AS TO WHEN THE  GROUND OFFENSIVE BEGINS WILL BE  MADE BY THE ISRAELIS AND THEY  WILL CONSIDER ALL KINDS OF  FACTORS INCLUDING THE PRESSURE  FROM THE UNITED STATES. BUT AS DAN POINTED OUT, THEY  NEED TO MOVE IN BEFORE TOO LONG. THERE IS A TIME LIMIT ON HOW  MUCH THEY CAN WAIT. THERE IS MOMENTUM. WE KEEP THINKING OF THE PRESSURE THAT IS BEING PUT ON NETANYAHU  FROM THE OUTSIDE. WE'RE NOT PAYING ENOUGH  ATTENTION TO THE PRESSURE FROM  WITHIN, FROM ISRAELIS. AND YOUR CORRESPONDENTS ON THE  GROUND WILL KNOW THIS BETTER --  ERIN AND NIC, THAT ISRAELIS WANT TO SEE SOMETHING DONE. WE'RE NOW TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM  THE HORRIFIC EVENTS THAT BEGAN  THIS CHAIN OF OFFENSES. AND THOSE EVENTS ARE STILL FRESH IN THE MINDS OF ISRAELIS. THEY STILL WANT A RECKONING FOR  WHAT HAPPENED ON THE 7th OF  OCTOBER. THEY STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE  THAT THAT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. THERE IS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON  NETANYAHU TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON  HIS PROMISES, TO GO IN AND  FINISH HAMAS ONCE AND FOR ALL. WE CAN DISCUSS AROUND THIS TABLE WHETHER THAT IS EVEN POSSIBLE,  BUT WE MUST NOT DISCOUNT THE  STRENGTH OF FEELING IN ISRAEL  AND THE IMPACT THAT FEELING HAS  ON NETANYAHU'S DISPOSITION  TOWARDS GAZA. &gt;&gt; THE POINT EARLIER ABOUT WHAT  LEADERS SAY IN PUBLIC AND WHAT  THEY SAY BEHIND CLOSED DOOR,  II  THINK IT IS INTERESTING THAT CNN IS REPORTING THAT THE U.S.  ADMINISTRATION WANTS THEM TO  DELAY THAT INVASION. BUT NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE  HEARD PUBLICLY FROM THE  PRESIDENT EXCEPT FOR WHAT HIS  TEAM SAYS WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING OF HIM SAYING YES TO A QUESTION  OVER THE WEEKEND. DO YOU THINK THERE COMES A POINT WHEN THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE  PRESIDENT SAYS OUT LOUD? &gt;&gt; NO. I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S APPROACH SO FAR HAS BEEN TO GIVE THE  ISRAELI GOVERNMENT AND THE  ISRAELI PEOPLE A BIG BEAR HUG IN PUBLIC, SAY I HAVE YOUR BACK. WHAT HE DID WAS DRAMATIC BY  SHOWING UP AND MEETING WITH THE  CAR CABINETS. BUT FORWARD LEANING AND SORT OF  ATTACHED AT THE HIP MESSAGE  PUBLICLY. AND PRIVATELY CONVEYING HIS  MESSAGES. I DO NOT BELIEVE --  &gt;&gt; EVER? &gt;&gt; I CAN'T SAY EVER. BUT NEAR TERM I DON'T THINK THAT HE WILL PRESSURIZE REALLY  BECAUSE THE DETERRENT EFFECT TH  THAT WOULD WIPE OUT AND THE  MESSAGE IT WOULD SEND TO  HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN WOULD BE  DISASTROUS. &gt;&gt; THANKS, GUYS. APPRECIATE IT.
