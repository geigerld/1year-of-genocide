&gt;&gt;&gt; ISRAEL SAYS THAT HAMAS COULD BE HOLDING AS MANY AS 199  HOSTAGES, AND TAKING CAPTIVE IN  THE TERROR ATTACKS THAT KILLED  AS MANY AS 1,400 PEOPLE.  AND ONE OF THEM IS MIA SCHEM WHO WAS AT THE MUSIC FESTIVAL.  &gt;&gt; AND WE SPOKE TO HER MOTHER  AND BROTHERS ABOUT THE VIDEO  THAT WAS RELEASED OF THEIR  SISTER AND DAUGHTER.  &gt;&gt; THAT IS ALL WE WANT.  JUST TO GET MIA BACK TO US.  &gt;&gt; WE ARE BEGGING THE WORLD TO  BRING MY BABY HOME.  &gt;&gt; WITH US RIGHT NOW IS CNN  NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST PETER  BERGEN ON THIS.  THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.  YOU HAVE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS  IN THE PAST DAYS OF WHAT ARE  REALLY THE AIMS AND GOALS OF  HAMAS.  THE IDF SAYS THAT THIS HOSTAGE  VIDEO BEING RELEASED IS A  PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE ON THE  ISRAELI CIVILIAN, AND WHAT DO  YOU THINK IT IS? &gt;&gt; WELL, THERE'S THAT, AND IT IS ALSO PROOF OF LIFE THAT THE  HOSTAGE HAS BEEN TAKEN, AND  HOSTAGE-TAKING SITUATION, AND  OFTEN THE TERRORIST GROUP WILL  RELEASE A VIDEO, AND OBVIOUSLY,  IT IS VERY, VERY TRAUMATIZING  FOR THE FAMILY, BUT AS YOU KNOW, KATE, YOU HAVE GOT 199 HOSTAGES, AND HAMAS CLAIMS 200 TO 250, AND YOU HAVE PALESTINIAN AND ISLAMIC JIHAD WHO CLAIMED 230 IN  BEGINNING, SO IT IS NOT CLEAR OF HOW MANY HAVE BEEN TAKEN, BUT  THIS IS A PROOF OF LIFE OF ONE  HOSTAGE, AND SO, WE HAVE SEEN  TONY BLINKEN GOING TO QATAR TO  SPEAK TO THE QATARI GOVERNMENT  WHICH IS THE MOST FRUITFUL WAY  THAT THIS MIGHT BE RESOLVED IN  SOME WAY THAT IS, YOU KNOW, TO  HAVE THE SAFE RELEASE OF THE  HOSTAGES.  THEY WERE HELPFUL IN GETTING  FIVE AMERICANS OUT OF IRAN LAST  MONTH, AND SENT HUNDREDS OF  MILLIONS INTO GAZA, AND THEY DO  HAVE RELATIONS WITH HAMAS, AND  THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND THE  MILITARY SITUATION ARE ALL VERY  COMPLICATED, BUT IF THERE IS  GOING TO BE A PEACEFUL SITUATION FOR SOME OF THIS TO THE HOSTAGES THE QATARI GOVERNMENT IS THE  MOST LIKELY VENUE.  &gt;&gt; PETER, IT IS A STAGGERING  NUMBER OF POTENTIAL HOSTAGES  FROM A WIDE RANGE OF COUNTRIES  AND NOT JUST ISRAELI, BUT  COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD.  WHY DO YOU THINK THAT HAMAS DID  IT? ARE THEY GETTING WHAT THEY WANT  OUT OF IT? AND IS THERE THE INTERNATIONAL  OUTRAGE THAT THEY HAD EXPECTED  FROM IT? &gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT THEY ARE GETTING  OUT OF IT IS FIRST OF ALL HUMAN  SHIELDS TO GO BACK TO THE FIRST  GULF WAR.  SADDAM HUSSEIN DID SOMETHING  SIMILAR AND HE GATHERED  LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF HUMAN  SHIELDS TO HAVE AN ATTACK  AGAINST HIM.  AND THIS IS CLOSE TO THE SCALE  OF 200 HOSTAGES IT SEEMS.  AND SO, A, KIND OF DISWADING ANY KIND OF ISRAELI MILITARY ACTION, AND OBVIOUSLY A DEAL DOWN ROAD,  AND HAMAS HAS NOTHING TO SHOW  FOR THE CONFLICT IN TERMS OF ANY REAL POLITICAL GOAL.  IF THEY CAN GET SOME PRISONERS  BACK, OBVIOUSLY, THAT IS  SOMETHING THEY WANT.  MAYBE THAT IS THE INTENTION IN  THE BEGINNING OF THIS, AND  OBVIOUSLY THE OPERATION BECAME  BIGGER AND THEY KILLED MORE  PEOPLE THAN INITIALLY WAS THE  PLAN.  AND IS IT GETTING THE  INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION, AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES, AND 30  NATIONALITIES OF VARIOUS KINDS,  AND THIS SEEMS TO BE A GREAT  DEAL OF CONCERN AROUND THE  WORLD, INCLUDING FROM THE UNITED STATES ABOUT THESE HOSTAGES, AND HOPEFULLY THERE CAN BE A SUCCESS RESOLUTION STARTING WITH THE  CHILDREN AND THE ELDERLY AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK.  SEE IFHEHEY CAN BE RELEASED  FIRST.  &gt;&gt; PETER, ISRAEL HAS SAID THAT  AT LEAST, YOU KNOW, THE PUBLIC  STATEMENT IS THAT THEY ARE NOT  GOING TO BE NEGOTIATING AROUND  WITH REGARD TO THE HOSTAGES.  YOU KNOW, ISRAELI LEADERS  POINTED TO THIS IS WHERE THE  LEADERSHIP OF HAMAS HAS COME  FROM THE HOSTAGES IN THE PAST  WHICH IS WHAT YOU ARE LAYING  OUT, WHAT IS THE BEST SCENARIO  THEN? &gt;&gt; WELL, I DON'T KNOW.  LOOK, I MEAN, FOR THIS IS A HUGE DILEMMA FOR GOVERNMENTS.  THE STATED POSITION FOR THE  UNITED STATES IS THAT WE WILL  MAKE NO CONCESSION TO TERRORIST  GROUPS, AND WELL, IN PRACTICE,  WE WILL MAKE CONCESSIONS AND WE  WILL DO PRISONER EXCHANGES, AND  WITH THE GOVERNMENTS THAT WE  DON'T RECOGNIZE LIKE IRAN, AND  WE WILL DO PRISONER EXCHANGES  WITH TERRORIST GROUPS LIKE THE  TALIBAN AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE  PAST, AND ISRAEL HAS A LONG  RECORD OF DOING PRISONER  EXCHANGES, AND THE POLITICS  AROUND THIS RIGHT NOW MAY  PREVENT THEM FROM DOING ANYTHING AT ALL AND HAVING ANY  COMMUNICATIONS WITH HAMAS.  AND THIS COULD GO ON FOR MONTHS. THE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS, AND YOU LOOK AT THE ATTACK IN MOSUL  WITH ISIS AND IT TOOK MANY, MANY MONTHS AND ALMOST A YEAR OF  PLANNING WITH THE U.S. AIR FORCE AND THE SPECIAL FORCES ADVISING  ON THE GROUND TO EXTIPATE THE  FORCES FROM MOSUL, AND
