00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.401
Breaking news we're following right now.

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:03.336
The Pentagon now says U.S.

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:05.605
forces have carried out an airstrike

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:06.773
against a weapons

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:09.776
facility in Syria linked to

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.878
various groups backed by Iran.

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:13.813
CNN's Jeremy Diamond is joining us

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.281
from Tel Aviv, Israel, right now.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:16.216
He's got the latest.

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:19.119
What are you learning, Jeremy?

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:19.886
Yeah, that's right, Wolf.

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:21.221
Two U.S.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.790
F-15 striking a weapons

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.626
storage facility in eastern Syria.

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:27.794
This was just confirmed,

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.429
confirmed by the U.S.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.430
Department of Defense.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.197
This happened

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.532
in response to attacks

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.167
carried out by Iranian proxies

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.301
in the region against U.S.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.404
personnel in Iraq and Syria.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:38.805
We have watched over

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:39.939
the last several weeks

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.608
as Iranian proxies

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.843
have ramped up their attacks on U.S.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:46.846
personnel and bases in Iraq and Syria.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:50.050
Since October 17, 40 times,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.951
those bases have been attacked

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.586
by those Iranian proxies,

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:54.654
leaving multiple U.S.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:55.388
service members

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.157
with traumatic brain injuries

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.258
and other injuries

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.593
that the military characterize as minor.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.762
But this is just an ongoing saga

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:03.563
in the potential

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.031
for a greater escalation here

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:06.766
as Iran has employed its proxies

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.169
to attack not only Israel, but also U.S.

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:10.336
interests in the region.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.272
Earlier today, in fact,

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.107
the Houthi rebels in Yemen,

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.475
who are also allied

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:19.145
with Iran, took down an unmanned U.S.

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:20.613
aerial drone,

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.083
which is another significant move

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.351
in this story as we watch to see

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.019
whether or not

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:26.653
this conflict

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.754
between Israel and Hamas

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.255
could potentially escalate

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.523
into a broader regional war,

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:31.191
which the U.S.

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.559
is very much trying to avoid.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.593
Yes, certainly is,

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:34.761
But it's a very serious

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:35.562
development indeed.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:36.596
We're also getting

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:37.097
and I

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.331
know you're doing a lot of reporting

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:38.865
on this,

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.233
a new look inside

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.801
Israel's ground offensive

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:43.236
that's ongoing in Gaza.

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.705
What are you learning?

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:46.372
That's right, Wolf.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:47.974
We went into Gaza on Saturday

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:50.410
with the Israel Defense Forces and today

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.511
several other journalists,

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.345
including Reuters,

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.880
getting an opportunity to go inside.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.082
These are very tightly controlled visits,

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:56.783
very limited

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.518
window, and military censors

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:00.153
do review footage.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.454
But we are getting a picture

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.323
in this case of northern Gaza

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.525
and some of Israel's military operations.

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:06.860
This is all happening

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.661
as Israeli forces are moving now

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.196
into the heart of Gaza City,

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.464
according to Israel's

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.032
minister of defense.

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:13.967
For several days

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:14.701
now, we've been hearing that

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.202
they've been encircling Gaza City

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.203
and now they are saying that

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.571
they are firmly operating

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.807
within that city, a Hamas stronghold.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:21.141
Of course,

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.142
it's very difficult for us

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.810
to independently verify

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.945
those accounts by the Israeli military.

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:27.046
But all of this is happening

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:29.849
as senior Israeli officials

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.318
are making very clear, Wolf, that

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:35.188
the tunnel system that remains below Gaza

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:37.056
remains a tremendous challenge

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.391
for Israeli forces.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:39.592
And tonight,

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.261
the Israel Defense Forces confirming that

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:45.064
they have taken out 130 tunnel systems

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:47.667
since this war began.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:48.635
But, of course, they acknowledge

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.737
that many, many more still remains.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.672
Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.340
in Gaza, Wolf, remains dire.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.175
We are watching

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:55.909
as hospitals

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.210
are running out of medical supplies,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.011
running out of fuels

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.712
to carry out their operations.

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:00.246
And the U.N.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.948
secretary general is warning

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:03.516
that the way Israel is carrying out

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.018
its military operation,

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.753
saying that there is clearly something

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:07.754
wrong there Wolf.

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:08.488
Jeremy Diamond

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:09.756
reporting from Tel Aviv, Israel,

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:11.024
thank you very much.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:11.724
I want to get some more

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.626
now on the crisis in Gaza

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.195
as countless Palestinians

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.963
flee the Israeli bombardment

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.164
in the northern Strip

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.466
for an uncertain future in the south.

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:21.334
CNN's Salma

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.870
Abdelaziz has a closer look at their

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.539
harrowing journey.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.775
Taking only what they can carry.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:32.245
Families are fleeing Gaza City.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:33.913
They wave white flags

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:37.250
made of anything they can find.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.952
And as the sounds of war

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:40.153
echo around them,

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:41.754
they signal yet again

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:44.958
that they are innocents.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.459
And now we're supposed

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.560
to be in the safe area.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.996
But you can hear the bombs behind us,

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:52.398
he says. All of our houses are gone.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.499
Nothing is left.

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.802
How much more can

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:56.970
the Israeli military

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.404
has been calling for weeks

00:03:58.404 --> 00:03:59.405
on all those living

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.007
in the northern part of the strip

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:02.775
to move southwards?

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:05.178
Most recently opening what it called

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:06.412
safe corridors

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.748
for limited windows of time.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.383
Pushing thousands here

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.151
to Salahadin Street,

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.853
where evacuees describe

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:15.822
a harrowing journey.

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:18.458
So we saw along the road destruction

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.325
dead bodies

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:20.927
everywhere in the Israeli

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.096
tanks with demand to search the youth.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.030
She says.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.466
We saw one young man stripped naked.

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:30.803
We witnessed unbearable scenes.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.438
The only way to reach the route

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.274
is by foot or by cart.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:38.611
For those who can find room.

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:39.679
There was heavy shelling

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:40.480
on our neighborhood

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.148
and we were forced to flee.

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:43.750
We have to use these donkey carts

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.918
because there's no fuel, he says.

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:48.421
They cut everything off to force us

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:49.956
out of our homes.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:50.523
Israeli

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:53.526
troops are now in the heart of Gaza City

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.395
as Israel's defense minister

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:58.031
apparently declared the entire city,

00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.799
the whole of the Enclave's

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.001
largest population center

00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:03.870
a legitimate target.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.738
Azar Gaza is the biggest terror

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:08.207
stronghold that mankind has ever built.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.342
This whole city is one

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:11.577
big terror base underground.

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:12.879
They have kilometers of tunnels

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.715
connecting to hospitals and schools.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:16.249
The U.N.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.252
calls this exodus forcible displacement

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:20.119
and accuses

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:21.988
Israel of the collective punishment

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.924
of some 2 million people.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:25.458
And these

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:28.461
routes can be dangerous and deadly.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:30.129
This was Salahadin Street

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.898
just a few weeks ago.

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:34.500
CNN geolocated and authenticated

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.401
these videos

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:37.403
showing the aftermath of explosions

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:39.072
that killed evacuees.

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:43.776
You can see luggage among the bodies.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:44.877
And many fear

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:46.112
they will never be allowed

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:47.847
to return home.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.015
Some here say

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.250
this is reminiscent of the Nakba,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.118
the Arabic term

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:53.052
for the expulsion

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:54.287
of Palestinians

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.154
from their towns

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:57.623
during the founding of Israel.

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.158
We walked a very long way.

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:02.562
It felt like the Nakba of 2023, she says.

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:03.463
We walked by dead

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:05.131
people who were ripped to shreds.

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:06.499
Children were very tired

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:07.700
because there was no water.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.001
People were dying

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:12.004
and there were elderly who couldn't walk.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.307
And for those who do make it.

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:15.775
Bombardment and siege

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:16.943
await them in the south.

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:18.811
To what do I do?

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:21.013
There is no true escape.

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:22.148
Because ultimately I'm here.

00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:23.149
Because I'm at the table.

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:24.484
And thanks to see it in Salma

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:26.319
Abdul Aziz for that report.
