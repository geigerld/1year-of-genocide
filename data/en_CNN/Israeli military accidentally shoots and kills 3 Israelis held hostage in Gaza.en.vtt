00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:00.600
The IDF

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.034
saying that

00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.635
it mistakenly killed three

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:04.637
Israeli hostages in Gaza.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:05.238
An IDF

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:06.206
spokesman says

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:07.941
the victims were misidentified

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.010
as a threat and shot dead.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.777
CNN's Jeremy

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.212
Diamond is in direct

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.146
Israel with more on

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.681
this tragic development.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.016
Jeremy, what more is the IDF

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.118
saying about this

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.088
Yeah, it's very sad news.

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:22.622
And the Israeli

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:23.757
military is admitting

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:24.991
that soldiers

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.060
effectively mistakenly identified

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.162
these three Israeli hostages

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:29.896
as a threat

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:30.463
and shot

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.297
and killed them

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:32.999
during combat operations

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:34.801
being conducted in Israel,

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.803
which has been the scene of very heavy

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.071
fighting between Israel.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.172
And Hamas

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.974
over the course of the last week

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.876
or two of the three hostages

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.110
have been identified.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.146
One of the families of the hostage

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.981
of one of the deceased hostages

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:48.448
asked that

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.050
their name not be broadcast,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.284
but the two who we can tell

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:52.886
you are Yotam Hayyim,

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:53.520
who was kidnaped

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.722
from Kibbutz Kfar AZA on October 7th.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.124
And the second is Summer Talca

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:00.360
who was kidnaped from Kibbutz Nir,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.562
also on October 7th.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.464
The Israeli military

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.533
effectively recovered these bodies

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:08.201
in Gaza,

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.669
move them to Israel,

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.071
where they were taken to a

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.072
forensic center

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.873
and then subsequently

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.575
positively identified

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.610
as the bodies of three hostages

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.511
who have been

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.146
who were kidnaped by Hamas

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.514
on October 7th.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.349
Now, we should note amid all of this,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.384
that this comes

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.718
as the Israeli military

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.854
had loosened its rules of engagement

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.355
as it began

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.391
this war in Gaza

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.359
following those October 7th attacks,

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.495
allowing Israeli soldiers to fire upon

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:38.631
suspected terrorists with while

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.133
conducting fewer checks

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.835
than they normally would have.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.670
The Israeli military, we're told,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.572
is taking lessons from this incident

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.107
and transmitting them to soldiers

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:47.774
in the field.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.109
They also say that they, quote,

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.443
expressed their deep remorse

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:51.744
over the tragic incident

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:52.712
and send the families

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:54.781
their heartfelt condolences.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.483
This also comes as we know

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.084
that some of those former hostages

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:58.885
who were freed

00:01:58.885 --> 00:01:59.953
as part of that weeklong

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.387
truce between Israel and Hamas,

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:02.655
they angrily confronted

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.390
the Israeli prime minister last week

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.192
with one of those former hostages

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.861
accusing the Israeli government

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.629
of having no information

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.663
and no intelligence

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:11.664
about the whereabouts

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:12.732
of these hostages,

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.934
noting that the location

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.069
where she was being kept

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.937
by Hamas was actually shelled

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.205
by the Israeli military.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:19.973
And today,

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.242
we are learning of a far more tragic

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.376
and direct incident

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:24.711
where Israeli forces appear

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.546
to have fired upon

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:28.281
Israeli hostages in Gaza,

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.849
believing that they were a threat,

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:30.650
and then ultimately

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.551
realizing later

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:32.452
after the fact

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:34.454
that they were indeed hostages

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:35.588
forced them.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:36.089
Jeremy

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.023
you mentioned the

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:38.658
loosened rules of engagement.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:39.692
Obviously, U.S.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.094
National Security Adviser Jake

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.729
Sullivan is in the Middle East right now.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.365
He's expressed the Biden administration's

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.200
concern about the intensity

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.701
of the IDF offensive.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:49.102
Of course,

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.403
President Biden's desire

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:52.305
for Israel to tone it down.

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.606
How do you think this news

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.675
is going to play into

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.443
the tone of these talks?

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.349
Well, we'll have to wait and see.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.218
I mean, hostage negotiations

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.020
are one of the key elements

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.555
of Jake Sullivan's visit in meetings

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:09.589
with Israeli officials.

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.024
But as you noted,

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.592
one of the other focuses

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.827
is indeed the civilian casualty count.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:15.795
I mean, we have watched

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:16.563
there's now nearly

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.331
19,000 Palestinians

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:19.699
have been killed in Gaza.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.967
Some of those combatants,

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:23.269
many of those noncombatants, including

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.738
over 7000 children

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.240
who are believed to be among

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.474
those who have been killed in Gaza,

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:29.976
according to the Palestinian

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.077
Ministry of Health.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.179
And Jake Sullivan said earlier today

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.813
that he believes

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:35.215
Israel intends

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:35.882
to distinguish

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.184
between Hamas targets and civilians,

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:39.719
but that that intention

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.853
does not always line up

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:42.655
with the reality on the ground.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:44.457
And that reality,

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:45.458
that mismatch

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:46.326
has really up

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.460
until now mostly

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.362
applied to Palestine and civilians.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:50.530
But in this case,

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.064
it appears

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.866
to also be matching up to a reality

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.101
that has now affected

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:55.902
and resulted

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.437
in the loss of life of three

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:59.005
Israeli civilians.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.174
Who were held hostage by Hamas

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.642
and unfortunately today

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:03.910
killed by Israeli forces.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:05.845
All right, Jeremy Diamond,

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:08.147
thank you so much.

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:10.049
And joining us now is IDF spokesperson,

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.418
Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus.

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:14.721
Jonathan, how did this happen?

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.623
What can you tell us

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:21.361
Yes, good evening.

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:22.095
It's ninth here

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:22.862
in Israel

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.164
and a very sad and tragic event,

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.033
one that the IDF, of course,

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:28.067
terribly regrets

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:30.236
and has told that to the families.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:33.172
We are investigating how it happened.

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:34.707
One of the contributing

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:37.277
factors are obviously related to the fact

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.811
or can obviously be related

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:39.412
to the fact

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:40.847
that so far

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:42.115
what we have encountered

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.182
on the battlefield

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.617
are many Hamas

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.953
combatants that have been dressed

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.821
in civilian clothes.

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:49.889
And I'm quite sure

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.091
that that has been part of

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:52.959
the issue here.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.161
But it's still very early to understand

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:57.463
and to say certain things.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:58.898
And what we can say

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:01.501
and confirm is what we have issued.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.303
Obviously, a very sad event.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.672
Tragic event, of course, goes

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:06.739
against everything that

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:08.107
what we have been trying to do

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:10.310
for the last two months,

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.277
more than two months.

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:13.680
It's day 70 of the fighting.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.215
But even sad events like this

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:18.151
will not shake our resolve.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.520
And it will not divert us from the focus,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.555
which is clear to dismantle families

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:28.194
and save lives.

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:30.563
Sir, you broke up there at the end.

00:05:30.563 --> 00:05:31.564
But I'm curious

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:33.333
because you mentioned that

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.301
the IDF is still trying to get details

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:37.470
on exactly what transpired

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.038
in a statement from the IDF.

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:40.707
It says that immediate lessons

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.275
from the event have been learned,

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:43.343
which have been passed on

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.645
to all IDF troops in the field.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:48.181
Can you share what those lessons were,

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:48.981
if there's going to be

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:51.084
a different approach by the IDF now

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:57.890
looking into how it happened,

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.192
how it came about,

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:02.729
that these hostages were out

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.597
and trying to understand

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:05.998
how that happened,

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.701
whether it was intentional or by Hamas

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:11.170
or whether it wasn't intentional.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.472
And what we have told

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:16.175
our troops is to exercise caution

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.412
when being confronted with

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:21.447
people in civilian clothes.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:22.382
Again,

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.883
part of the complexity here

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:24.183
is that

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:26.552
we're fighting in a civilian environment

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:30.957
where almost all of the RPG crews and the

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:33.126
groups that have

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:34.327
attacking our tanks

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:35.928
and our troops have been dressed

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.430
in civilian clothes.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.167
And so it creates a very dynamic and

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:43.136
challenging combat environment.

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:44.070
And what we have told

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.873
our troops is to be extra vigilant

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.110
and do one more safety check before

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:54.380
dealing with kinetics with any threat

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.915
that they face on the battlefield.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.750
But it is a very challenging environment

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.585
that our troops are.

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:01.554
Just a follow up on what you said.

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:03.122
You said these hostages were out.

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:04.791
Can you just expand on that a little bit?

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.659
What do you mean by that?

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:09.028
Just the circumstances around this.

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:10.430
And as we just heard

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.198
our Jeremy Diamond talk about the fact

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:13.599
that the rules of engagement

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:14.400
have been loosened

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.469
since the October 7th attack.

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:17.804
Do you think that could have played

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:18.404
a role

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:19.806
in the killings of these

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:21.541
three Israeli hostages?

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:26.612
I don't know what the

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:27.947
Jeremy base is that on.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:31.851
And I am not aware of any different rules

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:32.618
of engagement.

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:33.786
Our rules of engagement

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:35.021
are those of a military

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:37.590
at war against the terrorist organization

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:40.426
that use the civilian infrastructure,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.595
use the schools and hospitals

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:44.163
and mosques and ambulances

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:45.531
and all the things that we have seen

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.833
and you have reported

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.568
on during the last two months.

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:49.602
And so I am not aware

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:50.369
that we have changed

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:51.671
any of our rules of engagement.

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:52.271
There are according

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:53.606
to the laws of conflict

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:54.440
and according

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.709
to our standard practice in war.

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.411
And we will have to look into

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.980
and analyze exactly what happened

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.482
and what I can say so far

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.251
is that these the three Israelis,

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.088
former hostages, they were above ground

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:10.289
into the air

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:12.592
in close proximity to air

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:15.094
one of our units in the area

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:17.797
and then were misidentified

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.967
as posing a threat and therefore

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:24.704
Israeli troops followed the fortunate.
