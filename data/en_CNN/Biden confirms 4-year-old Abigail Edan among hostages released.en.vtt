00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.127
A little girl named Abigail

00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:04.212
turned four years old.

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:06.840
She spent her birthday that birthday,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.341
at least 50 days

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.969
before that held hostage by Hamas.

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.013
Today, she's free.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:13.430
And Jill

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.639
and I, together,

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.684
as so many Americans, are praying for

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.394
the fact that she is going to be

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:20.770
all right.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.855
You know, she's free

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.857
and she's in Israel now.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:29.112
And so those who are now wrapping Abigail

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:30.655
in loving care,

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.949
the supportive services she needs.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.827
She's been through a terrible trauma.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:36.077
You know,

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.288
her mom was killed in front of her

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:38.747
when it

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:39.581
when a kibbutz

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.833
was attacked by Hamas terrorists

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.626
on October 7th.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.837
Abigail ran to her dad there,

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.213
who then was gunned

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.215
down, gunned down as well,

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.925
while using his body

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:52.969
to shield little Abigail.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.430
She then ran to a neighbor for help

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.223
where they were all taken hostage.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.559
That entire house and neighbors

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.644
were taken hostage by Hamas

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:04.105
and held for 50 days.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:06.775
What she endured is unthinkable.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.610
Abigail was among 13 hostages

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.737
released today from Gaza.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.239
Under that brokered and sustained,

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.492
though intensive U.S. diplomacy.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.702
She's now safely in Israel

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:18.953
and we continue to press

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:20.497
and expect four additional Americans

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:22.207
will be released as well.

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:23.708
We will not stop working

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:25.627
until every hostage is returned

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:27.253
to their loved ones.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:27.837
As I said

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:30.340
when I spoke about this deal on Friday,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.591
this has been the product

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.634
of a lot of hard work

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.511
and weeks of personal engagement

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.429
for me and my team.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.764
We have been in close contact

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.015
with the leaders of Qatar,

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:40.517
Egypt and Israel,

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.977
speaking with each one of them repeatedly

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:44.771
over the past few weeks

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.231
to help secure this deal.

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:47.816
We spoke again yesterday

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.275
with the emir of Qatar.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.527
I owe special

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:52.487
thanks to in order to keep the hostages

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:53.738
release on track

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:54.906
and push for Abigail

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:56.616
to be part of this release.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.243
And I'll be speaking again shortly

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:00.578
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:01.579
And we will continue

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.665
to remain personally engaged,

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:04.958
personally engaged to see that

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:05.500
this deal

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.001
is fully implemented

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.921
and work to extend the deal as well.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:10.839
For weeks,

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.173
I've been advocating a pause

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:13.424
in the fighting

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:14.300
for two purposes

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.135
to increase

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:15.969
the assistance,

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.847
get into Gaza civilians who need help

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:21.850
and to facilitate release of hostages.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.685
We know that innocent children

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:26.187
in Gaza are suffering greatly as well

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.397
because this war

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:28.606
that Hamas has unleashed

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:31.192
is so has such consequences.

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:32.527
Thousands have been killed

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:33.820
and from the earliest days

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.113
of this crisis.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:35.864
I've worked closely

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.866
with President Sisi of Egypt,

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:38.825
the Israeli government,

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.077
and King Abdullah of Jordan, and leaders

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:42.579
throughout the region to expand

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.079
the delivery

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.039
of critical humanitarian assistance

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.584
to help innocent Palestinians in need.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.503
We're not part of Hamas under this deal.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:51.921
The fighting in Gaza

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:54.507
has now been paused for three days.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.800
Over that time,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.094
58 hostages have been released,

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.304
including two Thai,

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.556
Filipino and Russian nationals.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:04.225
Dozens of families have been reunited.

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:05.560
And we worked urgently,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.271
urgently to take advantage of the pause

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:11.191
to surge aid into Gaza.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:11.691
We've moved

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:12.817
approximately 200

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:15.028
aid trucks into Gaza each day,

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.362
loaded with food,

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:19.365
water, medicine, fuel and cooking gas.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:20.825
More is needed.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:22.160
But this deal is delivering

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.162
life saving results.

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.289
Critically needed aid is going in

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.583
and hostages are coming out

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:29.709
and they're still structured

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.461
so that it can be extended

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.713
to keep building on these results.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:34.464
That's my goal.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.132
That's our goal to keep this pause

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.634
going beyond tomorrow

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:38.509
so that we can continue

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:39.636
to see more hostages

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:40.386
come out

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:42.222
and surge more humanitarian relief

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.514
into into those.

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:45.683
And who in need in Gaza.

00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:46.893
We've seen

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.186
this is a day by day

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.938
approach, hour by hour process.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:51.731
Nothing is guaranteed

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.150
and nothing is being taken for granted.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.736
But the proof that this is working

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.529
and worth pursuing further

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.156
is in every smile

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:01.407
and every grateful tears

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:02.450
we see

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.035
on the faces of those families

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.078
who are finally getting

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.955
back together again.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:09.207
The proof is little Abigail.

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:12.293
More than 20 other children, 18 years

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:14.003
and younger, have been released.

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:14.754
They've been released

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.631
through this deal as well.

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:18.883
They've endured a terrible ordeal.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:19.801
They can now begin

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.011
the long journey toward healing.

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.304
I'm going to continue working

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.973
with the emir of Qatar,

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.474
President Sisi, Egypt,

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:28.351
Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel,

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.478
to do everything possible

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.730
to see the hostages are freed.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.232
All the hostages.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.776
I'm grateful for the personal partnership

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.111
as we pursued this deal

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.446
from each of those men I just mentioned.

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:43.241
As we work together to see the and see

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.033
all this implement

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:46.911
and now to try to extend it further.

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:49.080
I continue working with all our partners

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.123
to take the hard

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.124
but necessary steps

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.959
to build an integrated

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:53.918
and more prosperous

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:55.962
and more peaceful future in the region.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.589
A two state solution is the only way

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:59.799
to guarantee

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.176
the long term security of both Israelis

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:04.053
and Palestinian people,

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:04.846
to make sure

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.848
Israel and Palestinians alike

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.099
live in equal measure

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.809
of freedom and dignity.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.227
We will not give up on working

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.729
toward that goal.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.439
Thank you very much.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.358
Thank God she's home.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:18.151
I just can't

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.446
imagine the enjoyment in it.

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.365
I just wish I were there to hold her.

00:05:24.365 --> 00:05:25.033
Mr. President.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:25.783
Do you have an update

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:26.784
on the other Americans

00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:28.119
who are being held in any sense

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.913
as to when they would be released?

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:32.749
We are hopeful,

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.585
but I don't have anything firmly

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.837
to tell you at this moment.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:38.921
So do you expect that

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:40.882
if you are able to use this momentum

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:42.508
to extend the pause,

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:44.302
have you extracted any guarantees

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.846
about proof of life for other hostages,

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.097
or do you have an expectation

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:51.100
of how much longer you can push this?

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:53.686
Well, look, you know, the deal calls for

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:54.729
for every

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:55.772
for every ten hostages

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.940
released to extend another day.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.109
So I'm hopeful this is not the end

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:01.694
that's going to continue.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:04.197
But we don't know. And

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.409
but I get a sense that

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.620
all the players in the region,

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.913
even the neighbors who aren't

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:13.623
and we have been directly involved

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.417
now are looking for a way to end this.

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:18.461
So the hostages are all released.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:24.717
And Hamas is just completely,

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.052
how can I say

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.136
no longer in control

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:28.513
of any portion of Gaza?

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:29.472
Do they have control

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.723
of all of the hostages?

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:31.015
Are there

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:32.475
still other militant groups

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.102
that you have to deal with?

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.353
We think there are probably other

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.897
militant groups. We're not certain.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:38.689
Mr. President, Mr.

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:41.109
President, how is Abigail doing?

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:43.069
What's her physical condition?

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.571
Well, I haven't gotten that information.

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:48.241
I just want to let you know immediately

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:51.285
they were going to cross into Egypt.

00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:52.161
As you recall,

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:53.621
that was a group

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:56.958
about an older, non-American,

00:06:57.041 --> 00:07:00.461
elderly, elderly woman is very sick

00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:02.088
who was in need of immediate

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.381
medical help.

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:04.757
So they arranged to cross

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:05.967
directly into Israel

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:08.052
to be able to take her to a hospital.

00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:11.013
All I know is that she was being held.

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:11.764
I don't know.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.099
I haven't seen a photograph.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:13.808
I've just been

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.685
in communication with my team.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:19.105
But she is safely ensconced in Israel.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.857
But there's a lot more work to be done.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:21.774
How many days would you like

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:24.026
to see the hospital on board?

00:07:24.068 --> 00:07:25.987
I would like to see

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:33.286
us move to a point where we were able to.

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.121
Well, let me put it this way.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.581
I'd like to see the pause go on.

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:40.460
As long as prisoners kept coming out.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:40.877
All right.

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.170
Thank you all so very much.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.837
I know.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:45.339
You know, we have to call you.

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:45.965
I know

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:46.466
you say why

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.091
she called me

00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:49.844
with only 10 minutes or so and

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:50.678
I said, that's No.

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:53.264
Two sided because we didn't know.

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.223
I didn't want to be having

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:55.558
this press conference

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.185
if they weren't physically

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:57.852
even when they were

00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.729
in the Red Cross ambulance.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:00.521
I didn't want to do it

00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:02.064
because they were not out there.

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:03.941
They were still in Gaza.

00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:06.402
So I don't thank you enough

00:08:06.402 --> 00:08:07.820
and thanks for your patience.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.656
And I know we're here.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.866
All right.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:12.992
All right.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.911
So I was doing okay.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.162
Happy hour as you guys.
