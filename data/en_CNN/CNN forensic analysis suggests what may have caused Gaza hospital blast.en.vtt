00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.069
I'm Anderson Cooper, live in Tel Aviv.

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:06.272
Tonight,
a new CNN forensic analysis confirms that

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:10.076
the deadly blast at the hospital complex
in Gaza did not come from Israel.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.112
Joining me now is Jeremy Diamond in
Ashkelon.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.815
So, Jeremy, what do you know

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.618
Well, Anderson, our investigations

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:23.123
team has conducted a really thorough
analysis using dozens of videos

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:27.861
taken from social media,
but also live broadcast and footage

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:32.232
filmed by a freelance journalist
working for CNN inside the Gaza Strip.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.234
In addition
to that, their satellite imagery.

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:37.203
And they also spoke
with several explosives

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:42.776
and other military experts
who analyze these very images

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:47.447
and CNN's analysis
effectively suggests that this blast

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:52.185
at this hospital inside the Gaza
Strip was caused by a rocket launched

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:56.589
from Gaza, a rocket
that appears to have broken up midair.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:01:00.360
And then at least part of that rocket
fell down on that parking lot

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.630
outside the hospital,
causing the explosion

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.200
that has killed
hundreds of people over there.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.005
Now, these weapons and explosives
that explosives experts who CNN spoke

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:16.476
with, they all agree
that this is the most likely scenario.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:20.547
Now, at the same time, a definitive
conclusion on this simply can't be reached

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:24.717
without recovering physical evidence
from the site, which is very difficult

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:28.388
given the limited access
that journalists have to the Gaza Strip

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:32.459
and also the fact that that territory
is indeed controlled by Hamas.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:36.129
Now, I want to take you through two key
moments here, because one of them is from

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:39.265
this live broadcast
that was being broadcast on Al Jazeera,

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.968
where you can see the rockets
that were being fired.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.771
Around the same time
as this blast occurred,

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.974
one of those rockets
appears to burn out in the sky

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:51.544
before crashing into the area
where the hospital is.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:55.215
The second piece of evidence,
Anderson, is the crater and this is a key

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:59.119
piece of evidence that the Israeli Defense
Forces have also pointed to as

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.256
they tried to make the initial claim
that this was not them,

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:07.560
that this was caused by a rocket fired
by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:12.332
The crater that was caused by this
explosion was three by three feet wide,

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:13.933
about one foot deep.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:18.338
And all of the experts that CNN spoke
to agreed that this is not consistent

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:19.539
with the kind of crater

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.575
that you would see from a bomb
that would be dropped from an aircraft.

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:25.845
And they also said
that it is not consistent with any kind of

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:29.115
artillery fire on that kind of a position.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.986
Now, all of this doesn't change
the fact that Palestinian officials

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:36.356
continue to insist
that Israel is responsible for the strike.

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:41.628
Israel, of course, denies that and has
pointed to this very same rocket scenario.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:45.532
What it also doesn't change is the anger,
the eruption of anger

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:50.670
that this hospital blast has caused
in the Arab world, in the Middle East.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:55.508
We have watched these protests
over the last couple of days at U.S.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:58.211
embassies, at Israeli embassies
in the region.

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.414
And ultimately,
you know, the majority of these this

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:04.751
this hospital blast has really become
quite a touch point, Anderson.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:05.618
And I don't think

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:09.956
that that is going to change
despite this latest analysis, Anderson.
