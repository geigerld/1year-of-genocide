00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.900
I want to go to

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.435
Jeremy Diamond is standing by in

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:03.570
Jaffa in Israel.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.938
Our CNN military analyst

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:05.839
Cedric Layton,

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.640
and our global affairs

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.109
correspondent, Matthew Chance.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.377
Jeremy, let me go to you first,

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.444
because we do have

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.913
the statement from the IDF.

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.482
basically saying they

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.750
they are responsible.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.584
They carried out

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.587
what they called a targeted strike.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.321
they will look

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:24.324
they were attacking, I think,

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.593
a number,

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:27.594
well, part of me

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:28.728
talking to strike in Beirut

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:29.763
on a commander,

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:30.230
part of me

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.131
of commander responsible

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.633
for the murder of the children in my some

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:34.667
it says at the moment

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.503
there are no changes in the homefront.

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.271
Command defensive guidelines.

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:41.274
What does that mean, Jeremy?

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:43.710
Well, effectively, the home

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.444
front guidelines

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.546
or the guidelines issued to civilians

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.415
in Israel to tell them effectively

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:48.982
what the risk

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.618
level is at this moment in terms of,

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:54.254
military action, it's to tell them

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.122
whether to cancel large gatherings,

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:57.991
to not go to school.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:58.892
to be

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.627
within reach of a bomb shelter

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.628
at all times.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:02.429
And in this case,

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.097
the Israeli military has decided

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.398
not to make any changes

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.233
to those guidelines, which indicates,

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.535
at least for the moment,

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:09.636
that they don't anticipate

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:11.471
that this will immediately escalate

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.273
any further than it already has.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.607
But make no mistake,

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.276
that possibility is certainly

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:17.343
in the air tonight.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:19.879
As we have seen, this very significant

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:20.814
Israeli strike

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.549
hit the southern suburbs

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.385
of the Lebanese capital, Deir,

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.287
which is notable in and of itself

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.354
for the location

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.990
given its proximity to Beirut.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.325
But also in addition to that,

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.693
it is the fact that they are targeting

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:36.529
a senior commander in that area.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:37.764
they say that this commander,

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:38.832
who they have not named in

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:39.532
this statement,

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:40.767
was responsible

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.168
for this rocket attack

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:44.204
that killed 12 children,

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:46.873
in the, Israel, controlled,

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:47.640
Golan Heights

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.476
in the Syrian Druze community

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.077
of marginal Shams.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:52.946
It has been clear since this weekend

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.814
when that rocket attack took place,

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:56.216
when we saw the number

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.350
of civilians killed,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.119
the fact that these were all children

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.453
who were killed as well,

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:01.488
it became immediately

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.655
clear that there was

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.958
a possibility of escalation.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.327
And since then, we have heard

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.229
clear statements from Israeli officials

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.263
vowing that there would be

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:11.564
a severe response,

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:12.799
vowing that Hezbollah

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.267
would have a price to pay,

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:15.435
even as Hezbollah,

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.170
of course, denied responsibility

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.404
for this attack.

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.173
and so now we have finally seen

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:20.907
what shape

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:22.342
that response has taken

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.010
as the Israeli military,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.912
in just the last couple of hours,

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:27.213
carried out this strike

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.149
and then very quickly confirmed it,

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.450
making clear that they wanted

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.784
to send a message

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:33.052
that, as the Israeli defense

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.187
minister says tonight,

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:35.088
a red line

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:36.523
was crossed by Hezbollah

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:38.424
in this rocket attack over the weekend.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.960
And an Israeli response was narrative.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.195
Thanks very much, Jeremy Diamond.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:43.897
Let's go to Cedric Layton,

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:44.898
who is with us?

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:45.398
And Cedric,

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:46.332
I think it's fair to say

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:49.469
that many were expecting a response.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.571
all expecting some sort of retaliation

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.806
for the Golan Heights attack.

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.241
What do you make of what we are learning?

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:55.608
This sound?

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.877
The IDF saying it was a targeted strike.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:00.647
yes.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:01.247
I think

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.616
that is really the key thing here.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.885
And if it turns out to be true

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.388
that this was a drone strike

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:09.856
instead of a strike

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.391
with a manned aircraft,

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:12.692
that also goes to show

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.726
that the Israelis

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:16.696
were looking for a very precise action,

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.198
they wanted to do this

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.466
with a minimum of collateral damage

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:23.503
and that, you think commensurate

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:24.571
with some of the pressure

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:27.173
that the Israelis have probably received,

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:28.374
from the US as well

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.243
as other Western nations,

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:32.378
to minimize civilian casualties

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:33.780
in any type of,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.248
response that they would make.

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:36.950
I think everybody expected them

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.851
to make this kind of a,

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:39.352
an effort,

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:40.987
this kind of a response in response

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:42.989
to what happened in Marshall Trump.

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.824
but the other thing that

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:45.959
they had to consider

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.760
was the fact that they needed

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.362
to also minimize

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.798
the possibility of civilian casualties.

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:52.098
Yeah.

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:52.398
Look,

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:54.334
this is a very dangerous moment, right?

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.368
This is not a war zone.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:56.369
This is happening as we showed

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:58.538
our viewers streets of Beirut.

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:00.006
And that is absolutely terrifying.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:01.107
We've heard in the last few minutes

00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:02.742
from the Lebanese state media

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.310
that the strike was conducted

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.778
by road, by the dirt,

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:07.513
by drone that fired three missiles.

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:08.781
If we played the video

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:10.350
that we played at the top of the show,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.051
my producers play that out.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.553
From what we see in this video,

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:14.654
once we play it out.

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:15.088
Cedric,

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.322
I wonder whether you could tell us

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:17.156
in terms of

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.024
of the impact

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:19.492
we're hearing one casualty here.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:20.793
What more can you

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.762
can you dissect from from the video

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.130
that we have seen so far,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.998
the images here we go

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:25.865
to playing right now.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.101
Right.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.602
So when you look at

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.704
the destruction in this street,

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:33.106
this is commensurate

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:36.109
with a fairly low powered explosive.

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:36.976
you know, something

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:37.810
that on the order of

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.813
perhaps the 250 pound bomb or less,

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.982
I and I say more or less

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:44.484
with emphasis in the case,

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:45.952
because it would be far

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.021
greater destruction to the buildings

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.356
if a standard form

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:51.991
I would be used

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:52.659
would have been used

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.527
in this particular case.

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:57.030
And so, you see, you know, some of the

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.697
you know, obviously

00:04:57.697 --> 00:04:58.931
there's building debris

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.800
middle of the street there,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.935
some windows appear to be a appear

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:04.470
to have blown out,

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.473
and there does seem to be,

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:08.207
you know, a case

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:08.975
where they looked

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.210
at a very specific location

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.745
within a building,

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.580
to go after a very specific

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.015
individual target.

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.116
So that's what it looks like

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.318
to me at the present time.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:18.751
And I see

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:21.287
these are live pictures right now.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:23.923
and it does seem as if they're basically

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:24.190
in there

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.358
mopping up operation,

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:26.926
but they don't expect,

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:29.529
any secondary or tertiary attacks

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:30.830
after this one.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.164
At least

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.299
that's what it looks like right now.

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:34.667
So do stay with us.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.302
Let me go to our Matthew, Chance

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:36.803
and Matthew.

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:39.706
We look at we are in unknown territory.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:40.139
Yes.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.508
Israel's claim responsibility as we heard

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:43.843
from our Jeremy Diamond there.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:44.711
But Hezbollah had said

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:45.845
previously, Matthew,

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:46.979
that would meet escalation

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.581
with escalation. Right.

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.982
speak to the significance

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:51.017
of this moment of the fear,

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:51.384
of course,

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:52.485
that this could widen

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:54.487
out the wider conflict.

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.388
Yeah, it's

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:58.257
I think I think the question here is,

00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:01.327
is this the start of a broader

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:04.397
Israeli campaign in southern Lebanon,

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:07.033
or will it provoke a broader campaign

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.267
in southern Lebanon?

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:09.402
Or is it just,

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:11.504
you know, a very limited action,

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:14.107
that was undertaken in response

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:15.708
to those dreadful killings

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:17.377
in Mashal Shams in the in

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.045
the Golan Heights at the weekend

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:19.846
in which

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:22.849
those 12 children, teenagers as well,

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:24.917
were, were killed

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.252
and, and, you know,

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:28.588
the whole region is on a knife edge

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:31.157
trying to grapple with that question.

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:32.492
I can certainly tell you,

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:34.127
and I've been up to northern Israel

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:35.061
several times

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.697
since the October 7th attacks.

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:39.165
There's a great deal

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.600
of political pressure

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.735
inside northern Israel, inside Israel

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.370
and in northern Israel, particularly

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.805
to strike at Hezbollah,

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:47.874
to push that that group back

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:49.642
from the northern border of Israel,

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:50.777
it's under northern

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:52.044
Israel is under constant,

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:52.945
not just a constant

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.647
threat of missile attack,

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:56.315
but actually under constant missile

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:57.884
attack as well.

00:06:57.884 --> 00:07:00.119
and it's led to whole communities

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:01.354
being evacuated.

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:02.388
They're not able to go back

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:03.489
into their homes.

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:07.059
That fright, fearful that what happened

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:08.828
in, in, you know, from Gaza

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:09.962
in southern Israel

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.831
could happen to them

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.266
in northern Israel as well.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:13.566
So there's

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:15.568
enormous amount of political pressure

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:16.969
the government of Benjamin

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.938
Netanyahu is feeling

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.573
to strike at Hezbollah.

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:23.576
But that has to be balanced with the fact

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.145
that Israel is exhausted.

00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:28.247
It is already engaged in a bitter

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:30.082
conflict in the south of the country,

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:31.284
inside Gaza,

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.652
and just doesn't

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.720
have the energy potentially,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.488
it might have the means,

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:36.689
but doesn't actually have the energy

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:37.256
and the political

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:39.592
will to go full on into Lebanon

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:40.460
right now,

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.627
not whether it escalates

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:42.261
into something else.

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:43.396
It has a momentum of its own.

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:44.197
We will see.

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:45.431
But that is the

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:47.867
the issue we're confronted with tonight.

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:48.401
Yeah, indeed.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:49.202
The concern is

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:50.336
how does

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:52.104
Hezbollah retaliate

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:54.707
if it indeed does retaliate to this?

00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:56.309
as we have seen tit for tat before,

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.510
let me go to Ben

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.513
Wedeman, who is in Beirut for us.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.981
Ben, just give us a sense

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:02.982
of what you are learning.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.150
We're looking at these images

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.451
out of Beirut.

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.420
Streets are part of an ambulance.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.021
We've seen some of the first scenes.

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.890
What are you learning?

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.891
from authorities

00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:13.192
there and importantly,

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:14.627
about casualties at this stage.

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:18.698
Well, this strike happened

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:19.398
just before

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:22.368
8:00 in the evening, local time.

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:23.169
this is a time

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.438
when the streets are crowded

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:26.172
with people

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.074
and the neighborhood where it happened.

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:28.674
Tarek.

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:29.976
And in southern part

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:30.776
of Beirut

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:33.613
is a very crowded, populous neighborhood.

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:34.981
Now, that is where

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.016
many of Hezbollah's leaders

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.117
operate out of.

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:39.285
But that's also where

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:42.288
hundreds of thousands of civilians,

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:43.656
live as well.

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:44.891
Now we're

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.893
hearing from the National News Agency,

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:48.561
the official Lebanese news agency,

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:51.030
that at least one woman was killed

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.732
and several others injured.

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.400
There are reports in the local media

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.101
that,

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:56.736
hospitals in the area

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:59.272
are calling for donations,

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:01.908
of blood as well.

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:02.408
also,

00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:02.975
I'm hearing

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:04.343
that people are lining up,

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:06.145
queuing up at petrol stations

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:07.580
to fill because,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.782
this is an event that,

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:11.417
although it comes in a surprise

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:13.119
in terms of the time and the place,

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:14.120
the fact that it happened

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.588
was no surprise at all,

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:17.823
because it was widely expected

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:18.591
that there would be

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:19.926
some sort of Israeli

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:21.527
response to the attack

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:22.728
on the champs

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:24.163
in the Israeli occupied

00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:26.532
Syrian Golan Heights that left 12,

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:28.534
people dead.

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:29.669
but, the other day,

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:31.671
I was speaking with the

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.339
foreign minister of Lebanon,

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:33.973
who told me

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:36.108
that they, the Lebanese government

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:37.443
had received

00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:40.446
assurances through diplomatic channels,

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:43.182
that Beirut, the Beirut airport

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:44.016
and specifically

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:46.519
the southern suburbs of Beirut

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:47.753
would not be struck.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:50.122
And that was their interpreter

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:51.691
of those assurances.

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:53.893
So clearly, those assurances,

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:54.493
don't amount

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:57.196
in much to much at this point.

00:09:57.196 --> 00:09:58.931
Now, we know that, Secretary

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:00.199
General of Hezbollah,

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:01.968
Hassan Nasrallah, has said

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:02.969
time and time again

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:05.037
that striking Beirut

00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:07.139
is crossing a red line.

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:09.408
However, on the 2nd of January of this

00:10:09.408 --> 00:10:10.543
year, Israel

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:11.777
did launch a strike

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.946
that killed a senior Hamas leader,

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:17.817
also roughly in that area, as well.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.385
So we'll have to simply wait

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:20.920
and see how Hezbollah

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.121
is going to respond.

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:24.357
But I know that organization well,

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:25.324
they are not

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:27.593
going to go quietly into the night.

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:30.596
There will be some sort of response,

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.731
from Hezbollah.

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:34.266
They have said they will meet escalation

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:35.267
with escalation.
