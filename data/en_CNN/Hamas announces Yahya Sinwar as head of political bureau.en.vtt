00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.967
Hamas, as in

00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.702
the last few moments, announced

00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:04.771
that Yaya Sinwar will replace

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:05.872
Ismail Haniya

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:08.308
as the group's political leader.

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.342
Sinwar, of course,

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.911
is the group's leader in Gaza.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.315
The change comes after Haniya was killed,

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.418
if you remember, last week in Tehran.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:19.586
We'll have more on that.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.287
But this news just coming in on Hamas

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:22.622
announcing Sinwar

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:25.592
as the head of the political bureau

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:26.960
in the meantime

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.228
and staying in the region, U.S.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.596
officials tell CNN Iran

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:30.430
and its proxies

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.365
are beginning preparations

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.501
for retaliatory attack against Israel.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:35.468
The entire Middle East

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:36.770
has been on edge for days.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.604
In fact,

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.172
after a series of assassinations

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.473
blamed on Israel,

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.409
including the deaths of senior Hamas

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.410
and Hezbollah

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.711
figures, two officials say

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.146
fears are higher right now

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.314
about a major response from Hezbollah

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.183
rather than Iran.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:51.751
Today, Hezbollah leader Hassan

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.420
Nasrallah, using the vowed

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.355
his group will act whether alone

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.490
or with regional allies.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.992
Hezbollah has already declared

00:00:58.992 --> 00:00:59.759
a new face,

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:00.126
what it calls

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:01.227
a new phase in its months

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.530
long cross-border conflict with Israel.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.963
Today,

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:04.798
it says it fired

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:05.865
a swarm of drones

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.268
at Israeli military targets

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:09.903
and a Hezbollah rocket

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:10.770
barrage triggered

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.572
fires near Kiryat Shmona

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.574
in northern Israel,

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.142
adding to the tensions.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:16.476
The U.S.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:17.444
military is blaming

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:18.611
Iran backed militias

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.946
for a suspected rocket

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:22.348
attack on this airbase in Iraq,

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:25.051
calling it a dangerous escalation.

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.086
Seven U.S.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.121
service members were injured.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.956
Let's get more on all these threads.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:30.857
And Natasha Bertrand

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:31.691
is following developments

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:32.992
for us from the Pentagon.

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.227
So, Natasha, we've heard

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:35.562
Iran say they will respond.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.730
The question now is when and how.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.965
What are you hearing from U.S.

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.400
sources and U.S.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.402
officials as to what retaliation

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.504
that retaliation may look like right now?

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:45.939
Well, U.S.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.640
officials don't seem to know

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.175
exactly what that's going to look like.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:49.809
And that's in part

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:50.877
because they don't know

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.545
if Iran even knows at this point

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.580
what they're going to do,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.848
but they are more concerned

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:55.949
now, we're told

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:56.950
about what Hezbollah

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.451
is going to do about than

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.053
what Iran is planning.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.287
We're told that in recent

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.089
days, the fears have escalated

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.990
about the idea

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.726
that Hezbollah could actually act alone

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:08.294
and not be coordinated

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.463
with Tehran in its response.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.598
And of course, Hezbollah

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:12.665
is just right there

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.467
on Israel's northern border.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:15.768
And so this could be something

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:16.603
very significant

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:17.670
that we see from Hezbollah.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.473
Or, you know, it could result that

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.241
all the diplomacy

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.442
that we're seeing in the background

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.110
could result in all sides

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.612
kind of de-escalating tensions.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.213
It does not seem necessarily like that

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.715
is what is going to happen at this point.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:28.982
U.S.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.216
officials are bracing

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.685
for some kind of retaliatory action,

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:33.520
but they're trying

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.555
to essentially temper it

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:36.789
and try to make sure

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:37.790
that any kind of action

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.125
will not result, of course,

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.894
in a large number of civilian casualties,

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.829
that it will be more largely symbolic

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.830
and allow either

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.697
Tehran or Hezbollah

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:47.000
or both to kind of save face,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.400
you know, in

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.801
light of these Israeli strikes

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.470
in both Beirut and Tehran.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.005
And so we know from U.S.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.506
officials that both Iran

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.240
and Hezbollah

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.807
have been making

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.009
some kind of preparations

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.077
for some kind of attack on Israel.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.179
But again, you know, U.S.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.280
officials have declined to say

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.015
what exactly that looks like.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.484
I will note, however, that before

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.019
the attack, the Iranian attack

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.987
against Israel in April, U.S.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.455
officials saw very, very clear

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.724
signs of very large movements by Iran,

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.126
including the movement of,

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.727
for example, major

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.095
missile launchers and things

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:17.764
like that into position

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:19.399
to prepare for a major attack.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.300
They're not necessarily

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.901
seeing those kinds of huge signs

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:23.870
at this point, forecasting something

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.171
potentially as significant

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.406
as a massive missile barrage

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.807
like we saw a few months ago.

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:28.875
But of course, they're

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.843
basically preparing for the worst here

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:31.678
and engaging in this

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:32.745
very frenetic diplomacy

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:33.646
behind the scenes

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:35.415
to try to ease tensions even further.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.083
So we'll have to see if that works.

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.117
Natasha, appreciate it.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:39.419
Thank you very much.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:39.786
Let's talk

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.487
more about the growing threat

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.856
of a wider war in the Middle East.

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.091
Joining me now is Colin Clarke,

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.693
director of policy and research

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:48.461
at the Suzanne Group, a well known face.

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.329
He on the show.

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.196
Colin, great to see you.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.030
Just some breaking news

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.165
that we've had in the last few minutes.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.233
I'm not sure if you quoted.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:53.866
We've now heard

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.868
that Hamas has issued a statement

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.870
announcing that its leader in Gaza,

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.873
Yahya Sinwar, will replace Ismail Haniya,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.109
of course, who was assassinated

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.711
in Tehran last week

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.980
as the head of its political bureau.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.781
What do you make of this announcement?

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.851
Thanks for having me.

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:12.952
I think the announcement

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:14.220
could be quite significant.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.722
And it's really interesting

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:16.322
because you now

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:19.392
see Hamas potentially attempting to,

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:20.793
bring closer

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:21.894
the political bureau

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.162
and the military wing

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.631
by having a military leader

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:25.798
like Sinwar

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:27.000
kind of dual hatted,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.735
functioning in both roles.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.370
It certainly points to a victory

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.739
for the hardliners within Hamas.

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:34.140
Some of the other names

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.776
that have been mentioned, Khalid Meshaal,

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.011
has some,

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:40.913
issues and it's his relationship,

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:43.383
with some of the, you know, kind of Hamas

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:44.884
adjacent countries in the region,

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:46.419
including the Syrians and the Iranians.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.554
And so this was likely,

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:50.523
a move to empower,

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:52.525
the more hardline militants in the group.

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:53.626
It could also have

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:54.994
reverberations into the West

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.996
Bank as well.

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:57.130
Yeah.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.364
I was gonna say this doesn't bode

00:04:58.364 --> 00:04:59.666
well because, of course,

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:00.933
Ismail Haniya

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:03.403
was part of the negotiations.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:05.104
We so thought as part of the,

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:05.772
the wing,

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:06.739
the political side,

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:08.941
the political bureau of Hamas.

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:10.576
And of course, Israel

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:12.912
has publicly accused Sinwar

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:14.314
of being the mastermind

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.248
right behind

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:16.949
the terror attack

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.584
against Israel on October 7th.

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:21.587
So it begs the question of where does

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:22.622
where does this leave

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:24.324
any sort of ceasefire,

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.059
any hostage negotiations?

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:30.229
Now with, Yahya Sinwar as the head of the

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.531
political bureau of Hamas?

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:33.900
Well, I think what it

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.401
does first and foremost

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:36.936
is it complicates

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:39.138
today, after we hear a lot of discussions

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:41.407
about the day after and how,

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:42.241
the Israelis haven't

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.376
really been planning for that.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:44.777
They haven't strategized

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:45.845
for the day after.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.680
A lot of that is because of,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.282
the role of Benjamin Netanyahu

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:50.917
and his far right allies.

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:52.151
They refuse to kind of think

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:54.554
about any kind of Gaza governance.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.889
This really, really complicates that,

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.192
because let's say the war was to start

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.093
this week

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:02.362
and Sinwar was not captured, killed.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.730
He'd be the individual,

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.732
you know, representing Hamas there.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:06.933
And there's no way

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:08.301
the Israelis are going to do business

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.268
with Sinwar

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:10.803
in any kind of post

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:13.139
conflict governance in Gaza.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.574
Yeah. Stay with us, Colin.

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.042
I want to go to our Jeremy

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.610
Diamond, who's in Haifa

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.112
for this breaking news.

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:19.812
And, Jeremy,

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:21.714
just as we bring our viewers

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:23.216
up to date on this breaking news,

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.051
the Hamas announcing Shinhwa

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.386
as the head of the political bureau,

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.987
what has been the reaction

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:29.355
from Israel to this?

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.426
well, we haven't gotten any

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:34.260
reaction yet,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.595
but but this I can tell you

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:37.196
what the reaction will be.

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:38.965
And that is to say that

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:39.632
he sinwar

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:42.301
taking over as Hamas's political leader,

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:43.870
first of all, increasingly blurs

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.104
the lines between Hamas,

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:46.239
his military wing,

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.640
and its political wing.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.842
Yahya Sinwar was viewed as very much

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:51.911
the bridge between those two wings.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.012
And in addition to that,

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:54.547
he is also viewed

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:55.948
as responsible

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:58.651
for the October 7th massacre.

00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:01.387
the in the same way that Mohammad Deif

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:03.122
was the leader of the military wing.

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:04.090
There is a belief,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.191
a strong belief,

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:06.359
that Yahya Sinwar

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:08.127
would have been intimately involved

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:09.395
if not in the planning,

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.830
then certainly in the decision

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.065
making about choosing to carry out

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:14.500
such an attack.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.069
And, what this also does is

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.038
it makes very clear that he has sinwar

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:21.941
despite more than ten months of war,

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.444
is clearly alive, clearly,

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.246
still very influential within Hamas

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:27.880
to the point

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.249
that he is able to actually seize power

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.651
here in the wake of Ismail

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:33.286
Haniyeh assassination.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.620
And what that will do

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.155
beyond what I've already mentioned,

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:39.258
is also clearly show that the hardliners

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:42.261
within Hamas are clearly being empowered.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:43.663
Ismail Haniyeh,

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:46.132
was viewed in many

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.568
ways as a more pragmatic voice

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:50.336
within Hamas, as a voice

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:52.038
who was pushing for a cease fire,

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:52.705
who was willing

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:54.407
to make certain concessions

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:56.042
at the negotiating table.

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:56.943
And yet here Sinwar,

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:57.944
who has been consulted

00:07:57.944 --> 00:07:59.612
at every step in the cease fire

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:01.614
negotiations, was very much viewed

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:04.617
as carrying the more hardline position.

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:07.220
and so that obviously is

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.021
I think it's pretty clear what that means

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.122
for the future of cease

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:11.090
fire negotiations,

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.258
for how much more difficult

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:14.293
it may be to actually achieve

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:15.428
a cease fire.

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:16.429
And obviously,

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:18.664
this will have tremendous implications.

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.199
in, in Gaza itself,

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:21.100
where we know that

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.335
the lack of a cease fire

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.537
is impacting Gazans, civilians

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:26.372
more than anyone else, perhaps.

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:26.672
Yeah.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:27.273
And

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:28.574
and I assume that

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:31.744
Yahya Sinwar is in hiding in Gaza.

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:33.045
Do we know what role

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:35.748
he has played in these negotiations?

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:36.082
Well,

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:38.050
of course, when he was still alive,

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.086
do we know how prominent

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:40.920
his viewpoint,

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.588
how influential he's been in

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:44.056
these negotiations journey?

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:47.159
It's been critical

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.561
that every single juncture,

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:51.197
because Hamas's political leadership

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.432
outside of Gaza knew

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:55.801
that he could not implement a cease fire.

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.203
He could not stop the fighting

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.338
without the agreement of,

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:00.840
Hamas leaders in Gaza,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.708
which effectively gave Sinwar

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:03.609
a veto over

00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:04.677
every decision

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:05.478
that has been made

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:08.147
at the negotiating table so far.

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:10.383
but now he is in power even further,

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.717
because we're not just talking about

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:12.151
a veto,

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.686
we're talking about actual decision

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:16.022
making power and authority.

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:17.590
And what other thing that we should note

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.091
is that Sinwar, as

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:20.326
he has been consulted

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:21.661
at every critical juncture

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:23.496
that sometimes led to delays

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:24.830
in those negotiated options

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.132
because of the fact

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:27.533
that Sinwar is believed

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:29.702
to be hiding in tunnels under Gaza,

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:32.004
most likely under Communist.

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:32.905
it was taking

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:33.873
it could take as little

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:34.974
as our sometimes,

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:35.908
but oftentimes

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:38.044
it would take days for the messages

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:39.245
to go from Doha

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.413
or Cairo,

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:41.747
from the mediating,

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.382
from the negotiating table

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:44.350
into Gaza

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.651
to actually reach Sinwar

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:46.786
in a covert manner

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:47.820
without the Israelis

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.622
discovering where he was hiding.

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:51.190
And then for those messages,

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.192
to reach back to the negotiating

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:54.093
table thereafter.

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:56.262
And so that is going to be clearly,

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.663
another,

00:09:57.663 --> 00:09:59.999
factor in the potential future

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:00.967
of those talks.

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:02.568
But we should note that for now,

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:05.538
these negotiations are effectively dead

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:06.539
for the time being,

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:08.140
at least in the short term,

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.542
following the assassination

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:10.576
of Ismail Haniya.

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:13.079
There has been no progress towards,

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:14.480
another ceasefire deal.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.115
And instead, what we are talking about,

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:17.283
particularly where I am

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.751
now in northern Israel,

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:19.885
is this possibility,

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:21.354
very real possibility

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:23.356
of an Iranian attack against Israel

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:24.256
in retaliation

00:10:24.256 --> 00:10:26.459
for the assassination of Ismail Haniya,

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.827
as well as potentially attacks

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:28.661
from Hezbollah,

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:31.497
which is just about 30km north of here

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:32.365
in Lebanon.

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:33.699
Jeremy, I appreciate it.

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:34.934
Thank you very much for coming

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:35.968
up for this breaking news.
