00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.967
Despite increasing

00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.536
calls for a cease fire in Gaza, 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.471
remains defiant

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.539
against those calls until Hamas

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.009
releases all hostages.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.342
U.S.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:10.210
Secretary of State

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.611
Antony Blinken echoed

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:12.979
the rejection, saying

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.881
it would only give Hamas more ti

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.350
to regroup and attack Israel aga

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.352
But he did reiterate today

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.520
on a surprise visit

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.388
in Baghdad

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.023
that he is still pursuing

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.858
a humanitarian pause.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:25.291
Blinken,

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.726
that is the queen of

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:29.262
Jordan, says a stance against a 

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:30.964
fire is ill advised

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.033
and will not bring peace to the 

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.000
CNN's

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.568
Becky Anderson is in Doha,

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.670
Qatar, and spoke with Queen Rani

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.773
earlier today.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.509
Fred, we've seen consistent

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.710
and united calls

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.911
for a cease fire

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:45.979
across this region,

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.948
including from Jordan's Queen Ra

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.652
Israelis flatly rejected those c

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:54.387
And when Arab leaders met

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.390
with Antony Blinken in Amman on 

00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:59.993
the US secretary of state reaffi

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:00.827
the U.S.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:01.761
position

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:02.662
that a ceasefire

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:04.230
will only enable Hamas

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.999
to commit more attacks

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.635
like the one on October the seve

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:09.202
Well, Queen

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:10.236
Rania said

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.939
that position was short sighted

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.676
if you manage to eliminate all o

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:18.211
What next?

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.246
The root cause of this conflict

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.182
is an illegal occupation.

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:24.918
It is routine human rights abuse

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:29.055
illegal settlements, a disregard

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.057
resolutions and international la

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:34.461
If we do not address these root 

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.030
then you can kill the combatants

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.364
but you cannot kill the cause.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.101
She went on to say that

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.702
the death of civilians

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:44.070
will only further

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.605
the cause of Hamas

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:48.208
and not bring peace to Israel.

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.442
But Israel has insisted

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.844
that it is doing its best

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:51.578
to protect

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.847
civilians and blames Hamas

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.982
for using them as human shields.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:57.550
Queen Rania cited

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.852
how Israel has used

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:00.587
its evacuation orders on

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:03.256
why she doesn't think that those

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.492
stand up. Have a listen.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.994
Never mind that the evacuation o

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:12.332
or sent on on online or or on te

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.734
knowing that there is no electri

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:15.368
in Gaza for those

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:16.870
since the beginning of this war,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.571
these evacuation orders,

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:19.472
I do not believe

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.507
are for the benefit

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:22.375
of the Gaza civilians.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.977
They are not the target audience

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.145
The rest of the world is.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.212
It is Israel's

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.414
attempt to try to legitimize

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:29.149
their actions.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.583
And when it comes to human shiel

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:31.985
I think we need to defer

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.653
to international law.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:34.320
Of course,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.557
the use of human shields is crim

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.192
even if one side use

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:41.161
it puts a civilian in harm's way

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.296
that civilian is still entitled

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:44.731
to full protection

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.933
under international humanitarian

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.102
That is the global standard.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.770
And no nation is exempt

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.238
in a place like Jabalya,

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:54.174
which is one of the most crowded

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.441
corners of Gaza.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.910
Gaza being one of the most dense

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.045
populated spots on Earth.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:03.016
Civilian death is not incidental

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.050
It is not accidental.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.785
It is a foregone conclusion.

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:08.388
And that makes it a war crime.

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:10.590
Jabalya is the refugee camp

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:13.226
in Gaza where civilians

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:14.928
have been sheltering in U.N.

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:15.528
schools.

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.863
It's been hit on

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.198
multiple occasions,

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.266
including this weekend.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.402
And at the end of the conversati

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:22.602
Queen

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.137
Rania had a really

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.205
poignant message

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.640
for those standing behind Israel

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:28.308
She said that

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:30.577
if you are an ally to Israel,

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:31.978
you need to give them

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:33.546
the uncomfortable truth,

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:34.447
that they

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:35.848
have crossed the line

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:38.251
that is, Queen Rania is position

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.020
And it really speaks to the frus

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:42.255
that you hear

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.790
across this part of the world,

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.058
the Arab world

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.093
that we have been reporting on n

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.529
for weeks Fred.

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:50.463
Becky Anderson,

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:51.798
thank you so much, in Doha.
