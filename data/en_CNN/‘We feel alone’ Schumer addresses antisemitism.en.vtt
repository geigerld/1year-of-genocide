00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040
&gt;&gt;&gt; In the weeks since the October 7th&nbsp;
attacks in Israel killing thousands Israelis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:18.240
including women, children, and doing so with some&nbsp;
barbaric way, we have seen a rise of anti-semitism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.360
around the world, particularly here in the U.S.&nbsp;
Jew hate, senate minority leader chuck Schumer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.600
just addressed this crisis in a&nbsp;
powerful speech on the senate floor.&nbsp;

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:40.520
&gt;&gt; I have noticed the significant disparity&nbsp;
between how jewish people regard the rise of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:49.680
anti-semitism and how many of my non-jewish&nbsp;
friends regard it. To us, the jewish people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:59.013
the rise of anti-semitism is a crisis. A&nbsp;
five-alarm fire that must be extinguished.

00:00:59.013 --> 00:00:59.026
[12:09:10 PM]

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:03.200
extinguished. For so many other people&nbsp;
of good will, it is merely a problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:12.400
a matter of concern. After October 7th, jewish&nbsp;
Americans are feeling singled out, targeted and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:21.800
isolated. In many ways, we feel alone.
&gt;&gt; Melanie zanona joins me from capitol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:29.120
hill. It's so interesting to hear somebody&nbsp;
like chuck Schumer say what he just said and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.640
really take up the mantle to speak for Jews&nbsp;
in America in a way that we don't always hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:46.240
jewish leaders, even chuck Schumer.
&gt;&gt; It is personal. He's the highest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.360
ranking jewish law maker in the country and&nbsp;
she felt compelled to speak out and to draw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:00.920
attention to what he views as a crisis&nbsp;
in the country. He tipped off a number of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.160
[12:10:15 PM]

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.000
He tipped off a number of incidents, and&nbsp;
he also described what it fell like to hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.280
some of his fellow citizens say that&nbsp;
the war was justified in some way. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.960
message that could have been directed a the&nbsp;
some of the members of his own party. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.200
comes as congress has been wrestling&nbsp;
with an aid package. As of right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.240
that package really hinges on whether they can&nbsp;
find bipartisan agreement on a border security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:40.920
provision package. That is the complex issue.&nbsp;
As you know, it's something that is long alluded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.360
Washington for many years. We'll see if they can&nbsp;
get it done. As of right now, they are trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.200
make some progress hoping to get a handshake on&nbsp;
that part of the package. Could see something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.040
on the floor, but it's a high task over here&nbsp;
in congress to get something like that done.
