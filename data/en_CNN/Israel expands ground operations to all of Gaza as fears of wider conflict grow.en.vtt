00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
This morning, we're watching growing threats
of the israel/hamas war spreading to a much

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.110
wider conflict, new overnight, Israeli military
ramping up air strikes after announcing it

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.980
was expanding the ground assault to the entire
gaza strip including in south, where so many

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.140
civilians have fled, the idf say the strikes
destroyed 20 on hamas targets.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.189
&gt;&gt; The U.S. Navy destroyer came to the rescue
of three commercial ships that were attacked

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.669
by iran-backed houthi rebels.

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.660
We're also keeping a close eye on Israel's
northern border with Lebanon, where they've

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.190
been exchanging fire with Hezbollah.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.250
Three israelsosoldiers were hurt by mortar
shells fired from Lebanon.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.440
We have team coverage.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.000
Let's start with CNN's Ben wedeman in Jerusalem.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.130
Expanding it to the entire gaza

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.130
[6:01:42 AM]

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.780
Expanding it to the entire gaza strip over
the weekend, where the civilians who have

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.670
moeftd to the south supposed to go?

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.240
&gt;&gt; Reporter: That I think is a question that
many people in gaza are asking, we know that

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.180
more than 80% of the population of gaza is
already displaced, many have gone to the south,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.079
now the Israelis over social media have put
out a map showing hundreds of individual blocs

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:29.190
that are numbered and on theory people can
go to that map there's a qr code, and nowhere

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.100
is safe and where is not the problem is most
people in gaza don't have electricity to charge

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.400
their phones.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.409
Don't have an internet connection.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.070
Therefore, they're very much really left to
their own devices and of course another problem

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.770
is, already the shelters, the schools that
have been converted into shelters in gaza

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.960
are already crammed with people, as many as
400 to 500 people per toilet, if there's even

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.960
a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.960
[6:02:45 AM]

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.850
toilet, if there's even a toilet.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:12.959
Phil, poppy.

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.560
&gt;&gt;&gt; We saw on Saturday, fighting in the north
of Israel across the border with Lebanon,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.060
Hezbollah, saying one of their fighters was
killed.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.129
What does that indicate to you, does that
indicate the beginning of a broader, expansion

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:37.690
of this to the north and more broadly between
not just Israel and hamas but Israel and Hezbollah?

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.440
&gt;&gt; Reporter: Well, starting on the 8th of
October, Hezbollah basically entered into

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.110
this fight with limited strikes on Israeli
poxes in some communities on the other side

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.170
of the border, but it's worth noting that
during the seven-day truce, they also observed

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.030
the truce, they didn't open fire, but what
we have seen since the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.030
[6:03:47 AM]

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.610
but what we have seen since the truce broke
down on Friday morning there's been a real

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.890
intensification of the back and forth fire
between Hezbollah and the Israelis.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.720
I've been in touch with our correspondent
in Lebanon, he said there's hourly shelling

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.670
back and forth.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.220
Poppy.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.220
&gt;&gt; Quite telling.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.730
Ben reporting for us in Jerusalem, thank you
very much.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.340
Phil.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.090
&gt;&gt;&gt; Exchanges in the north just the latest
example that every hour the threat that America

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.510
could get dragged directly into the war seems
to grow.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.820
U.S. Military said a U.S. Navy destroyer and
three commercial ships were attacked in an

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.970
hours-long assault in the red sea.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.209
Launched ballistic missiles and drones.

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.610
The U.S. Blaming the attack on

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.610
[6:04:48 AM]

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.709
The U.S. Blaming the attack on rebels backed
on Iran.

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.319
It's stoking fears of a wider conflict.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.340
Natasha joins us live from the Pentagon.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.259
To give an example for people on the map where
this is all happening, Israel up here, Ben

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:28.410
talking about Lebanon, we're talking specifically
in this area here, the red sea, down in Yemen,

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.421
proxy organizations tied to Iran, have been
a significant player on attacks on U.S. Ships

00:04:35.421 --> 00:04:41.000
and other commercial ships, I think the big
question right now, particularly in the wake

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
of those hostage negotiations breaking down,
is this a sign that an escalation is coming

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.900
or just a return to what we saw the six, seven
weeks before that pause?

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.560
&gt;&gt; This was a particularly active day in the
red sea.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.870
Iran-backed houthi rebels.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.070
[6:05:53 AM]

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.669
Iran-backed houthi rebels.

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:15.130
This was a number of attacks, four attacks
on three separate commercial vessels in the

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.539
southern red sea including one attack in which
the houthis used a ballistic missile.

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:27.930
The uss carney responded to each of these
attacks which occurred on Sunday at several

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.789
different times throughout the day and many
of them resulted in damage to these commercial

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.560
vessels in the southern red sea and the U.S.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.440
Now says that this is really, really dangerous,
obviously, not only did the uss carney respond

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.360
to these attacks but they also shot down a
number of drones that were launched from these

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.110
houthi-controlled territories in Yemen.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.979
Clearly they're taking advantage right now
of the tumult in the region of the U.S. Presence

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:03.550
in the region to try to attack these ships
and the houthi-run Yemeni run forces they'll

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.870
continue to wage these attacks

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.900
[6:06:54 AM]

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.949
continue to wage these attacks against these,
quote, Israeli ships and those aligned with

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.980
Israel, standing in solidarity with Palestinians.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:26.970
The U.S. Central command said that these attacks
pose a quote 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.450
a direct threat.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:38.229
Importantly they say that have every reason
to believe that these attacks are fully enabled

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.830
by Iran, now the big question is how the U.S.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.440
Is going to respond, of course we've seen
the U.S. Military strike these iran-backed

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.210
groups in Iraq and Syria.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.340
But Yemen whether they're going to go after
the houthis in Yemen is an entirely different
