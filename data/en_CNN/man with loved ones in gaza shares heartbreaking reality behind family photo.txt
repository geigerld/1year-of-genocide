&gt;&gt;&gt; AS CALLS FOR A CEASE-FIRE  GROW INSIDE THE UNITED STATES  TONIGHT, ISRAEL HAS AGREED TO  FOR OUR PAUSES EACH DAY TO  ALLOWED AGE TO GET INTO GAZA  AND CIVILIANS TO GET OUT.  A SENIOR ISRAELI OFFICIAL SAYS  THIS WILL ONLY APPLY TO  SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE  WAR ZONE.  SOME DEMOCRATS SAY THIS IS NOT  ENOUGH.  MY NEXT GUEST KNOWS FIRSTHAND  JUST HOW DEVASTATING THIS  VIOLENCE HAS BEEN FOR FAMILIES  STILL INSIDE OF GAZA.  SAMMY SIOBHAN IS A PALESTINIAN  AMERICAN WHO HAS LOST 17 FAMILY  MEMBERS SINCE THIS WAR BEGAN.  THAT AMOUNTS TO FOUR  GENERATIONS, NOW GONE.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING  HERE AND I AM SO SORRY FOR WHAT  IS REALLY A PROFOUND LOSS FOR  YOUR FAMILY. WE WERE JUST  SPEAKING, 11 OF THE 17 MEMBERS,  BASICALLY LOST IN ONE INSTANCE.  TELL US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.  &gt;&gt; YEAH, THEY WERE LOST BUT  THEY WERE SPECIFICALLY KILLED.  A BOMB DROPPED ON THEM.  IT WAS IRONIC BECAUSE MY  COUSIN, ABDULLA, WHO LIVES  THERE, SAID IT SAFER WHERE I AM. THEY WERE BOMBED, NINE OF THEM  WERE KILLED THERE.  THE TWO SURVIVORS WERE MY UNCLE  AND MY COUSIN.  SHE SURVIVED ONLY FOR A FEW  DAYS GOING THROUGH SURGERY  WITHOUT ANESTHESIA, BUT CUT  DIRECTLY INTO YOU, IN THE  HOSPITAL.  MY UNCLE SURVIVED FOR 10 DAYS  BUT HE EVENTUALLY SUCCUMBED TO  HIS WOUNDS.  HE WAS BURNED FROM HEAD TO TOE.  HE WAS THE BEST OF US.  HE WAS A PERSON WHO, FROM THE  TIME HE WAS YOUNG, WAS JUST A  BEAUTIFUL PERSON.  HE WOULD LINE UP FOR PRAYER, HE  WOULD ALWAYS BE TRYING TO GUIDE  YOU TOWARDS GOOD, HE WAS ALWAYS  SOMEBODY THAT PEOPLE LOOKED UP  TO.  TO HAVE THAT LOSS, TO ME IT  BREAKS MY HEART, THAT I WILL  NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE HIM AGAIN.  &gt;&gt; YOU ALSO HAVE A LOT OF  FAMILY MEMBERS IN GAZA.  WHAT ARE THEIR LIVES LIKE RIGHT  NOW?  &gt;&gt; THERE ARE NO BASIC  NECESSITIES.  MY AUNT, DEPENDENT ON LIFE- SAVING DRUGS, IS RUNNING OUT OF  THOSE MEDICINES.  MY UNCLE, WHO REQUIRES OXYGEN  TANKS IS RUNNING OUT.  WHEN THEY ARE SURROUNDED, MY  UNCLES FAMILY NEEDED TO BE  EXCAVATED, AND WHEN THEY DID  TAKE THEM OUT, THEY COULD ONLY  TAKE THEM OUT IN SMALL CHUNKS.  INDISTINCT SHABBAT.  THEY COULDN'T TELL WHO WAS WHO.  ESPECIALLY CHILDREN.  &gt;&gt; HOW MANY CHILDREN WERE  THERE?  &gt;&gt; THERE WERE FOUR CHILDREN.  ONE OF THEM WAS NOT EVEN A YEAR  OLD.  I HAVE A PICTURE THAT I SHARED  WITH YOU ALL. IN THAT ONE  PICTURE AT A WEDDING, THEY ALL  LOOK SO HAPPY.  NOT ONE OF THEM IS ALIVE RIGHT  NOW.  &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A COUSIN WHO IS OR  WAS PREGNANT?  HOW IS SHE?  &gt;&gt; SHE IS SURVIVING.  SHE WAS PREGNANT AND WENT TO  THE HOSPITAL, SHE ENDED UP  HAVING A CESAREAN SECTION, AS  ANY MOTHER WILL TELL YOU,  THERE'S 1 MILLION DOCTORS.  SHE HAD NOTHING.  SHE WENT TO A SMALL GROUP, THEY  HAD TO HAVE HER OUT WITHIN 10  HOURS OF THAT AND NOW SHE HAS  HAD TO MOVE SEVERAL TIMES  WITHIN GAZA, JUST TO SURVIVE,  WITH THESE WOUNDS.  &gt;&gt; SHORTLY AFTER HAVING A BABY.  WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THIS  NEWS, THAT THERE WILL BE THESE  FOR OUR WINDOWS EACH DAY TO  ALLOW CIVILIANS TO MOVE AROUND  WITHIN GAZA, FROM THE ISRAELI  GOVERNMENT?  &gt;&gt; IS A PALESTINIAN, I WELCOME  IT, BECAUSE IT IS MY FAMILY.  BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH.  MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE.  THERE NEEDS TO BE A CEASE-FIRE,  THERE NEEDS TO BE AN END TO THE  BLOCKADE OF HUMANITARIAN AID  BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE DYING BUT  THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF FOOD.  MY COUSINS TOLD ME THERE IS NO  WATER OR FOOD FOR THEM TO EAT  OR DRINK.  WE NEED TO OPEN THIS UP WITH  THESE KIDS HAVE DONE NOTHING  WRONG.  4000 CHILDREN HAVE BEEN KILLED  AT THIS POINT.  4000.  THAT IS MORE THAN THE 9/11.  THIS IS A CEMETERY IN CRISIS AT  EPIC LEVELS.  WE NEED TO STOP THIS.  IT IS OUR GOVERNMENT THAT IS  PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE, AND WE  NEED TO HAVE THE BRAVERY TO  STAND UP TO ANYBODY IN THE  WORLD AND SO YOU NEED TO STOP  THIS.  THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO DO  IF THERE WAS A MASS SHOOTER IN  A SCHOOL, YOU WOULD NOT BLOW UP  THE WHOLE SCHOOL, RIGHT?  YOU NEED TO BE TECHNICAL ABOUT  HOW YOU GO AFTER THIS, BECAUSE  IN THE MEANTIME, MY FAMILY  MEMBERS AND INNOCENT PEOPLE  THERE ARE BEING KILLED, THEY  ARE BEING SLAUGHTERED BUT THIS  IS TURNING INTO A GENOCIDE.  WE NEED TO STOP IT, NOW.  &gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING  YOUR PERSPECTIVE.  AMICABLY SORRY, AS I SAID  EARLIER, IT IS A PROFOUND LOSS,  THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE.  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
