00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:02.002
And I want to begin our

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:03.069
coverage live here tonight

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:03.903
with Nic Robertson.

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:05.038
He is OUTFRONT

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:06.439
live in Stuttgart, Israel,

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:08.208
which is about 45 miles

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.143
south of where I'm standing right now.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.379
And Nic, where you are.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.581
Many loud explosions just moments ago.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.382
What's happening,

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:19.219
as best as you can tell?

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.021
Yeah, there's a lot of helicopter

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.055
activity in the sky.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.289
You heard fighter jets.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.091
This is not that uncommon,

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.826
but we've heard a lot of mechanical,

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:27.727
heavy equipment

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:30.530
moving in the area between this town

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.731
and the Gaza

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:32.465
Gaza fence,

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.701
which is less than a couple of miles

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.269
really from where we're standing right

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.971
now, says a lot of

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:41.374
mechanized machinery, mechanized units

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.777
being military units being maneuvered

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:44.611
in that area.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.212
At the moment, we don't know what form,

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.580
but the explosions

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.482
that we've been experiencing here

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.718
over the past past

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.986
perhaps hour or so,

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.890
but pretty intense up up here in the past

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.224
20 minutes.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.226
You see a big flash go off behind me.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.361
Counter counter

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.929
three can't afford to count to five

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.899
and then you will hear a huge explosion.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.267
The explosions have been enough

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.003
to shake the roof of this building here.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.005
So that impacting in Gaza

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.440
a couple of miles away.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.874
And it's enough to shake

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.443
the roof of the building here.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.343
But what we found

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:18.912
when we went to Camp Azhar,

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.146
which it took,

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:20.880
by the way,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.883
it took the Israeli Defense Forces

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.654
48 hours of fighting against Hamas

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:30.523
to take back control of it.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:31.057
What we

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.192
found there and what

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:33.726
the Israeli Defense Forces

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:34.994
wanted to show us

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.863
was what they were describing

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:38.932
as the brutality of the way

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.967
that people were treated, that

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:41.868
the residents

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:42.969
were treated,

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.405
that some of them had their hands bound.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.807
That's how families were executed.

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:50.810
Parents, children, people even beheaded,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.678
he said.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:56.850
This is what happened on the road that

00:01:56.916 --> 00:02:01.087
the drive into Kafr AZA is chilling

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:05.391
evidence of Hamas's butchery Everywhere.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:08.461
This Israel Defense Force general shocked

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.130
at what he found.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.032
I thought about

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:15.602
General Eisenhower that come to the death

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:16.536
camp in Europe.

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:19.172
And the first thing that he

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:22.709
said is brings this press young children.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:23.910
He did the same

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.913
in fighting about 50 journalists.

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.014
You will see

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:31.017
it's a it's a big massacre, a big,

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:31.751
big day.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:33.219
Have you ever seen anything like this

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.053
in your career?

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:34.420
Never.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.423
For less than a mile from Gaza.

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:40.426
70 Hamas fighters stormed in here

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:44.664
early Saturday, some even flying.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.331
They're telling us

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.733
this is one of the paragliders

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:47.634
that flew in here.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.769
You can see the engine here,

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.505
the propellers here made of carbon fiber.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.274
The fuel tank up here

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:56.075
and the frame of it and the seats

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:58.011
at the front.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.312
The IDF in

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:03.216
control now after a two day battle.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:06.286
Hamas lie where they fell.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.290
Only now, the extremes of their barbarity

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:13.059
becoming apparent.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.863
700 plus civilians lived here.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.331
How many were killed?

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.234
Still unclear how they died.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:24.070
Brutally apparent.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.372
Some decapitated.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.607
They say

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:30.243
kill babies in the front of their parents

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.744
and kids. The parents.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:32.745
They killed parents.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.480
And we found babies

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.249
between the dogs and the.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.519
And the family that killed before him.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:42.589
They cut the head of the people.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:46.259
Each body bag, silent sentinel

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.827
to the intelligence failure

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:49.395
that allowed Kafr AZA

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.764
and other communities near Gaza

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.466
to be overrun.

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:56.469
And motivation for troops, too.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.972
We wait to the switch

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.240
to to switch ourselves

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.574
from the defense to the attack.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.642
Because, you know,

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:06.012
we defense our people and still now we

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:06.679
call it.

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.348
And when you say you're going to attack,

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:10.083
will you be going into Gaza?

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.884
So if we can see it here, look, it's

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:12.785
you know,

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:16.489
I look to the next hundred yard,

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.090
you take care

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.358
of the next hundred yards next

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:19.726
until they are the fight

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:20.827
fighters, the next hundred yards,

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:22.829
and then look forward,

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:25.331
forward to a possible showdown

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.633
with Hamas.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:27.967
How and when?

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:33.306
Still to be determined.

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:34.440
And that's really

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.109
where I think these troops

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.410
find themselves at the moment.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.111
They're waiting for

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.079
that political decision.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.147
The sense with them today

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.782
was that they were sort of

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.117
there was a sort of a pause,

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:44.851
but not a pause

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:46.152
where you sit back and rest,

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.654
but a pause where you were.

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:48.721
You change posture

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:50.156
and begin to lean forward.

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:51.391
And you get that sense for them.

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.191
They're really waiting

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:54.093
to get the political direction

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:55.194
of what they need to do.

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:55.928
They know that

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.163
if they go into Gaza,

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.132
that this will be a very bloody fight,

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.000
a very dangerous fight for them,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.168
because they'll be fighting

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.470
and streets and small streets

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.139
and civilian neighborhoods

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.573
where they're the enemy,

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:10.576
where Hamas, Islamic Jihad, know

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:11.244
the terrain,

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:13.613
where the population is against them,

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:14.080
but also

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.881
an environment

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:16.349
where their rules of engagement

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.551
are to avoid civilian casualties.

00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:20.153
Yet, and in an environment

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:20.620
like that

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.989
in Gaza, civilian casualties,

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.590
as we've seen in the past,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.059
do and will happen.

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:29.262
So all of this stands in front of Israel,

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:30.229
stands in front of the prime

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.197
minister right now

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:32.532
and most particularly stands

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:33.900
in front of those troops

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.537
we were with today, Aaron.

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:40.139
All right, Nic, thank you very much.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:40.673
And Major Ben

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:41.441
Wall Houses

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.542
and spokesperson

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:43.910
for the Israel Defense Forces

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.677
for the IDF.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:45.645
And I very much appreciate

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:46.846
your time, Major,

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.014
on the back of this reporting.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.550
And here we are tonight.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.451
Hamas

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:52.685
obviously has always been

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.487
a brutal organization.

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.421
Now, though,

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.256
these reports we're seeing beheadings

00:05:57.256 --> 00:06:00.259
by ISIS like cruelty babies.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.064
Have you seen a shift in their tactics?

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:06.666
Oh, Hamas has always been

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:07.367
an individual

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.701
terrorist organization,

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.269
and it's openly stated

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:11.104
its explicit

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:12.872
aim to kill all the Jews

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.007
and all the Israelis that it can.

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:15.308
So in

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:16.075
terms of who

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:17.143
it is as an organization,

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:19.145
as an organization, that's nothing new.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:21.080
But surely the extent

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.982
and the barbaric nature of these attacks

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:25.118
is something that we haven't seen before.

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:27.253
And as your journalists saw today,

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:28.054
as our forces

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:28.988
go through the south

00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:30.323
and clear house by house,

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:31.791
making sure there is no terrorist

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:32.725
presence left.

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:34.660
We're starting to hear those stories.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.496
We're starting to find those corpses

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:38.798
that were brutally mutilated,

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.100
entire communities massacred.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.567
And yet,

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.101
as you say,

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:42.902
this is something that

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:47.340
we haven't seen before.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.040
Major, there's the

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.442
strikes coming from Gaza.

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:50.343
I also understand

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:53.179
there was a clash between IDF soldiers

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:56.182
and Hamas militants inside Israel.

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:58.284
In the north, meantime,

00:06:58.284 --> 00:06:59.352
three rockets were seen

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:00.787
launched from Syrian territory,

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.989
according to the IDF just tonight.

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:03.756
Rockets were launched

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:06.259
from Lebanon earlier.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.694
Where does security of Israeli

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:12.432
land stand at this hour?

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:14.567
Yes, this is an extremely complex

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:15.768
security situation.

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:17.437
We are continuing intense

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.738
fighting in the south

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:19.972
with the aim of stopping

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:20.840
Hamas's attacks

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.575
and making sure they can't carry

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:23.543
these kinds of attacks.

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:24.444
That, again,

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.478
thousands of rockets

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:26.379
are still being fired

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.881
into Israeli cities indiscriminately.

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.416
And at the same time, as you say,

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:31.884
on our northern border

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:33.686
and on our eastern border,

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:34.921
we have attacks, rocket,

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:37.390
anti-tank fire, rocket fire from Lebanon.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.391
In Syria,

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:39.392
we have called up over

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:41.260
300,000 reserve

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.029
soldiers who have left their families

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:45.164
and are deployed on all of their borders.

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:45.765
And in the north,

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:47.400
we're watching very carefully

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.335
and making sure that the message is clear

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:54.707
that no one should join in the fight.

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.142
Reuters is reporting,

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.310
Major, that for months

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.611
leading up to the attack,

00:07:58.611 --> 00:07:59.979
Hamas misled Israel

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.948
to believe that it didn't want to fight.

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:03.282
I didn't want a confrontation.

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:04.450
And the report from Reuters

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.352
cites a source close to Hamas

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:07.720
saying that the organization actually

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.488
even went so far

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.491
as to construct a mock Israeli town,

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:12.992
a settlement in Gaza

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.760
where they practiced a military landing.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.661
They did all these things.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.897
They trained to storm it.

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:22.101
Can you confirm any of this?

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:23.603
Well, Hamas's intentions

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:24.437
have always been clear.

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:25.738
The fact that it makes a mock

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:26.572
Israeli town

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:27.540
to invade

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.741
shows that Hamas's war

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:30.610
is a war against civilians.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:31.677
Hundreds of terrorists

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:33.145
streaming across the border

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:34.113
and massacring

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:35.081
women and children

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:38.084
and elderly is a war against civilians

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:39.585
taking civilians,

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:40.653
entire families

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.121
into Gaza, abducting them.

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:43.923
That's a war against civilians.

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:44.790
And at the same time,

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.559
they're using their own civilians

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:48.160
as human shields, placing them

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.163
military targets inside homes, mosques,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.965
hospitals, all in an effort

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:54.066
to use their civilian

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:58.604
population as shields.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:01.240
So in terms of any sort of a mock,

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.541
you know,

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.042
settlement that they may have created,

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.544
do you now know where that is

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:05.411
or what they were doing?

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:06.445
And you do now

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:07.780
have the intelligence to sort of

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.015
look at how this actually

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:12.218
was trained for an accomplished.

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:12.451
Well,

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:14.053
we're looking forward at the moment.

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:15.655
Our immediate priority

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:17.557
is to stop Hamas's attacks.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.624
Their rocket attacks

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:20.059
indiscriminately into our cities

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:21.127
are continuing,

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.795
as your viewers are seeing right now.

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.330
Attempted attacks by land,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.998
by air from Gaza

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:27.199
and our immediate priority

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:29.101
is to protect our civilian population

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:32.972
from further attacks.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:34.640
All right, Major, I appreciate your time

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.709
and thank you very much. Of course.

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:38.611
Obviously, it is past two in the morning.

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:39.946
So another another late

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:40.980
or all night for you.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.081
Thank you very much, sir.
