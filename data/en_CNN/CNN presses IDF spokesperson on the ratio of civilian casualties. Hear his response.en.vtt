00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.634
According to the AFP,

00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:02.402
senior Israeli

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:03.703
military officials have said aro

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:05.605
two civilians have been killed.

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.507
For every Hamas fighter

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.041
that you have

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:11.911
successfully killed in the Gaza 

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.514
So that's two civilians

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:15.648
for every terrorist.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:19.185
Can you confirm that?

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.354
I can confirm the reports

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:24.624
and I can say that if that is tr

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.694
and I think that our numbers wil

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.396
be corroborated.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.897
If you compare, though,

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:31.831
that ratio

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.801
to any other conflict in urban t

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.703
between a military

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.538
and a terrorist organized

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.739
and using civilians

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.641
as their human shield and embedd

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.643
in the civilian population,

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:44.477
you will find that

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:47.414
that ratio is tremendous,

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:49.082
tremendously positive

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.085
and perhaps unique in the world.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.553
I understand that there are

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.754
civilian casualties

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:55.522
and understand

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:56.823
that footage and coverage

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.025
goes towards emotions

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.527
and to to cover

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.295
those civilian casualties.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:03.563
But what I want to say

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.598
is that we will get those figure

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:06.633
and they will be official

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.201
and on record by the IDF

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.869
with the name behind it.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.539
And then we will be able to say

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.674
and to back up afterwards

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:16.509
with names and numbers

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.078
that we are indeed

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.512
targeting the terrorists.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.014
We are not after the civilians

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.383
and we are going into great effo

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.418
in order to keep it that way.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.853
And it is

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:27.554
it is, of course,

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:30.657
hard to comprehend two for one.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.558
But when you say you're going

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:32.859
to great efforts, Colonel,

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:33.793
one of those efforts

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:34.961
is those IDF directions,

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:35.495
which I don't know

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:36.763
when you actually plugged in,

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.864
but I had shared with anyone

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:38.898
watching at the top of the show

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.367
the directions for evacuation.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:41.668
All right.

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:44.671
So, you know, there's the QR cod

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.340
And then if you click on can't r

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.775
because there's a blackout.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.844
But if you were to click on it

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:53.146
and you were to see where to go 

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:54.214
in this urban area,

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:55.381
a tiny little parcels

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.716
block by block

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:57.617
and numbers,

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.620
I suppose it's hard to even read

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.123
How do you really expect anybody

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.425
to get that, to click on it

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.127
to see it, which they can't do r

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.461
now, again, because the blackout

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.829
and then to follow the direction

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.064
and to get somewhere safely.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:15.635
I mean, is that is that reasonab

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.570
And I think, Aaron, that

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.205
it may not be perfect,

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.908
but it is the best thing that we

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:24.944
And the situation is that for we

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.947
we have designated a humanitaria

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:30.150
and we have been asking civilian

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.217
to go there.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:32.819
Unfortunately, civilians

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.120
for various reasons,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.021
because they're under

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.556
the control of Hamas,

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:37.590
because the international

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.525
aid organizations

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:39.826
have channeled them there.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.094
Many other reasons

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.362
have not yet gone

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.663
through the humanitarian zone,

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.431
which I think is very unfortunat

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:45.932
The reason

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.567
why we made that

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.802
or designated that humanitarian 

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:50.637
is because it's

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.172
one of the few areas

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:55.041
where Hamas isn't embedded above

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.042
and below ground

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.211
and therefore a relatively safe 

00:02:58.211 --> 00:02:59.946
because we would have no interes

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:00.747
in fighting there

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.749
because Hamas isn't there.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:03.216
And that's

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:05.084
what we've been asking all along

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.286
the attempt or what

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:07.320
you showed on the map.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.154
And I can agree

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:09.155
that it's not perfect,

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:10.256
but by by the way,

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.191
I contest the fact

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.158
that there's a blackout

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:14.928
because I saw lots of cameras ou

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:16.629
when our hostages were being ret

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.565
And I saw lots of live footage

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:20.066
from those occasions as well.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.301
Well, tonight, though, tonight,

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.001
though, there is

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.136
I was actually going to intervie

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.671
the spokesperson for the Red Cro

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:25.171
We were unable

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.006
to get communications, Colonel,

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.041
for 45 minutes.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:28.541
I mean, there is a

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.211
widespread blackout tonight.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:31.844
I've seen the

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:32.612
spokesperson of

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.247
UNICEF on CNN

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:35.982
and every other living network.

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:36.916
And I think that there

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:38.518
isn't really such a blackout

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:39.786
because obediently

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.621
he has service and many others h

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.223
And there's video coming out.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:43.890
Listen,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.692
I understand that it's not perfe

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.961
but this is what we are trying t

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:49.662
We're trying to reach out

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:50.496
to Palestinians.

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:52.498
We're trying to inform them

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:53.566
ahead of time.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.702
We're fighting is going to be in

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:56.102
for them

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:58.438
to be able to take precautions a

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:00.440
from where there is going to be 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.543
I don't know how else we can squ

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.279
that circle of defeating Hamas

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:07.413
where Hamas is

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.449
and minimizing civilian casualti

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.184
I think running with military

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.585
experience has an idea.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:13.920
We're open for suggestions,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.923
but it has to square in defeatin

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.691
not ceasing operations

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.159
and letting Hamas win,

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.928
but defeating Hamas

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.796
and minimizing collateral

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.465
or damage to civilians.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:25.999
Colonel, one

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.567
final point on the blackout

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:28.601
that that has been going

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.769
on the past few hours

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.137
and the Red Cross was there earl

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:32.972
There was video earlier than thi

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:33.873
And that's actually why

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:34.440
we had the interview

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.742
scheduled with the Red Cross.

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.243
Then the blackout affecting

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:38.911
most of Gaza has been in effect.

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.647
Do you know if it's been resolve

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:45.652
Do you know why it's in place?

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.620
I am not aware of a blackout.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.122
I am aware of

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.257
problems with coverage in local 

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:52.392
There have been reports of it.

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:54.594
But I see live streaming

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:56.229
by a Palestinian propagandist

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.897
from various areas,

00:04:57.897 --> 00:04:59.632
including from 20 minutes ago.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:00.233
I watched it

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.402
live of a very known

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.237
notorious Palestinian propagandi

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:05.738
He was live on Tik-Tok.

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:07.006
So there is why,

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:09.208
if I may be not specifically

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:10.476
with the Red Cross

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:11.644
that you were speaking with,

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.279
but I am factually aware

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.514
that there is live

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:16.215
Internet services in Gaza

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.917
not perfect and not 5G

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:18.885
Manhattan speed,

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.653
but there definitely is internat

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.255
in Internet service.

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:22.588
All right.

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:23.389
Well, Colonel Conricus,

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.457
I appreciate your time.

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:26.659
Thank you very much, sir.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:27.493
Thank you for having me.
