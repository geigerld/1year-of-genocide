Jeremy diamond. Give us the latest, Jeremy. &gt;&gt; Reporter: Today we set out to do a story of the hundreds of thousands of military reservists and this massive military buildup that Israel is preparing for. As we set out to do this story along the gaza border and Israeli communities here, one thing became clear that this is a very volatile, very unstable situation even before the next phase of Israel's military campaign, whatever it may be, reveals itself. Whether it was rockets flying overhead as we were in the city of sderot, or a firefight we caught, this is a very unstable, uncertain situation. Three days after hundreds of hamas militants infiltrated Israel, Israeli forces are still fighting to eliminate the threat. We are outside the Israeli town of mythalseem where we have been hearing repeated exchanges of gunfire the last ten minutes or so.

Israeli troops and reservists mobilizing to the gaza front. Part of a massive call-up of more than 300,000 reserve troops, preparations for a potential ground invasion of gaza. For some, this moment feels different. &gt;&gt; Then we came in with a concept of full control. This one started with obviously more confusion and the playing field is different. But I think in the last two days, the momentum has shifted. &gt;&gt; Reporter: An entire country springing into action with those T of uniform bringing food and supplies to troops. After days of tragedy, also a sense of resilience. "I'm not afraid at all," she said. "When it will be my time, it will be my time." Wolf, late Tuesday evening, the Israel defense forces also now confirming that the first shipments of advanced U.S. Weaponry provided by the united States in the wake of hamas' attack this past weekend has now arrived in Israel. It arrived at the nevatim air base in southern Israel. The idf did not say what kind of weaponry was being provided, simply that it is, quote, designed to facilitate significant military operations and increase preparedness for
