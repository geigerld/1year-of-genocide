00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.201
When and how

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.838
will Iran strike back for Israel

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.640
assassination of Hezbollah's top

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.742
military chief?

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:09.409
That question

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:11.244
hanging over the Middle East thi

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:14.214
US sources say Iran and its affi

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.016
are preparing to respond,

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.785
possibly in the coming days. Rig

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.387
Diplomats from Islamic nations

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:21.287
are meeting

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:22.789
in an emergency session

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.825
in Saudi Arabia at Iran's reques

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:29.596
They are expected to urge restra

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:31.197
from Tehran and condemn

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.433
Israel over its suspected

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.502
killing of Hamas political chief

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:39.739
Ismail Haniya in Iran recently.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.574
Yahya Sinwar,

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.009
an alleged architect

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:44.244
of the October 7th

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.413
attacks, has been

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:49.015
tapped to replace senior.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.083
Among those working

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.684
at that meeting in Jeddah,

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.219
Jordan's Foreign Minister

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.088
Iman Safadi has been conducting

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:59.259
a flurry of talks to Defuze tens

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.861
He stopped in Iran on Sunday,

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:03.129
the first such visit

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.933
by a top Jordanian official in 2

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:07.834
Simon Safadi,

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.103
stepping away from that meeting 

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.004
to talk to us.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.439
This is his first interview

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.775
since he was in Tehran, and you 

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:16.743
with the acting foreign

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.812
minister of Iran today.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:19.879
So I want to get

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.882
your sense of Iran's thinking

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:26.286
at this point as the region awai

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:27.587
what is threatened

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:30.924
retaliation by Iran on Israel.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.992
what do you understand

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:36.096
to be Tehran's position at this 

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.364
and what are they trying to achi

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.966
with this meeting? Foreign Minis

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:46.806
good evening Becky.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:47.774
We are

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.243
in very, very dangerous situatio

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:51.244
in the region.

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:53.913
following the assassination of o

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:55.415
the head of the political bureau

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.484
of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh,

00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:00.086
tensions have risen, obviously,

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:01.855
what we and Jordan are saying

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:02.889
is that we,

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.557
the region cannot afford

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:05.525
further,

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:06.626
conflict, further

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.328
war, further destruction.

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:10.763
And we must stop this escalation

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.165
And the first step

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:12.932
towards stopping

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.267
the escalation is ending.

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:16.236
Its its root cause, which is,

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.438
the continued Israeli aggression

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.874
on, Gaza.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.075
we have

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:23.276
everybody has to realize

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.744
that this situation

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:26.379
is extremely dangerous.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.747
The threat of the region

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.249
being dragged into,

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.017
regional war is real.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:34.354
we do want this escalation to st

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:35.588
We have been working

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.924
very hard, to achieve that.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:39.893
And we are, 100%,

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:41.794
convinced that

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:43.163
the only the first step

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.864
towards that de-escalation

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:47.867
is stopping the aggression on Ga

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:48.768
and Iran.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:52.872
Obviously, we had, discussions

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.007
with the Iranian foreign ministe

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.041
the Iranian president,

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:57.377
and Bahrain few days ago,

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.179
I went there at the invitation o

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.113
foreign minister,

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:02.115
to try and see what we can do,

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.584
to bring the, temperature down.

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:05.685
they,

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.320
believe that they've been done

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.221
a great wrong.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.255
And, they believe

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:10.857
they have the right to respond.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.426
so what we're trying to do is, a

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.963
to create, the conditions, in wh

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.831
everybody will see

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.233
value in de-escalating.

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.535
And that would be ending the agg

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.804
getting a permanent cease fire, 

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.339
urging everybody to act

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.774
responsibly and

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:28.741
prevent,

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:29.509
the whole region

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.444
from falling into the abyss.

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:32.111
well,

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.414
while the US secretary of State 

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:35.815
that the cease fire talks

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:38.117
are in their final stages, sourc

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:39.686
that I talked to around this reg

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:40.987
suggest that, you know,

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:42.922
we are not close at this point.

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:46.125
So given that and given that

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:49.162
the appeal to Iran has been from

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:53.032
and others, that a cease fire is

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:55.101
we should be pushing for here

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:58.171
and retaliation, by default, not

00:03:59.005 --> 00:03:59.672
what is it

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:02.842
that Tehran hopes to achieve tod

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.043
in Jeddah?

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:06.479
Is this just a holding pattern?

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.280
At this point?

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.482
We're not going to get a cease f

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:10.250
or tomorrow.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.785
I think you and I would agree on

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.154
is this just a holding

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.357
pattern at this point by tech? W

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:18.091
Can we

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.792
do you believe expect

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:22.495
to see that threatened retaliati

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:25.465
in the days to come.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.569
Well, as I said, Becky,

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:30.937
the danger is real.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.038
I think our meeting today

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:32.805
will not be able

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:34.340
to bring about a cease fire.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.242
I think Iran and Palestine,

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:38.911
called for this, emergency meeti

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:42.548
try and rally Arab Muslim,

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:43.916
position behind

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:45.818
condemning the assassination of 

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:46.552
and to

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:47.754
urge for,

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:49.188
more effective work

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.057
by the international community,

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.860
to end the aggression, on Gaza.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.863
again, I think we need to do, so

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.464
really transformative here.

00:04:58.464 --> 00:04:58.931
I think,

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.533
regardless of where Iran is,

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:02.835
where Israel is at this point,

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:05.505
if we are to force Israel

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.173
to accept the cease fire

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.474
and the aggression in Gaza,

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.475
ensure

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:11.944
that we get that permanent cease

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:14.580
then we would have created enoug

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.016
for everybody to say enough is e

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.318
Now we have an opportunity

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.687
at a real de-escalation,

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:22.622
and we should, move towards that

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:24.357
So, the talks on the cease

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:26.492
fire are obviously complicated,

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.661
particularly after the assassina

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.128
of the chief

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:30.296
negotiator on,

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:33.066
from the Hamas, side, which is w

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:33.900
believe is is,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.035
a violation of international law

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:36.936
and a reckless move

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:39.305
that we condemned as a crime.

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:41.874
But but beyond that, where do we

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:43.042
we have two paths.

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:43.576
A path

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:44.711
that will drag the region

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:46.579
further into the abyss of war,

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:49.415
or a path that would say enough 

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.084
and save the region from,

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:53.419
the devastation of an all out wa

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.587
And we believe that

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:57.490
if we throw into, the the the th

00:05:58.491 --> 00:05:59.225
discourse,

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:02.829
real promise of a cease fire, th

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:03.463
we believe

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:06.632
everybody, will have, a strong a

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:09.135
to say, let's not escalate any f

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:10.269
Everybody must exercise

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:11.938
self self-restraint.

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:15.007
And, use the opportunity of a ce

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:16.209
to go further towards,

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.212
calming the temperature in the r

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.915
Ismail Haniya, described by the 

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:24.183
as the lead

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:27.286
negotiator, of course, for Hamas

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:28.654
in those indirect

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:30.256
talks, his assassination is,

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:31.624
as you suggest,

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:35.094
complicating, any mediation effo

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:37.029
Surely you accept

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:40.600
that the appointment of Yahya Si

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.502
seen as Israel,

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:43.436
seen by Israel

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:47.840
as the architect of the, October

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.709
deadly attacks,

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:52.712
his appointment as the political

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:55.114
for Hamas at this point

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:58.551
must further complicate, the,

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:01.621
potential for any success in the

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:02.588
fire talks, doesn't it?

00:07:07.493 --> 00:07:08.594
We are already in a

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.163
very complex situation.

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:12.732
the war on Gaza has been ongoing

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:13.499
ten months.

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:15.134
The devastation it has,

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:17.437
produced is beyond description.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.404
And,

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:20.273
we all rallied behind efforts

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.073
to bring about

00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:24.410
that exchange deal to, reach,

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.480
that, permanent ceasefire that w

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.948
But, look,

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.583
we've been to the door and back,

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:31.584
so many times

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:33.085
in, in regards to the discussion

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:35.288
So I would not really say that w

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.289
near or not near

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.191
until we see that deal happening

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:40.059
But I think the bottom line is t

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:42.295
if there is a will to,

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.763
achieve that cease fire,

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:45.898
we believe that it can be achiev

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:48.901
The challenge that we have is th

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:53.005
every time we get near, we Israe

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:53.739
does something

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:54.974
that, complicates

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:57.343
the situation further, including

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:59.345
assume that pointed to,

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:02.215
the assassination of of Ismail H

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:03.683
in the middle of negotiations,

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:05.117
which the US, Qatar

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:06.118
and Egypt are saying

00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:08.154
we are achieving some progress.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.155
So you coming

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.023
and, assassinated the chief

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:13.392
negotiator, undermined the whole

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:15.561
and continue with the war in Gaz

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:17.630
our message to the whole world

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.865
is that enough is enough.

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:20.166
Enough killing and destruction

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.200
has taken place.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.969
The only path forward is really

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:25.104
to bring about an immediate ceas

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:26.172
that will help,

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:29.242
de-escalate the regional, situat

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:30.643
will save the region

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:33.646
from the abyss of further, confl

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:34.981
and will protect the region

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.216
from the agenda of Netanyahu,

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:38.985
continues to,

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.920
provoke, continues to escalate.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:41.787
And every time

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:43.189
there is a glimpse of hope,

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.192
he does something that, push us,

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.127
pushes us back to the

00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:49.262
to the edge of the abyss.

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:51.731
So the question is, do we allow 

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:52.832
and his radical government

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:53.799
to impose

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.434
their agenda on the region and d

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:56.035
it, therefore,

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.803
to a future of more conflict?

00:08:57.803 --> 00:09:00.439
Or do we do what we all believe 

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:01.974
and bring about that permanent

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.376
and immediate cease fire,

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.744
and then work with everybody

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.579
to make sure that we are on a pa

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:07.813
that will ensure that,

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:08.814
everything

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:10.116
that has happened since October

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:11.884
7th does not happen again.

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:13.052
Nothing on the table

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:15.655
as of yet is going beyond tactic

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:16.722
We believe that

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:18.090
we should start with, with

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.158
with ending the aggression

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:20.192
and start talking

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:23.829
strategically about how do we, l

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:26.933
a plan, to implement a solution

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:28.200
that will guarantee

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.669
we will not relive this,

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:30.703
these horrors again.

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.905
And that only solution is,

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.407
ending the occupation

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.575
and the two state solution.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.176
We cannot be capped

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:39.412
by what Netanyahu is willing to 

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.813
or willing to allow.

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:42.882
Unfortunately, this has been the

00:09:42.882 --> 00:09:43.950
that is within

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.753
which all, proposals have been, 

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:48.220
thus far.
