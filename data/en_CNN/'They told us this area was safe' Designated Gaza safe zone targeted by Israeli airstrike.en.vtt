00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.534
Rescuers have been digging

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:02.969
through sand and debris,

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.271
found a camp for displaced Palestinians

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:06.840
after an overnight strike

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.108
by Israeli forces left

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:09.342
scores of people

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:12.112
dead, wounded or missing.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.313
The Israeli military says it

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:14.714
struck Hamas terrorists

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:15.782
operating command

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:16.616
center embedded

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:17.951
in the humanitarian safe

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.753
zone in Khan Yunis.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.988
Hamas denies its fighters were present.

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.991
Civil Gaza civil defense officials say

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.426
entire families

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.395
disappeared into the sand.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.730
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.899
says civilians in the alma

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.902
area had no way to escape.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.872
If you try and picture

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:39.606
the area,

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.542
these are the most crowded surroundings

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:43.777
you could imagine.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.879
There's barely room to walk

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.180
in between tents

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.149
that are crowded on the beaches.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.617
It was late at night.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.685
Colleagues heard what they believe

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.154
was with the strikes

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:57.390
and and and just absolutely devastating.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.491
No way

00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.592
whatsoever that

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.561
the civilians in these areas

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.496
were able to protect themselves.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.234
While Israeli forces

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.603
have previously here is almost

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.406
in their pursuit of Hamas commanders,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.174
a strike in

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:18.111
mid-July killed at least 90 Palestinians.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.212
Or for more.

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:20.713
CNN's Matthew Chance,

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:21.714
monitoring this from

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.717
Tel Aviv in Israel and

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:27.487
I know that the detail still coming in.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:30.223
But what more do we know about this

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.124
strike in an area?

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.093
As I say, previously struck

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.928
by the IDF in pursuit,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:35.929
they say, of Hamas

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.932
terrorists back in July.

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:42.602
Well, Becky, I mean, first thing,

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.170
first thing you can notice,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.271
one of the first things you notice as we

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.139
look at the video

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.407
and the images that are coming

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.676
out of the Amira Sea

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:50.977
region

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.312
in the Gaza Strip

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:55.315
is that this was a massive attack.

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:56.382
I mean, the

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:58.051
the weaponry that was involved

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.452
is extremely powerful.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.420
Clearly,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.488
some of the craters

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.689
that have been left

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.692
by the strikes are seven meters deep.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.361
And so an extraordinary amount of damage

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.329
has been caused

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.897
in what would have been a densely

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.832
populated sort of area

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.168
humanitarian zone in the Gaza Strip.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.202
And of course,

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:19.205
civilians and ordinary people are again

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.707
paying that very high price.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.376
Oh, yeah.

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:24.577
Yeah,

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:25.545
there's rescue workers

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.213
scrambled for survivors.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.081
Eyewitnesses

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:30.283
say the Israeli strikes targeted

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:31.084
what was meant to be

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:34.087
a safe zone in the southern Gaza Strip,

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.355
ripping through tents

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.823
and makeshift shelters,

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.758
leaving deep craters.

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:41.227
Dozens of killed and injured

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:42.695
people, Judy.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:45.365
And they told us this area was safe,

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:46.166
says this man.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.000
I swear

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.801
the people here were just normal,

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.804
he says, not fighters.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.506
And by daylight

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.674
you can see the extent

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.542
of the destruction.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:56.342
Israel's

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.110
military says

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.944
it conducted

00:02:57.944 --> 00:03:00.914
a precise strike on Hamas terrorists,

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:03.716
operating a command and control center

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:06.719
inside this humanitarian zone,

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.321
and IDF statement says

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.423
prior to the strike, numerous steps

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:11.925
were taken to mitigate

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:14.894
the risk of harming civilians.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.366
But this was a heavily populated area

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.335
and civilians were caught up

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:24.304
in the powerful blasts.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:25.505
So many.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.440
This man says his two daughters

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.376
were completely buried under the sand.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:33.112
Only one survived, he says, and he says

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.448
he found the body parts of his neighbors

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:37.016
strewn around.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.319
This 12 year old girl is nursing

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.587
a broken shoulder,

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:42.622
suffered when her tent collapsed,

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:43.423
she says,

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.925
trapping her and her mother inside.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:46.859
Good thing

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.127
I was scared

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:49.862
because the strikes were so close,

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:50.430
she says.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.366
A long walk for

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:56.669
his rail accuses Hamas of using civilians

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.203
as human

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:58.838
shields, and insists

00:03:58.838 --> 00:03:59.872
the Israeli military

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.975
takes extensive measures

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.943
to enable civilians in Gaza

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:06.613
to avoid combat zones.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:09.048
But there's little real security

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:12.051
in this brutal war.

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:15.121
Well, Becky,

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:16.089
as you mentioned,

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.658
this exact humanitarian zone,

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.960
this camp had been struck

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.262
before back in July

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.630
with Palestinian health officials

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.833
saying that 90 people were killed back

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.635
then, Israeli military

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:29.502
saying they were targeting

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:30.703
Hamas militants.

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:32.572
But the health ministry in Gaza,

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.774
which is controlled by Hamas, of course,

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:35.375
saying that

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.743
these half of that figure

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.611
were women and children.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.213
So again, underlining

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:43.516
just what a poor state of security exists

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:46.519
inside the Gaza Strip.

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:48.921
Matthew,

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:51.924
meantime, the IDF has said

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:53.359
an investigation

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:54.894
has been launched into the death last

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:56.562
week of an American

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.798
killed in the West Bank.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.066
Now, the US secretary of state

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.801
has just weighed in on that.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.102
So I want you and our viewers

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:04.671
just to have a listen to what

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.673
Anthony Blinken has just said.

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.243
No one,

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:10.710
no one

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.277
should be shot

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:14.280
and killed for attending a protest.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.114
No one

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:17.984
should have to put their life at risk

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.653
just for freely expressing their views.

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:24.290
in our judgment, Israeli security forces

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:27.627
need to make some fundamental changes

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:28.728
in the way that

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.930
they operate in the West Bank,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.764
including changes

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:34.767
to their rules of engagement.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.003
Well, I assume we haven't yet

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.838
had an IDF statement

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.340
in response to Anthony Blinken.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.873
His words,

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:43.776
which were in the past couple of hours.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.578
But what are the IDF

00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:46.946
saying at this point?

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:48.114
They've said that they've launched

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:48.881
the investigation.

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:51.884
Do we have results of that?

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:55.955
the investigation has been launched,

00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:56.889
certainly.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.292
to try and get to the bottom of it.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:05:59.926
There's been a sort of

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:01.094
preliminary announcement

00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:03.162
by the Israeli Defense Forces

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:05.665
saying that they believe that

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:07.400
the killing of this American

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.868
Turkish activist, Aisha,

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:12.605
or Ezgi AG, was unintentional.

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:14.207
And indirect.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.708
and they said that

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:16.809
actually what they've learned

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:17.910
is that that

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.712
the shots were fired

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:21.714
at one of the protesters,

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:22.782
that would have been

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:25.752
had been hurling stones and burning tires

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:29.655
in front of Israeli forces, in the West

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:30.690
Bank.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.424
but, you know, we're

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:32.692
expecting more information

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:34.260
to come out in the hours ahead.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.028
There's going to be a briefing shortly

00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:39.332
with the, the chief spokesperson

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:40.967
for the Israeli Defense Force.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:43.169
And so we'll get some more, more clarity.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:44.771
But clearly, the the United States

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:45.772
Secretary of State,

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:48.775
Antony Blinken, they're not happy at all,

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:52.145
that, you know, another American.

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:53.513
And there's been a couple

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:55.548
who have been killed in the West Bank

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:56.582
while protesting.

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:57.717
To recap what he said.

00:06:57.717 --> 00:06:59.085
And no one should be killed

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.620
for attending a protest.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.020
And, of course,

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.889

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.225

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:07.493
And so signs there

00:07:07.493 --> 00:07:09.796

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:11.431
being increasingly critical

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.598
of how Israel operates.
