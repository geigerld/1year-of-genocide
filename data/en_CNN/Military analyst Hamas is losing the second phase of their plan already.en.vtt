00:00:01.155 --> 00:00:02.289
also one of the worst terrorist

00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:03.357
attacks on the American people

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:06.293
in recent times as well.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.262
&gt;&gt; Joining me now is CNN

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.564
military analyst general Wesley

00:00:11.165 --> 00:00:11.331
Clark.

00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:13.600
So general, first I'm gonna

00:00:14.168 --> 00:00:14.635
talk to you about what's going

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:16.436
on at the border, but before

00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:17.638
that, can you just talk about

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:20.307
the significance of these two

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:23.243
very important U.S. Naval

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.445
carriers, going into the region,

00:00:25.712 --> 00:00:27.347
and what is it's meant to do?

00:00:28.248 --> 00:00:32.252
&gt;&gt; Those two aaft carriers

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:33.654
and the flotilla that goes with

00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:35.455
him, you have about 20 ships,

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:36.690
you have a tremendous capacity

00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:38.458
for not only aircraft on each

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:40.327
acre craft carrier, but the

00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:41.461
escorts, and what they can do

00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:43.397
in the way of tomahawk missiles,

00:00:44.198 --> 00:00:44.264
and other things.

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:47.334
And so, there is a warning,

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:49.269
they're there is a deterrent to

00:00:49.803 --> 00:00:50.270
Iran.

00:00:51.205 --> 00:00:52.306
Keep your hands off, stay out

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:53.340
of it, or else.

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:56.210
Because the general thinking is

00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:58.212
that, Hezbollah is not going to

00:00:58.478 --> 00:01:00.280
go --

00:01:00.547 --> 00:01:01.548
without Iran saying go ahead.

00:01:03.217 --> 00:01:04.484
This ties Iran in directly into

00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:05.219
the assault.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:06.553
On the other hand, you can be

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.222
sure that Iran is watching

00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:08.555
this.

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:10.557
They're calculating, they're

00:01:10.824 --> 00:01:12.226
wondering whether the Israelis

00:01:12.492 --> 00:01:13.427
are going to get so bogged down

00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:16.330
in gaza, be so --

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:19.233
tarnished in world opinion,

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:21.235
that they could justify

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:22.469
releasing Hezbollah, and go for

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:24.371
the finish of Israel.

00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:25.639
There is going to be that kind

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:28.242
of thinking going on, in

00:01:28.508 --> 00:01:28.642
Tehran.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.577
Those two aircraft carriers are

00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:32.479
really important to stop that

00:01:32.746 --> 00:01:34.381
kind of thought.

00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:36.316
&gt;&gt; You want --

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:37.517
it is a deterrence.

00:01:38.252 --> 00:01:39.286
We have definitely heard some

00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:41.388
this morning, in interviews,

00:01:41.655 --> 00:01:43.257
not ruling out the notion of

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:45.592
U.S. Troops being involved.

00:01:47.261 --> 00:01:47.728
I think it's important to put

00:01:48.262 --> 00:01:49.463
that into context.

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:51.598
Certainly does not seem as

00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:53.600
though the U.S. Is going to get

00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:56.336
involved in a very active way

00:01:56.603 --> 00:02:00.274
with U.S. Troops in this

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:01.408
conflicts.

00:02:01.675 --> 00:02:05.312
The discuss it is --

00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:08.282
about how to get American

00:02:08.548 --> 00:02:08.782
hostages out.

00:02:09.283 --> 00:02:10.417
&gt;&gt; That's right, and I'm sure

00:02:10.684 --> 00:02:12.386
we've got a joint plan going on

00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:12.886
with Israelis.

00:02:13.287 --> 00:02:14.821
If we could locate the hostages,

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.792
if it's possible to pull off an

00:02:19.293 --> 00:02:19.860
extraction mission, sure we

00:02:20.294 --> 00:02:21.461
would work with the Israelis to

00:02:21.728 --> 00:02:21.862
do that.

00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:25.299
There's also the possibility of

00:02:25.565 --> 00:02:27.301
those U.S. Forces in the north

00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:30.304
actually having to engage,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.371
should Hezbollah decide to

00:02:31.638 --> 00:02:33.507
launch its hundred 50,000

00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:35.309
rockets against Israel.

00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:38.312
And Iran should be under no

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:39.379
illusions.

00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:40.714
Those ships are not just there

00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:42.316
for show, those ships are ready

00:02:42.582 --> 00:02:44.518
to go and on the presidential

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.619
order they could go.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.322
As president Biden said, we're

00:02:48.522 --> 00:02:50.324
100 percent committed to Israel

00:02:50.557 --> 00:02:51.391
were not going to allow the

00:02:51.658 --> 00:02:52.326
destruction of Israel.

00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:54.328
&gt;&gt; I really want to get your

00:02:54.528 --> 00:02:55.329
perspective on what is

00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:57.397
happening inside gaza.

00:02:58.332 --> 00:03:00.534
And Thea that, according to

00:03:00.801 --> 00:03:03.403
the white house, hamas, they're

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.372
the ones who stopped Americans

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.707
from getting into Egypt, via

00:03:06.973 --> 00:03:09.343
the rafah border crossing.

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.346
We're talking about

00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:14.348
Palestinians, we're talking in

00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:17.351
this case about Americans who

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:18.418
are inside gaza.

00:03:19.353 --> 00:03:21.355
These are civilians.

00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:23.423
What does it tell you, first of

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.360
all, that crossing was closed,

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.361
and what is your sense of why

00:03:27.527 --> 00:03:28.462
this really happened.

00:03:29.363 --> 00:03:31.398
We're showing our viewers a map

00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:34.601
of the area we're talking

00:03:34.868 --> 00:03:34.968
about.

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:39.439
Now &gt;&gt; Dana, we look at this a

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:39.973
as a two phase --

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:42.376
show how powerful you are, and

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.378
then fall back into gaza, and

00:03:44.644 --> 00:03:46.380
use civilian population as a

00:03:46.613 --> 00:03:49.383
shield, and then attack Israel

00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:50.450
on the stage of world opinion,

00:03:50.717 --> 00:03:53.453
and cause Israel to look like

00:03:54.388 --> 00:03:56.390
an evil force that is anti

00:03:56.623 --> 00:03:57.391
humanitarian.

00:03:58.392 --> 00:03:59.393
What's happening right now is

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:01.395
that hamas is losing the second

00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:02.396
phase already, before the

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.398
fighting is even started,

00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:06.400
violence of people there are

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:07.401
getting out of the way.

00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:08.668
Hamas may be trying to keep

00:04:09.436 --> 00:04:12.406
them in position, but hamas is

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:14.408
failing to do that, they are

00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:15.475
evacuating the northern area.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.415
Despite hamas roadblocks --

00:04:22.416 --> 00:04:24.418
on a main evacuation route,

00:04:24.684 --> 00:04:25.419
that looks like something

00:04:25.485 --> 00:04:26.420
engineered by hamas to

00:04:26.787 --> 00:04:27.487
intimidate its own people.

00:04:29.423 --> 00:04:31.425
Their view is that those people,

00:04:31.558 --> 00:04:32.492
they're just human shields.

00:04:34.428 --> 00:04:35.429
They're collateral, they don't

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.963
care about those people, what

00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:38.432
they're interested in is the

00:04:38.498 --> 00:04:41.435
destruction of Israel, and so

00:04:41.568 --> 00:04:45.439
the poor people in gaza,,

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.440
they're not all hamas.

00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:48.542
There are innocent people

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:48.909
there.

00:04:49.443 --> 00:04:52.446
They need to be protected too.

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:56.450
And the United States --

00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:58.452
hamas needs to be eliminated,

00:04:58.518 --> 00:04:59.453
and that's what the Israeli

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:00.454
objective is going to be

00:05:00.687 --> 00:05:00.854
eventually.

00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:03.457
In this phase, it's already

00:05:03.723 --> 00:05:05.459
underway, hamas is losing

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:06.526
control of the population, and

00:05:06.793 --> 00:05:08.595
that's a huge loss for hamas.

00:05:09.463 --> 00:05:11.465
&gt;&gt; Just to underscore, we're at

00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:12.466
a time, but just to underscore

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.468
what you said, which is that

00:05:14.734 --> 00:05:16.470
hamas with, just for speed the

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.471
leadership of gaza, is trying

00:05:18.472 --> 00:05:19.473
to prevent innocent civilians

00:05:19.673 --> 00:05:20.540
from getting out of harm's way.

00:05:21.475 --> 00:05:22.876
And getting out of a war zone,

00:05:23.143 --> 00:05:23.643
because I think it helps them,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:24.611
in the propaganda war.

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.481
It's really important to talk
