00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.533
There are new

00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.301
signs this morning

00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:02.702
that the Israeli Defense Force

00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:04.637
could move into Gaza at any minute.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:07.107
CNN has seen a buildup of military

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.375
right along the border

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.610
and now flares late into the night.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:11.711
This comes as Israeli

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:12.512
government officials

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.347
tell CNN's Nic Robertson

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.782
that the troops have the,

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:18.018
quote, green light to enter Gaza.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:18.818
Now, those officials

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:19.652
also say that Gaza

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.187
a 50 mile border with Israel,

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.722
will look radically different

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.090
after any military incursion.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.692
They tell CNN that a tough buffer

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.027
zone will be established,

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.028
one that would essentially be a

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.095
no go zone in

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:31.431
the IDF will be able to go into Gaza

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.165
and arrest people

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.333
whenever they want,

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.402
theoretically on their terms,

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:36.970
much like they can now in the West Bank.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.004
Joining us now at the magic wall.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.172
CNN military analyst,

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.273
retired Lieutenant General Mark

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:42.008
Hertling serve. Good to see you.

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:43.510
I want to start with the flares

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.310
because Nic Robertson

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.211
was pointing this out

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.013
show video of it right now,

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:47.881
and he made clear that

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.582
that's not the norm necessarily

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:50.950
in this moment. What does that tell you?

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.685
It just tells me that the Israeli forces

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.454
are looking for something

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.689
or they're trying to use a little bit

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.224
of psychological warfare

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.727
against the people inside of Gaza.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.463
This is not that big of a deal.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.831
It is just to show

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.066
potentially the commanders

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.200
that are on the scene

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.635
where different crossing points

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:09.602
are what they're looking for.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:10.236
It's to orient

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.105
those who are new to the area.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.673
The big question

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:15.542
is, will this become a regional conflict?

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:16.709
The president talked about that

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:17.143
last night.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.578
Let's talk about what we have

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.579
just seen in the region.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.847
The fact that two

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:22.582
sources told CNN overnight

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.117
that Navy warships, U.S.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:24.751
Navy warships

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.653
operating in the Middle East

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:29.756
had to counter multiple projectiles fired

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.858
on the coast of Yemen yesterday.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.626
And then you couple that

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.395
with what the Pentagon says are

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.262
drone attack

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.331
attempts in Iraq and where U.S.

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:40.867
officials are in Iraq and and and Syria.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.101
Yeah,

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:41.734
a couple of things

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:42.969
that happened yesterday.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.637
The drone attack out

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.272
off the coast of the Red Sea

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.707
and the Gulf of Aden down here

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:48.842
against the USS Carney,

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.276
drew a lot of attention.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.112
Integrated air defense from that ship

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.214
shot the drones and the missiles down

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.049
that were coming out of Yemen.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:56.950
That's important.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.687
But the range from there to Israel

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:01.621
is pretty far.

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.123
And it's

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.557
they don't have a great missile force,

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:05.492
let's put it that way.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.127
But the other things that were occurring

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.496
are would be a normal day

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:10.897
in some in some countries,

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.065
like the drone attack

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.200
at Al-Tanf in Syria.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.268
That is a U.S.

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.504
military base in that particular reason.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:19.038
It's been there for a while.

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.073
Other drone attacks

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.407
outside Air Force Base.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:21.841
I've been out

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:24.210
there are many times in Iraq,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.411
Erbil, Baghdad

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.880
and in the southern part of Iraq

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.914
just tells me

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:30.283
that the popular mobilization fronts,

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:31.684
the Iranian backed

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.820
rebels are actually targeting

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.355
those kinds of locations

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.990
just as harassment attacks.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.459
There was also two Israeli citizens

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.793
killed in Egypt,

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.495
which just shows that there's

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.597
a swell of a ground movement

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:45.632
that is a result of

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:46.232
some of the things

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.100
that have been going on there.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.202
And all of these Arab street

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.804
does not want Israel to go into Gaza.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.306
Just take a step back

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.341
to what your point has been.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.776
And I think it's very valuable to note

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:58.111
that these bases, these U.S.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.112
bases are often

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.580
harassed or often subject

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.715
to drone attacks or rocket attacks.

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.251
All of it happening on the same day,

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:05.652
the same day

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:06.486
the president gives

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.188
an Oval Office address

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.256
as Israel is preparing

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.525
for what looks like a ground incursion,

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.561
different proxies from Iran.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.662
But does that tell you something?

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:16.663
Yeah, it's a call for it's

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:17.897
a call for harassment.

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.232
It's a call for attacks.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.668
It is a jihad.

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:23.069
They are receiving information

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.270
from Iran saying

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.371
let's upped the ante

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:25.872
a little bit

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.574
and show our displeasure

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:29.142
at what's going on in Israel.

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:29.943
Moments ago,

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.711
a large group of people

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.312
were seen

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.147
rallying for the opening of the Rafah

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:36.182
crossing on the Egypt border.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:37.750
And you can see this.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.419
This is right outside that border

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.255
a few miles around that crossing.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.590
There's craters in front of it.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.924
We understand about 20 trucks.

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.726
Some of those drivers have told us

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:47.360
they actually saw

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.828
the Egyptian moving concrete

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:50.230
as if there was a mate,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.698
maybe the possibility of an opening.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:53.466
But subsequently, CNN

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:53.866
has learned

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:54.767
that the Rafah crossing

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.803
will not open today

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.172
as had been anticipated.

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:00.907
But that sense of on the ground

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.343
and that that terrain desert

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.911
gives you some perspective

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.212
on where we stand right now.

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:06.946
Just moments ago,

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:08.081
we did hear from the U.N.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.415
secretary general,

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:10.583
Antonio Gutierrez,

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.518
who is at the Rafah border

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.153
crossing on the Egyptian side.

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:15.888
So he is there you got a U.N.

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:17.190
compound on the other side

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.924
where where we know

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:18.958
people are better

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.093
supplied than most places,

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.661
but still with dwindling,

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:23.396
dwindling supplies.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.330
And of course, he's standing

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.431
where all those trucks loaded with

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:26.432
aid are waiting to enter

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:31.037
Behind these walls.

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:34.374
We have 2 million people

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:36.542
that is suffering enormously.

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:40.113
So these trucks are not just trucks.

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:43.583
They are a lifeline.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:45.451
They are the difference between life

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.854
and death for so many people.

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:49.589
In Gaza.

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.824
What we need is to make them move,

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:53.893
to make the move

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:56.996
to the other side of this wall, to make

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:59.132
the move as quickly as possible.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.672
So those cement blocks that I referenced,

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:07.440
we actually have video of that.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.341
CNN has obtained

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:09.842
that from some of these truck drivers

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:11.411
who are sitting there

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.712
night upon night and waiting,

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:13.579
moving those blocks

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.181
at the entrance of the crossing.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:16.549
There are those 20 trucks

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:17.750
they are expected to enter

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.452
once the crossing opens.

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:20.653
The United Nations is saying that

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:24.257
it needs, though, 100 trucks a day

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.091
to provide

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:27.760
adequate aid to the people inside Gaza.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.195
20 trucks right now.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:30.997
And they need 100 a day.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:31.931
This comes as Gaza's

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:33.766
main medical facility is in danger

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.935
of running out of fuel within hours.

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:37.704
No fuel has been coming into Gaza

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:39.238
now for days.

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:40.506
And, of course, to run a generator,

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.207
you need fuel.

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:43.209
All of that is now running out.

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.010
Doctors Without Borders

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.777
said yesterday

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:46.179
that the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.980
City only had enough fuel

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.817
to run its generators for 24 more hours.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.718
That hospital is

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:53.019
one of the few places in Gaza

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.887
that actually even has electricity

00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:55.822
for now.

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:57.056
And on that front,

00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:58.324
we have been getting dispatches

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:01.461
from people inside Gaza daily.

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:02.595
And, you know,

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:03.963
we get these small clips

00:06:03.963 --> 00:06:04.664
and they cut out

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:06.199
because of the phone connections

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.967
because they don't have the power.

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:09.569
Our journalist, Ibrahim Dam on Escape

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.170
Northern Gaza in the south was his wife

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.838
and two sons.

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:13.439
He's been filing these dispatches

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.540
for OUTFRONT every night.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.109
And here's his latest report on

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:17.410
the situation in Khan Younis.

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:22.148
A lot.

00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:24.050
And genuineness.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.151
I mean, Sarah, it matters.

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:28.287
A man in front of a lot newness

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:30.723
or no danger and official Baird

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:31.624
will be there.

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:33.693
And in between, the men

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:36.295
lurking the land mines and so on will

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:39.432
but the joy of newness

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:41.834
will cost very much right

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:43.603
JLP.

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:45.671
If anyone is sarbjit done.

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.410
I've done my hammamet my soul.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.710
Well, I'm

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.210
I've been

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:54.013
so budget done for my official fish,

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:56.983
my the shuttle side of the of joy.

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:59.952
We actually required to go and didn't get

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:02.155
a little bit of something a month ago.

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.122
So

00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:09.061
the world is turning into a white cloud.

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:10.730
Something poetic and profound

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.031
about that, that horrible image.

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:13.299
Joining us now is Apple Brand.

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:14.033
While the US

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:14.834
executive director

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.302
for Doctors Without Borders and Apple,

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:18.371
I appreciate speaking with you again.

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:18.871
I know that

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:20.673
you have a team in this main

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:22.742
hospital in Gaza, the Al-Shifa hospital.

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:23.576
Can you give us any

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.077
update on their situation

00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:27.847
Yes.

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:29.449
I mean, we are

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.050
really beside ourselves

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.119
because we often lose contact with them,

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:33.986
as you mentioned,

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:35.288
with the lack of electricity,

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.422
the inability to charge

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:39.392
phones, cell signals often being cut out,

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:40.893
very difficult

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:41.761
to get real time

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:43.062
information from the team.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:44.430
And what we do know

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.798
is that our medical coordinator

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:46.532
was warning

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:48.334
that the fuel was reaching

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:49.869
catastrophic lows.

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:51.204
And of course, they will ration

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:52.805
they will try to stretch it out

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:53.706
as much as possible

00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:55.141
because you need that fuel

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.542
to run generator

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.611
for the lifesaving medical equipment,

00:07:58.611 --> 00:07:59.812
including incubators

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:02.081
for neonates, dialysis machines

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:03.883
and just just general functioning

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.251
for all the trauma surgeries

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:06.085
that they're trying to do.
