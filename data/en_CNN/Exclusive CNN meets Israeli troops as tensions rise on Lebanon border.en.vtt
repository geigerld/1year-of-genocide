00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.633
Over the last

00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.534
24 hours or

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:04.070
so, there has been intensifying exchanges

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.238
of fire between

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.040
Israel and Hezbollah

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.509
militants that operate inside Lebanon.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:10.543
Hezbollah is

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.312
a terrorist organization

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.080
that gets support from Iran,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.582
but operates as a quasi

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.083
governmental force, really

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.352
inside the borders of Lebanon.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.286
They've been going back

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.421
and forth with Israel

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.490
over the last seven days.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.191
United Nations peacekeepers

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.526
who operate inside

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:27.394
southern Lebanon

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.661
say that their headquarters

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.296
were hit by a wayward rocket.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.132
Luckily, no one was hurt there.

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:32.799
But it gives you

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.801
a sense of the situation

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.703
along that border with Israel now

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.204
saying that people who live

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.206
within two kilometers of that border

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.374
should evacuate.

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.243
28 villages concern.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.545
Our Matthew Chance is in northern Israel,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.247
not far from that border right now.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:48.848
Matthew, give us the situation

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.187
a very tense situation up

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.889
here, close to the Lebanese border here.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:56.656
Right

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.290
within the past

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.991
few hours,

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.193
the Israeli military has ordered 28

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.595
Israeli communities to evacuate

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:03.463
from their

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.365
positions very close to that frontier

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:06.866
with Lebanon.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.868
And so that's in process now.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:09.669
And that follows

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.539
a string of cross-border attacks

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.373
that have been taking place

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.241
over the course of the past 24 hours,

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.743
or in fact, even longer than that.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.645
But nine rocket attacks

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:19.712
according to

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.481
the Israeli Defense Forces

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.550
over the course of the past 24 hours.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.617
They've responded to that

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.920
with air strikes and artillery strikes,

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:28.621
some of which we can hear

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.689
are being launched

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:30.490
from very close

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.958
to this location here,

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.828
close to the Lebanese border.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.396
We were also able, though,

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:38.665
to gain some access to that exclusion

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:39.966
zone close to the border.

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.468
It's actually four kilometers,

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.436
about two and a half miles

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.404
back from the border

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:46.773
that they've now said is off limits

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.074
to Israeli civilians.

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:49.742
They gave us access and showed us

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:53.146
where
the basically that the front lines were.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.982
It's also the place, remember,

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:58.918
which could really turn this conflict

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:00.987
inside Israel into a much broader

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.222
regional war.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.124
And so it's a very dangerous

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.558
sort of tipping point here

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:06.326
in northern Israel.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.060
Still,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.561
all the civilians that we talk

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:10.497
we talked to most of them, at least

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:12.232
the soldiers, the politicians

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:13.733
that I've been in contact with as well.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.036
They are so enraged,

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:18.938
so angry at what happened

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.708
in Gaza last weekend that they say

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.943
they are ready, even bristling

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:24.978
for a fight with Hezbollah.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:25.812
Take a listen to what one

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.413
Israeli commander told me right

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:30.517
close to the Lebanese border.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:33.553
Are you hopeful still that

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:36.556
Hezbollah will stay out of this war?

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.992
I hope there will be another front.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:40.994
We need to destroy Hezbollah.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.695
You hope there will be another front.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:43.496
You want the war?

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.999
Yes. Why?

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.801
What Hamas did in Gaza,

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.637
it didn't come from nowhere.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:51.905
It came from Hezbollah.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.706
It came from Iran.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.075
And in order for us to stop

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:57.343
what happened from Hamas,

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.445
we need to stop them also.

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:02.882
Yeah, John.

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:03.616
And the big difference

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.385
now, of course, is that for some reason,

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.687
the Israeli military were not ready

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.055
during the Gaza attacks.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.790
They are very ready up here

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.692
in the north of the country.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.793
Matthew was really extraordinary

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:15.161
to see him pointing right there.

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:15.695
It gives you a sense

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:16.629
of how close they are.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:17.363
He was merely

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.165
just pointing a little bit north

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.433
to where
Hezbollah operates

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.168
with these extremely powerful

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.736
and well-trained militias.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:24.304
Matthew Chance

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:26.172
in northern Israel, please stay safe.

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:26.506
U.S.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.540
Secretary of State

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.810
Tony Blinken is back in Israel Today,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.579
he's been in the region traveling

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.247
all throughout the region.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:35.348
For days now.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:36.549
We're standing by to see

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.051
if Blinken will speak to reporters

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:38.818
this hour.

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:39.552
A critical update

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:40.720
potentially coming from him,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.321
given the news

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.722
that you just reported, John.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.257
The IDF offered

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:46.426
this also a sobering update

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.260
on the hostages

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.461
taken by Hamas terrorists.

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:48.895
They now

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:52.932
believe 199 people are being held hostage

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.100
by Hamas in Gaza.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.635
They've also said over the weekend

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:56.502
that some

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.371
may have been killed in transit,

00:03:58.371 --> 00:03:59.405
if you will,

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:02.475
during the trip from Israel into Gaza.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:05.111
Sara Sidner is right now in Haifa,

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.479
Israel, where U.S.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.982
evacuations are underway. Hey, Sara.

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:14.487
Hey, Kate and John.

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.923
It's good to see you guys there.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:17.757
Safe and sound.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.125
We are safe and sound at the moment.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:20.727
Here in Haifa,

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:21.928
Israel, where we have

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.097
just watched in the last 2 hours.

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:25.665
A huge ship

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.133
taking away Americans

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.502
out of the danger zone and to Cyprus.

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:30.436
We'll get to that in just a minute.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:30.770
But first,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.472
I want to go to our Jeremy Diamond,

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.674
who has been tracking the whereabouts

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:37.010
and and the conversations

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.077
that Anthony Blinken

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:38.778
has been having

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:39.912
the secretary of state here

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:42.582
for the second time in just a week

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:44.250
as Israel prepares

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.853
for a potential ground war with Gaza.

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:49.022
And as this war rages on.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:49.756
What can you tell us,

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:51.858
Jeremy, about the plans here?

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:54.627
What Secretary Blinken is doing back here

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:56.396
again, why it was so important

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:58.398
for him to show up in this country

00:04:58.398 --> 00:04:59.432
a second time in

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:00.667
such a short amount of time

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:04.437
Well, Sarah, just to give

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:04.837
you a sense

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:06.072
of how fluid

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:07.740
the situation on the ground is right

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.875
now, the secretary,

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.276
even the reporter is traveling

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:11.611
with the secretary of state,

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:12.912
really haven't had a clear sense

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:13.446
of exactly

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:15.181
who he's been meeting with and when,

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.050
although we did just get a readout

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.252
from the secretary of state spokesman

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:21.354
that he did indeed meet with the Israeli

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:22.288
prime minister

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:23.756
as well as the presidents

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.525
of Israel, Isaac Herzog.

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:27.260
And in these readouts,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.861
we don't have a ton of details,

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:29.796
but it's clear

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.998
what the focus of these discussions is

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:34.967
It is the release of those hostages

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:36.302
being held in Gaza.

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.770
And it is, of course,

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.207
the situation regarding humanitarian aid

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:43.209
being able to flow into Gaza

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.177
and having Americans

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:44.644
who are trapped

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:47.013
in Gaza be able to exit southward

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:48.748
and into Egypt.

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:49.382
Over the last

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:49.949
several days,

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.451
there has been a lot of finger pointing,

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.486
a lot of conflicting information

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.153
concerning

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:56.022
when or whether that Rafah

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.424
crossing between Gaza and Egypt

00:05:58.424 --> 00:05:59.625
might indeed open.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:00.660
The Egyptian officials

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.929
have blamed the Israelis at time.

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:04.697
At times.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.332
And there's been a lot of

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:07.700
conflicting information.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.801
US embassy officials

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.703
telling Americans inside of Gaza

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:11.804
to head for that crossing,

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.039
expecting it to open.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.607
But as of yet,

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:16.142
we have not seen any evidence

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:18.044
that that crossing has indeed open.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:18.811
So the question is

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:20.313
whether at the end of this day,

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:21.914
as the secretary of state concludes

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.049
a series of meetings

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.584
with Israeli officials,

00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:25.852
whether we will be in a place

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:27.053
where humanitarian aid

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.621
will start flowing into Gaza,

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:29.856
and whether those Americans

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:31.157
and perhaps other civilians

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:34.260
will be able to exit Gaza and into Egypt.

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:36.062
Amid all of this,

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.330
we also have the Israeli prime

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.331
minister inviting

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:41.267
President Joe Biden to come visit Israel

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.602
The president

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:43.803
so far not confirming

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:44.303
whether or not

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:45.638
he intends to visit Israel.

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:47.073
But we do know that today

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:47.740
he was scheduled

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.442
to take a trip to Colorado.

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.344
He canceled that trip at the last minute

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:52.345
staying at the White House

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:53.246
instead for what

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.013
they are describing

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:55.915
as national security meetings,

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.183
whether that is a prelude

00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:59.185
to a presidential visit here to Israel.

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:00.753
We do not yet know.

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:01.954
But of course, the situation

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:04.023
on the ground remains extremely fluid.

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.725
We just had sirens

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.593
nearby here in Jerusalem, rockets

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.629
being fired in central Israel.

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:10.730
And all of this, again,

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.698
amid preparations by Israel

00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:14.534
for a potential ground invasion. Sara,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:18.704
Jared Diamond,

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:20.706
you have been so great on this story.

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:22.842
Thank you so much for breaking that down

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:23.276
for us.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.744
Another important

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:25.778
meeting between the U.S.

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:26.813
secretary of state

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:28.848
and many of the leadership here

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:29.782
in Israel.

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:30.783
I do want to mention

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.151
why I'm here and why I'm

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:33.286
where I am in Haifa.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.420
We are about 85

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.721
miles from the Lebanon border

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:36.689
where there have been rockets

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:37.890
that have come over,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.693
but far, far, far fewer than

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:44.297
what has come out of Gaza, shot by Hamas

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.766
here, rockets coming over the border

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.601
because of Hezbollah,

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.603
a sworn enemy of Israel's.

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:51.804
But for the most part,

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:54.540
it has been quiet here in the north.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.742
But what has also happened

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:58.010
is that the United States

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.612
has been getting so many inquiries

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:00.646
from Americans

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.782
who can't simply get out of Israel

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:03.883
during wartime,

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.284
many of them with children

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:06.752
who are concerned about their safety,

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:08.521
both mentally and physically.

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:09.989
Finally, the United States

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:13.626
was able to charter an enormous ship

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:15.461
that left from this port

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.163
a couple of hours ago.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.165
And on it were American families

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.434
who had been stuck here for days

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:23.936
as the war raged on, unable to leave

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.271
because there aren't enough flights

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:26.639
those flights are very sparse

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:27.707
and almost all of them

00:08:27.707 --> 00:08:30.476
are completely packed, leaving Israel.

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:32.111
So this was one way

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:34.146
to try to get hundreds of Americans

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:35.381
out of Israel.

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:37.250
They just took this.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.618
They are currently in the water

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:43.055
on a ten hour travel time to Cyprus,

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:44.357
which is where they will get off

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.225
and be able to book their flights

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:47.460
back to the United States.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.262
We spoke to several families

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:51.063
about why they came.

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:52.832
Many of them live here in Israel.

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.033
They are American citizens

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:56.035
who have chosen to live here in Israel.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.837
Some of them have been helping

00:08:57.837 --> 00:08:58.938
troops on the border

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:01.007
with Lebanon, taking them supplies,

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:02.041
trying to do their part

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.042
for the war effort.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.377
But but many just said, look,

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.778
it is time for us

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:07.313
to get our kids to safety

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:08.180
and to

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.849
calm the nerves of our family members

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:10.917
who have been watching all this from

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.051
the United States. Take a listen.

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:14.554
U.S.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.322
citizens and the U.S.

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:19.058
embassy made it pretty

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:22.094
easy to have a way.

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.629
And if for some reason

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:27.233
the borders are closed, we'll swim back

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:29.635
Becky.

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.271
All right. So you heard that.

00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:34.574
She also said, look, we are coming back

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.375
and all of them said the same thing.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.511
We will be back in Israel.

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.513
We consider this our home as well.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.882
No matter how long it takes,

00:09:42.882 --> 00:09:44.383
we will be back here

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:45.084
to this country,

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:46.619
a country that they love as

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:47.853
much as the United States.
