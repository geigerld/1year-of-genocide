00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.336
This just in a new candid message

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:05.372
from President Biden on Israel.

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.340
At a fund raiser in Washington

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.742
just a short while ago,

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:09.909
Biden told donors

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.178
that Israel is losing support

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.413
around the world.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:14.381
And Prime Minister

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:14.814
Benjamin

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.150
Netanyahu needs to change his hard

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.284
line government.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.486
CNN's Arlette Signs

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.287
joins us from the White House.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:22.188
Wow.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.289
These are pretty

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.259
stark words from a president who has been

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.629
in a robust way, supportive

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:30.063
of what

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:32.665
the Israeli government has been doing.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:33.700
Yeah, that's right, Dana.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.301
These are very candid comments.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:36.302
Perhaps President Biden's

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.971
most candid comments

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:38.972
about the conflict

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.740
between Israel and Hamas.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.341
The president

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.309
made these comments at an off

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.145
camera closed door fundraiser.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:47.447
So we have a pool report

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.282
that's offering some quotes from that.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.451
And it said that President Biden

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.185
had warned

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.421
that Israel was beginning to lose support

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.756
amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza.

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:58.558
And the president suggested

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.360
that it may be time for Israeli

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.295
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:03.663
to change his government.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.865
The quotes say that

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.634
Netanyahu has a tough decision

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:08.468
to make and quote,

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.003
this is the most conservative government

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:10.503
in Israel's

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:11.371
history, Biden

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.206
said, adding that the government doesn't

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.141
want a two-State solution.

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.009
The president added

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.010
that Israel was beginning

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.378
to lose support around the world.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:18.711
And said

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:20.513
Netanyahu, quote, has to strengthen

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.682
and change the Israeli government.

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:23.550
But it does come,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.285
as you have seen President Biden

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:26.619
very publicly stand

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.721
shoulder to shoulder with Netanyahu.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.423
But there have been some warnings

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.792
specifically about the campaign in Gaza

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:34.861
and the mounting civilian casualties.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:36.229
There's been

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.731
widespread criticism about that.

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:39.632
And President Biden

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:40.700
has warned

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.202
Israel to take more caution

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.470
to protect civilian life.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.204
But these are certainly

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:44.804
some of the president's

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:46.206
most candid comments

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:46.906
as he is warning

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:47.640
that Netanyahu

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.576
is losing support around the world.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.810
Thank you so much for that.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.712
Our Latin reporters are back here.

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:53.546
Jeff Mason,

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:55.982
to me,

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:57.183
obviously,

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.751
what Arlette was just reporting

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.521
is, is kind of the headline that he said.

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.257
He warned that Israel is losing support.

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:07.627
But also this, the second quote

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.096
which explains may be the first quote.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.332
This is the most conservative government

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.100
in Israel's history,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.768
adding that the Israeli government

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:18.571
doesn't want to a state solution.

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:20.773
Am I reading too much into this

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:22.075
to say that?

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.811
Never mind the war,

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.112
that the administration

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:27.347
and the president himself

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:30.483
is starting to see a finish line

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.886
for Prime Minister Netanyahu and

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:36.055
kind of saying the quiet part out loud

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.056
that maybe it's time

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.491
for that government

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:39.058
to change

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:40.026
which people in Israel

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:40.860
expect to happen

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.128
after the war is over anyway?

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:42.996
I absolutely do.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:43.863
And I don't think you're reading

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:44.531
too much into it.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:45.798
I think the Biden administration

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:46.232
is focused

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.101
on what happens when the war is over.

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.402
And you've heard the president

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:49.836
and others

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:50.670
in his administration

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.172
talk about a two state solution

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.174
a lot in the last few weeks.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.041
They want to be sure

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.209
that there is somebody in place

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.844
that actually supports that

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.012
and this government does it.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.347
I think it's also telling that he said

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.949
Israel is doing indiscriminate

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.617
bombing over Gaza.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.986
And it comes after last night he was

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.521
he had a reception

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.757
at the White House for Hanukkah.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.091
And he gave an anecdote

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.660
about having a picture

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.961
taken with Bibi Netanyahu

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:15.662
decades ago

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:16.663
when they first met each other.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:17.597
And he said

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:19.399
on the back of that picture,

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.601
I wrote an inscription saying,

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:22.302
I love you,

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.470
but I don't agree with anything you say.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.072
And he followed up by that

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:26.973
and followed up with that

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:27.941
last night saying.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.143
And that pretty much applies today, too.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:31.544
So there's a shift.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:34.047
And today, the fundraiser comment

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.014
and his comment last night

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.183
as a signal of that And Paul Cain,

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:39.018
you spend all your time on Capitol Hill

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.587
where there

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:42.021
certainly is a lot of support

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.057
for Israel, bipartisan support.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.358
But there is

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:48.061
a rift among the president's own party.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.395
Yeah, look, the

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.132
Israel for Democrats is

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.968
I'm not comparing the

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:55.702
how the wars

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:57.270
are being conducted in the players,

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.838
but in terms of the politics.

00:03:58.838 --> 00:03:59.973
Israel for Democrats

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:00.673
in some ways

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:03.743
is becoming like Ukraine for Republicans.

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:06.079
They their base

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.181
the Democratic base is not happy

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:10.883
with how Israel is conducting this war.

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:12.151
And they are

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:14.220
they're showing up at senators' offices

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.623
here in Washington. And back home.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:17.991
They are showing up everywhere

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.125
and protesting.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:21.227
And so they're right now,

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:21.561
they are

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.696
the loudest voices on this issue

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.465
in the Democratic coalition.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:26.766
And Democratic

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.301
lawmakers are reflecting that.

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:28.835
And yet

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:29.269
and yet

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.103
you have

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:30.703
the Secretary

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:31.838
of State, Antony Blinken,

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:34.307
as soon as as recently as Sunday

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:36.776
on with Jake Tapper, who has said

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.244
for some time

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:40.313
that Israel needs to be more careful

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:43.616
when it comes to civilians and killing

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.052
civilians as they try to root out Hamas.

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:48.955
But also said, again,

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:50.690
he understands and the U.S.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.091
government understands

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.326
that Israel

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.561
is doing its best to root out Hamas

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.564
and that Hamas is using its own civilians

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:00.099
as human shields. Right.

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.968
They've been saying both things

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:02.535
all along,

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:03.603
which is they

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:04.804
aren't going to tell Israel

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.639
how to conduct this war,

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.207
but then also saying

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.143
that they need to make sure

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:10.910
that they minimize

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.745
civilian casualties, abide

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.247
by the laws of war.

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:15.148
And they've stressed

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.549
that over and over again.

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:18.584
And you can see that the president,

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:19.819
as well as his White House,

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.287
their patience is wearing thin

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:22.322
because they feel as though

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.589
they've been saying that

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.826
privately, publicly, in the conversations

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.462
that the president has with Netanyahu,

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:30.530
he has said this.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.665
And yet it appears as though

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:34.500
Israel is not really listening

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.335
to the White House.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:35.501
Yeah,

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.035
the president

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:37.670
is clearly looking for a finish line.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.638
And that finish line

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:40.640
the White House does not believe includes

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:42.241
Prime Minister

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.543
Benjamin Netanyahu

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:45.645
on the top of the Israeli government.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:47.580
Really, really interesting development.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.648
The U.N. is again

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:49.849
debating whether to demand

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.751
a cease fire on Gaza.

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:52.218
CNN's

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:53.920
Nic Robertson is tracking that story

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.621
for us. Nic, so the U.N.

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:56.322
General Assembly

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:57.990
appears set to demand a vote

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.459
for an immediate cease

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:00.660
fire, this days

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.861
after the Security Council

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:03.963
failed to agree on a similar call

00:06:03.963 --> 00:06:05.732
because of a U.S. veto.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:09.001
Walk us through what this vote may mean.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.739
Yeah, immediate ceasefire and immediate

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:15.141
unconditional humanitarian access

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.242
into Gaza as well.

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:18.177
Those will be the same two demands

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:21.180
expected as were pushed on Friday,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.682
rejected by that veto

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:23.549
by the United States.

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:24.517
The Security Council.

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:26.486
So this is the General Assembly.

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:30.556
193 nations able to vote.

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.392
And I think a lot of people

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.993
will be watching to see

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.661
how the needle has shifted

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.764
in opinion about Israel,

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:41.200
because this is a non-binding vote.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.469
It needs a two thirds majority to pass

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:45.605
And it may well pass,

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:46.472
but it doesn't mean it's

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:47.407
going to come into effect.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.641
There's no enforcement.

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:50.276
So this really becomes a measure

00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:51.511
of trying to the U.N.

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:52.345
General Assembly,

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:53.045
if you will,

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:55.548
trying to send an even stronger message

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:56.082
to Israel.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:56.916
Back in October,

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.384
there was a vote

00:06:58.384 --> 00:06:59.485
along along

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:02.688
broadly similar terms, but 121 voted

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:06.492
for 14 against 44 abstentions.

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:08.594
So if the number of votes

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:11.197
for this immediate cease fire

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.832
and immediate humanitarian access

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:14.033
goes up,

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:16.803
then that shows that the dial is shifting

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:18.671
and pressure on Israel.

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:21.174
Will it make a difference to to Israel?

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:21.941
Potentially not.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.075
But there's a real desperate

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:24.277
effort underway

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.711
to try to find ways

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:26.679
internationally now

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:28.681
to signal to Israel that

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.950
that this cannot continue in Gaza.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.185
The high civilian casualty

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:33.152
toll the

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:33.986
the desperate

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:36.355
and worsening humanitarian situation

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:37.924
cannot continue,

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:39.692
and that that is, in essence,

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.027
what this vote will be about,

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:43.763
because it cannot enforce anything.

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:46.365
And that's expected to begin

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.234
in the next couple of hours.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.436
The US once again expected to veto.

00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:52.138
But as our reporting suggests,

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.072
the US

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:53.940
has behind closed

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.408
doors told the Israelis

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.943
that they have weeks left

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:59.612
to continue the operation at the pace

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:00.746
and magnitude

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:02.448
at which it's being conducted now

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:03.349
in Gaza.

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:05.351
Nic Robertson, thank you as always.
