00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.209
Prosecutor Kerim Hahn,

00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:02.961
welcome to the program.

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:04.129
Thank you for having me.

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:07.132
And of course, we're here at the ICC.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:08.925
You are today

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:11.386
announcing that you are applying

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:12.971
for arrest warrants

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:16.683
for top military and political leadership

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.894
in the Israel Gaza war

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.480
since the October 7th events.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.400
First and foremost, explain to me exactly

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.610
what you're asking for and who you are

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.237
charging today.

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.822
Christiane, we've applied for warrants

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.824
to the pretrial chamber

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.035
of the International Criminal Court

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.371
in relation to three individuals

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.582
that are Hamas members,

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.375
Sinwar, who's in charge on the ground?

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.335
That's Yahya Sinwar. Absolutely.

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:45.462
Deif,

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:48.465
who's in charge of the custom Brigade.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.550
And Haniya,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.343
who's one of their political bureau

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:53.261
based in Doha.

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:55.263
Let me just for everybody to understand,

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.348
Yassin was the head of what they call

00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:58.600
the Islamic Resistance

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.684
movement, Hamas,

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:00.769
the military operation,

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.437
or even even wider.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:03.897
Mohammad Dhiab, Ibrahim

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.690
al Masri, otherwise known as Dave,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.109
commander in chief of the Military Wings

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.486
al-Hassan Brigade,

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.780
and Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.282
political bureau.

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:16.868
What are the charges?

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:19.871
The charges are extermination, murder,

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:21.247
taking of hostages,

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.793
rape and sexual assault in detention.

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:27.420
So these are the key

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.422
crimes that are alleged

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.131
to have been committed

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:31.841
by these two individuals.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.051
The world was shocked

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.135
on the 7th of October

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:35.512
when people were ripped

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.097
from their bedrooms, from their homes,

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:40.642
from the different kibbutzim in Israel.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.186
And people have suffered enormously.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:44.562
And we have a variety of evidence

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:46.356
to support the applications

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:47.857
that we've submitted to the judges.

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:50.235
And just tell us what the evidence is.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:50.735
Obviously,

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:54.948
the world has seen the real time images.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.116
The Israeli government

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.450
has put out videos

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.036
which it said to the UN and others

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.621
journalists about what happened.

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:05.375
There are body cams on many of the Hamas

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:07.502
fighters, whoever was there at the time.

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.921
Is that the evidence or do you have more?

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.923
We have more.

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:12.674
We have

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.926
authenticated videos and photographs.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:17.679
We have CCTV

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.389
camera pictures.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.808
We have eyewitness evidence.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.560
We have evidence of survivors.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.061
I mean, it is remarkable

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.313
the victims and survivors

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.940
that have from Israel

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.733
that have engaged with my office

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.318
have this

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.695
righteous demand for justice

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:36.281
and accountability. They've come here.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.407
I've also met them

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:40.410
in the different kibbutzim, and they want

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.829
justice and accountability.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.914
So we have expert evidence.

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:47.792
So there's a whole variety of information

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:49.127
that we have authenticated

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.254
that we think is relevant and probative.

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:52.297
And that is sufficient,

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.923
we say, to sustain the

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:54.382
the crimes

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.009
that we put forward to the judges.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.844
You have also issued warrants

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.846
against the top political

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:00.513
and military

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:01.806
leadership of the government

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.933
of the state of Israel.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.101
We've applied for warrants.

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:05.560
Of course,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.270
the judges must determine

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.479
whether or not to issue them.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.440
But we've applied today

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.399
will apply for warrants

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.402
for Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:17.405
and also Minister of Defense Galant

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:20.700
for crimes of

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:22.535
causing

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:26.414
extermination and causing starvation

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:27.248
as a method of war,

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:28.666
including the denial

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:31.211
of humanitarian relief supplies,

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.587
deliberately targeting

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.297
civilians in in conflict.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.673
And

00:03:35.673 --> 00:03:37.133
the sad thing really is in relation

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.427
to both categories,

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:42.180
I have been saying repeatedly

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.890
in

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.018
Cairo in October last year at the Rafah

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.102
crossing

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:51.439
on Israeli television in Ramallah,

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:54.400
everywhere I can to the parties,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.985
to the conflict,

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.696
complain now, don't complain later.

00:03:58.696 --> 00:03:59.906
And of course, hostages

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.783
have not been released.

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:05.954
That insidious crime continues

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.790
for so many innocent Israelis

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.541
that are in custody,

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.626
you know, held hostage

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:13.044
by Hamas and families

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.671
that are waiting for their return.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.547
And of course, we see pictures

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:18.258
of starving children,

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.093
of emaciated children.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.930
We have a variety of evidence to support,

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:25.306
not polemics, but evidence

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:27.100
that's been forensically analyzed

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.226
to sustain the charge

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.227
also of starvation

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:32.605
being used by Netanyahu and Galant

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:33.523
as a method of war.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.275
And it's awful that in 2024,

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:38.069
we have had to submit these applications

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.238
to the judges of the ICC for warrants.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.864
I'm going to get into starvation

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.157
as a weapon of war in a moment.

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:44.742
But first, I want to ask you.

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:45.994
The word genocide

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.413
has been used by both sides

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:51.416
and many believe that genocide

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.625
is being committed.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:53.626
But you do not

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.670
you're not using that word.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.920
Well,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.338
this is an active investigation

00:04:57.338 --> 00:04:59.716
and we have a

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:00.550
criminal charges

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.176
that we can use genocide,

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:04.679
war crimes and crimes against humanity

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.264
in relation to this current stage

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.724
of investigations.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:08.474
The charges

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.059
that we have put forward to the judges

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.312
do not include genocide,

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.147
but we are continuing to investigate.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.149
It's a very complex situation.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.401
We have not been allowed access into Gaza

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.902
by the Israeli authorities.

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:22.780
We are also continuing our investigations

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.615
in relation to the Hamas attacks.

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.909
And if and when the evidence points us

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.745
in a particular direction,

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:29.996
we will not hesitate to act.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.873
So it's still an active investigation.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:33.750
But yes, today we haven't.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.253
What is extermination? It's mass killing.

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.421
Different than genocide.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:38.963
Yes.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.716
Genocide is defined by specific intent,

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:45.470
not only killing, but an intention

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:47.013
to destroy the group in whole

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.265
or in part to be suspiciously content,

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.184
to destroy the group in whole or in part.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.810
So we're not

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:53.770
we have not

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.356
included in our application today

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.523
a request for warrants

00:05:57.523 --> 00:05:58.900
for the crime of genocide.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.318
So extermination, war

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.570
crimes, crimes against humanity.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.364
I want to ask you about starvation,

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.033
because although it was accepted

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:09.994
by the ICC as a war crime

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.497
when you were created in 1998,

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:13.498
I don't believe it's ever

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:14.540
been prosecuted

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.210
before as a weapon of war.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.920
No, it's not that I'm aware of.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.881
I think, unfortunately,

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.257
this situation will be a first.

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:24.300
And it's very unusual.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.888
We see a population,

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:31.516
large numbers of children and women

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.434
that have already endured

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:36.938
more than 17 years of a very rigid regime

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:40.942
of allowing goods into Gaza.

00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:43.361
I think even in 2022, the United Nations

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.487
and others said

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.782
that 80% of the population,

00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:49.075
you know,

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:52.078
lived on humanitarian supplies.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.121
And that's just become

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:55.081
even more pernicious

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.166
since the 8th of October

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:59.210
with all the other restrictions.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.044
And,

00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:00.294
you know,

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:00.670
the words

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.421
of the Secretary-General

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.089
of the United Nations, of the head

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.132
of the Office

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:06.134
of Coordination, of Humanitarian

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:07.718
Humanitarian Affairs, Martin Griffiths,

00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:09.554
W.H.O., UNICEF.

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:10.680
I mean, it seems everybody

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.432
in the international firmament

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:15.435
has spoken with grave concern.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.353
A extreme concern,

00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:19.897
but we haven't seen food,

00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:21.732
water, medicines

00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:22.984
go to the most vulnerable.

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.152
And they have those rights

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:25.695
not because of

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:26.612
something that I'm saying

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.156
it's because it's required

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.323
in the Geneva Conventions

00:07:29.323 --> 00:07:31.242
and it's required in the Rome Statute.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:33.119
So as of April 17th,

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.746
according to humanitarian organizations

00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:36.789
and the authorities,

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:39.167
whatever exist on the ground in Gaza,

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:42.044
28 children under 12 have died,

00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:43.463
including 12 babies

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.422
about a month old,

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:47.216
because of malnutrition related

00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:48.885
conditions.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.136
The defense minister, you

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:50.678
have Galland,

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:51.429
who today

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.139
you are issuing an arrest warrant

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.891
or the request for an arrest warrant

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.350
for said on October 9th,

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.769
two days after October 7th.

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:00.980
We are imposing a complete siege.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.440
There will be no electricity,

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.775
no food, no water, no fuel.

00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:06.235
Everything is closed.

00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:07.987
We are fighting human animals

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.781
and we will act accordingly.

00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:11.282
Prime Minister

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:12.450
Netanyahu on October

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.577
13th said We will exact a price

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:15.995
that will be remembered by them

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:16.746
and Israel's

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:21.167
other enemies for decades to come.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.753
Are those is that the basis

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:27.381
on which you establish intent,

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:30.051
or is that what is that

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.302
much of your evidence?

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.303
Much more than that.

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:33.346
But yes,

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.180
some of the words

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.017
uttered by the two individuals,

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.352
Minister of Defense Gallant

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.354
and Prime Minister Netanyahu,

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.773
are, of course, probative and relevant.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:47.276
The fact that so many other individuals

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.987
have said, you know, words like there's

00:08:49.987 --> 00:08:50.571
no such thing

00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.032
as an innocent civilian in Gaza.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:55.034
They're all responsible.

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:55.535
The words

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.912
by members of the security committee.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:00.456
I mean, there's a whole variety of words

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:02.833
that are said and done by the government

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:04.168
that have not been disowned,

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:05.962
that have not been

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:07.880
denied, that have not that

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.798
they do to individuals,

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.841
have not disassociated themselves from.

00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:11.926
And I think that's relevant.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:12.718
But it's again, it's

00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:15.346
a very complex operation.

00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:18.849
It's not just the denial of aid.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.811
It's the fact that as an occupying power,

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.480
Israel has an affirmative obligation

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.775
to make sure food and the objects

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:29.527
indispensable to survival

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:30.736
get to the civilians,

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.280
have an affirmative obligation

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.781
that in control of the north of Gaza,

00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:37.243
for example, IDF tanks are in situ.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.703
They could guard

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:39.912
aid convoys going in

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.289
and making sure it goes to the camps.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:42.498
They're not doing that.

00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:43.958
But in addition, one

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.793
has to look at a wider aspect.

00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:48.045
Water has been cut off.

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.422
Electricity

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.674
has been plants have been

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:53.092
either destroyed or targeted.

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:54.635
Fuel can't go in.

00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:56.178
Desalination

00:09:56.178 --> 00:10:00.516
plants are completely dysfunctional.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.392
There's no

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:03.728
desalination plant in the north of Gaza

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.438
at all.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:08.441
Water purification tablets,

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.235
filtration systems have been classified

00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:13.571
as dual use

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.448
objects, as have incubators,

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:16.907
as has oxygen for hospital,

00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:18.909
as have anesthetics.

00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:21.370
One sees

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.039
90% of all the greenhouses

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:26.042
in the north of Gaza destroyed 40% of

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.961
the land that was used for agriculture

00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:31.839
has been destroyed since

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.382
the conflict started.

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:36.385
70% of the fishing vessels,

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:39.388
I mean, every avenue

00:10:39.388 --> 00:10:43.059
that is so important to human survival

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:44.352
has been constrained

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.187
or suffocated because of a policy.

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.688
And the words of the Secretary-General

00:10:47.688 --> 00:10:49.065
of the United Nations,

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.441
which said we're at breaking point.

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:53.611
The words of UNICEF, the words of UNWRA,

00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:55.029
saying that we've got a trickle of aid

00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:58.032
in a sea of need, all of these, you know,

00:10:58.032 --> 00:10:59.909
giants of the international system,

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.661
their words, that concerns

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.037
have been put to one side,

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:05.289
unfortunately, in the face of

00:11:05.289 --> 00:11:06.332
other imperatives.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:09.460
And what seems to be a bit also filth,

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.587
the collective punishment of the

00:11:11.587 --> 00:11:12.713
people of Gaza.

00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:14.924
What is the international law

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:15.925
on the restrictions

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:16.926
that you're talking about

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:17.551
and for instance,

00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:19.303
the checking of aid convoys?

00:11:19.303 --> 00:11:20.638
The Israeli government says

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:23.140
it is at war with a terror organization

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.850
and has worked in coordination

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.018
with the US, Egypt

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:27.603
and international aid agencies

00:11:27.603 --> 00:11:29.397
to get aid in.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.774
Netanyahu himself, on October 29th,

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:34.527
after two weeks of nothing getting in

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.194
another week

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:36.821
later said we must prevent

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.865
a humanitarian disaster.

00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:41.200
What do you make of those words

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.493
and what is the law

00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:45.746
on stopping and checking aid convoys?

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:48.124
See, we have to look at words

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.792
and analyze them against

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.502
what is taking place.

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:52.086
Prime Minister

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.671
Netanyahu has been on the record

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:54.880
to say that

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.425
the access of humanitarian aid

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:59.468
gives Israel important leeway

00:11:59.468 --> 00:12:00.428
that is being used.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.637
Have talked about a diplomatic

00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:03.055
iron dome as part of,

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:03.347
you know,

00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:04.974
allowing aid in and not allowing aid

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:06.308
and all the rest of it.

00:12:06.308 --> 00:12:08.561
Israel has every right

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:12.022
not to give succor to Hamas.

00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:13.691
That is not contested.

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:15.025
Israel has every right

00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:15.276
and did

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:18.070
an obligation to get hostages back.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:18.821
But you must do so

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.948
by complying with the law.

00:12:20.948 --> 00:12:24.744
The fact that Hamas fighters need water

00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:27.037
doesn't justify denying water

00:12:27.037 --> 00:12:29.915
from all the civilian population of Gaza.

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:30.916
There is an obligation,

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.042
as I said, it's an affirmative

00:12:32.042 --> 00:12:32.460
in addition

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.127
to everything else

00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:34.420
is an affirmative obligation

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.255
as an occupying power

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:39.175
that Israel is to make sure water,

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.761
medicines, anesthetics, insulin

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.387
goes to the people that need it.

00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:45.431
If tanks can go in, why can't those tanks

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:49.101
and those soldiers guard aid convoys?

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:52.021
So there's a lot of

00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:54.315
deficiencies that give rise

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.358
not just to recklessness

00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:57.818
or negligence or indifference,

00:12:57.818 --> 00:12:58.736
but seems to be part

00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:03.407
of a criminal common plan to deny

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.826
these objects in dispensing both

00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:06.535
to the survival

00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:08.204
of the civilian population.

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.538
And how many doctors

00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:10.289
have to talk about

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.541
amputating the limbs of little babies

00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:14.126
or children without anesthetic,

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:16.128
or how many people need to die

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:16.962
without insulin,

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:20.299
or how many people with severe burns

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:21.342
can be left

00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:22.009
by the doctors

00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:23.052
and the different hospitals

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:23.719
because they don't have

00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:25.221
antibiotic creams for burns

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:27.014
and they can't save them without that

00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:28.057
for us to realize

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:29.266
that the law is being breached.

00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:31.143
Now, this is what we have analyzed

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:33.020
and we've presented it for judges

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.063
who make the final decision

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.356
if warrants should be issued or not.

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:38.359
And again, you say that you have

00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:40.152
requested these warrants

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:42.947
based on a higher level of evidence

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.949
than is normally required,

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.618
not just that it is a reasonable

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:48.953
belief that it could lead

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:50.996
to actual warrants and of charge.

00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:53.624
But you believe your evidence has what?

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:54.667
Well, I

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.001
when I came in as prosecutor,

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:57.169
the standard for a warrant

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:58.462
are reasonable grounds to believe

00:13:58.462 --> 00:14:00.548
that's what the judges have to determine.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:03.008
I across all our situations,

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:04.552
when I became prosecutor,

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:06.679
I required the leaders in the office,

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.430
the heads of the teams

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.223
to certify

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:10.599
that there is a realistic prospect

00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:11.559
of conviction.

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:14.395
It's not enough in these kinds of cases

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:15.688
to have enough to issue a warrant.

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:17.064
We must be able to bring it home.

00:14:17.064 --> 00:14:17.857
On both sides.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:18.482
On both sides.

00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:20.234
And in relation to both, I've determined

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:23.112
and the team are unanimous that we have a

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:24.697
realistic prospect of conviction

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.657
in relation to the three warrants

00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:29.660
being sought regarding the Hamas leaders

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:30.744
and the two

00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:33.163
that are being sought in relation to

00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:34.540
Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.916
and Foreign Minister Galant.

00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:37.209
And of course the judges will decide

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:37.960
if we've got it right

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.296
and our analysis is spot on or not.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:41.755
I'm going to get to the actual

00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:43.340
how you effect these warrants,

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.341
given the practical

00:14:44.341 --> 00:14:45.968
things, the situation in a moment.

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:46.427
But first,

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:47.136
I want to ask you

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:49.388
about the so-called political nature

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:51.515
that many people will claim.

00:14:51.515 --> 00:14:53.058
Prime Minister

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:54.852
Netanyahu has already said

00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:56.896
ICC charges would be a scandal

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.564
on a historic scale,

00:14:58.564 --> 00:14:59.732
an indelible stain

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.609
on the idea of justice.

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:02.526
Israel's commitment

00:15:02.526 --> 00:15:05.237
to international law is unwavering.

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:06.614
And Netanyahu has also said

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.283
it would be an anti-Semitic hate crime.

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.160
Now, we haven't heard anything from Hamas

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.996
about how they would react.

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:17.166
What do you say to that?

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.459
There must have been a huge

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:19.919
amount of pressure on you

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:24.048
from all sides to do and not to do.

00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:24.924
Well, this court,

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.635
Christiane, is a child of Nuremberg.

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:31.597
It was built because of

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.681
the awful pictures

00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:34.767
that haunt us today of the Shoah

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:35.768
and the gas chambers

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:36.644
and then the Balkans.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.062
And the list goes on.

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:39.939
And

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.942
we have to look at the evidence.

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.652
And the way I very simply

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:45.819
tried to do things is

00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:47.988
look at the evidence,

00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:51.867
look at the conduct, look at the victims

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.788
and airbrush out the nationality.

00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:57.247
And if a crime has been committed,

00:15:57.247 --> 00:15:58.540
we should move forward.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.833
Nobody is above the law.

00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:03.045
No people by dint of birth or passport,

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:04.129
religion, nationality

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:06.006
or the color of their skin

00:16:06.006 --> 00:16:07.716
have a get out of jail

00:16:07.716 --> 00:16:09.426
free card, have a free pass

00:16:09.426 --> 00:16:11.136
to say what the law doesn't apply to us.

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:12.429
This is a moment

00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:14.807
when we see in the shadow of Ukraine

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.559
a increasing cacophony of noise,

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:19.311
of double standards and selectivity.

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.105
And what we're trying to do

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:24.066
is not go with a tide of emotion,

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:25.818
but take our time, move

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.444
as effectively as we can,

00:16:27.444 --> 00:16:28.696
but be guided by evidence

00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:31.615
and every human life, every baby

00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:32.408
that is killed,

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:33.617
whether it's a baby

00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:35.786
that's cruelly abducted by Hamas

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:37.371
and killed or a baby

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:38.831
that's been

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:39.832
bombed or killed

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:42.001
or has died in incubators

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:43.419
because of no electricity

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:46.296
or water or food in Gaza

00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:47.381
for them, for their families

00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:48.590
and for humanity, Humanity.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.800
It's a tragedy.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.468
And this is why we have a court.

00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:53.345
It's about the equal application

00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:54.471
of the law.

00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:55.806
No, people are better than another.

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:58.350
I know people anywhere

00:16:58.434 --> 00:16:59.435
are saints.

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:00.352
And so we have to

00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:02.813
apply a yardstick of legality to conduct.

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:03.605
We've done that,

00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:04.690
and this is why

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.191
we've made the applications

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:07.818
that the judges must determine.

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:09.069
I'm going to read you

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.612
some heavy criticism

00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:11.321
that you've received

00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:12.364
from the United States.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:12.781
As we know,

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:13.741
the United States

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:17.286
is not a party to the ICC, nor is Israel.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:18.495
Recently,

00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:19.455
when word came out

00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:22.666
that this may be happening at some point,

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.376
US senators and U.S.

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:25.627
Congress people,

00:17:25.627 --> 00:17:27.379
mostly Republicans, wrote you

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:28.672
a letter, signed by Senator

00:17:28.672 --> 00:17:30.132
Tom Cotton, Mitch McConnell,

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.509
Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and others.

00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:34.845
This is the quote Target Israel

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:36.638
and we will target you

00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:38.348
if you move forward with the measures

00:17:38.348 --> 00:17:39.767
indicated in the report.

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:42.519
We will move to end all American support

00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:44.438
for the ICC, sanction

00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:46.482
your employees and associates,

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.025
and bar you and your families

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:49.318
from the United States.

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:53.655
You have been warned. Is that a threat?

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:54.281
I think

00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:55.157
that's

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:57.451
the plain meaning of it in English.

00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:59.203
But, you know,

00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:00.996
there's hotheads everywhere

00:18:00.996 --> 00:18:02.414
and there's people that are mature

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:03.749
statesmen and stateswoman

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.626
and and leaders.

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:06.877
There are those that have fidelity

00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:08.212
to something greater than themselves,

00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:09.880
whether it's their constitutions.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.091
But ultimately, it's the rule of law.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:12.925
The good news is,

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.051
I think for the last two

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:14.718
and a half years,

00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:16.470
we've had very positive engagement

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.888
with the Biden administration

00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:18.847
in the United States.

00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:19.890
We're working

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.517
across a range of situations,

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:23.685
whether it's in Ukraine or Darfur.

00:18:23.685 --> 00:18:25.854
And I've said to

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:28.107
distinguished members on the Hill

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.316
and to the administration

00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:31.318
that Rome Statute values

00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:33.487
are quintessential American values.

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:34.363
It's against bullying.

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:36.949
It's against the untrammeled power,

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:38.200
against the most vulnerable.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.910
It's the rights,

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.286
the dignity

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:43.122
of the individual

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.040
is the protection of babies.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.375
I mean, these are fundamental

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:47.251
American values

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.920
that should engender bipartisan support.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.338
Now, of course,

00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:54.258
this situation, unfortunately,

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:55.509
lives on the San Andreas

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:59.221
Fault of international politics and

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:01.014
strategic interests.

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:01.473
And of

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:03.225
course, I've had some elected leaders

00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:05.060
speak to me and very,

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.687
you know, be very blunt.

00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:09.481
This court is built for Africa

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:12.025
and for thugs like Putin was, what one

00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:15.654
senior leader told me.

00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:17.406
We don't view it like that.

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:19.700
This court is the legacy of Nuremberg.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.410
This court is a sad

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.578
indictment of humanity.

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:26.373
This court should be the triumph of law

00:19:26.456 --> 00:19:28.417
over power and brute force.

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:29.626
Grab what you can,

00:19:29.626 --> 00:19:31.879
take what you want, do what you will.

00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:34.840
And we're going to simply be and

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.550
we're not going to be dissuaded

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.428
by threats or any other activities,

00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:40.137
because in the end,

00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:44.474
we have to fulfill our responsibilities

00:19:44.474 --> 00:19:45.267
as prosecutors,

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:46.935
as the men and women of the office,

00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:48.937
as judges, as registry

00:19:48.937 --> 00:19:50.147
to something bigger than ourselves,

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.441
which is the fidelity to justice.

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:55.027
And we're not going to be swayed

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.320
by the different types of threats,

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.237
some of which are public

00:19:57.237 --> 00:19:58.113
and some maybe are not.

00:19:58.113 --> 00:20:00.824
You mentioned without names

00:20:00.824 --> 00:20:02.284
that there are many

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:03.577
who have been indicted

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:05.579
who are not in Democratic states,

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:09.708
who are essentially despots.

00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:11.710
Israel is a democracy.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.086
They have a judiciary.

00:20:13.086 --> 00:20:14.504
They have law enforcement.

00:20:14.504 --> 00:20:16.298
They have elected leaders.

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:18.550
Why do you need to do this

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.093
when they have a system

00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:21.678
that could do this?

00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:24.389
I'd much rather Israel does it.

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:27.309
I mean, Israel, you're right. It has a

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:29.436
very good Supreme Court.

00:20:29.436 --> 00:20:34.316
It has very qualified, brilliant lawyers.

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:37.277
But even if you read recently

00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:39.404
public information, for example,

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:40.239
in The New York Times,

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:43.200
I think the Bergman and Mazzoli report,

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.119
if one goes back to the eighties

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:48.163
and look at the COP report,

00:20:48.163 --> 00:20:49.831
a deputy attorney general of Israel,

00:20:49.831 --> 00:20:51.166
who said that Israel was unwilling

00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:52.960
or unable to investigate crimes

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.211
in the occupied territories,

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:56.922
if one looks at the Sassoon report,

00:20:56.922 --> 00:21:00.425
if one looks at General,

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:01.593
you have a three star general

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:04.596
that was in Washington, DC between

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.348
2019 and 2021

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:08.183
who said there's no accountability.

00:21:08.183 --> 00:21:10.060
The simple truth is that

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.812
for all the application of the law

00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:13.647
in the territory of Israel,

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:15.065
unfortunately it doesn't appear

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:15.816
to be

00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:16.900
applied with vigor

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.818
or sincerity

00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:19.903
in the occupied territories or in Gaza.

00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:21.780
And this is why we have to move forward.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.533
Of course, if Israel disagrees,

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:27.286
if they think they are investigating

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:30.122
the same individuals and the same conduct

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:33.083
and the policies that underpinned them,

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:34.126
they are free.

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:35.460
Notwithstanding their objections

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.670
to jurisdiction

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:37.546
to raise a challenge

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:39.131
before the judges of the court.

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.717
And that's what I advise them to do. But

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.426
the simple

00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:43.176
truth of the matter

00:21:43.176 --> 00:21:46.179
is the disregard of the law

00:21:46.346 --> 00:21:48.682
in this situation and the policies

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:49.516
and the utterances

00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:50.934
that are coming from the Prime minister,

00:21:50.934 --> 00:21:54.855
the minister of defense

00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:56.315
support

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:57.983
and corroborate the other evidence

00:21:57.983 --> 00:21:59.901
we have from a variety of sources.

00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:01.236
I just want to fill in for our viewers.

00:22:01.236 --> 00:22:02.863
You mentioned in big New York Times

00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:04.239
magazine report this weekend

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:05.741
by Ronen Bergman and Mark Mazzetti,

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.326
an eight year effort.

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:08.952
It was titled Unpunished.

00:22:08.952 --> 00:22:10.120
And as you say,

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.580
it is about the failure

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.040
of the Israeli system.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.043
Police, legal and military,

00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:18.879
to punish settlers on the occupied West

00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:20.505
Bank as they punish

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:23.842
Arab Palestinians on the West Bank.

00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:26.803
Now,

00:22:26.803 --> 00:22:29.222
you talk about the state of Palestine,

00:22:29.222 --> 00:22:30.974
and therefore you have jurisdiction

00:22:30.974 --> 00:22:32.476
over things that happen

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:34.227
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.

00:22:34.227 --> 00:22:35.645
There are those who disagree with you.

00:22:35.645 --> 00:22:37.189
Clearly, Israel disagrees.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.857
The United States disagrees.

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:40.525
They point out that as yet,

00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:42.486
there is no official state of Palestine

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:44.654
recognized by the Security Council.

00:22:44.654 --> 00:22:47.115
What is your jurisdiction there?

00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:48.867
Well, it's a jurisdiction

00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:50.994
that's detailed in the statute,

00:22:50.994 --> 00:22:53.205
and that has been decided by majority

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:55.123
by the pretrial chamber.

00:22:55.123 --> 00:22:56.666
Leaving aside the

00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:57.250
for the moment,

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.169
the fact that 141 countries

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:01.838
have recognized Palestine as a state.

00:23:01.838 --> 00:23:02.381
In the General.

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:03.423
Assembly, in the General Assembly,

00:23:03.423 --> 00:23:05.425
124 states

00:23:05.425 --> 00:23:06.635
that make up the Assembly

00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:08.512
of State parties

00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:12.891
agreed for Palestine to be accepted as a

00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:15.727
state party to the Rome Statute.

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:17.771
And so by dint of that,

00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:19.689
clearly we have jurisdiction.

00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:20.774
The Geneva Conventions

00:23:20.774 --> 00:23:22.609
also make it clear that it applies

00:23:22.609 --> 00:23:24.611
to high contracting parties.

00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:25.862
Israel is a high contracting

00:23:25.862 --> 00:23:27.239
party, as is Palestine.

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:28.156
What does that mean?

00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:30.867
It means that they have both committed

00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:32.244
to comply with the provisions

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.578
of the Geneva Conventions.

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:34.830
That includes

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.248
the prohibition on starvation

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:37.416
as a method of war.

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:39.918
That includes the prohibition

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.253
on taking hostages

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:43.463
or willfully killing or extermination.

00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:45.799
I mean, these come from the Rome Statute,

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:47.926
but originally they found form

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:49.511
in the Geneva Conventions.

00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:50.804
So we apply the law.

00:23:50.804 --> 00:23:53.014
There's been judicial pronouncements

00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:53.765
by the

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:54.433
the ICC,

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:57.436
and we have to be guided by those.

00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:58.645
The Hamas leaders

00:23:58.645 --> 00:24:02.607
who have sought arrest warrants for.

00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:03.942
Do you have any hope

00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:05.986
that anybody will move against them?

00:24:05.986 --> 00:24:06.945
Do you have any hope of

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:08.905
ever getting to them again?

00:24:08.905 --> 00:24:10.991
The ICC does not have a police force.

00:24:10.991 --> 00:24:12.451
You cannot go and apprehend.

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:13.118
As far as we know,

00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:14.953
at least two of them are underground,

00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:17.038
potentially in tunnels in Gaza.

00:24:17.038 --> 00:24:17.581
And Ismail

00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:18.123
Haniya

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:19.249
appears to be

00:24:19.249 --> 00:24:19.916
the leader

00:24:19.916 --> 00:24:21.126
involved in the political

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:24.421
negotiations, indirect between Israel

00:24:24.504 --> 00:24:25.213
and Hamas

00:24:25.213 --> 00:24:26.506
with the U.S., Qatar,

00:24:26.506 --> 00:24:29.217
other nations mediating.

00:24:29.217 --> 00:24:31.678
How do you expect to go after them?

00:24:31.678 --> 00:24:32.679
Who do you think is

00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:33.972
going to hand them over?

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:34.639
Well, the first thing is

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:37.184
the judge has to rule on the applications

00:24:37.267 --> 00:24:39.561
until the judges rule on the application.

00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:41.021
All it is is an application

00:24:41.021 --> 00:24:42.731
that doesn't have legal effect.

00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:43.398
But then states

00:24:43.398 --> 00:24:44.983
have such responsibilities

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:46.860
and individuals have choices.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.863
If individuals say that what their

00:24:50.071 --> 00:24:52.574
what is alleged is not made out,

00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:53.533
it's bunkum.

00:24:53.533 --> 00:24:56.286
It's nonsense.

00:24:56.286 --> 00:24:56.870
Put your case

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:57.704
before the independent

00:24:57.704 --> 00:24:58.538
judges of the court.

00:24:58.538 --> 00:25:00.290
This court has had acquittals.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.584
This court has not confirmed cases.

00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:04.002
The record shows

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:05.795
that it's a forensic laboratory

00:25:05.795 --> 00:25:07.964
in which the evidence

00:25:07.964 --> 00:25:09.090
determines

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.343
whether or not people are convicted,

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:12.344
cases are confirmed

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:14.387
or cases of kicked out.

00:25:14.387 --> 00:25:16.056
That applies to Hamas leaders

00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:16.598
if they want.

00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:17.766
And if not,

00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:18.308
we have to see

00:25:18.308 --> 00:25:20.018
what are the other opportunities,

00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:21.436
if they're either in Palestine,

00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:22.854
which is a state party,

00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:24.314
or if they're in Qatar,

00:25:24.314 --> 00:25:25.357
which is a non-state party,

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:26.566
but in a way

00:25:26.566 --> 00:25:28.693
that's getting ahead of ourselves.

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:29.319
Today,

00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:30.862
the announcement is the application

00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.781
and the judges have to be given the time

00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:33.865
to independently

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:35.075
and dispassionately assess

00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:37.827
what we've given. Nothing is a given.

00:25:37.827 --> 00:25:38.703
They have to assess it

00:25:38.703 --> 00:25:40.497
and make a determination

00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:44.125
whether or not to issue warrants. But

00:25:44.167 --> 00:25:44.501
I also

00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:47.504
want to underline the fact that

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:49.297
you mentioned in an earlier question

00:25:49.297 --> 00:25:51.049
the allegations of anti-Semitism,

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:54.052
the the hate, the idea that

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:57.305
by applying the law blindly,

00:25:57.389 --> 00:26:00.225
we are favoring one side or persecuting

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:01.685
or being hostile to another side,

00:26:01.685 --> 00:26:02.644
and nothing can be further

00:26:02.644 --> 00:26:04.437
from the truth.

00:26:04.437 --> 00:26:07.691
We have so many people of distinction

00:26:07.774 --> 00:26:10.277
that are respected

00:26:10.277 --> 00:26:12.612
and they independently came in.

00:26:12.612 --> 00:26:13.738
I brought them in,

00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:15.615
they sat in the evidence review.

00:26:15.615 --> 00:26:17.200
And this is not a witch hunt.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.201
This is not some kind

00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:20.704
of emotional reaction to noise.

00:26:20.704 --> 00:26:21.788
We've been criticized for going

00:26:21.788 --> 00:26:23.039
too slowly, criticized

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:24.374
for going too fast.

00:26:24.374 --> 00:26:26.626
It's a forensic process

00:26:26.626 --> 00:26:28.336
that is expected of us

00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:30.255
as international prosecutors,

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:31.840
as an independent court,

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.217
to build evidence that is solid,

00:26:34.217 --> 00:26:36.219
that will not dissolve in the courtroom.

00:26:36.219 --> 00:26:37.178
And that's what we've done

00:26:37.178 --> 00:26:38.888
today, is the fulfillment of that

00:26:38.888 --> 00:26:39.848
first stage.

00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:42.225
This first round of applications

00:26:42.225 --> 00:26:42.934
in which we say

00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:44.728
we have done our job,

00:26:44.728 --> 00:26:45.937
we now give it to the judges

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:46.980
to scrutinize.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.691
So it's not against any people

00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:53.945
and it's not against or for any interest.

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.613
It's simply

00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:55.322
because if we don't

00:26:55.322 --> 00:26:58.408
apply the law equally,

00:26:58.491 --> 00:27:00.869
we're going to disintegrate as a species.

00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:01.286
Of course,

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:04.748
what's happening in the West Bank is

00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:05.832
extremely worrying.

00:27:05.832 --> 00:27:06.458
It's an issue

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.376
also that we are investigating.

00:27:08.376 --> 00:27:11.379
But there's a certain

00:27:11.379 --> 00:27:14.382
in democracies,

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:15.967
political choices

00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:18.553
tend to be determinative.

00:27:18.553 --> 00:27:22.182
And all I can say is that Israel,

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.393
the leaders, the country, has a choice

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.563
that they can engage

00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:30.774
and do what is necessary

00:27:30.774 --> 00:27:32.275
to meet complementarity.

00:27:32.275 --> 00:27:34.235
And the United Kingdom

00:27:34.235 --> 00:27:35.945
in the Iraq investigations,

00:27:35.945 --> 00:27:38.031
before I was appointed prosecutor,

00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:40.867
it was found that there were deficiencies

00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:44.954
in the legal system for military justice.

00:27:45.038 --> 00:27:47.874
But we have really sincerely looked

00:27:47.874 --> 00:27:51.086
at things with a broad horizon,

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:52.629
looking at incriminating

00:27:52.629 --> 00:27:55.465
and exonerating evidence equally

00:27:55.465 --> 00:27:56.466
looking at evidence,

00:27:56.466 --> 00:27:58.385
authenticating the evidence,

00:27:58.385 --> 00:28:01.763
and realizing that we're not worth

00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:04.849
the job, the title as being a prosecutor

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:06.643
or being lawyers

00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:07.811
or having an international

00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:09.312
criminal court.

00:28:09.312 --> 00:28:12.107
If we are dissuaded because of extraneous

00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:14.734
interests from moving forward.

00:28:14.734 --> 00:28:15.819
Because end of the day,

00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:16.861
I go back to this basic

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:20.365
premise a child in

00:28:20.448 --> 00:28:21.491
Myanmar that's

00:28:21.491 --> 00:28:25.578
persecuted or a child in Israel

00:28:25.662 --> 00:28:26.496
that is an orphan

00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:30.375
or that has been taken and killed

00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:33.420
or one in Ukraine for their family,

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.254
there's no difference.

00:28:34.254 --> 00:28:36.506
The universe has been torn to shreds

00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:37.966
and this is

00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:39.092
the need for the court

00:28:39.092 --> 00:28:41.386
and independent judges to scrutinize,

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:42.971
not look at the politics,

00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:43.513
not look at a

00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:45.640
dysfunctional Security Council,

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.976
not look at the difficulties it may cause

00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:49.686
a regional organizer, nations

00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:51.938
or different groupings,

00:28:51.938 --> 00:28:55.275
but simply say, is the evidence reliable?

00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:57.110
And if so,

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.404
we go back to King John

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:00.655
that the king is under no man

00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:01.781
but God under the law.

00:29:01.781 --> 00:29:03.491
We all must be subject to that.

00:29:03.491 --> 00:29:04.576
Otherwise,

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:05.326
what is this

00:29:05.326 --> 00:29:07.078
international rules based system?

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:08.663
What is the principles

00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:10.415
of public international law

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:11.499
that so many men and women

00:29:11.499 --> 00:29:12.584
have given their lives

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.627
for since the Second World

00:29:14.627 --> 00:29:16.212
War particularly?

00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:18.673
And I think it's a dishonor for them.

00:29:18.673 --> 00:29:19.424
It's a dishonor

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:21.426
for the victims of the gas chambers.

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:23.928
If we airbrush out inconvenient truth

00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:25.930
and we have to try our best

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:26.890
to achieve justice

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:29.517
for the victims of the 7th of October,

00:29:29.517 --> 00:29:32.771
we also must try our best to do justice

00:29:32.854 --> 00:29:34.189
for so many innocent people

00:29:34.189 --> 00:29:36.065
that are suffering as we speak

00:29:36.065 --> 00:29:38.568
in Israel and also in in Gaza,

00:29:38.568 --> 00:29:41.112
as well as in other parts of Palestine.

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:42.489
Prosecutor Kerem Hahn, thank

00:29:42.489 --> 00:29:44.324
you very much indeed for joining us.

00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:44.866
Thank you so much.
