This morning, we're watching growing threats of the israel/hamas war spreading to a much wider conflict, new overnight, Israeli military ramping up air strikes after announcing it was expanding the ground assault to the entire gaza strip including in south, where so many civilians have fled, the idf say the strikes destroyed 20 on hamas targets. &gt;&gt; The U.S. Navy destroyer came to the rescue of three commercial ships that were attacked by iran-backed houthi rebels. We're also keeping a close eye on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, where they've been exchanging fire with Hezbollah. Three israelsosoldiers were hurt by mortar shells fired from Lebanon. We have team coverage. Let's start with CNN's Ben wedeman in Jerusalem. Expanding it to the entire gaza [6:01:42 AM] Expanding it to the entire gaza strip over the weekend, where the civilians who have moeftd to the south supposed to go? &gt;&gt; Reporter: That I think is a question that many people in gaza are asking, we know that more than 80% of the population of gaza is already displaced, many have gone to the south, now the Israelis over social media have put out a map showing hundreds of individual blocs that are numbered and on theory people can go to that map there's a qr code, and nowhere is safe and where is not the problem is most people in gaza don't have electricity to charge their phones. Don't have an internet connection. Therefore, they're very much really left to their own devices and of course another problem is, already the shelters, the schools that have been converted into shelters in gaza are already crammed with people, as many as 400 to 500 people per toilet, if there's even a [6:02:45 AM] toilet, if there's even a toilet. Phil, poppy. &gt;&gt;&gt; We saw on Saturday, fighting in the north of Israel across the border with Lebanon, Hezbollah, saying one of their fighters was killed. What does that indicate to you, does that indicate the beginning of a broader, expansion of this to the north and more broadly between not just Israel and hamas but Israel and Hezbollah? &gt;&gt; Reporter: Well, starting on the 8th of October, Hezbollah basically entered into this fight with limited strikes on Israeli poxes in some communities on the other side of the border, but it's worth noting that during the seven-day truce, they also observed the truce, they didn't open fire, but what we have seen since the [6:03:47 AM] but what we have seen since the truce broke down on Friday morning there's been a real intensification of the back and forth fire between Hezbollah and the Israelis. I've been in touch with our correspondent in Lebanon, he said there's hourly shelling back and forth. Poppy. &gt;&gt; Quite telling. Ben reporting for us in Jerusalem, thank you very much. Phil. &gt;&gt;&gt; Exchanges in the north just the latest example that every hour the threat that America could get dragged directly into the war seems to grow. U.S. Military said a U.S. Navy destroyer and three commercial ships were attacked in an hours-long assault in the red sea. Launched ballistic missiles and drones. The U.S. Blaming the attack on [6:04:48 AM] The U.S. Blaming the attack on rebels backed on Iran. It's stoking fears of a wider conflict. Natasha joins us live from the Pentagon. To give an example for people on the map where this is all happening, Israel up here, Ben talking about Lebanon, we're talking specifically in this area here, the red sea, down in Yemen, proxy organizations tied to Iran, have been a significant player on attacks on U.S. Ships and other commercial ships, I think the big question right now, particularly in the wake of those hostage negotiations breaking down, is this a sign that an escalation is coming or just a return to what we saw the six, seven weeks before that pause? &gt;&gt; This was a particularly active day in the red sea. Iran-backed houthi rebels. [6:05:53 AM] This was a number of attacks, four attacks on three separate commercial vessels in the southern red sea including one attack in which the houthis used a ballistic missile. The uss carney responded to each of these attacks which occurred on Sunday at several different times throughout the day and many of them resulted in damage to these commercial vessels in the southern red sea and the U.S. Now says that this is really, really dangerous, obviously, not only did the uss carney respond to these attacks but they also shot down a number of drones that were launched from these houthi-controlled territories in Yemen. Clearly they're taking advantage right now of the tumult in the region of the U.S. Presence in the region to try to attack these ships and the houthi-run Yemeni run forces they'll continue to wage these attacks [6:06:54 AM] continue to wage these attacks against these, quote, Israeli ships and those aligned with Israel, standing in solidarity with Palestinians. The U.S. Central command said that these attacks pose a quote  a direct threat. Importantly they say that have every reason to believe that these attacks are fully enabled by Iran, now the big question is how the U.S. Is going to respond, of course we've seen the U.S. Military strike these iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria. But Yemen whether they're going to go after the houthis in Yemen is an entirely different
