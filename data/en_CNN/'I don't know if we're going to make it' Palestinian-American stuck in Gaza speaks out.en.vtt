00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.001
More than 2 million

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.669
Palestinians live in Gaza.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.238
About half of those are children.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:06.873
Let's bring in Haneen Okal.

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.641
She's a Palestinian-American

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.577
from Union County in New Jersey.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.645
She is currently stuck in Gaza City

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.114
with her three children.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:17.083
They are 82 and a two month old.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.551
They cannot get out.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.553
Thank you so much. For joining us.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.654
Has the US

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:22.622
embassy been able

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:24.657
to give you any help to get out?

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:27.594
How are you?

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:28.561
Yes,

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.965
we tried to contact the US Embassy

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:33.033
so many times.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.501
Unfortunately, they couldn't

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:35.568
help us at all.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.704
I contacted them through the phone,

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:38.671
via email.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.840
I texted and I.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.977
I called different numbers, but nobody

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.713
I couldn't hear back from any.

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.650
They said that we're going to call you

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.254
back within 24 hours or so on couple

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.488
hours. But they couldn't,

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:57.891
they couldn't at all

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:58.958
call us or

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.061
we didn't get any information from them.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:01.795
I applied,

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:05.498
I submitted a form through the website,

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.735
but that didn't work as well.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.171
And I don't know with what happened

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:13.206
with Erez crossing border

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.175
and what was happening

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.276
with the Rafah border,

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.044
I don't know if we're going to make it,

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:21.514
but I am absolutely looking forward

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:24.684
to the help of the US Embassy.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.287
We are all here feeling abandoned.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:29.055
That and we're

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.224
feeling that we're left alone.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:33.960
So we really looking for the US Embassy

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.328
to help the US

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.897
citizens who are living in Gaza

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.633
That was just an Israeli airstrike out

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.901
that we just heard.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:43.837
That was just an Israeli

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.239
airstrike that we just heard

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.975
our that we just heard

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.743
a lot of sound like a

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.011
a bomb or a missile.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:52.946
Is that what we just heard?

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:53.780
Yes, we are.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.049
Yes, that's happening. 24 hours

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.818
old time.

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:01.454
They're bombing all around

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.624
from south to north

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.092
to the center of Gaza.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.194
Everywhere. Bombing is everywhere.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.364
Your your kids, how are they doing

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:12.899
with that

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.201
It's terrible.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.036
My kids are very scared

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.239
and they're afraid of that stuff

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:19.939
going on.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.642
I have to explain all the time.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.878
I have to calm them down and

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:26.980
trying to

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.349
make them feel comfortable, safe, and

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:31.885
trying to make them busy

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.219
with other things.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.022
So they can feel afraid or scared

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:37.290
about like

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.425
they are like what happened with me,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:40.927
for example, today

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.563
I was going trying to get out from Gaza.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:46.966
I was going to the Rafah border.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.469
And while we were going there,

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.173
we tried multiple ways to get out of

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:56.943
Gaza, going to the hospital so

00:02:58.411 --> 00:02:59.312
we could make it.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:02:59.979
And also,

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.116
my son saw all the locations destroyed

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.617
his favorite places.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:07.954
He was he was shocked with what he saw.

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.890
So we had to see all that

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.892
and we had to go

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.229
through what we say.

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.063
Okay.

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:19.165
So it was like, you know,

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:22.335
you're going to death

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:24.470
Yes.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.271
There needs to be a way

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.172
for you to get out.

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:27.340
I mean, you're not Hamas.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.342
You're an innocent person

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.243
and you have three kids.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.711
You need to be able to get out

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.946
You heard earlier

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:35.048
the suggestions from the IDF spokesman

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.482
I spoke with Saturday night.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.684
Where are innocent

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:38.918
Palestinians supposed to go?

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.653
He said, you can go to the south,

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:41.955
you can go to the shore.

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.289
Is that at all realistic?

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.890
We just

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.091
we just heard about your attempt

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:45.725
to go to the border

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:46.693
crossing in the south,

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:48.094
and that didn't work.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:50.129
Is there anywhere for you to go to escape

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:52.265
to escape this barrage of missiles?

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:54.000
No.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.501
We tried everywhere.

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.837
They say go to the shore

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:00.273
and then they bombed the store. Next day.

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:01.808
They say go to the north

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:02.575
and then be bombed

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:05.011
the north areas next day,

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:06.479
like everywhere.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.447
They're bombing everywhere.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:10.049
So no place is safe here in Gaza Strip.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:11.851
And

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.654
it's like it's just terrible

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:17.357
and very, very,

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.726
you know, very hard to explain.

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.995
Because they're bumping everywhere.

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:22.929
Well, I hope the wife

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:23.997
just a place

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:27.300
or like a place that is close to Hamas,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.003
they're bombing places that

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:32.739
are not related to Hamas to like,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.409
I don't know, everywhere.

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:37.143
Haneen.

00:04:37.143 --> 00:04:39.212
Well, we have your number.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:40.213
I know that the White House

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:41.180
watches this show

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.049
or the White House can call me

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:45.018
and we will put them in touch with you.

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:47.520
You and your kids need to get out safely

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:48.755
and you need to get out safe.

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:50.790
As soon as is humanly possible.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.959
Please stay safe. Stay in touch with us.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:53.926
We're going to do everything we

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:54.661
can to help you

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:57.130
and so much.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.531
I appreciate it. Thank you.
