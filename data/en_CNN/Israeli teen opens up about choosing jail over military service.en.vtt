00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.801
Across Israel, protesters are

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:02.936
growing louder.

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:04.504
Those frustrated by the war

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:05.505
are now grappling

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.640
with how to make their voices heard.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:11.678
CNN's Melissa Bell has more

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:13.980
in Israel, too.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.282
There are those who objected

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.451
to their government's handling of the war

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:19.819
in Gaza

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:22.622
Among them, Ben Arad, who has an 18 year

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:24.424
old, is due to enlist this week

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:25.425
for his mandatory

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.193
military service in Iceland.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.095
Instead, he tells the crowd

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:32.632
he's choosing to go to jail

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.868
We caught up with him

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:35.702
in Tel Aviv

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.238
on his very last day of freedom.

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.707
I don't refuse because I'm afraid of

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.244
being hurt or or killed

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:45.645
in military accidents

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.380
have a very, very deep

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.850
disgust of the things that I'm seeing

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:52.919
happening things,

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:53.820
he says, that

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.922
Israeli media doesn't dwell on

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.390
or that he seeks out

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.893
on international networks and online.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.961
I think something that

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:03.863
really broke my heart

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.732
was the flower massacre.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.868
So seeing people

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:12.872
trample each other to to uh, to get food.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:16.743
I mean, you just can't deny at that point

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.678
that there is a famine going on

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.146
and people are hungry.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.182
So on Monday, Ben will hand himself

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:23.450
in becoming one of only

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.585
a handful of so-called refuseniks

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.520
to make their decisions public.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.056
Since the war began,

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:33.927
In a country

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.261
where military service marks

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.696
the start of every Israeli's

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:37.797
grown up life.

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:39.232
Aside from those exempt

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.667
on religious grounds,

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.502
the war has made avoiding it

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:43.803
a political act.

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:45.805
I've been called a traitor.

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:46.439
Uh,

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.409
I've been told that I need to be deported

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.112
or I've been asked why I don't just move.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.348
Uh, I mean, it's, uh,

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:56.916
not not such terrible stuff.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:57.951
I haven't gotten that yet.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.752
Like, I'll get that when I go to jail.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.654
Yet Ben

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:02.222
says he's

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.424
determined to give up his freedom

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.759
in order to remain free of a war

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.263
that he simply doesn't believe in.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:13.967
Now, it's difficult to overstate

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.201
what a remarkable decision

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.370
it is for an Israeli 18 year

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.005
old to decide not to serve,

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.374
given the place that military service has

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:22.842
in this country,

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.944
but especially at this time.

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.679
I think listening to the testimony

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.714
that you were just hearing there

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:28.414
beyond and voice

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:29.949
that you just heard from that Dr.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.451
remember that international networks

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.386
like CNN can't get into Gaza,

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:33.820
but do what

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.621
they can

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.989
to try and show what's happening

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.624
to Palestinian civilians,

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:38.925
that he's had to seek out

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.593
that information to make his decision,

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.695
I think is interesting in itself.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:43.997
One media analyst pointing out

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.331
that here in Israel,

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.666
the drums of war

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.468
have been beating so loudly

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:50.036
that it's been hard

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.338
for the Israeli public to get access

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:53.573
to its own media,

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:55.108
to much of what's happening

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.409
to Palestinian civilians.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.511
So remarkable story at a remarkable time.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.913
And bear in mind, that we are now

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:02.182
in the third day of four days of protest

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.117
against this war here in Jerusalem

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:04.884
and beyond.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.920
There are really fascinating perspective

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.954
from that young man.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.689
Melissa Bell live for us in Jerusalem.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:10.723
Thank you so much.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:10.924
All right.

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.058
In terms of what else is happening

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.693
on the ground in Gaza, what was once

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:14.727
the enclave's largest

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.996
hospital, really a place of hope

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.165
and healing is now permanent.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.700
Leave out of service.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.934
That's

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.002
according to the acting director

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.904
of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex.

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:25.805
The hospital has turned

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:26.372
into a makeshift

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.340
graveyard one day

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.175
after Israeli troops ended their two week

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:30.343
siege there.

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:30.843
The World Health

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:33.613
Organization says Al-Shifa is in ruins

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:35.615
and can no longer be able to function

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.617
in any way as a hospital.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.152
Now, these before and after images

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:40.987
show the extent of the destruction.

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:42.422
A spokesperson

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.923
says that the loss of the hospital

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.092
will have devastating consequences

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.193
for the people of Gaza.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:51.231
We've had contact with the staff.

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:53.499
The directors told us that

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.001
Al-Shifa hospital is gone.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.936
Destroying Al-Shifa means ripping

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:58.571
the heart out of the health system.

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.773
It was the tertiary care center.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.041
It was a huge hospital.

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:05.278
750 beds, 25 operating

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:08.014
theaters, 30 intensive care rooms.

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:09.849
You know, it was the

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.417
the place people

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:12.151
go to

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.386
for the kind of care

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.955
that a really good health system provides

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.891
that we in all our societies

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:19.892
expect to have.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:22.829
Should we be in need?

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:24.497
Now, Israel has described

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:25.531
the 14 day raid

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.166
as an anti-terror mission

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:27.667
and a government

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:29.002
spokesperson is referring

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:29.869
to the operation

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:32.472
as the gold standard of urban warfare.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:36.342
I believe that the terrorist

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:38.111
takeover of Shifa

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.178
and the subsequent

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:41.047
Special Forces operation

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:43.416
to clear the hospital of terrorists

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:44.884
will be studied

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:45.518
by future

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:47.787
generations of military strategists.

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:50.390
At West Points and Sandhurst

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.827
as the gold standard for urban warfare

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:57.263
But our

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:58.031
next guest says

00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.065
the indiscriminate

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:00.433
bombing of Gaza

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:01.768
has killed more children,

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:03.836
more women, doctors, aid workers

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:04.771
and journalists

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.973
than any other war in our time

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.808
as secretary general

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:11.010
of the Norwegian Refugee Council.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.079
He joins us live now from Oslo, Norway.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.415
And I want to start obviously

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:15.915
by talking

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:17.717
about what happened with the World

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.052
Central Kitchen Aid workers,

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:19.952
seven of them,

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:22.155
seven of them rather tragically killed.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.291
Clearly, it is part of the calculation

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:26.993
right of aid organizations

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.995
when you are entering into a war zone,

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:31.230
that there is some degree of risk.

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:33.232
But there are also certain things

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:34.801
that these organizations often

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:36.803
do to mitigate the risks

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:38.905
they coordinated with the IDF.

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:40.573
The IDF knew their coordinates.

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:42.241
They were in a vehicle

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.077
that was clearly marked

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.912
with World Central Kitchen's logo

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.213
a lot of people are asking themselves,

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:48.081
how on earth

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:50.183
could this have happened?

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.818
I mean, I'm not really sure what else

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:52.585
they could have done

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:53.853
to really mitigate the risks.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:54.420
I did want to start

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.355
by getting your reaction

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.556
to what happened.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.125
I think our colleagues in World

00:05:59.125 --> 00:05:59.992
Central Kitchen

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:03.329
did everything that they could

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:07.300
to be safe in the war zone, something

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:09.268
so different than the women

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:11.671
and the innocent with food

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:13.339
and the Israelis

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.308
that deliberately targeted

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:17.810
these three vehicles. We do not know.

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:20.046
We do not believe that they wanted

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.448
to attack one central kitchen

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:24.817
with whom they had worked a lot

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.986
in previous operations

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:29.222
to reach people in Gaza.

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:31.124
But they deliberately

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:33.159
and repeatedly targeted

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:37.330
these three vehicles So it's very clear

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.464
that they are

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.800
again and again and again targeting

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:45.171
without knowing who inside and there.

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:48.841
Therefore, it's the worst casualty

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:51.210
of any

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.580
any war in recent memory.

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:56.549
In terms of women,

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:57.984
children, the innocent,

00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:59.819
the aid workers, the

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.221
doctors, the nurses, the teachers,

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:05.458
any any group

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:07.260
that had protection

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.227
under international law.

00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:11.063
And it's not the gold standard of

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:13.466
of of good where warfare

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.568
this is a race to the bottom.

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:18.438
And it's happening with American,

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.474
German and other Western

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:26.078
And in response to this tragic strike,

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:28.381
the Israeli defense minister said

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:29.449
that Israel

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:29.882
would open

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:31.350
a joint situation room

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.285
with international groups

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.453
to enable coordination

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.221
of aid distribution

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:37.623
in Gaza with the military.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:41.894
Now, aside from a ceasefire, which,

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:43.496
of course, would require both sides

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:44.197
to agree

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:46.499
and for Hamas to also release hostages.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:49.402
Do you think this is the right next step

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:51.304
in terms of rebuilding

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.406
trust and getting more aid,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.676
much more needed aid into Gaza,

00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:58.644
given the dire situation now

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.580
and you have the World Central Kitchen

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.914
understandably saying

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:03.416
they're going to suspend their work

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:04.817
there following this tragedy.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:06.986
They will.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:07.687
And other

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:08.988
groups, including my own,

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:09.489
have said

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:12.258
we will not send convoys north

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:15.895
at this time because they are so often

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:19.232
targeted by the Israeli war machine.

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:22.401
And if if they now will have

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:24.036
a deconfliction system

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:26.372
and notification system

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:29.408
with international staff embedded

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:30.877
in the Israeli

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:32.044
military command,

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:34.146
it would be this a step in the right

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:34.814
direction.

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:36.949
I've been an aid worker

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:40.786
in many war zones, and we had a system

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.322
in Afghanistan with the US military

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:45.024
in the air

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:46.592
when the US was there

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:48.594
in the Afghan military high command.

00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:50.062
And that worked

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:54.166
pretty well We had even in the 2006 war

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:55.201
in Lebanon

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.303
between Israel and Hezbollah,

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.539
we had UN staff in the Israeli

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.273
high command.

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:02.375
We haven't had that in the Gaza War.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.643
And partly

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.077
therefore, I think

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.046
there hasn't been a deconfliction system,

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.447
a notification system

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:11.017
that has perfected a yes.

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:12.618
However, we need

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:15.655
really more than anything as a cease fire

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:18.691
so that this senseless blood

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:21.427
should be stopped, stopped.

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:23.696
And the second thing we need

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:26.566
is all of the border crossings,

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:29.101
including those in the north,

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:31.037
that these red has shot down

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:32.972
so that we cannot reach civilians

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.140
in a safe way.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.208
We need those border crossings to.
