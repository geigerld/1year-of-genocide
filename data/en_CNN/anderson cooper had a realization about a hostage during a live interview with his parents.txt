&gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF A 23-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN ISRAELI. HE'S BELIEVED TO BE A HOSTAGE IN GAZA. LAST MONDAY, I DID A LIVE INTERVIEW WITH HIS MOM RACHEL AND HIS DAUGHTER JOHN. THEY TOLD ME HIS ARM HAD BEEN BLOWN OFF BY HAMAS GUNMAN WHO TOSSED GRENADES -- AFTER HE ESCAPED FROM THE MUSIC FESTIVAL. WITNESSES HAD TOLD THEM HER SON WAS PUT INTO A TRUCK FROM GUNMAN AND TAKEN OFF. THEY HAD NO VIDEO OF THEIR SON. SO, DURING THE LIVE INTERVIEW A WEEK AGO, WE SHOWED A PICTURE OF HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN'I REALIZE I ACTUALLY SAW THEIR SON AND HAD A VIDEO OF THEIR SON ON MY PHONE. IT HAD BEEN SHOWN TO ME BY A SOLDIER AT THE MUSIC FESTIVAL. WE RECORDED OF HIS PHONE, WE HAVE PERMISSION FROM HIM TO DO. SO IT HAD NEVER BEEN RELEASED PUBLICLY. I DID NOT WANT THE SHOT OF DURING THE INTERVIEW SO, I WAIT FOR IT TO BE DONE. THEN I CALLED RACHEL AND JOHN IMMEDIATELY, AND I SENT THEM THE VIDEO. IT WAS THEIR SON, HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN. I'VE BEEN TOUCH THE FAMILY A LOT THIS LAST WEEK, AND THEY WOULD LIKE EVERYONE TO SEE THIS VIDEO, THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEIR CHILD, AND THEY WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED PEOPLE WHO WERE TAKEN BY HAMAS. THIS VIDEO WAS PROOF OF THAT. WE WERE NOT SOME PARTS OF, IT WE WANT TO WARN YOU THAT IT IS DISTURBING. &gt;&gt; [SPEAKING IN A NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE] WHAT GOD IS GREAT, THE GOVERNMENT, SHOUTS RECORDING ON HIS PHONE. [SPEAKING IN A NON-ENGLISH HE CHECKS A CAR, LOOKING FOR ANYONE ELSE HIDING. OTHER GUNMAN SHOT AS THEY BRING SURVIVORS FROM THE SHELTER. CALM, CALM, THEY. YELLOW THEM. THAT IS HURT ON THE RIGHT WITH ANOTHER HOSTAGE. HIS LEFT HAND AND PART OF HIS ARM IS BLOWN. OF THE BONE STICKS OUT. THE OTHER HOSTAGE APPEARS WOUNDED AS WELL. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER WOUNDED HOSTAGES DRAGGED BY HIS HAIR AND TOSSED INTO THE TRUCK. A FOURTH MAN IS THROWN ON TOP OF THEM. &gt;&gt; WHEN I SENT THE VIDEO TO YOU, WHAT WAS YOUR INITIAL? &gt;&gt; IT'S A CRAZY SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT WE TALK TO YOU THROUGH A COMPUTER SCREEN AND THEN GET A PHONE CALL FROM YOU SAYING, I HAVE A VIDEO OF YOUR SON. &gt;&gt; I DID NOT WANT TO SAY ON LIVE TELEVISION. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE COURSE APPRECIATED. THE WAY EVERYTHING HAS UNFOLDED, THE GENTLENESS THAT YOU USE, BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU ARE A JOURNALIST, AND JOURNALIST WON A STORY. THAT COU HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH IN MANY OTHER WAYS THAT WERE NOT KIND AND GENTLE. &gt;&gt; SO, FIRST SEEING THAT VIDEO IN GENERAL GAVE US A DOSE OF OPTIMISM. AS HORRIBLE AS IT IS AS A PARENT TO SEE YOUR KID UNDER GUNPOINT BEING PUSHED WITH ONE ARM, THE COMPOSURE FROM WHICH HE'S WALKING ON HIS OWN LEGS, PULLING HIMSELF WITH HIS ONE WEEK HAN, HE'S A LEFTY, AND HIS LEFT ARM WAS BLOWN, OF PULLING HIMSELF IT IS ONE-WEEK HAND ONTO THE TRUCK, GAVE ME A REAL GHOST OF HIS STRENGTHS THAT HE IS HANDLING A HORRIBLE SITUATION, AND HE IS DOING IT WOULD COMPOSURE. &gt;&gt; WE'RE SAYING HE WALKED OUT CALMLY, WHICH HE DID, BUT I THINK IT WAS FROM SHOCK. &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE THIS PHOTO TAKEN INSIDE THE SHELTER BEFORE HAMAS GUNMAN BEGAN THROWING GRENADES INSIDE. RACHEL SAYS, AS MANY AS 29 PEOPLE WERE CRAMMED TOGETHER. THAT IS HERSH, AND THIS IS HIS FRIEND. &gt;&gt; HURST AND HIS FRIEND WENT TO THE FESTIVAL TOGETHER. THEY'VE KNOWN TO THE SINCE THEY WERE KIDS. HONOR WAS BEHIND THE DOOR, AND BY ANYONE'S ACCOUNT WHICH WE SPOKE TO, AS THEY WERE THROWING GRENADES, HE WOULD KEEP PICKING THEM UP AND THROWING THEM OUT, PICKING THEM UP THROWING THEM OUT. ALL THESE WITNESSES SAID THERE WERE 11 GRENADES THROWN IN. HE THREW OUT EIGHT. &gt;&gt; RACHEL SAYS EIGHT PEOPLE SURVIVED AND DEVOTED CAPTURED BY HIDING BENEATH THE BODIES OF THE DEAD. HIS FRIENDS ARE TO MAKE IT OUT ALIVE. &gt;&gt; HIS PARENTS CAME TO HER HOUSE ON FRIDAY, AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IDENTIFYING BODIES ACTUALLY LET THEM KNOW THAT THE IDENTIFIED HIM WITH DNA, BUT IN HIS HAND HE WAS HOLDING A GRENADE. HIS DEAD BODY HAD A GRENADE IN IT IN HIS HAND. THIS MEANS HE IS THE REAL HEROES. THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE, AND EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO WALKED OUT AND ARE NOW IN GAZA, IT IS BECAUSE OF HONOR. &gt;&gt; HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO GET THROUGH EACH DAY? &gt;&gt; I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO KEEP RUNNING TO THE END OF THE EARTH TO SAVE HIM. WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING AND BELIEVING THAT SOMEHOW HE GOT TREATMENT, AND HE IS THERE, AND HE IS IN PAIN, AND SUFFERING, BUT HE'S ALIVE AND THERE. THERE ARE ALSO THE MOMENTS IN THIS UNIVERSE THAT WE NOW LIVE, WHERE YOU SAY, MAYBE HE DIED ON THE TRUCK. MAYBE HE BLOOD OUT IN THE TRUCK. MAYBE HE DIED YESTERDAY. MAYBE HE DIED FIVE MINUTES AGO. THERE ARE THOSE MOMENTS WHERE YOU THINK, HOW ARE THESE THOUGHTS EVEN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE THOUGHTS. THEY ARE REAL THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; THEY OFTEN GO DOWN TO SEE THEIR SONS ROOM. &gt;&gt; THIS IS HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN'S ROOM? &gt;&gt; IT'S A STEEL DOOR BECAUSE IT'S OUR BOMB SHELTER AS WELL. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN FEEL HIM HERE CLOSE, HIS GLOBE, HIS BOOKS, AND MOMENTOUS, IT'S ALL JUST AS HE LEFT THEM. RACHEL DID MAKE HIS BED HOWEVER, SHE WANTS IT READY FOR WHEN HE RETURNS. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A PORCH THAT'S FACING SOUTH, AND THEY WENT OUT FRIDAY NIGHT. I WAS SCREAMING TO HIM. HOPING. FRIDAY NIGHT WE BLESS OUR CHILDREN TRADITIONALLY, AND JEWISH HOMES YOU BLESS YOUR CHILDREN ON FRIDAY NIGHT. SO, I WAS SCREAMING. IT'S A TRADITIONAL BLESSING FROM THE BIBLE. I WAS SCREAMING THE BLESSING TO HIM. MY HANDS OUT. I USUALLY PUT MY HANDS ON HIS HEAD WHEN HE'S HOME. &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THE BLESSING SAY? &gt;&gt; IT SAYS, MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY HIS FACE SHINE UPON YOU AND BE GRACIOUS TO YOU. MAY GOD'S COUNTENANCE BE LIFTED UP TOWARDS YOU AND GIVE YOU PEACE. &gt;&gt; WOULD YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT HERSH? &gt;&gt; HE'S A SUPER CURIOUS KID, AND THIS WANDERLUST HE DEVELOPED WHEN HE WAS SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD HAS BEEN HIS LIFE, OBSESSION ALWAYS ASKING FOR MAPS AND GLOBES AND ATLAS IS FOR HIS BAR MITZVAH. THESE LAST FEW YEARS HE'S REALLY SAVED EVERY PENNY TO GO ON THIS TRIP THAT HE HAS A TICKET FOR ON DECEMBER 27TH. HE WAS GOING TO GO TO INDIA, AND THEY'LL ALL POINTS. EAST &gt;&gt; RACHEL AND JOHN WERE ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE WORLD TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE PLAY OF THE HOSTAGES, PARTICULARLY THOSE LIKE HER TO HAVE SERIOUS WOUNDS OR MEDICAL ISSUES. &gt;&gt; AS AMERICANS ISRAELIS, WE HAVE BEEN EMBRACED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE SUPPORT IS THERE. THE EMPATHY IS THERE FROM THE U.S.. WE ARE OBVIOUSLY HUNGRY FOR MORE THAN THAT. WE WANT ACTION. WE WANT RESULTS. THERE ARE HOSTAGES FROM SOMEWHERE AROUND 30 COUNTRIES, WHY HAVE WE NOT YET SEEN PRIME MINISTERS, FOREIGN MINISTERS, GLOBAL LEADERS SCREAMING TO GET THE WOUNDED HELP? &gt;&gt; RACHEL ALSO GOT TO BE IN A POOL WITH OTHER AMERICAN FAMILIES AND PRESIDENT BIDEN. &gt;&gt; HE STAYED FOR 90 MINUTES AND LISTEN TO US, AND CRIED WITH US. &gt;&gt; I KNOW LOSS, I HAVE LOST TWO CHILDREN, I LOST MY WIFE, AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH THIS, BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO REMEMBER THAT YOU WILL BE STRONG AGAIN FOR YOUR FAMILY. HE SAID THINGS THAT BECAUSE HE KNOWS LAWS, SO IT WASN'T PLATITUDES, IT WAS SOMEONE SPEAKING WHO HAS LOST CHILDREN, SPEAKING TO A MOTHER WHO LOST HER TWO CHILDREN. IT'S WAS REAL MOMENT OF COMING TOGETHER JUST AS PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT'S PAIN IS. THIS VERY EXCRUCIATING PARTS OF PAIN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A PARTICULAR KIND OF &gt;&gt; CORRECT. THERE IS NO PLAYBOOK FOR THIS THAT WE KNOW OF. THE GAME DAILY IS HE ALIVE? IS HE GETTING TREATMENT? DID HE DIE 15 DAYS AGO? WE ARE ON THE HEAD OF A PEN, AND EVERY DIRECTION YOU FALL IS A BAD DIRECTION. SO, A LOT OF HOW WE GET THROUGH THE DAY WHEN YOU ASKED THAT REPORT IS WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE ON THE HEAD OF THE PIN AND JUST GET EVERYTHING DONE WITH THE HOPE THAT HE WILL COME HOME TO US ALIVE, AND HE'LL GO ON THAT TRIP WITH ONE HAND. &gt;&gt; JOHN AND RACHEL. WITH ME NOW IS VETERAN CHIEF OF JERUSALEM POST. THE SITUATION WITH THE HOSTAGES IS SO HORRIFIC AND SICKENING. DO YOU HEAR, WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE DO WHAT DO THEY TALK ABOUT FIRST, WHAT DO YOU HEAR FROM PEOPLE? I THINK THE RALLIES ARE IN A STATE OF SHOCK AND TRAUMA. THEY'RE ALSO IN THIS WAITING GAME, NOT KNOWING WHETHER THIS GROUND OFFENSIVE IS GOING TO HAPPEN OR NOT. THERE ARE 360,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE MASKED ON THE BORDER, AND THAT AFFECTS FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE, SIBLING, SPOUSES, PARENTS IN SOME CASES. SO, I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE MOST OF. THE HOSPITALITY WAGING IS VERY MUCH ON PEOPLES MINDS. THAT HAS BEEN VERY MUCH THE CONVERSATION THIS TIME. &gt;&gt; HAMAS COULD RELEASE ALL THEIR HOSTAGES RIGHT AWAY. THE GAME THEY ARE PLAYING OF RELEASING TWO BY TWO IS VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS A TACTIC THERE AND THE STRATEGY THERE, THE MANIPULATION OF IT. IT IS INCREDIBLE TO ME THAT WOUNDED HOSTAGES, AND FANS, TODDLERS, PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MEDICAL CONDITIONS ARE STILL BEING HELD. &gt;&gt; IT'S SHOCKING. THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE ANYTHING WE'VE ENCOUNTERED OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS. I DON'T KNOW THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAS THE VOCABULARY TO ENABLE US TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH. BUT, THE HORROR OF HAVING SMALL INFANTS, ELDERLY PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OR
