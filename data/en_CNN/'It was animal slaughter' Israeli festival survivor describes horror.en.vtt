00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.543
The infamous rampage through

00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:02.168
the outdoor

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:03.169
music festival

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.172
killed at least 260 partiers, at least.

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:08.633
Many are still missing, and the stories

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:09.676
keep coming out.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.762
Sara Ben Sala barely survived.

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.931
He's shown here dancing with friends

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.142
just hours before the massacre.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:17.892
And I spoke to him

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:19.519
from hospital in Tel Aviv.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.687
And a warning to

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:24.441
his story is difficult to hear.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.026
I want to make it clear.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:29.029
First thing first,

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.822
it was at this festival

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:31.740
and we

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.367
and we did nothing to provoke them.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.037
We just was dancing and having fun.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:37.746
I can't.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.247
I can forget the moment

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:41.499
that when I got in the festival

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:43.835
and I don't know anybody, anyone there,

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:47.505
it was something like 34,000 people.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.175
And just got into the entrance and a

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:51.551
just a guy that I don't even know

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.302
then came to me

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.304
and start to hug me and bless him

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:56.056
for coming for the festival.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.932
We had a small camp

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:59.476
next to us, the German

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.770
people from German, just tourist

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.354
who came all over the way from Berlin

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:05.440
or wherever they came,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.484
and we made drinks together.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:08.234
We had laugh.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.820
It's just so much happiness.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.946
What happened to you?

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.282
Tell me how you got wounded.

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:17.535
And I forget when I saw the story.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.995
The first moment that we realized

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.205
that there is myself,

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:23.041
I was really come in first

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:23.958
because it's not the first time

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.293
to the same

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:26.586
missiles I was fighting in

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.088
there took it down.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.380
And then I was doing.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.382
I've been serving the army.

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:31.841
And then

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.259
then the start towards the missiles.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.887
And one of the producers of the festival

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.598
just jumped on the fence

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:39.224
and screamed

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:40.683
that the terrorists are coming

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:41.768
and legs and legs

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.228
just they kind of landed

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:44.896
not there for myself.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.856
And then the panic begin.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.191
It was a big panic.

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:50.068
Everybody was jumping on the fence.

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:51.694
Everybody ran to their cars

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:54.489
and there was a lot of fire out there.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.575
Just even in the biggest war thing

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:59.953
that we seen in the movie movies.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:00.703
I can explain

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:02.622
almost how many bullets and missile

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.207
were flying around up,

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:07.043
not to the big mister like RPG

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.629
and everything was RPG all over.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.755
I was fighting in the war.

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:13.091
Never seen so many RPG history.

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:14.551
And how did you get shot?

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:18.263
And Sahar, how did you get get shot?

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:19.681
The part of the story,

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.474
we tried to go to another place

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.059
and they turned us around again.

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.977
And then when

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:24.853
we saw a policeman

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:26.187
standing next to a shelter

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.564
and the look of us

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:28.314
and the policeman

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.107
look at us say,

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:30.316
there is no ID, there are,

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.901
they are all over the place.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:32.944
Get inside the shelter.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:35.530
It's the only way we got inside.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.823
The shelters are suffering.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.575
I remember 30 or 40 people,

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.451
but my friend say that was six

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:43.538
still living there, 50 or 60 people.

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:44.455
And we got inside.

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:46.332
The shattered was something like

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.709
two meters at all,

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.461
like just two meter square.

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.255
And we got inside

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.590
and then the shooting started

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.593
and the policeman tried to come down.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.554
It's not a terrorist is the IDF.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.472
But the shooting was on us.

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:03.141
I could see the shot.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:03.808
I couldn't.

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:05.852
I can feel on the

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:09.272
on the stance of the soldier killed

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:10.815
at the bullets.

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.901
In this case, it's not IDF.

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.110
It's not IDF.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.321
And then just look at us, say,

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.698
stay inside, pull out the gun.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.783
And then it was a mass of shots

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:21.701
all over the place.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.245
We can see in the intensive, the shelter,

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.872
a lot of bullets flying inside,

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:26.915
but they couldn't get us

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.292
because if they can turn left,

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:30.835
but because it was an entrance

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:32.503
and then left to the shelter,

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:34.297
a small something like.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.424
So we made the saw.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:36.966
It sounds

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.135
to me like you're

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:40.803
directed to take shelter,

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:43.264
but you were like a cornered animal

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:47.060
in this shelter because that's where the.

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:47.977
Shelter it wasn't.

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:49.687
It wasn't the shelter.

00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:52.315
It was animal slaughter.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:53.483
It's like they take

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:54.817
all the animals to one place

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:56.236
and shoot them all.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.070
And then

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.989
the policeman got shot in the run away

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.282
and he killed one of the terrorists,

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.076
but got shot and thrown away.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.286
I found him on soccer life and God,

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.413
the policeman

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:12.919
and one second, silly.

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:13.920
Then they

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.923
they dropped the first grenade

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.007
drop inside.

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:23.972
It was to explode in the entrance.

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.683
I'm sorry if it's too much to.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:28.851
Take my life. Okay.

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.436
I need to tell about this.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:33.815
Just a second, please. Thank you.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:34.565
After the first

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:38.361
grenade of something like 45 seconds,

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.613
it dropped the second grenade

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:43.366
and they hit the wall, hit my head

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.326
and blow to the back of the rope

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:46.786
for the people of the people

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:50.164
in the back row and explode on their.

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:50.790
And then was it

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.793
something like a lot of smoke inside?

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:55.753
And they my friend, their friend,

00:04:55.753 --> 00:04:57.088
they start to choke.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:58.673
And she wanted to go out

00:04:58.673 --> 00:04:58.965
and to

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.675
start to run away from the shelter.

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:01.676
We tried to catch her.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:02.176
I remember

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:04.387
I wasn't the second of the people.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:05.930
I tried to catch her with my hand

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.100
and it was sleeping and she tackle,

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.811
I think she tackled the terrorists

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:12.854
and the shutter

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:16.524
Then from the zero, from zero

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:17.692
point blank.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:21.070
From point blank. Point blank

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:21.571
from point

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.866
blank and after, after each other.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.451
Then it just got to the side.

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:29.078
I could never forget the face of it.

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:30.788
It was smiling at us.

00:05:30.788 --> 00:05:33.291
It looks like the devil just looked at us

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.125
one point.

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:34.917
The gun,

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:35.501
the column,

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:39.213
the machine gun in front again, face.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:42.300
And just to spread everything around

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.884
all the people.

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:44.886
I was in the second row,

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.054
all the people in the first

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.931
or in the second row shot dead.

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:51.976
I just opened my eyes and opened my mouth

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.811
and start to go down the world

00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:54.312
because I got

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.481
I understood that I got hit.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.648
But then in a state

00:05:57.648 --> 00:05:59.317
where yet because it was blood

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.735
all over and screaming

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.195
and from all the adrenaline,

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.488
I got it it in my body.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:04.906
But I can't really understand

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.407
what happened.

00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:09.160
And I think his gun was broken that way.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.119
Stopped the shot

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:11.496
and there was a third grenade

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.289
inside of the building,

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.540
but it didn't explode.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.666
We found him on the floor.

00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:17.126
We would you say with that

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:18.002
we don't don't touch it

00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:19.962
so it wouldn't explode.

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:21.839
You know what, Sara?

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:25.009
I'm just pleased that you made it out.

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.930
What a complete and utter horror.

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:32.183
I wish it was all over in all the movie.

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:34.185
You can go outside somehow.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.562
We then. And no joke.

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:38.773
I saw the kids that

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.651
the bodies full of bullets again,

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.153
that all all the body parts on the floor.

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:46.364
And she was calling to her boyfriend

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:47.407
and dead boyfriend

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.117
and start to kiss him until she got

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.743
she died by herself.

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:52.662
Wow. I'm so sorry.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.205
I'm so sorry for you.

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:56.582
I'm so happy that you survived.

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:59.460
And we wish you all the best.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.379
And we thank you for this story,

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.380
because as you say,

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.798
it's important for people to hear

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:04.924
what happened.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.968
Thank you very. Much. Thank you, sir.

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.428
Thank you.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.137
Thank you.

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.055
Just really wanted to make it clear.

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.849
Just last think.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.058
It wasn't the war.

00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:16.310
It was a slider. Cicely.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.728
It wasn't the war.

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.897
It was a big slider

00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:22.900
that didn't care about animals or people.

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:23.443
You didn't care

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.027
if you're a Jew, American,

00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:26.654
a Christian, even not a muslim.

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:27.947
They killed even evil Muslims.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:28.990
They killed

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.829
you didn't care about anything.

00:07:34.912 --> 00:07:35.955
I was convinced.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:36.873
My conversation

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:40.835
with Sahar in the hospital in Tel Aviv

00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:41.878
is too difficult.
