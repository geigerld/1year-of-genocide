00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.375
No one

00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:02.502
is watching Israel's war against Hamas

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:03.670
more closely

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.546
than the Russian president,

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:05.714
Vladimir Putin,

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:07.674
who is now trying to seize on the war

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.425
to say that it is

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:09.092
a battle

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:10.176
between the United States

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.262
and Israel versus the rest of the world.

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.889
Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:18.643
as Israel's

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:21.396
military continues its war against Hamas.

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:25.316
Russian leader Vladimir Putin is framing

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:26.192
the conflict

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.862
as part of a global struggle of America

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:29.904
and the West

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:31.698
against the rest of the world.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.741
Even the

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:33.491
new British,

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:34.868
it's the current ruling elites

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.036
of the United States

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.037
and their satellites

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.413
that are the main beneficiaries

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:39.831
of global instability.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:43.376
They extract their blood toll from it.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.336
While many nations around the world

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:46.421
condemned Hamas

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.714
after the October 7th

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.591
raid on southern Israel,

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.551
killing more than 1400

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.719
and taking hundreds of

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.554
hostages, including Russians

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.599
Russia invited a high

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:59.017
level Hamas delegation

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.727
to Moscow for meetings.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.936
A top Hamas leader

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:03.688
saying the group would give preference

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:04.564
to captives

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.066
from what they call their, quote,

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.443
Russian friends at home.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:10.361
This request from Russia

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:11.863
we treat more positively

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:12.906
and attentively

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:13.698
than others

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.533
due to the nature of our relations

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.495
with Russia. So,

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:19.037
so far,

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.455
no Russian hostages

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.040
appear to have been released.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.166
Still, Moscow

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.001
not criticizing Hamas

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.295
Instead, ripping only into Israel

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.047
for the many Palestinians

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.632
killed by the IDF's

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.967
ongoing aerial campaign in Gaza

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:36.012
some day, terrorism Condemning terrorism.

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:37.680
We categorically disagree

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.349
that terrorism can be responded

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:40.850
to by violating the norms

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.019
of international humanitarian law,

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:44.312
including the indiscriminate

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:45.814
use of force against targets

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.315
where the civilian population

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.818
is known to be located.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.071
But for years,

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.448
it was Russia that waged a relentless

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.616
bombing campaign

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:57.450
against areas

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.326
held by rebels

00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:00.036
opposed to Syrian President

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:00.954
Bashar al-Assad.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:02.956
The U.S.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.165
and various international

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:05.750
aid groups accused Moscow

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.461
of deliberately targeting civilian areas,

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.463
including hospitals and markets,

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.841
killing and wounding scores.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:13.716
Even though the Kremlin

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.969
has consistently denied those claims.

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:19.973
And Russia's war against

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.432
Ukraine continues.

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:22.433
Moscow once again

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:23.893
harming civilian structures

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:25.061
overnight in the port

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.605
town, Odessa, wounding several people

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:30.817
Vladimir Putin, though, trying to argue

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:31.693
that Russia

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.486
is invading Ukraine

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:36.197
to help the Palestinians international.

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:36.614
So does

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:38.616
the nations of These are all soldiers

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:39.576
and officers.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:40.910
And the choice of a real man,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.912
a real warrior, is to pick up arms

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:44.622
and stand in line with his brothers,

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:46.624
be in a place where the fate of Russia

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:48.835
and of the whole world is being decided,

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.044
including the future

00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:51.588
of the Palestinian people,

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:52.839
leadership, Palestine.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:53.548
Vladimir Putin

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:54.674
there errand essentially

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.593
trying to pit the entire rest

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:57.135
of the world

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:59.220
against the US and its allies,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.681
including, of course, Israel as well.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:03.641
And this is not new from Vladimir Putin

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.935
pretty much since he's invaded Ukraine.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:06.227
He's been

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:06.895
speaking about

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:10.023
wanting a new world order, as he puts it,

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:11.774
one in which countries like China

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:14.235
and Russia are much stronger and the U.S.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.737
is weakened Aaron.

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.280
Fred, thank you very much.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.364
And I want to go now to Barack

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.783
Ravi, the Axios foreign policy reporter,

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:23.119
long time Israeli reporter as well.

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.620
All right.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:24.662
Great to speak with you.

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:25.538
And obviously, you know,

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.165
you hear Fred's reporting there

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.750
and you've done extensive

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.418
reporting on Putin and Russia's

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:31.002
role here.

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.421
What is Vladimir Putin doing here?

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:37.884
And I think

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.928
what we see from Vladimir Putin

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.096
since the beginning of this war

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:43.723
is something that, at least from

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:48.186
my point of view, was very unusual

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:52.065
because for more than a decade, Vladimir

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.192
Putin tried to maintain

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:56.361
a close relationship with Israel.

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.862
And during this conflict,

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.405
he just decided to

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.199
throw Israel under the bus.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.742
And when you think about it,

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.953
when you try and go like you know,

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.705
30,000 feet up,

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:09.791
you maybe know the reason why.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.960
Because if you look at this war, the

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.337
I think the person who

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:15.672
gets the most out of this

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.048
war is Vladimir Putin

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:20.093
when after the entire world

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.513
attention was on his invasion to Ukraine.

00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:25.640
Now, the entire attention

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.683
of the international community

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:27.725
is on the Middle East.

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:31.396
And it gets gets him a lot of air

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.357
to do things without anybody watching.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.276
And Fred showed

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.860
that Moscow had invited

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.237
top Hamas leaders to visit

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:41.322
after the October 7th terror attacks.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:42.907
So they made a point, right?

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.617
It's not just saying things

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:45.535
between the lines.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.287
It's an invitation to come visit us.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.997
But because, you know, Hamas

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:49.539
has been meeting

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.999
with top Russian officials,

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.208
including the foreign minister,

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.084
Sergei Lavrov,

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.752
this has been going on for years,

00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:56.045
including multiple times

00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:58.423
since Russia invaded Ukraine.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.718
So what do you think this means is

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.553
I mean, this is an investment over time.

00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:06.139
That's true.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:06.764
That's true.

00:05:06.764 --> 00:05:10.018
But and it's a big but Vladimir Putin

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:13.771
for years, one of his prides was that

00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:16.190
he takes care of Russian speaking

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:17.650
people abroad.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.861
He still sees them as part of Russia

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.612
in another part of the world.

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:22.905
And Israel is a country

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:23.948
where you have

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:27.076
1 million Russian speaking people.

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:29.829
And a lot of many of them

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:33.624
were harmed in the October 7th attack.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:35.501
And Putin didn't seem to care.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.836
And I think that the fact

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:37.754
that they invited

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:38.755
the Hamas delegation

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:39.714
a few days later,

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.758
I think that was a clear message.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.634
On which side Putin is on.

00:05:43.634 --> 00:05:44.510
It's pretty incredible, though,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.553
the point that you point out,

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:47.263
1 million Russian speakers.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:48.306
And I think something many,

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.975
many may not realize about about Israel.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.310
And some of them, by the way,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.895
some of them are hostages in Gaza

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.313
right now. Right.

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:55.688
Right.

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:57.690
As he meets with Hamas

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.817
in that context, in this interview

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:00.526
that Prime Minister

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:01.944
Netanyahu just gave to ABC News,

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:02.945
he says, I think Israel

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.739
will for an indefinite period

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.824
have the overall security responsibility

00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:07.450
because we've seen

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.618
what happens when we don't have it,

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:09.494
referring to Gaza.

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:10.953
Now, we know his ministers have said

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.206
that he's intimated this before Barak,

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.458
but he puts the word indefinite on it.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.502
What do you see here?

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:21.464
I think that what we're going to see in

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:24.092
Gaza is in many ways similar

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.260
to what we see in the West Bank

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.096
in the last 15 years.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.640
And this is that Israel keeps

00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:34.143
the overall security responsibility

00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:35.269
for itself

00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:36.854
coming every night

00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:38.314
into Palestinian cities

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:41.109
to arrest suspects of terror activity.

00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:43.611
Obviously, Gaza is not the West Bank.

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.113
It's not going to be exactly the same.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:48.616
But I think that when it comes to the do

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.494
the policy Israel will try to

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:53.663
do the same thing

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.331
it is doing in the West Bank

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:56.874
now in Gaza, again,

00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:58.626
after this operation

00:06:58.626 --> 00:06:59.377
will end

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.253
and who knows

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.296
how long it is going to take.

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:03.047
All right, Barak,

00:07:03.047 --> 00:07:03.673
thank you

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:04.882
very much, as always,

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:06.634
for your perspective. We appreciate it.

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:07.009
Thank you.
