00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.134
CNN has learned that

00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:01.735
Prime Minister

00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:02.936
Benjamin Netanyahu

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:04.938
is meeting with his war cabinet

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:05.839
just ahead of what

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:06.606
they anticipate

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:09.376
could be a potential attack from Iran.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.878
It comes after an Israeli airstrike

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:13.313
hit the Iranian consulate

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:14.681
in Damascus, Syria,

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.248
last week,

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:16.316
killing a dozen

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.284
Iranian military officials.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.886
The Pentagon says the top U.S.

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:20.720
general for the Middle

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.288
East is in Israel right

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.690
now, meeting with Israeli

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.691
military officials

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.393
about the security threats.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.094
And the White House tells CNN

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:28.862
that officials

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.064
there are keeping a very close eye

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:32.699
on the situation

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.734
and are in constant communication

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.169
with Israel.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:37.470
Let's get to the latest reporting

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.705
from our correspondents,

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.707
CNN international diplomatic editor

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:41.608
Nic Robertson

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.309
is joining us from Jerusalem.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:43.743
And know

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:45.912
Toshiba Trend is over at the Pentagon.

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:47.347
Nic, first to you.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:47.747
First of all,

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:48.481
what can you tell us

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.650
about this Israeli war cabinet meeting?

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.886
How concerned are Israelis right now

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.954
that Iran could launch an attack,

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.390
a retaliatory attack against Israel

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.327
There's a real concern, Wolf,

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.363
that Iran could do that in the coming

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.331
24 or 48 hours.

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.499
I've talked to various

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.701
intelligence sources in the region

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.370
at the moment.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.005
They understand,

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:12.872
and this is what we're getting

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.874
from a lot of different sources,

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:17.210
that Iran is poised to respond.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.777
Now, of course,

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:20.947
this could be Iran intentionally dis

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:21.614
informing,

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.316
putting disinformation out there

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:24.984
just to create that.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.152
The sense of jitters

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:27.921
among the Israeli public here

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.089
among the leadership

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:29.789
in Israel

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.257
about precisely what they'll do,

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.226
and it's unclear what they'll do.

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.294
Will they respond

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.129
in straight back directly

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.364
to Israel themselves with the use proxies

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.666
to strike into Israel

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.633
with a strike,

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.734
Israeli interests

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.403
elsewhere in the region?

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:44.938
That's a question on people's

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:45.872
minds at the moment.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.575
But that strength of an show of unity

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.477
and support between the United States

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:51.044
and Israel

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:51.845
is on display

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.680
today at a cancer airbase

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.048
in the south of Israel.

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:56.583
The CENTCOM commander,

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.184
General Eric Correll, up there

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.352
with your article

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:00.987
and the Israeli defense minister,

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:03.990
the deputy IDF chief of staff also there.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.793
So this is very much a message of unity

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.228
and strength and preparedness

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.929
and this is what we heard from Rear

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.965
Admiral Daniel Hegarty,

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:15.201
the IDF spokesperson, just last night,

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:18.238
speaking about how prepared Israeli

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.573
is for whatever threat comes from Iran.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:23.910
We're highly alert and prepared

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.712
for a wide range of scenarios

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:26.613
and are conducting

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.615
a situational assessment

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.850
We're ready in both defense and defense

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.951
with the various IDF

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.154
capabilities and strategic partners.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:34.754
I'll take

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:36.122
you should give key

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:36.990
of Iran

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.925
a strike coming from Iranian territory

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:39.859
will clearly prove

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.127
that Iranian intentions

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:42.495
to escalate the situation

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.596
in the Middle East

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.632
and to stop hiding behind its proxies

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:50.003
And I think you get

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.571
a level of the understanding

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.540
of how this concern is shared

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.141
jointly between the United States

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:57.177
and Israel State Department

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.945
and the embassy here

00:02:58.945 --> 00:02:59.913
warning staff

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:00.613
not to stray

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:02.682
beyond the sort of Tel Aviv area,

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.717
Jerusalem area, Sheva area,

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.553
stay in those areas.

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:08.721
The concern is it's just not clear

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.456
what Iran's move is going to be.

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.825
The sense that it could be soon, Wolf.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:13.059
You know,

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.027
there's a lot of concern

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.895
in those embassy, the US embassy

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:17.830
and other embassies in Israel as well

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.966
are issuing warnings to their citizens

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:20.700
to stay put

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.701
basically

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.335
and worry

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:24.370
or start worrying about the potential.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:25.471
Let's hope it doesn't happen

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:26.439
about the potential

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.140
of this war

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.208
escalating big time

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.243
between Israel and Iran.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:32.011
Natasha, I want to go to the Pentagon

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.746
with you for a moment.

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:34.647
The top U.S.

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:37.016
military commander in the Middle East

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.017
the commander of the U.S.

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:40.053
military's Central Command is in Israel

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:40.486
right now.

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:42.255
We just heard Nick talk about that.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.690
What do we know about his trip?

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.724
The coordination

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.559
that's going on between the United States

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.561
and Israel in anticipation

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:51.965
and fear of a formal a full scale Iranian

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.700
retaliatory response?

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:55.501
Well, Wolf, Eric

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:56.769
Parrilla the top general

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.037
for the Middle East,

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:00.139
he did say that the U.S.

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:02.041
and the Pentagon did say

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.009
also that the U.S.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.210
stands with Israel

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.312
against any potential attack

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:08.081
that Iran might launch

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.015
against the Israelis.

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:09.782
And President Biden

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:11.618
made this very clear as well

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:13.353
that they are in constant coordination

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:14.220
with the Israelis

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.854
to prepare

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:15.755
for the possibility

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.924
that they do launch some kind of attack

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:19.626
directly on Israeli soil.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:20.693
And according to a readout

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:21.861
from the Israeli side,

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:22.762
General Eric Carol,

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:23.529
he did meet with

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:24.897
you have got today

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:25.665
to discuss

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.600
readiness for an Iranian attack

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.768
against the state of Israel,

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.237
which may lead to regional escalation.

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:31.771
So clearly,

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.373
all sides here are bracing

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:34.173
for the possibility

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.041
that this escalates

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:36.576
into a full on conflict

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:38.044
between Iran and Israel.

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:39.012
However, U.S.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.013
intelligence assessments,

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:40.680
as we reported

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.181
a little bit earlier in the week,

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:42.782
they assess that

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.817
this is more likely to be carried out

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.052
by Iranian proxy

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.420
forces in the region

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.322
rather than from Iran directly.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.723
And that is for a number of reasons,

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:52.158
but most prominently

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:53.760
is because the Iranians don't

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.095
necessarily want to get involved

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:56.963
in a full blown war

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:57.563
with Israel,

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:59.165
that the US, as they have stated

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:01.200
publicly, would then come to Israel's

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.035
defense with.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:04.170
So the Iranians trying to kind of temper

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.072
their response, according to our sources.

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:07.940
However, it is very possible

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.875
at this point,

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.443
according to intelligence assessments,

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:11.811
that these Iranian proxies

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.079
carry out attacks

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:15.581
against Israeli assets in the region.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.382
And so all sides

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:18.284
kind of bracing for that and importantly,

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:20.553
how Israel is going to respond,

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.522
because that is also going to inform

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:23.690
just how much

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.358
this conflict escalates Wolf.

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:27.126
So, Natasha, just to be precise,

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.361
if Hezbollah,

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.996
an Iranian proxy in southern

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.164
Lebanon, starts

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.299
launching rockets and missiles, bombs

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:35.368
towards Haifa, Tel Aviv,

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:37.136
elsewhere in Israel,

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.471
the Israelis presumably

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:41.174
would respond big time against Hezbollah

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:42.575
in southern Lebanon

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:44.711
and try to destroy their capability,

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:46.946
but it wouldn't necessarily attack

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:49.549
directly Iranian targets in Iran.

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.718
Is that the U.S. understanding as well?

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:53.286
Well, it's

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:55.221
not clear just whether the U.S.

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.889
would characterize

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:57.390
an attack

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.491
by an Iranian proxy

00:05:58.491 --> 00:05:59.792
against Israel as an attack

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.160
by Iran itself.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.494
The U.S.

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:02.228
has made very clear,

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:03.596
of course, that the proxies

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:04.997
are only able to function

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:05.998
and really survive

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.334
because of Iranian support for them.

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:10.203
But at the same time,

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.604
it would definitely be a layer

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:13.473
removed from Iran itself.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:14.574
If the proxies were the ones

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:15.575
carrying out these attacks.

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:16.676
However, Israel has said

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:18.911
that they are going to respond forcibly

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:20.613
to whatever kind of attack

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:21.748
they are faced with

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:23.149
by Iran or its proxies.

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:24.584
And so it just remains to be seen

00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:26.886
how exactly this is going to play out

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.321
are very important, very,

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:29.922
very worrisome developments

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:32.091
unfolding right now. Natasha, thank you.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.693
Nic, thanks to you as well.

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:34.694
I want to bring in CNN

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:36.129
military analyst, retired U.S.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.664
Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling.

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:40.400
General, thanks so much for joining us.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.335
As you know, officials are telling CNN

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:43.102
they expect

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:44.670
Iran will respond

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.706
imminently, key word imminently.

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:48.641
Do you think Iran is likely to strike

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:49.909
Israel directly

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.744
or could that happen through a proxy

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:54.046
like Hezbollah? For example, in Lebanon?

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.017
Everyone's asking that question, Wolf.

00:06:58.017 --> 00:06:59.752
And what I'd say is General Chiarelli

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:01.387
is there because he's looking at

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:02.889
what is the most dangerous

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.891
course of action that Iran will take.

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.592
And what's the most likely?

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:08.194
The most dangerous is a strike

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.163
by Iran inside of Israel,

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:11.597
because that could certainly cause

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.666
an inflection point and expand this war.

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.868
The most likely is all of your reporters,

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:19.172
Natasha just said, is likely an attack by

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:21.774
any number of proxy groups,

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:23.109
whether it's Hezbollah

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.043
in Lebanon

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:26.979
or any of the PMF forces in Iraq or Syria

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.748
or in the area.

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:30.583
So that's what General Khairallah

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:31.417
and probably

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:34.153
he has some of his intelligence officers

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:34.520
with them

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.255
as well as some of his operators

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:38.191
so that they can react with naval

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:40.326
and air forces from the U.S.

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:41.093
in case

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:42.061
anything does happen,

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:44.130
because the key is deterring

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.932
any further expansion

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:48.201
of this regional conflict.

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:49.502
The Israeli strike

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.204
on that Iranian consulate

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:52.672
building in Damascus

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:54.440
was, what, about a week or so ago?

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.374
Why do you think Iran

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:57.643
has not waited this long to respond?

00:07:57.643 --> 00:07:59.412
They immediately issued warnings

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:00.179
that they were going to

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:01.514
respond, but they haven't yet

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:04.350
Well,

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.851
part of it

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.620
is the messaging that Iran often uses

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:08.721
and they're concerned

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.723
about attacking inside of Israel

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:11.991
because truthfully,

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:12.892
Wolf, as you know,

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:15.561
Israel force is pretty extensive

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:16.696
and pretty confident

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:17.697
they can certainly go

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:19.532
after Iranian forces

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:21.300
if they do these kind of things.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.235
So I think Iran

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:23.836
is trying to get their proxies

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:25.137
together to determine

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:26.672
what would be the best

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:28.608
and most effective attacks

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.076
by their proxies

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.844
and potentially themselves

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:33.446
without being

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:34.580
deterred or countered

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.082
by any Israeli forces.

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:36.849
So, again, that's

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:40.119
why everyone is on the edge to see

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:41.521
which kind of force

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.823
Iran will use and how they will use it.
