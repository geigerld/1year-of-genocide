00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.036
Can I ask you first, as an

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:04.604
Arab, as a Palestinian,

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:07.007
as a human being, a mother.

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.308
How are you feeling?

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:11.711
Ever since October 7th,

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:14.247
Well, look, Christian,

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.115
I cannot begin

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.383
to describe to you

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:20.053
the depth of the grief, the pain

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:22.889
and the the shock

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.924
that we are feeling here in Jord

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:27.093
All of us are united in this gri

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.295
regardless of our origin.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.231
We are just.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:33.266
Just can't believe the images

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.968
that we're seeing every single d

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.269
coming out of us.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.504
We're going to bed

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:39.773
seeing those images and waking u

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:40.173
you know,

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:41.307
I don't know how to you know,

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:44.544
as a mom, we've seen Palestinian

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:44.911
who have had

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.346
to write the names

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.748
of their children on their hands

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:51.284
because the chances of them bein

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:52.886
to death of their bodies

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.788
turning into corpses are so high

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.090
I just want to remind the world

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.491
that Palestinian mothers

00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.292
love their children

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.660
just as much as any other mother

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.528
in the world.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.029
And for them to have to go throu

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.931
this is just unbelievable.

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.032
And equally,

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:08.034
I think the people all around

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:10.503
the middle East, including in Jo

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:12.439
we are just shocked and disappoi

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.007
by the world's reaction

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.643
to this catastrophe that is unfo

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:18.078
in the last couple of weeks.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.512
We have seen

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.682
a glaring double standard in the

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.718
When October 7th happened, the w

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.687
immediately and unequivocally

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:28.922
stood by Israel

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.090
and its right

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.192
to defend itself and condemned

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:33.726
the attacks that happened.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:34.727
But when we look

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.296
we're seeing the last couple of 

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.364
we have we're seeing silence in 

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.868
Countries have stopped at just e

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:45.038
concern or acknowledging the cas

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:48.374
But always with a preface of dec

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.610
of support for Israel.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.180
And are we being told that it is

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:57.550
to kill a family, an entire fami

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.551
at gunpoint,

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.987
but it's okay to shell them to d

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:02.722
I mean, there is a

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:04.591
glaring double standard here,

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.658
and it's it's

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.861
just shocking to the Arab world.

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.063
This is the first time in modern

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.265
that there is such human sufferi

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.299
and the world is not even

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.968
calling for a fire.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.836
So the silence is deafening.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:18.671
And to many in our region,

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:20.940
it makes the Western world compl

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.841
you know,

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.209
through their support

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.110
and through the cover

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.079
that they give Israel, that it i

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.081
its threat to defend itself.

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.682
Many in the Arab world

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:30.850
are looking at the Western world

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.185
as not just tolerating this,

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:34.120
but as aiding and abetting it.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.922
And this is just horrendous.

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:38.691
And it's deeply deeply disappoin

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:39.692
to all of us.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:40.193
Queen Rania,

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:40.793
I'm going to ask

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:41.794
you more about this

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:45.031
and go deeper into this, you kno

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.634
into your feelings about this.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.602
But first, I want to ask you,

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:49.903
you know,

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:52.572
the Israelis are shocked to thei

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:56.442
the grief, the the the the you k

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.911
what happened to them

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.412
has never happened in that way

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:00.980
since the Holocaust.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.516
And they are shaken to their cor

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.151
as I said, and the grief.

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.819
I just want to get

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.522
from you what you felt on Octobe

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:14.060
Well, of course, I was shocked.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.161
And, you know,

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.330
Jordan has made its position ver

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.699
We condemn the killing of any ci

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:20.900
whether Palestinian

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.102
or is really that is Jordan's

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:25.171
ethical and moral position.

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.140
And it's also the position of Is

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.142
Islam condemns

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:30.510
the killing of civilians

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.879
as my husband mentioned recently

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.847
the pact of all my which was iss

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:35.982
in the case of Jerusalem

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.951
15 centuries ago,

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:38.851
that's 1000 years

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.620
before the Geneva Conventions

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.790
orders Muslims not to hurt a not

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.592
a woman, child or elderly

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.126
and to be the person

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:50.363
and not to destroy a tree

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:53.032
or hurt a priest.

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.368
And so this is what we believe

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:57.070
are the rules of engagement

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.104
at a time of war.

00:03:58.104 --> 00:03:59.973
But they need to apply to everyb

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.874
So yes, there was the shock

00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:03.443
and there is the condemnation.

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:05.345
But why isn't there equal condem

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.046
to what is happening now?

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:09.082
I just want to emphasize that

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.717
what happened on

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:11.284
this conflict

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.019
did not begin on October 7th,

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.687
although it has been being portr

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:15.054
as that.

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:15.488
You know,

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:17.390
most networks are covering the s

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.425
under the title of Israel at War

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.361
But for many Palestinians

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.529
on the other side of the separat

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.498
and the other side of the barbed

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:27.033
war has never left.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.502
This is a 75 year old story

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.238
a story of overwhelming death

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:33.172
and displacement

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:34.540
to the Palestinian people.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.710
It is a story of an occupation

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:39.879
under apartheid

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.383
regime that that occupies land, 

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:46.919
that demolishes houses, confisca

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:50.757
military incursions, night raids

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:54.894
You know, the context of a nucle

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:56.429
regional superpower

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:58.531
that occupies, oppresses

00:04:58.798 --> 00:04:59.499
and commits

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.267
daily documented crimes

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:02.669
against Palestinians

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.470
is missing from the narrative.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.004
Queen Rania,

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:05.305
you know,

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.573
for too long, Palestinians live.

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:09.242
I'm sorry to interrupt. You.

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:10.777
I want to ask you a specific que

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.812
because you're using a lot of wo

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:15.915
which clearly many in your you k

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:17.016
in the Arab world

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.052
have used words like apartheid.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:19.485
And the rest.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:20.920
But you know,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.988
that you are going to come

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.523
under a lot of criticism

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:25.625
from Israel and its supporters.

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:26.559
And I'm wondering

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.061
whether you're coming out to spe

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:28.561
Let me just

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:29.595
I know size,

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:31.831
but let me just emphasize that

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.033
that apartheid is a designation

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:36.302
that was given not by Arabs,

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.670
but by Israeli

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.871
and international human

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:40.840
rights organizations.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.775
You wrote in an Instagram story

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.344
just in the last week.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.745
It isn't self-defense.

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:47.347
If you are an occupying force

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.582
and you show the destruction of 

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.984
And you have posted a video of y

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:55.221
from a presser in 2009 during th

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:57.190
saying it is heartbreaking

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.958
to see how little has changed

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.160
the world cannot remain silent.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.895
This this has to stop.

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:04.397
Do you

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:07.200
feel that you have a particular 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.002
you know, as queen of Jordan

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:11.537
in a country

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:13.606
that has a peace treaty with Isr

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.875
to speak up

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:19.479
It's not about me.

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.781
It's about speaking up for human

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:22.081
You know,

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:23.750
this is not about

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.586
being pro-Israeli or pro Palesti

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:29.522
This is about choosing the peopl

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.991
the everyday people on both side

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:34.827
And, you know, and explaining ag

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:36.963
that the Palestinian people

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:38.131
have for too long

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:39.832
been living under oppression

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:41.601
and the dehumanization.

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:42.368
You know,

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:44.670
they suffer daily indignities

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:46.839
and human rights violations

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:47.340
where they're

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.276
being jailed or humiliated or ha

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:52.845
They do not have freedom of move

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:55.648
There are over 500 checkpoints

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:58.050
scattered all over the West Bank

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.085
You have a separation

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.087
wall, which is deemed illegal

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.156
by the International Courts of J

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:03.656
that has

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:05.158
separated the territories

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:07.326
into 200 disconnected enclaves.

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:08.594
And, you know,

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.563
you've seen the aggressive expan

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:12.632
of settlements on Palestinian la

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:14.066
and those have interrupted

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.768
the territorial conviction

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:17.470
integrity of the territories

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.671
and has deemed

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:19.572
an autonomous,

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.941
independent Palestinian state no

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.277
So you are seeing all these

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.479
this is the background of this c

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:28.681
There's a hyper fixation on Hama

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:29.916
now because of

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:32.185
that happened the last couple of

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:33.386
But this is a problem

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:35.188
that far precedes Hamas

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:37.023
and will continue after Hamas.

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:39.058
This is a fight for freedom

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:40.193
and for justice,

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:41.994
and that is what needs to be hea

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:43.095
Can I ask you this question

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:46.165
then, because, you know, quite a

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:48.301
I think she's Saudi anyway.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.802
A journalist on the Saudi

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:51.671
television network Al-Arabiya

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:52.405
took this

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:53.372
and hammered Khalid

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:55.608
Meshaal, the former head of Hama

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:57.610
and said to him, the butchery,

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.511
that's my word.

00:07:58.511 --> 00:07:59.879
But she said what

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:02.882
everybody seen on their screens 

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:03.649
you know,

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:05.251
turned the world away

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:07.153
from the Palestine cause

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.855
and just to expand.

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:11.691
People are saying Hamas and what

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.526
Has brought this down

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:15.695
on these poor people of Gaza.

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:16.796
Do you accept that

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.100
Well, I believe I do

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.901
not believe

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:25.137
and as I said, the killing of ci

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:27.573
But this is a story of violence

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:29.742
that has been going on now for s

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:32.545
And this violence needs to be co

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:33.846
But at the end of the day,

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:36.048
what we're seeing today

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:38.518
and what people need to understa

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:41.521
is that, yes, you know, under th

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.257
of of the right to defend itself

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.626
we are witnessing atrocities.

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:46.859
You know,

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:48.160
every country has a right

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.961
to defend itself,

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:50.229
but not through any means,

00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:51.364
not through war crimes,

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.132
not through collective punishmen

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:53.699
You know,

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:57.169
6000 people, civilians killed so

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.472
2400 children.

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:01.474
How is that self-defense?

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:03.175
We are seeing butchery

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:05.111
at a mass scale using precision

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:06.546
precision weapons.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:07.146
You know,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.216
so for the past two weeks, we ha

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.451
the the indiscriminate bombardme

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:13.853
of Gaza,

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.557
entire families wiped out

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.891
residential neighborhoods

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:20.259
flattened to the ground,

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.961
the targeting of hospitals

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:25.498
and schools and churches and and

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:27.867
and medical workers

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:30.336
journalists and aid workers.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.872
How is that self-defense?

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:33.773
You know,

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.043
why is why is it that whenever

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:37.944
Israel commits

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:38.811
these atrocities,

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:39.345
it comes under

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:40.546
the banner of self-defense?

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:41.847
But when there's a

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:44.250
violence by Palestinians,

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.885
it is immediately

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:47.820
called terrorism?

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.788
Is the word terrorist.

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:50.056
It's just reserved

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:52.525
for exclusively for Muslims and 

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:53.559
Well, let me ask

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:55.227
there's a real double standard h

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:56.896
You're seeing your husband

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:59.131
being of all symmetry that we se

00:09:59.332 --> 00:09:59.999
Mm hmm.

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:01.734
Well, let me ask you this.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.402
Your husband, King Abdullah, act

00:10:03.402 --> 00:10:06.472
because these are not two equal

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:07.473
people in the conflict.

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:07.907
You know,

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.375
one is an occupier

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:11.143
and one is the occupied.

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:13.112
One has a military,

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:14.914
one of the mightiest in the worl

00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:15.681
and the other doesn't

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:16.916
have a military at all.

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:19.418
So there is a false symmetry her

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:20.653
that is being drawn.

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:22.455
And there's also

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.657
when you say the rights to defen

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.859
that does not say the entire sto

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:29.328
it doesn't say the story of the 

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:31.197
of international law,

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:32.865
international humanitarian law.

00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:34.600
It doesn't tell you the sufferin

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.036
and the end, the story of the oc

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:38.371
You know, Israel is in

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:39.605
violation of no less

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:40.706
than 30 UN

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:42.308
security resolutions

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:46.145
that require it's an IT alone to

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.380
withdraw from territories

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.716
occupied in 1967 to stop the set

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:51.484
the separation

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.719
wall, the human rights violation

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:56.355
This is at the crux of this issu

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:58.858
It is not this hyper fixation on
