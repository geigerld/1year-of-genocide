00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.560
Let's start with what's happening at that&nbsp;
hospital. Israeli forces have said that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.680
are engaged in intense fighting around Al shifa&nbsp;
hospital, the largest medical facility in gaza.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.360
I know you say that the hospital sits on top&nbsp;
of a hamas command and control center. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.560
of course, there are also patients, civilians&nbsp;
sheltering in that complex getting treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.000
How do you intend to go after hamas without&nbsp;
putting sick and injured civilians in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.160
hospital at more risk than they already are?
&gt;&gt; We've called to evacuate all the patients&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.720
from that hospital. In fact, 100 or so&nbsp;
have already been evacuated. I've called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.920
for hospitals, and the French president&nbsp;
has sent a floating hospital ship. I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.160
asked emirates to send a field hospital.&nbsp;
They have. Other countries have done the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.160
same. There's no reason why we just&nbsp;
can't take the patients out of there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.773
instead of letting hamas use it as a command&nbsp;
center for terrorism with the rockets they

00:00:57.773 --> 00:00:57.785
[9:03:40 AM]

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:00.720
terrorism with the rockets they fire against&nbsp;
Israel, for the terror tunnels they use to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.000
Israeli civilians. Remember, Dana, let's keep&nbsp;
this in focus. Just imagine what would happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.480
if the United States were attacked viciously&nbsp;
by 20 9/11s, that's the proportion number,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.240
50,000 Americans killed, 10,000 Americans&nbsp;
held hostage including babies, elderly, women,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.080
children, 10,000 rockets falling on your cities.&nbsp;
That's the number of rockets that are falling all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.440
the time on our cities, may fall during this&nbsp;
interview, as a matter of fact, and I'll have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.160
to go to a shelter. What would America do? It&nbsp;
would take all its force and go after these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.680
killers. What if these killers embed themselves&nbsp;
in hospitals, schools, U.N. Facilities? You'd do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.840
everything in your power to get the civilians&nbsp;
out, which is what we're doing. We call them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.800
to leave. You certainly wouldn't give immunity&nbsp;
top the terrorists. We're obviously treading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.040
carefully when it comes to hospitals, but we're&nbsp;
also not going to give immunity to the terrorists.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.400
[9:04:41 AM]

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.520
terrorists. So far, even though hamas has&nbsp;
tried to prevent the civilians from leaving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.720
hundreds of thousands have left, sometimes&nbsp;
having to go through hamas gun points and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.920
gunfire and wants to keep them in harm's way.
&gt;&gt; Just to be clear, sir, Israel will aid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.040
help these civilians who are quite sick&nbsp;
and inside these hospitals come out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.000
not just in Al shifa, but there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.680
other hospitals where this is happening?
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, we're telling them to leave.&nbsp;

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.000
&gt;&gt; Telling them or helping them?
&gt;&gt; Helping them by creating safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.080
corridors. We have designated routes to a safe&nbsp;
zone south of gaza city where there's no fighting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.560
and we're telling them, go ahead, move. By&nbsp;
the way, 70,000 have moved. Three days ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.600
I think 50,000 moved yesterday. More will move&nbsp;
today. We want all the civilians to be moved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.140
out of harm's way. Hamas is doing everything in&nbsp;
their power to keep them in harm's way. Go ahead.&nbsp;

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.760
&gt;&gt; Do you believe there are&nbsp;
hostages below that hospital,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.040
[9:05:41 AM]

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.040
hostages below that hospital,&nbsp;
Israeli or American hostages?&nbsp;

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.520
&gt;&gt; I'm not going to go into the intelligence&nbsp;
picture we have, but you know there's been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.080
this vicious thing -- they take hostages --&nbsp;
imagine a baby is held hostage. Who takes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.800
baby hostage? I don't know if you have children,&nbsp;
Dana, I'm sure your camera crew has, we all have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.600
children. What is this taking children hostage?&nbsp;
Threatening to kill them. This is savagery of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.600
the highest order. We're doing everything in our&nbsp;
power to achieve two things. One, destroy hamas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.440
because without it, none of us have a future.&nbsp;
It's not only our war. It's your war, too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:47.000
the battle of civilization against barberism. It&nbsp;
will pass to other places. Middle East will fall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.840
Europe is next, you'll be next. The first goal is&nbsp;
to destroy hamas and the second goal is to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.080
back our hostages. We're trying to do both.
&gt;&gt; Those are completely understandable goals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.668
goals that

00:03:59.668 --> 00:03:59.680
[9:06:41 AM]

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.200
understandable goals, goals that the United&nbsp;
States very much supports, understanding that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.560
hamas is a barbaric terrorist organization.&nbsp;
Israel is not hamas, and the United States&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.720
also makes very clear that democracies have to&nbsp;
do better. The secretary of state, Tony blinken,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.740
said that far too many Palestinian civilians&nbsp;
have been killed. What is your response to that?&nbsp;

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.560
&gt;&gt; I think any civilian loss is a tragedy and&nbsp;
the blame should be placed squarely on hamas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.000
because it prevents them from leaving the&nbsp;
war zone, sometimes at gunpoint. It's fired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.880
in the safe zone and the safe corridor that we&nbsp;
enacted. The other day to prevent Palestinians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.760
from leaving harm's way, it puts rockets inside&nbsp;
the schools, hospitals. It has tunnels below&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:55.040
children's beds. That's what we're dealing with.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, but because Israel isn't hamas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.825
is Israel doing everything possible to take that&nbsp;
into consideration? &gt;&gt; Yes, Dana, more than that.

00:05:00.825 --> 00:05:00.837
[9:07:43 AM]

00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:06.160
&gt;&gt; Yes, Dana, more than that. And more than that.&nbsp;
We're trying to minimize civilian casualties as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.040
a result of our ground action, I think the number&nbsp;
of civilian carpalities is actually being reduced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.800
because people are heeding our calls to leave&nbsp;
the area and defying hamas' attempt to keep them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.040
there, and we'll do everything in our power to&nbsp;
do that. The one example I can give you is this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:29.040
These savages, they perpetrated the worst horrors&nbsp;
on Jews since the holocaust. The German chancellor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:36.240
Schultz called them the new Nazis. Look at the&nbsp;
old Nazis. The allies were attacked by hitler so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.120
they invaded France and then Germany. When they&nbsp;
did that, they went into the cities. They had to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.760
fight the German army that was often embedded&nbsp;
in the cities, in civilian neighborhoods. Many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.800
civilians were killed. Who is the blame laid onto?&nbsp;
Did they say the Nazis -- the allies are wrong,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.708
the allies should stop fighting? They said,&nbsp;
look, use forces as judiciously as you can, but

00:05:59.708 --> 00:05:59.720
[9:08:44 AM]

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.120
judiciously as you can, but don't give the&nbsp;
Nazis any refuge, don't feed the Nazis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.040
Which is what we're doing, using force in&nbsp;
the most judicious way, we have to defeat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:17.480
these new Nazis, for our sake, your sake, too.
&gt;&gt; I want to ask about the hostages. Thousands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.440
of families rallied this weekend right across the&nbsp;
street from where you are right now. They're very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.000
frustrated they're not getting more information&nbsp;
from you on where their loved ones are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.240
believe your government is not doing enough&nbsp;
to get them back. What do you say to them?&nbsp;

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:41.440
&gt;&gt; It's understandable. They're under tremendous&nbsp;
distress, they're under torture. You can imagine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:48.277
you have your father, your husband, your&nbsp;
son, your daughter taken by these savages --&nbsp;

00:06:48.277 --> 00:06:51.920
&gt;&gt; Are you doing enough?
&gt;&gt; We're doing everything we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:58.800
can around the clock, and I can't talk about it.&nbsp;
I personally met with hostage families -- families&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.588
of hostages several times. It tears your&nbsp;
heart out. Yes, we're doing everything and

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:02.600
[9:09:46 AM]

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.440
Yes, we're doing everything and&nbsp;
many things that I can't say here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.520
obviously. But this is one of our two&nbsp;
war goals. One is to destroy hamas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.360
and the second is to bring back our hostages.&nbsp;
We'll do everything we can. We think the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.520
world should join us. Demand from the red&nbsp;
cross that it demand vips its to the hostages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:30.080
demand unconditional release of the hostages, say&nbsp;
this is barbarism that is unacceptable. I'd like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.080
to see the U.N., the U.N. Secretary-general who&nbsp;
basically laid the blame on Israel, lay the blame&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:43.800
on these savages. Israel is fighting according&nbsp;
to international law. The Israeli army is doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:50.840
an exemplarily job trying to minimize civilian&nbsp;
casualties and maximize terrorist casualties.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:58.160
We theed the international community not to give&nbsp;
support and moral support and legitimacy to sheer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.530
evil that hamas represents. Support Israel.&nbsp;
Attack hamas. &gt;&gt; Prime minister Netanyahu, one

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:03.542
[9:10:47 AM]

00:08:03.542 --> 00:08:08.880
&gt;&gt; Prime minister Netanyahu, one of the questions&nbsp;
right now is, when it comes to hostages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:16.000
is whether there can be a negotiation that works&nbsp;
towards a deal to free large groups of hostages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.280
in exchange for ap sustained days' long pause in&nbsp;
fighting. Is that acceptable to you? If so, how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:30.960
long of a pause would Israel be willing to allow?
&gt;&gt; I said we're going to pursue the battle to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:38.760
destroy hamas to its end. But I also said the&nbsp;
only cease-fire that we would consider is one in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.800
which we have our hostages released. That remains&nbsp;
true. It doesn't mean we can't give humanitarian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.120
pause for a few hours in a place, a specific time&nbsp;
and place where we want to have a humanitarian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.840
corridor and have the people leave safely. We've&nbsp;
done that, and hundreds of thousands have left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.880
the fighting zone in that fashion.
&gt;&gt; How long of a pause would you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.120
be willing to support?
&gt;&gt; So far we've dealt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.800
with a few hours. If you're&nbsp;
talking about a cease-fire --

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.240
[9:11:48 AM]

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.840
cease-fire --
&gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:13.120
cease-fire. A longer pause, days, for example.
&gt;&gt; That's not a pause. If you're talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.880
stopping the fighting, that's exactly what hamas&nbsp;
wants. Hamas wants an end Ms series of pauses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:27.080
that basically dissipate -- like the Germans after&nbsp;
normandy. Okay, let's have a cease-fire. Hold off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.600
let us replenish our supplies, get out of&nbsp;
our terror tunnels, let us rearm ourselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:38.640
and so on. Obviously we're not going to&nbsp;
do that. In order to have a cease-fire of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.340
any -- a cease-fire in the entire area, that&nbsp;
will require the release of our hostages.&nbsp;

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:50.320
&gt;&gt; The U.S. Says you need an extended&nbsp;
pause in order to get the hostages out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.280
Do you not believe that as well?
&gt;&gt; We don't -- we don't disagree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:01.880
with that, we need to get our hostages out.
&gt;&gt; The U.S. Also says any postwar plan for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.068
gaza must include palestinian-led&nbsp;
governance and gaza unified with

00:10:05.068 --> 00:10:05.080
[9:12:49 AM]

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:11.880
governance and gaza unified with the west bank&nbsp;
under the Palestinian authority. You appeared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.960
to reject that yesterday. You said Israel will&nbsp;
not accept a, quote, civilian authority there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.360
that educates its children to hate Israel.&nbsp;
I want to be clear. Are you saying Israel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:28.080
would not accept giving control of gaza over&nbsp;
to the Palestinian authority after the war?&nbsp;

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.800
&gt;&gt; The first thing we have to do is destroy hamas,&nbsp;
because otherwise they'll do it again and again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.400
and again and they've said so. We'll destroy&nbsp;
hamas. The second thing we have to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:44.320
is there has to be an overriding and overreaching&nbsp;
Israeli military envelope. We've seen, any place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:52.640
we leave, we exit, give it to some other force,&nbsp;
very soon terrorism resurfaces. The third thing we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:59.080
have to understand is a civilian authority has to&nbsp;
cooperate on two comboels, one is to demilitarize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:06.835
gaza, the second is to -- the Palestinian&nbsp;
authority has unfortunately failed on both

00:11:06.835 --> 00:11:06.847
[9:13:52 AM]

00:11:06.847 --> 00:11:10.480
has unfortunately failed on both counts.&nbsp;
They don't demilitarize the west bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.640
We have to do it. We have to fight the&nbsp;
terrorists. They don't deradical lies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:23.000
teach children the hate red of Israel, they&nbsp;
pay for laefs, the more Jews they kill,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:33.240
the more they pay. They refuse to this day,&nbsp;
36 days after this savagery, to condemn what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.157
hamas did on October 7th.
&gt;&gt; If not the P.A. --&nbsp;

00:11:38.157 --> 00:11:42.760
&gt;&gt; There has to be a reconstructed civilian&nbsp;
authority. There has to be something else.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.520
Otherwise we're just falling into that same&nbsp;
rabbit hole. We're going to have the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.080
result. Remember the P.A. Was already in gaza.&nbsp;
When Israel left gaza, it handed the keys over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:59.880
to P.A. Within a very short time hamas took&nbsp;
over, kicked them out. They're not willing to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.960
fight hamas. They're still not willing to fight&nbsp;
hamas. You have to have some kind of authority,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.740
civilian, Palestinian authority that&nbsp;
is willing to fight the terrorists and

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.120
[9:14:53 AM]

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.040
fight the terrorists and educating --&nbsp;
important LI must educate the children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:18.720
for a fewer of peace, peace, cooperation,&nbsp;
prosperity. Cooperation with Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.960
not the annihilation of israelment so&nbsp;
far that hasn't happened. The burden of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:28.560
proof is on the P.A. And they've failed every&nbsp;
single time. I say that regrettably. Honestly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.480
we have to be realistic about what we expect.&nbsp;
We can't fall back on formulas that failment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.280
we have to succeed, to succeed to give gaza a&nbsp;
better future. Let's not bring it to a failed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.840
past. Let's create a different reality there.
&gt;&gt; Prime minister Netanyahu, before I let you go,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:52.280
I know you've been asked this several times,&nbsp;
but I have had multiple people inside Israel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.160
reach out to me knowing that I was going to&nbsp;
interview you and say the one thing they want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:01.040
to hear from you is that you take personal&nbsp;
responsibility for failing to prevent the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.960
October 7th attacks and protecting your people. I&nbsp;
know you say the time for that will come after the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.976
war. Why won't you take responsibility now?
&gt;&gt; I've already addressed that many times.

00:13:11.976 --> 00:13:11.988
[9:15:54 AM]

00:13:11.988 --> 00:13:14.953
many times. And I said this whole&nbsp;
question will be addressed after the war.&nbsp;

00:13:14.953 --> 00:13:19.360
&gt;&gt; Why not now?
&gt;&gt; Well, did people ask Franklin Roosevelt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.840
after pearl harbor that question? Did people ask&nbsp;
George Bush after the surprise attack of November&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.360
11th? It's a yes that needs to be asked.
&gt;&gt; The question has been asked.&nbsp;

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.720
&gt;&gt; I've said the one thing that is important&nbsp;
-- I've said we're going to answer all these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.400
questions including I'm going to be asked tough&nbsp;
questions. I think right now what we have to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:46.280
is unite the country for one purpose, one purpose&nbsp;
alone. That's to achieve victory. That's what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:51.640
we did. We formed a unity government, the&nbsp;
country is June nighted as never before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:56.320
That's what we have to pursue. What the people&nbsp;
expect me to do right now is two things. One,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:02.800
achieve the victory and bring the hostages back.&nbsp;
Second, make sure that gaza never becomes --&nbsp;

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.680
&gt;&gt; Israelis are disappointed that you&nbsp;
won't take responsibility, you said?&nbsp;

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.658
&gt;&gt; I said I'll answer all the&nbsp;
questions required, including

00:14:11.658 --> 00:14:11.670
[9:16:55 AM]

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.880
questions required, including the questions of&nbsp;
responsibility. There will be enough time for
