00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.768
AND ON THE POLITICAL FRONT, IT

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:03.837
IS KIND OF A MIRACULOUS THING

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.972
WE SEE HAPPENING, WHICH IS THAT

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:07.807
WE JUST HAD MIKE MCCAUL, WHO'S

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.743
CLASHED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION,

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.011
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:11.411
BEFORE.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.880
CHAIRMAN OF HOUSE FOR AFFAIRS,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.849
HAS THREATENED TO HOLD TONY

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.751
BLINKEN IN CONTEMPT,

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.252
COMPLEMENTING TONY BLINKEN AND

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:20.887
THE ADMINISTRATION FOR BEING

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:21.855
THERE AND BEING ON THE GROUND

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:22.989
TO STAND WITH ISRAEL.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.725
WHO IS NOT DOING THAT IS THE

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:26.659
FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.060
STATES.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.897
DONALD TRUMP, AND I WANT TO

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.832
PLAY FOR EVERYONE WHAT HE SAID

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.934
YESTERDAY, BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.137
JUST RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.071
THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:38.972
LISTEN TO THIS.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.842
&gt;&gt; I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT BIBI

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.010
NETANYAHU LET US DOWN.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.845
THAT WAS A VERY TERRIBLE THING,

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:46.379
I WILL SAY THAT.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.848
WHAT I SEE SOMETIMES IN

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.917
INTELLIGENCE, WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:51.951
INTELLIGENCE OR YOU TALK ABOUT

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.186
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WENT

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.054
WRONG OVER THE LAST WEEK.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.889
THEY'VE GOT TO STRAIGHTEN IT

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.891
OUT, BECAUSE THEY'RE FIGHTING

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.059
POTENTIALLY A VERY BIG FORCE.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.960
AND THEY SAID, SHE, I HOPE

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.228
HEZBOLLAH DOESN'T ATTACK FROM

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.029
THE NORTH.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.964
BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:05.498
VULNERABLE SPOT.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:06.232
I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.168
YOU KNOW, HEZBOLLAH IS VERY

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:08.535
SMART.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:09.202
THEY'RE ALL VERY SMART.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:13.339
&gt;&gt; VERY SMART.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.441
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.209
THE WHITE HOUSE JUST PUT THIS

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:19.112
OUT, A SPOKESPERSON ON THESE

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:20.246
STATEMENTS SAYS, WE DON'T

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.215
COMMENT ON 2024.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.316
STATEMENTS LIKE THIS ARE

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:24.484
DANGEROUS AND UNHINGED.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.252
IT'S COMPLETELY LOST ON US WHY

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.221
ANY AMERICAN WOULD EVER PRAISE

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.123
AN IRAN-BACKED TERRORIST

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.325
ORGANIZATION AS SMART, OR HAVE

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.460
ANY OBJECTION TO THE UNITED

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.128
STATES WARNING TERRORISTS NOT

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:36.329
TO ATTACK ISRAEL, ESPECIALLY

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.198
NOW AS ISRAEL'S FIGHTING BACK

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.467
AGAINST ONE OF THE WORST ACTS

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:41.401
OF MASS MURDER IN THE COUNTRY'S

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:41.801
HISTORY.

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:43.369
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THERE USED TO BE

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.337
AN IDEA THAT WAS --

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.338
BY REPUBLICANS.

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:47.307
PARTISANSHIP OUGHT TO END AT

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:48.308
THE WATER'S EDGE.

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:50.176
THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE IN A

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.311
TIME OF CRISIS LIKE THIS, WITH

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:52.212
AN ALLY.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.113
THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:57.016
DIDN'T HAVE THE DECENCY TO TRY

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.019
TO UNITE THE NATION, BUT HIS

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.021
INSTINCT IS ALWAYS TO DIVIDE

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.256
AND MAKE IT ABOUT HIMSELF.

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:06.025
AND THEN TO PRAISE THE

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.094
TERRORISTS, WHO ARE MURDERING

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.295
CHILDREN, AS VERY SMART.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.165
YOU KNOW, IT REMINDS ME OF

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.100
LANGUAGE HE USED AFTER TEAM IN

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.101
SQUARE, WHEN HE PRAISED THE

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.269
CHINESE GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.171
FOR BEING TOUGH AND SMART.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:20.273
HE SEEMS TO PRAISE VIOLENT

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:22.175
ACTIONS BY SO-CALLED STRONGMAN

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:22.609
OR GROUPS.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.110
AND IT'S PART OF THAT.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.045
IT'S THIS INSTINCT TO MAKE IT

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.280
ALL ABOUT HIMSELF, NOT THINKING

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.182
ABOUT, OTHERS LET ALONE

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:30.216
THINKING ABOUT THE NATION.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.385
&gt;&gt; CAN I JUST QUICKLY ASK YOU

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:33.219
ABOUT THAT?

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.054
WE JUST SAW ANTHONY BLINKEN IN

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:38.057
A REMARKABLE, UNPRECEDENTED

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:39.159
GATHERING OF ISRAELIS, HUGGING

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.360
HIM, CRYING IN HIS ARMS.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.495
HE SECRETARY OF STATE, HE'S

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.563
WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.198
DO YOU SEE THIS AS DONALD TRUMP

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.133
TRYING TO FIND HIS ROLE, TO GET

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:50.069
THE ATTENTION HE SO CRAVES AS

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.137
OPPOSED TO TRYING TO GOVERN?

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.206
TRYING TO SHOW --

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:54.274
&gt;&gt; THAT'S INSTINCT.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:56.176
HE'S GOT TO INSERT HIMSELF.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.077
WHAT HE FEELS WHEN IT'S NOT

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.245
ABOUT HIM, EVEN IF IT'S A

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:01.080
TERRORIST ATTACK TRYING TO

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.382
INSERT HIMSELF IN THIS.

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:05.051
THE ABILITY TO RISE ABOVE AND

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:05.418
UNITE.

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.020
I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.154
ANYTHING MORE THAN HIS EGO AND

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.156
HIS INSTINCT TO PRAISE STRONG

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:10.490
MEN.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.292
NO BETTER HOW UGLY THAT IS.

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:15.295
THIS IS NOT HARD TO UNITE RIGHT

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:15.628
NOW.

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:19.032
&gt;&gt; IS IT AS SIMPLE, ANNA, AS

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:19.432
MAYBE --

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:19.899
&gt;&gt; GO AHEAD.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.268
&gt;&gt; IT IS BECAUSE FOR ME DONALD

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:23.169
TRUMP IS --

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.207
HE IS AN INCOHERENT, NARCISSIST,

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.008
WHO MAKES EVERYTHING ABOUT

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:29.409
HIMSELF.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.077
BUT FOR ME, THE PROBLEM REALLY

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:32.145
IS PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR TIM

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:32.512
SCOTT.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.914
WHO TALKED ABOUT JOE BIDEN

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:38.284
HAVING BLOOD ON HIS HANDS.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:40.320
PEOPLE LIKE RONNA MCDANIEL'S,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.355
THE HEAD OF THE RMC, WHO SAID

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.090
THAT THIS IS A GREAT

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.091
OPPORTUNITY FOR REPUBLICAN

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:45.558
CANDIDATES.

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.427
THAT IS IRRESPONSIBLE.

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.262
YOU SEE, AMERICANS HERE HAVE TO

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:51.297
TALK WITH ONE VOICE.

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.233
THERE IS ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.335
WITH BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS, AND

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:56.269
THAT IS HAMAS.

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.172
AND WHETHER YOU ARE

00:03:59.172 --> 00:03:59.939
PRO-PALESTINIAN OR WHETHER YOU

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.307
ARE PRO ISRAELI OR WHETHER YOUR

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:03.076
PRO BOTH, YOU HAVE TO BE

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:03.576
AGAINST HAMAS.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:06.112
AND THAT IS WHAT OUR FOCUS AS

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:07.413
AMERICANS, AND CERTAINLY THE

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.182
MEMBERS OF OUR GOVERNMENTS AND

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.184
THOSE WHO HAVE PLATFORMS AND

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:13.286
OUR LEADERS SHOULD BE DIRECTING

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.221
THEIR FIRE AND DIRECTING THEIR

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:15.588
VOICE.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.357
AND THE CONTRAST, AGAIN, COULD

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:18.258
NOT BE STARK.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.260
OR AT A TIME WHEN --

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.262
THANKING AMERICA AND THANKING

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.197
JOE BIDEN, AT A TIME WHEN YOU

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:26.165
SEE ISRAELIS GATHERING AROUND

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.268
OUR SECRETARY OF STATE, HUGGING

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:28.601
HIM.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.104
AND THEY ARE HUGGING HIM AS AN

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.272
EXTENSION OF AMERICA.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.107
YOU SEE HERE IN AMERICA PEOPLE

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.341
TRYING TO BLAME AMERICANS FOR

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.277
WHAT JUST HAPPENED IN ISRAEL.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.211
COME ON, FOLKS.

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:39.178
COME ON.

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:40.246
STOP THIS.

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:40.913
STOP THE INSANITY, STOP THE

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.415
STOP THE INSANITY, STOP THE

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:43.249
PARTISANSHIP.

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.552
WE HAVE TO UNITE AT A TIME LIKE

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.121
THIS.

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:50.123
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. FORMER US 

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:50.757
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS 

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:52.492
CRITICIZING BENJAMIN NETANYAHU 

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:55.128
AND ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE TRUMP 

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:55.762
SPEAKING TO SUPPORTERS IN 

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:57.730
FLORIDA, RECALLED AN INCIDENT 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.431
INVOLVING ISRAEL'S ROLE IN A 

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:10.343
2020 US DRONE STRIKE. HE SAID 

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:11.077
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU PULLED 

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:11.678
OUT OF THE PLAN TO KILL 

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:12.312
ARONNE'S TOP SECURITY AND 

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.012
INTELLIGENCE COMMANDER WHAT I 

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:13.780
SEE, SOMETIMES THE INTELLIGENCE 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.347
YOU'D TALK ABOUT THE 

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:17.750
INTELLIGENCE SO YOU'RE TALKING 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.451
ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT 

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:19.185
WENT WRONG OVER THE LAST WEEK. 

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:19.986
THEY'VE GOT A STRAIGHTENING OUT 

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:20.620
BECAUSE THEY'RE FIGHTING 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.689
POTENTIALLY A VERY BIG FOREST. 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:23.356
I DID HAVE A BAD EXPERIENCE 

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.158
WITH ISRAEL THOUGH, WHEN WE 

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.994
TOOK OUT SOLEMANI IT WAS US AND 

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.029
AS YOU WORK IT AS A GROUP AND 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:32.765
THE NIGHT BEFORE IT HAPPENED I 

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:35.034
GOT TO CALL THAT ISRAEL WILL 

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:37.837
NOT BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS 

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:42.542
ATTACK I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT  

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:45.011
BIBI NETANYAHU LET US DOWN THAT 

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:45.712
WAS A VERY TERRIBLE THING. I 

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:49.916
WILL SAY THAT ALL RIGHT, 

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:52.385
OLIVIER KNOX, THE AUTHOR OF THE 

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:53.086
WASHINGTON POST DAILY TO O2. 

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:54.921
AND OF COURSE, NATIONAL  

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:55.655
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IS BACK 

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:57.590
WITH US ON THIS.  

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.959
&gt;&gt; SO OLIVIER THE STAKES ARE 

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:00.693
VERY HIGH. OF COURSE, WITH THIS 

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:04.897
STORY BUT THE REALITY IS QUITE  

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:05.565
PAR FOR THE COURSE WHEN IT 

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.266
COMES TO DONALD TRUMP  

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:08.000
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT REALLY IS. I MEAN, 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.069
WE STILL, WE HAVE TO START BY  

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:10.770
SAYING, WHO KNOWS IF WHAT HE 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.304
SAID IS TRUE EVEN. 

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:12.205
&gt;&gt; BUT YES, WE'RE TRYING TO 

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:15.141
FIGURE THAT OUT AS YOU AND I 

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:15.842
SPEAK. SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT 

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:17.243
CAVEAT. I'M GLAD YOU RAISED, 

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:17.977
BUT WE'VE WATCHED WE'VE WATCHED 

00:06:17.977 --> 00:06:19.746
THE ISRAELI RESPONSE TO THE 

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:22.482
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S SUPPORT  

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:24.817
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS.  

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:25.485
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAS, HAS 

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.553
JUST REPEATEDLY PRAISED THE 

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:28.254
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. YOU SAW 

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:29.989
THE SHOW OF SOLIDARITY TODAY 

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:30.690
WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE, 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.625
TONY BLINKEN. IT'S NOT SUPER 

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:35.161
HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHY DONALD 

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:37.530
TRUMP MIGHT BE ANGRY AT BIBI 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.264
NETANYAHU NOW AND I DON'T THINK 

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:40.400
IT HAS A LOT TOO. DO WITH A 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.468
YEARS OLD RAID AGAINST  

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:43.202
AIRSTRIKE. I SHOULD SAY AGAINST 

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:44.837
A TOP IRANIAN GENERAL. 

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:47.340
&gt;&gt; IT'S  

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.076
&gt;&gt; IT IS PART FOR THE COURSE IN 

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:50.810
ANOTHER WAY WHICH IS OF COURSE 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.378
THAT HE HAS HISTORICALLY SAID A 

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:53.112
LOT OF NICE THINGS ABOUT A LOT 

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:57.850
OF BAD PEOPLE. HE'S PRAISED KIM 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.484
JONG UN. HE'S PRAISED THE 

00:06:58.484 --> 00:06:59.185
CHINESE RESPONSE, THE CHINESE 

00:06:59.185 --> 00:06:59.919
CRACKDOWN TO TENEMENTS HE 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:00.620
PRAISED VLADIMIR PUTIN. THIS 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.722
IS, AS YOU SAY, IT'S, IT'S VERY 

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:05.358
PART FOR THE COURSE BUT I DON'T 

00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:07.894
THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AWAY FROM  

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:08.394
THIS. 

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:09.061
&gt;&gt; NO, I'M I'M GLAD YOU I'M 

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:10.296
GLAD YOU PUT IT THAT WAY. I  

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:11.030
AGREE. AND I'M SURE THAT THERE 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:20.239
ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE MISSING. I 

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:20.940
WANT TO BRING IN THE REST OF 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.641
OUR POLITICAL PANEL HERE NOW, 

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:22.375
JOINING US AS BRIAN FALLON, HE 

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:23.042
IS THE CO-FOUNDER OF DEMAND 

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:23.743
JUSTICE AND THE FORMER PRESS 

00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:24.477
SECRETARY FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S 

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:25.211
2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. AND 

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:25.912
WE ALSO HAVE SARAH MATTHEWS, 

00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:26.512
THE FORMER DEPUTY PRESS 

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:27.146
SECRETARY WITH THE TRUMP  

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:27.880
ADMINISTRATION. SO SARA, BEFORE 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.581
I GET TO BEFORE I GET TO THE 

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:29.282
WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE AND TALK 

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.349
TO BRIAN ABOUT IT, I JUST LIKE 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:31.050
TO KINDA GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.221
RESPOND TO WHAT THE FORMER 

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:37.857
PRESIDENT SAID HERE ABOUT THIS 

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:40.293
RAID. I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY  

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.027
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT DID OR DIDN'T 

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:42.862
HAPPEN THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO  

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:43.496
SHARE WITH US IN TERMS OF 

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:45.097
DETERMINING THE VERACITY OF 

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:47.600
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY AND IF NOT, 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.036
AND PERHAPS IT'S CLASSIFIED SO  

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:50.736
PERHAPS I'M ASSUMING THAT IF 

00:07:50.736 --> 00:08:02.748
NOT I'M JUST CURIOUS. YOU'RE  

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:03.449
TAKE ON WHAT HIS MOTIVATIONS  

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:04.150
MIGHT BE IN SAYING THIS. NOW  

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.884
&gt;&gt; I WASN'T AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:05.618
WHEN THIS RAID HAPPENED, AND SO 

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:06.319
I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT  

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.987
AND HIS THINKING ON THAT  

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:08.654
SPECIFIC THING, BUT I THINK 

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:10.122
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY  

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:10.823
IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT IT 

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:12.625
WAS REPORTED IN 2021 THAT 

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:13.326
DONALD TRUMP WAS VERY UNHAPPY 

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.495
WITH NETANYAHU BECAUSE 

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.663
NETANYAHU WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:18.264
PEOPLE TO CONGRATULATE 

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.132
PRESIDENT BIDEN ON HIS WIN IN 

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:22.969
THE NOVEMBER ELECTION AND SO I 

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:23.636
THINK THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY 

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:25.505
WHAT IS MOST SIGNIFICANT AND 

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.138
DRIVING TRUMP'S BEEF WITH 

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:30.343
NETANYAHU AND WHY HE MADE THOSE 

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.043
REMARKS. HE MIGHT SAY IT HAS 

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:33.079
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT 

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:35.548
SOLEMANI STRIKE AND THAT COULD 

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:36.249
BE PART OF IT, BUT I DO THINK 

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:37.917
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THAT HE WAS 

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:40.586
UPSET THAT NETANYAHU  

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:41.320
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT BIDEN WON THE 

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.788
ELECTION FAIR AND SQUARE. AND 

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:43.523
SO THAT SEEMS TO BE THE DRIVING 

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.291
FORCE HERE, BUT IT IS REALLY 

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:48.094
DISGUSTING THESE REMARKS THAT I 

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:48.794
THINK HE MADE WHERE HE'S THE 

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.630
FORMER PRESIDENT IS PRAISING 

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.668
HEZBOLLAH. AND I THINK A LOT OF 

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:56.302
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE BEEN 

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:58.004
CRITICAL OF CONGRESSWOMAN TLAIB 

00:08:58.004 --> 00:08:58.738
FOR REFUSING TO DENOUNCE HAMAS 

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:00.406
SHOULD BE EQUALLY UPSET DONE 

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:01.674
WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT FOR 

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:03.142
WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT FOR 

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:05.545
PRAISING HEZBOLLAH AND MAKING 

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.279
THESE REMARKS AT A TIME WHEN WE 

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.014
NEED TO SHOW SOLIDARITY WITH 

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:08.681
ISRAEL AND SHOW UNWAVERING 

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:09.649
SUPPORT
