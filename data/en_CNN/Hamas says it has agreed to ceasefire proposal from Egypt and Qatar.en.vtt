00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.320
breaking news in the Middle East Hamas&nbsp;
has announced it has agreed to a ceasefire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.400
agreement proposed by Egypt and cutter we're&nbsp;
waiting to see if Israel will accept the deal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.960
as well Beth Sanner is a former deputy director&nbsp;
of National Intelligence for us she's joining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.320
us on the phone so what's your reaction Beth&nbsp;
let me just read to you a little bit from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.440
statement that Hamas released the statement said&nbsp;
that uh Ismael hania the head of the political&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.320
Bureau of Hamas quote made a phone call to&nbsp;
the Cuttery prime minister shik Muhammad B&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.960
Abdul Rahman Alani and to the Egyptian minister&nbsp;
of intelligence Mr AB abas Kamal and informed them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.200
of hamas's agreement to their proposal regarding a&nbsp;
ceasefire agreement what's your reaction Beth well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.560
I think that um first we have to hold our breath&nbsp;
here but I do think that the um Israelis are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:00.280
likely to sign on since this is the same terms as&nbsp;
far as we know to what they had signed on earlier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.400
so I'm actually pretty hopeful I think that the&nbsp;
military pressure and this idea that the Rafa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.520
operation was about to go forward may have made&nbsp;
the difference the last framework proposal that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.760
uh we know about Beth had the release of 20 to 33&nbsp;
Israeli hostages over several weeks in exchange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.840
for a temporary ceasefire and the release of&nbsp;
Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.960
and that was supposed to result in ARR restoration&nbsp;
of sustainable calm during which the remaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.720
hostages captive Israeli soldiers and the bodies&nbsp;
of hostages would also be exchanged for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.120
release of more Palestinian prisoners that was an&nbsp;
earlier proposal that was clearly discussed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.120
both cter and Egypt uh if that is the plan right&nbsp;
now and if ifas has agreed to that that would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.520
a huge development an absolutely huge development&nbsp;
and I think that you know part of the issue here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:08.440
is that Yaya senoir who is as far as we know still&nbsp;
holed up in southern Gaza um and the political&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.120
leadership hania who is the one who said publicly&nbsp;
that they were a go you know they have trouble&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.320
communicating uh it's hard for them to do that but&nbsp;
also they're not completely on the same page and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.600
they don't have the same interests in some ways&nbsp;
given that senoir you know is potentially staring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.400
down the barrel of a gun and also the party who&nbsp;
wants to walk away from this and survive so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.080
know it could be a very big deal and I think that&nbsp;
this delay may have been uh part of the discussion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.560
and trying to hear back from sinir inside of Gaza&nbsp;
Beth standby I want to go to Jeremy Diamond he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.640
joining us live from Jerusalem right now Jeremy&nbsp;
has there been any reaction from the Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.560
government to what the Hamas has just announced&nbsp;
uh wolther has not yet and so we are applying a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.080
lot of caveats to this this news that is just&nbsp;
breaking at this hour and that is wolf that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.440
have now heard from Hamas in a statement that&nbsp;
they posted to their telegram Channel saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.840
that they have agreed to the proposal regarding a&nbsp;
ceasefire agreement isma hania hamas's political&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.760
leader speaking to the kaderi Prime Minister as&nbsp;
well as the Egyptian intelligence Chief to relay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.240
that message but as you uh said wolf we have yet&nbsp;
to hear from the Israeli government officially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.600
we have yet to hear from the Americans from the&nbsp;
Egyptians from the cutteries and so we do have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.160
to caveat this this news which does carry with&nbsp;
it uh quite a bit of promise and hope here hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.840
of course for the hundreds of thousands of people&nbsp;
in Gaza who have endured unspeakable Horrors over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.360
seven months of War as well as for the families&nbsp;
of those hostages Who Remain captive in Gaza who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.120
have hoped and prayed for the day that they&nbsp;
will get to hold their loved ones in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.480
arms once again uh but what we do know wolf is&nbsp;
that there has been an Egyptian framework on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.120
table over the course of the last week which uh&nbsp;
officials on all sides had had a lot of hope that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.400
it could potentially uh bring these two sides&nbsp;
together in particular because Israel did make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.000
uh several key concessions including allowing the&nbsp;
return the unrestricted return of Palestinians to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.480
Northern Gaza as part of this latest framework&nbsp;
something that they had resisted for some time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.480
and had been a major sticking point this framework&nbsp;
agreement that was on the table last week would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.680
see the release of some 20 to 33 Israeli hostages&nbsp;
over several weeks uh of of a ceasefire and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.880
ultimately leading to a longer term ceasefire&nbsp;
perhaps a one-year ceasefire between Israel and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.800
Hamas Israel had not agreed to every point in this&nbsp;
framework but it had uh it did have significant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.080
input in this framework as it was then presented&nbsp;
to Hamas we've watched wolf over the last uh few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.560
days as that optimism around those negotiations&nbsp;
had quickly soured it appeared that Hamas was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.840
sticking to its demand that an end to the war&nbsp;
altogether that Israel commit to that as part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.960
of this agreement something that Israel has&nbsp;
refused to do but now hours after the Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.160
military began dropping evacuation leaflets on&nbsp;
Eastern Rafa ordering a 100,000 civilians to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.800
flee Hamas now putting in a statement hours later&nbsp;
that they have agreed to this initial proposal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.920
we don't know whether that uh evacuation order in&nbsp;
Rafa was the key factor that changed hamas's mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.160
we also don't know whether any major changes to&nbsp;
this Egyptian framework have been made in order&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.960
to get Hamas to agree to it and and like I said&nbsp;
we have yet to hear from all of the other parties&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.520
involved so as much as there is a promise&nbsp;
and hope in this statement from Hamas there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.560
is certainly not certainty at this stage wolf&nbsp;
Jeremy I want you to stand by MJ Lee our White&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.200
House correspondent is getting more information&nbsp;
us reaction I take it MJ the president President&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.600
Biden had a conversation a phone conversation with&nbsp;
prime minister Benjamin nanyu earlier today is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.080
that right that's right we know President Biden&nbsp;
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.840
spoke earlier today and of course these ongoing&nbsp;
hostage uh deal negotiations was one of the many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.760
topics that the two leaders discussed as has&nbsp;
been the case for all of their recent phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.920
conversations uh but what we are waiting for right&nbsp;
now is an official White House and US reaction to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:25.120
this news that Hamas has apparently agreed to&nbsp;
a temporary ceasefire deal so we'll bring that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.880
to you whenever we have word of that uh but&nbsp;
I heard Jeremy in his last conversation with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.960
you really leaning into the various caveats that&nbsp;
are at play here and I do think that uh kind of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.600
note of caution from here in Washington is wise as&nbsp;
well that is just to say that we have had moments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.440
like this before in the months of negotiations to&nbsp;
get to a temporary ceasefire and hostages release&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.240
deal where we appear to be on the brink of a&nbsp;
deal and other moments where we appear to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:02.040
on the brink of these talks completely falling&nbsp;
apart so again as we wait for official US word&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.880
and reaction from the Israeli side to this news&nbsp;
from Hamas that they are agreeing to this deal I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:13.960
do think again just uh leaning into that note of&nbsp;
caution uh is is definitely uh worth doing uh but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.200
uh what US officials have been doing of course in&nbsp;
recent weeks is very much uh pushing hard for this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.520
deal to get done because uh the administration&nbsp;
believes that this is really uh the only clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:30.880
way to eventually getting to an end to this War&nbsp;
uh but I can't underscore enough how important it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.320
is for us officials to try to get to that point to&nbsp;
try to get to the point of uh hostages coming out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.120
and this uh this conflict that has been going&nbsp;
on for so many months to come to an end and of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.920
course a big part of that is avoiding a major&nbsp;
Rafa incursion from taking place and of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.920
the Israelis have been warning for weeks and weeks&nbsp;
now that they are getting increasingly prepared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.360
to go ahead and take that step if this deal does&nbsp;
not come together wolf is the White House still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.320
planning a press briefing at the bottom the hour&nbsp;
in about 15 minutes or so from now MJ yeah that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.120
press briefing has actually been pushed back&nbsp;
to 2:00 so that is when we will hear uh from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.800
National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby&nbsp;
and where we will get an opportunity to press&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.880
him on all of these latest developments and of&nbsp;
course we'll be bringing that to you as well wolf
