HOSPITAL AND THIS AREA OF THE  GAZA STRIP.  &gt;&gt; THAT IS TERRIFYING AND SAD.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  &gt;&gt;&gt; ALSO, WITH US NOW IS NATO  SUPREME ALLIED RETIRED  COMMANDER, WESLEY CLARK.  AND AS YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS,  AN OFFICIAL FAMILIAR WITH THE  INTELLIGENCE SAYS THAT THEY ARE  CERTAIN THAT THERE IS A COMMAND  HAMAS CENTER UNDERNEATH THE  HOSPITAL, AND THEY USE THE FUEL  INTENDED FOR THAT HOSPITAL, AND  FROM THAT OFFICIAL FROM THE  QUODS, THEY ARE WAITING TO BE  EVACUATED, BUT YOU CAN SEE IN  THE FOOTAGE OF THE IDF, AND WHAT THEY HAVE CIRCLED AS A DOOR AND  GOING IN AND OUT OF THE DOOR,  AND GENERAL, CAN YOU TALK ABOUT  THIS, AND HOW HAMAS USES THESE  STRUCTURES, AND HOW THAT COME  PLI KATES THE YERL EFFOR -- HOW  COMPLICATES THE EFFORTS IN THAT  REGION.  &gt;&gt; THIS IS LONG DEVELOPED BY  HAMAS TO USE LONG DEVELOPED LAND WARFARE TO BRING GLOBAL PRESSURE AGAINST THE ISRAELIS WHEN THEY  RETALIATED.  SO THE TUNNEL AT WORK HAS BEEN  BUILT THE HOSPITALS, AND THIS IS THE NEXUS OF THE TUNNELS.  HAMAS DID IT DELIBERATELY.  AND NOW, THE ISRAELIS ARE UNDER  INTERNATIONAL LAW.  THEY CANNOT BOMB HOSPITALS. THEY HAVE NOT BOMBED THIS  HOSPITAL, BUT THEY DO HAVE THE  RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE. THEY HAVE THE GO INTO THE  HOSPITALS AND GET INTO THE  COMMAND NODES, AND MAYBE THEY  HAVE BEEN EVACUATED BY THEN, BUT THERE IS A FIGHT FOR THIS, AND A CONCERN ABOUT THIS BY THE  ISRAELIS, AND TO TRY TO AVOID  THE GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT  THEY ARE DOING.  BUT THEY ARE STILL BOUND BY THE  LAWS OF PLANNED WARFARE.  SO YOU HAVE ONE SIDE LEGALLY  TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE ENEMY,  AND THE OTHER SIDE WHICH IS  CYNICALLY EXPLOITING  INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND PUTTING  THEIR OWN PEOPLE AT RISK AND  USING THEM AS HOSTAGES. THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,  JOHN.  &gt;&gt; AGAIN, YOU ARE SEEING THE  IMAGES OF THE ONES OF THE BABIES THERE OF THE NEONATAL UNIT OUT  OF THE INCUE BAYS OR THE AND  WARMED BY TINFOIL AND WATERS,  AND IMAGES THAT ARE DOING THE  WORK OF HAMAS, BECAUSE PEOPLE  ARE SUFFERING INSIDE OF THERE,  WESLEY.  &gt;&gt; YES, IT IS A TERRIBLE  CONDITION, AND IT IS THE FAULT  OF HAMAS.  UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL LAW,  HAMAS SHOULD HAVE NO MILITARY  OPERATIONS, AND NO DOUBT OF THAT HOSPITAL.  LEAVE IT.  LEAVE THE DOCTORS AND THE  PATIENTS BUT, AS LONG AS THEY  ARE USING IT BY HAMAS AS A BASE  OF OPERATION.  AND AS LONG AS THEY ARE USING IT AS A TANK LET ME  YOU ABOUT A TANK THAT IS USED AS PROXIES THERE TO ATTACK AMERICAN INTERESTS.  WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE? &gt;&gt; WELL, THIS IS AN EFFORT AGAIN BY THE UNITED STATES TO STRIKE  BACK AT IRAN WHO IS THE SOURCE  OF THE PROBLEM, WITHOUT  ESCALATION.  SO IT IS BALANCE BETWEEN HITTING THE FORCES, HITTING THE COMMAND  NODES, AND HITTING THE LOGISTIC  S AS I UNDERSTAND IT.  BECAUSE WE ARE HITTING THE  IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
