&gt;&gt;&gt; YOU ARE LOOKING, WE WILL  TAKE YOU TO SOME LIVE IMAGES  RIGHT NOW OVER NORTHERN GAZA. YOU CAN SEE WHAT WE'VE BEEN  WATCHING OUR COMBINATION OF  FLARES AND WHAT APPEAR TO BE  STRIKES AS NIGHT BEGINS TO FALL  OVER THERE IN GAZA AND, OF  COURSE, AS WE'VE BEEN MONITORING THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS IT'S  STILL BEEN TARGETING HAMAS  INFRASTRUCTURE AHEAD OF THE  TRUCE THAT DOESN'T TAKE EFFECT  UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING. PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU HAS VOWED TO CONTINUE  THE WAR AFTER THE FIGHTING  PAUSED SAYING IT WON'T END  UNTIL, QUOTE, HAMAS IS  DESTROYED, ALL OF THE HOSTAGES  ARE RELEASED AND THERE IS NOBODY IN GAZA WHO CAN THREATEN ISRAEL. SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR  SOME OF THESE IMAGES AS WE  WELCOME OUR NEXT GUEST, CNN  MILITARY ANALYST AND FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER GENERAL WESLEY CLARK. OBVIOUSLY, WE'VE BEEN WATCHING  SOME OF THESE -- SOME OF THESE  IMAGES HERE. THERE WAS A QUESTION OF HOW,  PERHAPS, INTENSE STRIKES WOULD  BE IN THE LEADUP TO THE ACTUAL  MOMENT THIS TRUCE TOOK EFFECT  AND SO WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO  BEGIN AT 3:00 A.M. EASTERN TIME  AND THIS PRECEDES MY QUESTION,  BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL  HAPPEN LEADING UP TO THAT  MOMENT? &gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THE  STRIKES WILL BE AS INTENSE AS  ISRAEL HAS TARGETS FOR. THERE WILL BE NO SLACKING OFF  UNTIL THE EXACT MOMENT OF THE  TRUCE, AND I'M SURE THIS WAS AN  ISSUE THAT WAS REALLY HAMMERED  OUT IN THE CABINET. I'M SURE THERE WERE VOICES  SAYING YOU CAN'T GIVE A TRUCE. YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH WITH  THIS. YOU'VE GOT TO FINISH THE JOB  AGAINST HAMAS, AND SO THE  ISRAELI MILITARY WILL BE  PRESSING TO DO AS MUCH AS THEY  CAN. DURING THE TRUCE PERIOD, OMAR,  THEY WILL STILL HAVE THE RIGHT  TO SELF-DEFENSE AND YOU CALL IT  A TRUCE, IT COULD BE CALLED A  PAUSE. IT COULD BE CALLED A TEMPORARY  CEASEFIRE, BUT WHATEVER YOU CALL IT, THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT  MECHANISM, SO THERE ARE NO  INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS ON THE  GROUND, AND WHAT NORMALLY  HAPPENS WHEN THIS KIND OF A  PAUSE OCCURS IS MAYBE THE  SHOOTING STOPS FOR A WHILE, BUT  PRETTY SOON IT STARTS AGAIN  BECAUSE SOMEONE FEELS THREATENED AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO  SELF-DEFENSE. AFTER THE PERIOD OF FOUR OR FIVE DAYS ASSUMING THE HOSTAGES GET  RELEASED ON SCHEDULE, UNLESS  THERE IS A CONTINUING RELEASE OF HOSTAGES BEYOND THE 50 AS PRIME  MINISTER NETANYAHU SAID, HE'S  GOING TO RESUME AND THIS WILL BE THE REAL STRUGGLE. THERE WILL BE STRONG POLITICAL  FORCES AND PRESSURE ON ISRAEL  NOT TO RESUME. SO HOW THIS GETS RESOLVED IS THE KEY, STRATEGIC PROBLEM FOR  ISRAEL.  &gt;&gt; AND FOR THOSE TUNING IN, WE  ARE MONITORING THE SCENE OVER  GAZA RIGHT NOW. WE'VE BEEN SEEING SOME FLARES  AND A COMBINATION OF WHAT  APPEARS SOME STRIKES GOING INTO  GAZA AS NIGHT BEGINS TO FALL AND OBVIOUSLY UNDER 20 HOURS TO WHEN THIS TRUCE TAKES EFFECT BEFORE  THEN. WHEN WE LOOK, GENERAL, AT SOME  OF THE DETAILS IN THIS DEAL. A FOUR TO FIVE-DAY PAUSE AND  WHAT DOES A PAUSE LIKE THIS  TYPICALLY MEAN MILITARILY. WHAT CAN AND CAN'T YOU DO  ESSENTIALLY IN A TIMEFRAME LIKE  THAT? &gt;&gt; WHEN IT STARTS, LET'S LOOK AT IT FROM THE ISRAELI SIDE. THEY'D LIKE TO PUNISH AND RELAX  AND CAN THEY REALLY TRUST HAMAS  AND THERE WILL BE A PERIOD OF  DOUBT AND THEY'LL HAVE TO KEEP  THEIR GUARD UP AND THEY'LL  CONSOLIDATE THEIR POSITIONS AND  THEY'RE INSIDE GAZA AND THEY  DON'T CONTROL GAZA. THERE ARE TUNNEL ENTRANCES THAT  ARE BEING SHOT AT FROM BEHIND ON SOME OCCASIONS AND THEY DON'T  HAVE ANY SECURITY IN THERE. MAYBE THEY'LL ROTATE SOME TROOPS IN AND OUT. ON THE HAMAS SIDE THEY'RE GOING  TO USE IT TO CONSOLIDATE,  REPLENISH, RESUPPLY, REORGANIZE  AND TRY TO RE-ESTABLISH  COMMUNICATIONS AND BE READY FOR  THE NEXT WAVE OF THE ISRAELI  FIGHTING. THIS IS A HUMANITARIAN EFFORT. THERE WILL BE SOME HUMANITARIAN  ASSISTANCE THAT COMES IN UNLESS  THERE ARE SOME REALLY STRANGE,  STRONG CONTROLS HERE. HAMAS WILL GET WHAT NEEDS OUT OF THAT HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND IT WILL REPLENISH ITS OWN FUEL  STOCKS OR WHATEVER. SO THIS IS -- LET'S GET THE  HOSTAGES OUT. THAT WILL BE A GREAT THING, BUT  THIS IS FAR FROM OVER, OMAR, AND IT'S VERY DYNAMIC, IT'S REALLY  HARD TO PREDICT WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO.  &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST ON THE GROUND. U.S. AND ISRAEL BOTH PAUSING  DRONE STRIKES OVER HOSTAGE AS  PART OF THE DEAL PER A SENIOR  WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL. TO ONE OF THE POINTSES THAT YOU  MADE, ISRAEL'S GOVERNMENT PLANS  TO RESUME THE AIR AND GROUND  CAMPAIGN TO COMPLETED  ERADICATION OF HAMAS AFTER  THIS -- THIS TRUCE, TEMPORARY  PAUSE, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT AND THEY LEFT THE DOOR OPEN  TO CONTINUE THE PAUSES FOR EVERY TEN HOSTAGES RELEASED. HOW DO YOU EXPECT ISRAEL TO  BALANCE THE HOSTAGE RELEASE AND  ALSO WITH THEIR GOAL OF  DESTROYING HAMAS? &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE TOUGH CALL, AND  IT'S A REALLY TOUGH POLITICAL  CALL ON NETANYAHU AND HIS WAR  CABINET BECAUSE THE MILITARY  KNOWS THAT HAMAS IS -- HAMAS TO  WIN -- A VICTORY FOR HAMAS IS  THEY HAVE THE HOSTAGES AND THEY  EMERGE AS HEROES AMONG THE  IRANIANS, HEZBOLLAH AND THE  OTHER JIHAD I GROUPS. THEY WILL USE THE HOSTAGES AND  EVENTUALLY THEY HOPE ISRAEL WILL LOSE THE APPETITE FOR THE FIGHT  AND THEY'LL SAY WE MADE IT. IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL OPERATION. ISRAEL KNOWS THIS. ISRAEL KNOWS THAT IF THEY DON'T, ELIMINATE COMING OUT OF LEBANON  SO THIS IS A REALLY, REALLY  TOUGH CALL. IN THE PAST ISRAEL HAS TURNED  LOOSE A THOUSAND PRISONERS TO  GET ONE ISRAELI SOLDIER BACK. SO THE WEIGHT ON ISRAEL IS HUMAN LIFE, ISRAELI HUMAN LIFE IS THE  MOST IMPORTANT OVERRIDING  FACTOR, BUT THIS IS THE FIRST  TIME THAT ISRAEL HAS DECLARED AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT ACCORDING TO  PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU. THIS IS, HAMAS, IS AN  EXISTENTIAL THREAT. MAYBE THAT CHANGES THE  CALCULOUS. THERE ARE ALL KIND OF DYNAMICS  THAT MAKE IT VERY UNPREDICTABLE, OMAR. &gt;&gt; OF COURSE, I SHOULD MENTION  AGAIN, AS YOU'VE BEEN TALKING  WE'VE BEEN SEEING THOSE FLARES  AS NIGHT BEGINS TO FALL AND A  LOT OF DYNAMICS TO KEEP AN EYE  ON EVEN AHEAD OF THI
