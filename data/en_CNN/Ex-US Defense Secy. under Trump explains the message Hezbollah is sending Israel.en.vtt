00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:03.436
Fears are growing about a potential full

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:04.137
blown war

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:05.839
between Israel and Hezbollah

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.407
militants in Lebanon.

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:07.941
Right now,

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.175
Israel and Hezbollah

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.845
are trading increasingly intense threats.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.214
The latest from the leader of Hezbollah,

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.248
Hassan Nasrallah,

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:17.317
who says if a war breaks out,

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.486
the group will target Cyprus.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:20.987
The nearby island nation

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.423
that is a member of the European Union.

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:24.457
Earlier, Israel warned

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:25.525
the possibility of war

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.327
is getting very close

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:28.561
after Hezbollah released

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.196
this threatening drone video

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.264
purporting to show

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:32.298
sensitive

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.600
Israeli military

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.468
as well as civilian sites.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.137
Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.438
have been rising ever since

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.373
the October 7th attacks by Hamas,

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.475
but especially here in recent weeks.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.110
We have former defense secretary

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.512
from the Trump administration,

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:46.546
Mark Esper, with us now.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.181
He also serves on the board

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.849
or as a strategic advisor

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:50.917
for several aerospace

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:52.619
and defense related companies.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.354
Sir, we see this

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.655
Hezbollah drones,

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:56.890
the message loud and clear.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.991
But these drones have also

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.326
been rather effective at evading Israeli

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.795
air defense, hitting Israeli

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:02.562
military sites,

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.564
even civilian homes in northern Israel.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:05.231
And U.S.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.167
officials, we've learned, are worried

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:08.902
that Israeli systems,

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:09.569
including Iron

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.037
Dome, will not be able to keep up.

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:12.639
How concerned are you about this?

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:16.042
Short.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.877
Beyond. Look, we should be concerned.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.779
And this has been a been a concern now

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:20.480
since the beginning

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.082
of the conflict in Gaza.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.583
since that time, Hezbollah

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.284
has been shooting

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:25.552
rockets and drones

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:27.854
into Israel from the north,

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:28.855
nearly every day.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.056
And, at this point,

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:32.092
they've caused a handful of Israelis

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:32.725
to be killed.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.327
But but,

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:35.795
you know, they also have displaced

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:38.131
well over 60,080 thousand Israelis

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.566
from northern Israel.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.401
So they've been displaced for some time.

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.203
I'm very concerned about this

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:43.937
because we're now

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.438
seeing a real escalation

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:46.806
in terms of the rhetoric.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:47.941
I think what,

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.075
Hezbollah did with regard

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.377
to sending that drone, over Israel,

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:52.712
over the port of Haifa

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:54.414
was, was a clear threat,

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.116
a warning that we can see you

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.851
and if we can see you, we can shoot you.

00:01:57.851 --> 00:01:58.585
And that's important

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.420
because we know that Hezbollah

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.888
has an inventory of well over

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:04.557
150,000 rockets and missiles,

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:05.425
which could do a lot,

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:06.392
quite a lot of damage

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.595
to all parts of Israel.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.997
What would a two front war mean

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:12.465
in this conflict,

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.900
and also specifically for the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.602
US as Israel's main patron?

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:19.772
Well, fighting

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:20.974
across two fronts is hard

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:21.708
because of course, it

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.476
draws resources, one from each.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:24.277
And,

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:25.612
maybe the Israeli view is

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:26.846
that they are wrapping up

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.215
operations in Rafah that they can turn

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.217
to, I'm sorry, in Gaza

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.520
so that they can turn to, Hezbollah

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.154
now in the North.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.321
They've been talking about this,

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.190
hinting about this for some time.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.658
There are parts of the Israeli government

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:39.893
that have wanted to,

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.427
to stir things up with,

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.462
Hezbollah in the north.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.397
And maybe they're reaching this point

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:44.831
right now,

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:45.865
I think, for the United States.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:46.199
Look, we're

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.934
trying to get the Middle East

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.036
to simmer down and not expand.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.372
And yet this would be quite an expansion.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.374
Keep in mind that Hamas,

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:56.142
while it had an estimated 30,000

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:56.943
or so fighters

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.479
in a small swath of territory.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.446
Hassan Nasrallah,

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.114
the leader of,

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.115
Hezbollah, has claimed

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.651
to have over 100,000 fighters.

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:05.385
And so you could see

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.686
a much broader conflict.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.487
And then on top of this,

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.389
we've got to keep in mind, strategically,

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.490
geopolitically,

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.691
Iran is in the midst

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.092
of a leadership transition.

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:13.927
And we should know

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:14.794
by the end of this month

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:16.796
who the next president of Iran is

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:17.830
and what direction

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.865
will he take the country,

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.200
particularly with regard

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.935
to this conflict in the Middle East?

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:24.537
I wonder what you make of the fighting

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:25.972
between Benjamin

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:27.240
Netanyahu and the IDF,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.375
because the IDF, spokesperson

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:30.143
Daniel Hager

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:31.144
said, those

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:32.946
who think Israel can make Hamas

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.147
disappear are wrong.

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.648
I mean, paging Benjamin

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:37.584
Netanyahu loud and clear here.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:40.486
He's been very critical of the IDF lately

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:42.655
and his office pushed back on that.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:43.723
Who's right here?

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.493
Well, the IDF spokesman was right.

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:48.094
He's correct.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:48.995
I mean, we've all been saying

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:50.897
for some time, you cannot destroy Hamas.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:54.267
It's it's an an ideology, a theology.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:55.902
It's a it's a cult. Right.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.403
now, what you can do is

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:58.738
you can neutralize its leadership,

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.039
which I've argued and others have.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.640
You can

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.307
you can

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.942
decimate the ranks of its fighters

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:04.010
to make sure that they're no longer

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.345
combat ineffective.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:06.846
But in terms of completely destroying

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:08.948
and eradicating them is not possible.

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:09.816
What you have to do

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.452
is, again, to take out the leadership,

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:13.920
remove their warfighting capability,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.988
and then you have to have a,

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.689
a police or a security presence

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.491
on the ground to continue to kind of,

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.525
as we say,

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:20.760
keep mowing the lawn every now

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.094
and then

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.462
to make sure that the right fighters

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:22.996
don't rise up.

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:25.465
So look, I think the spokesman was right.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.967
you see this growing split between,

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:30.136
the IDF and the political leadership,

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:31.604
which is quite curious.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.639
We saw when,

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.806
Benny Gantz left the government

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:34.907
a couple weeks ago.

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:36.743
Gantz, of course, was an opposition

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:37.343
political leader

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:40.313
and a former head of the IDF military.

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:41.814
And I think lastly, Brianna,

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:42.849
we saw just the other day

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:43.983
over the weekend,

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:45.752
it seemed to catch the surprise

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.153
of Netanyahu

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:48.054
that the IDF called

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:49.889
for a tactical pause in operations

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.726
in, in Gaza to allow for the,

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:55.228
humanitarian aid to get through.

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:56.062
And that really caught

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:56.996
the government off guard.

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:57.797
And it was others in

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.032
the government have objected.

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:00.533
So we see a growing rift

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:01.601
now between the military

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.536
and its political leaders.

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:03.836
Yeah.

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.238
You seem surprised

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:06.572
and also pretty ticked off by it.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:07.573
It was very clear.

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:08.841
Secretary Esper,

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.043
we always appreciate you being on.

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:10.743
Thank you so much.
