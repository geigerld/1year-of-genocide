Nick watt has more on the divisions at another major school in California. &gt;&gt; I hope they know. Look at it. &gt;&gt; Reporter: Those five seconds have been reposted by national influencers, viewed millions of times on Instagram. Watch again. &gt;&gt; I hope they all are. &gt;&gt; Look at the news. &gt;&gt; Reporter: The caption attached, this usc professor, John Strauss, threatened these students. Hope you get killed, and I hope they all are. During a campus rally for gaza. We call on usc to terminate this professor immediately. The college paper claimed tenured economics professor says, I hope they all are killed, walking by an event mourning Palestinian deaths. Is that really what he meant or even what he said? Strauss, who is jewish and pro-Israel appeared on the campus news. &gt;&gt; Media spoke with a usc processor who was put on leave. &gt;&gt; I started getting emails, very, very nasty emails, things from, I hope you die you fascist pig, to, palestine forever. &gt;&gt; Reporter: While an actual war rages thousands of miles away, this video and its fallout tip identified the conflicts on so many American college campuses. &gt;&gt; We have an atmosphere that's hostile to free speech is the key problem. The people who are going to college are adults, but a lot of them are acting like children. They want to see people punished for their speech. &gt;&gt; Reporter: So, what actually happened that day here in L.A.? Well, here is a longer version of that video, 21 seconds, not 5. &gt;&gt; People are ignorant. &gt;&gt; Professor Strauss, I believe. &gt;&gt; Everyone should be killed. &gt;&gt; And that they should all die, everyone one of them, referred, of course, to hamas. &gt;&gt; The longer video of professor Strauss was shot and posted by this student, founder of trojans for palestine. She asked that we obscure her identity for fear of reprisals. Your identity is hidden, but you exposed the identity of professor Strauss. How do you reconcile that? &gt;&gt; Professor Strauss, first of all, like, he is, a grown man, tenured faculty who harassed &gt;&gt; Reporter: He said Strauss stepped on the names of the dead. He said that must have been an accident, emotions, she said, were high. &gt;&gt; They were filming the names and laughing at them. &gt;&gt; Reporter: We spoke to a jewish student who was there, remembering their own dead. He did film the names, and he was disrespectful. He apologizes for any offense caused but told CNN he does not know for sure that all those names are innocent dead Palestinians because the source is the gaza health ministry, controlled by hamas. And that's a basic problem on these campuses. The two sides barely agree even on any basic facts. &gt;&gt; Trojans for palestine. Why did you feel moved to create that? &gt;&gt; We have a very large jewish population on campus. We have obviously the -- foundation. I've seen a lot of misinformation being spread. &gt;&gt; Reporter: And the two sides cannot even agree on the meaning of what actually comes out of mouths at the many pro-palestinian rallies. [ Crowd chanting ] &gt;&gt; Reporter: Many pro-palestinians say it's just a call for freedom. Many Jews say it's a call for genocide, for the destruction of Israel, which right now lies between the river and the sea. &gt;&gt; Is there a way back from where we are right now, where both sides feel similar things in terms of their voices being suppressed? &gt;&gt; On a personal level, no. What I know about someone is unequivocally going to support Israel, I will cut them out of my life. &gt;&gt; And Nick watt joins us now from Los Angeles. What more is usc saying about this? &gt;&gt; Reporter: Well, that's very interesting. What they're saying basically gives us the other slice of the story, which is how college administrators across this country are struggling to deal with this. They're trying to not offend, and they're making mistakes in the process, as we've seen on capitol hill. Here at usc, they say Strauss was never placed on administrative leave. He says he was, on November 10th. So, I kept on pushing. Eventually they told me, our statement discusses his status since November 13th. Not exactly clear and candid. They now say that -- they have said all along that they are shocked by the comments attached to those videos. And they now say all restrictions are lifted. He's allowed back on campus. Also worth noting classes for the semester have finished. They also say he has not been punished in any way. Last I heard from his lawyer, he's still under investigation and still could be punished. As I say, they don't appear to know how to deal with all this
