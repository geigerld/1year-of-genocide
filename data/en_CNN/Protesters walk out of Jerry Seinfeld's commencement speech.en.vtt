00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.702
The pro-Palestinian protests

00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:04.671
that engulfed college campuses

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.473
have now found a new stage

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.241
the graduation stage at Duke

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:09.209
University Sunday.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.443
About 30 students

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:11.578
walked out of the commencement

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:12.746
ceremony as comedian

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.914
Jerry Seinfeld was being introduced.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:16.716
Seinfeld has supported Israel

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.785
throughout the war against Hamas in Gaza,

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.320
and here is some of what he

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.323
then said in his address.

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.159
I totally admire the ambitions

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.460
of your generation

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.995
to create a more just

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:30.964
and inclusive society.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.966
I think it is also wonderful

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.667
that you care so much about

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.936
not hurting other people's feelings

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.338
in the million and one ways.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:41.207
We all do that every second of every day.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.210
It's lovely to want to fix those things.

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:46.546
That is far from

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.181
the only protests to hit college

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.682
commencement ceremonies over the weekend.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.185
CNN's Nick Valencia joins us now.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.387
What all happened, Nick?

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:54.921
Yeah. Hey.

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:55.355
Good morning.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.057
Commencement season is upon us.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.758
And these pro-Palestinian demonstrators

00:00:58.758 --> 00:00:59.292
are choosing

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.827
to voice their opposition to the war

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:02.862
in Gaza in a variety of ways,

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.131
some continuing to call for a cease fire.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:05.932
And over the weekend,

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:08.134
we saw that at commencement ceremonies

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.402
across the country. Really?

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.204
Some chanted, others held signs,

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:12.305
some draped themselves

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.473
in Palestinian flags

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:14.641
calling for their schools

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.209
to divest from Israel.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:17.277
But for the most part,

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.645
these ceremonies went on

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.013
with without a hitch.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:21.214
in Southern California, though,

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:22.615
there was a brief interruption.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:23.850
According to the New York Times,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.952
at least one person was arrested

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.320
over a skirmish outside

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.456
of Pomona College's graduation.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:30.957
They had to move their graduation

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:33.526
30 miles away from their campus.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.128
And, at Duke University,

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:35.929
we saw what happened

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.197
there in the intro, comedian Jerry

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.164
Seinfeld, who's been

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:40.533
a very vocal supporter of Israel

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.634
since the Hamas terrorist

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:43.269
attacked on October 7th.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.472
He was protested by a few dozen

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:46.806
pro-Palestinian demonstrators

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:47.874
who chose to walk out

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:50.143
and have their own commencement ceremony

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:51.044
across the country

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:52.979
in California, at UC Berkeley,

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:53.980
the dean of students

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.448
had to take the microphone.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.983
There was a pause in ceremony

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.084
there and listen to

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.219
what the dean of students

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.987
had to say to try to get control

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.555
again of that graduation ceremony.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.592
Students, if

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:08.595
you're open to it.

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:10.730
I invite you to speak with me

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.365
after the event in a space

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.368
that's more appropriate.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:19.506
But in the meanwhile,

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.742
I ask that you allow the program

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.745
to continue.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:29.015
Okay.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.316
Because otherwise

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.518
we're going to have to continue

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:32.685
to have you leave.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.654
And that breaks my heart.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.823
So,

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.258
the ceremony did continue.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.459
No one was arrested.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.527
And those demonstrators,

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:42.295
we understand, did leave voluntarily.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:43.096
More commencement

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.197
addresses and,

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.899
graduation ceremonies are planned

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.133
across the country this week.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:48.768
And we're starting to see some schools

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:49.569
try to get ahead

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.504
of these potential demonstrations.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:52.038
We're just learning.

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.274
The University of Wisconsin Milwaukee

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:55.208
has reached an agreement

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:55.942
with proposals

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:56.843
Tinian demonstrators

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.645
to dismantle their encampment

00:02:58.645 --> 00:02:59.646
by tomorrow.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:00.413
In exchange,

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.615
they've agreed not to interrupt,

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.250
or not to interrupt a, graduation

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.618
ceremony in exchange,

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.020
the university will join calls

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.556
now for a cease fire in Gaza.

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:11.925
Kate. Nick Valencia, thank you so much,

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:19.766
As college commencement

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:20.934
ceremonies continue,

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.903
so do the protests on Sunday.

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:26.472
Comedian Jerry Seinfeld was interrupted

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:29.475
at Duke University's graduation ceremony.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:30.076
In addition

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:33.079
to receiving an honorary degree.

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.415
Jerry is also serving as our commencement

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:38.418
speaker today.

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:47.126
About 30 students walked out

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.494
as the comedian was introduced.

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:49.696
You can see some students

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:51.664
waving the Palestinian flag.

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:54.667
Here's how Seinfeld responded.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:56.402
And I know all of you

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:57.637
here are going to use

00:03:57.637 --> 00:04:00.173
all of your brains and muscle and soul

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:01.374
to improve the world,

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:02.141
and I know you're

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:05.144
going to do a bang up job.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:08.147
And when you're done, as I am now,

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.283
I bet the world

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:10.783
because of

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:13.686
you will be a much better place.

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:14.854
But it will still not make

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:16.756
a whole hell of a lot of sense.

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.458
And it is worth the sacrifice

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.159
of an occasional discomfort

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.995
to have some laughs.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.565
Meanwhile,

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:26.899
Pomona College

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:27.867
in, Southern

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:29.269
California moved its ceremony

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.937
more than 30 miles away

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.572
to avoid the pro-Palestinian protest

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:33.339
on campus.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:36.342
CNN's Camille Banal has the story.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:39.279
Many students and parents

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.980
frustrated in this case

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.849
because they have to drive 30 miles

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.250
and change their plans

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.918
just to make sure that commencement

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:47.320
goes on as planned.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.522
So instead of it being in Pomona College,

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:51.190
it's going to be here in L.A.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.358
at the Shrine Auditorium.

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:53.593
You can see it here behind me.

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:54.861
There are security measures

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:55.762
already in place.

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:57.563
There is a barrier

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:58.731
metal barrier, and already

00:04:58.731 --> 00:04:59.499
security guards

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.567
who are not allowed inside the auditorium

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.770
if you do not have a ticket.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.838
The school apologizing

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:07.407
and saying not only that

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:08.508
this was an inconvenience,

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:09.909
but also saying that they would provide

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.010
transportation

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.978
for the students

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.147
to get here to Los Angeles.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.315
Nonetheless, students,

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.749
are just disappointed

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.451
and say they're not happy about this

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:19.085
whole change.

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.853
Take a listen to what one student said.

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:21.788
I think it's sad.

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:22.689
And I think it's,

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.358
it's a really bad way

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:26.526
to end your college career.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:27.627
And I think it's showing

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.629
exactly where Pomona is headed.

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.297
And some universities,

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:32.932
like Columbia and USC,

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:34.334
canceling altogether

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:34.834
this big

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.036
traditional commencement ceremony

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:37.670
and instead

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.473
making other plans, citing safety reasons

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:42.408
and wanting to avoid protest.

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:44.744
We saw students at Duke University

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:46.512
walking out, right

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:47.647
as the commencement

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:48.648
speaker was introduced.

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:50.049
That was Jerry Seinfeld.

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:52.518
he was able to give his address

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.152
as planned,

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:54.987
with no apparent interruptions,

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:55.988
and this weekend

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.290
at different universities,

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.860
we saw students at UC Berkeley chanting

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.629
and protesting and briefly pausing,

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:04.831
the commencement ceremony.

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:07.533
They then walked out of that event

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:08.701
and also at,

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.269
Virginia Commonwealth University,

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:11.671
at least a dozen students

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:14.474
also walking out when the governor was,

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:16.008
beginning to give his

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:17.377
commencement address.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:17.944
So, again,

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:19.312
that's what a lot of universities

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:21.013
are trying to avoid

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:22.548
this weekend and others

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:24.517
who have events later on.

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:26.252
And of course, this is also caused

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:27.453
just a lot of frustration

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:29.422
among students who had to deal

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:31.124
with graduating from high school

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:31.591
in the middle

00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:33.593
of a pandemic, and now again,

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:35.395
having to deal with commencement

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.330
under difficult circumstances

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.097
or under something

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:39.565
that they do not consider

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:41.701
a normal commencement ceremony.
