00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:01.501
We are now just

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.585
hours away from

00:00:02.585 --> 00:00:04.087
what is supposed to be the start

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:04.421
of this

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.256
temporary truce in this war

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:08.299
between Israel and Hamas.

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.925
This deal

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:10.844
does not come without criticism

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.262
even here in Israel.

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:13.513
There have been questions

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:14.723
about making this deal.

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:15.306
The former Trump

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:16.599
national security adviser,

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:17.767
John Bolton says is that

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.395
it is a badly flawed agreement

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:22.063
and he joins us now.

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:22.689
Thank you so much,

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:23.982
Ambassador, for being here.

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.066
You have been critical

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.317
because essentially,

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.111
if I believe this right,

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.237
and tell me if I'm wrong,

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:31.990
you think that Hamas gains more from this

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.825
than Israel does.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.410
What exactly about this deal

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.954
do you think is so bad

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.915
Well, there are many specific provisions

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:43.043
that I think are badly misguided.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.169
But but fundamentally,

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.296
what's going on here is that

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:47.756
Hamas is playing

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:48.256
a game

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.883
of psychological warfare

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.177
against the people of Israel

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:53.762
and the people of the United States

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:54.763
as well,

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:55.889
trying to distract

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:56.556
Israel

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.725
from its strategic mission

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:02.020
of eliminating Hamas and trying to focus

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.356
on the question of the hostages,

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:06.232
the question

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.235
of the condition of civilians in Gaza.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:10.028
Obviously,

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:12.363
this is a heart wrenching situation

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:13.615
and you can feel nothing

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.283
but compassion

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:17.619
for the families of the hostages.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.038
But in cold fact, Israel

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:21.998
strategic mission here

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:23.249
is much more important.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.875
But if the

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:27.378
if the Hamas effort can help break

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.423
the morale, can help break the resolve

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.633
of the Israeli forces,

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:32.926
what they really want to do,

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.636
and this is the real play,

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.430
is to turn this four day pause

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.724
into a permanent cease fire.

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:40.725
Now, I don't think they're going

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.019
to achieve that at the first iteration,

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.979
but they're trying to put the onus

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.606
on the Israeli forces

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:49.067
if and when they begin hostilities again.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:50.735
They are playing, I think, a

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:53.154
and surprisingly sophisticated

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:54.948
psychological game here.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.407
I don't think this one event

00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:57.283
is necessarily

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.410
going to be the Alpha and omega.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.746
But if this sets a precedent

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.998
that undermines Israeli resolve

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:04.833
to achieve

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:05.250
what they're

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.543
legitimately entitled

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.795
to achieve, the elimination of Hamas

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:10.046
as a threat.

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:10.964
It'll be a huge

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.298
victory for the terrorists.

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:16.427
So the flip side of that argument

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:18.096
and something that I was reading today

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.055
from having read

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:20.056
to Gerhard Dryer

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.350
here for the Times of Israel in Tel Aviv,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.935
he basically believes

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.311
that Hamas agreed

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.397
to this deal out of desperation.

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.274
Why do you think Hamas agreed to this

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:30.400
with Israel?

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.237
Well, I think on balance,

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:35.572
in a military sense,

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.448
Hamas is the beneficiary

00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:39.284
more than the Israeli side.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.661
Certainly, as you heard from your

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.496
your previous guest,

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.622
the Israelis are going to move

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:45.248
people around.

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:46.332
They're going to change troops,

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:46.833
that they're going

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:47.876
to do a number of things.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:49.335
They will take advantage of

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.753
of the pause as well.

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:51.671
But it's Hamas

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.590
that's getting pounded here.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.633
I don't think we know the full amount of

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.803
devastation that the Israeli forces

00:02:58.803 --> 00:02:59.554
have wrought.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.472
But it's Hamas that needs the break.

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:04.058
And the longer they can make that break,

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:06.102
the better off they'll be.

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.562
I don't think

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:08.688
people should forget that

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:09.939
at the beginning of this war,

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.191
the Biden administration

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.609
sent military advisers

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:13.276
to Israel

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.319
that said, look,

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.738
learn from our experiences in Iraq

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.072
and Afghanistan.

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:19.657
Don't rush in, pal mail.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:22.035
Take your time this is very complicated

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.245
using the examples, particularly

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:26.414
of Fallujah and Mosul in Iraq,

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.082
which took nine

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:29.876
to 12 months for American

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.003
and Iraqi forces to secure.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.504
We're seven weeks into this.

00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:35.173
There's a long way to go.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.592
But if Israel's resolve can be weakened

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.010
and broken,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.803
they'll never get to the amount of time

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:43.306
they really need to accomplish the stated

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:45.266
objective of eliminating Hamas

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.896
That is, I mean, quite an objective.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:50.521
They're not just saying

00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:52.941
they want to demean or diminish Hamas.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.067
They have used

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.402
words like eliminate and eradicate Hamas.

00:03:56.694 --> 00:03:57.737
We heard from the defense

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:58.738
minister earlier

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.615
saying that after this pause, he believes

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.700
it will take two more months of fighting.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.160
Do you realistically think

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.702
that Israel

00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:07.205
can achieve that goal within two months?

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:09.707
Well, you know,

00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:11.376
I read that comment as well.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.670
I understood that to be

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.380
saying to the Israeli forces, we've

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.048
got two months of intense struggle

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:17.799
ahead of us.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.549
I didn't see it

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.802
as limiting it to two months.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:23.137
But part of the psychological campaign,

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:25.181
part of the propaganda effort here

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:27.433
is to undercut

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:28.476
Israel's ability

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:30.061
to get to that stated objective.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.604
For example,

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.814
the Russian prime minister,

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.983
Medvedev, said a couple of weeks ago

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:38.403
that Israel, as an occupying power

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.238
which it's not, by the way,

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.072
in the Gaza Strip,

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.448
but as an occupying power,

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.450
did not have a legitimate

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.535
right of self-defense,

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:48.079
meaning implicitly that everything

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.956
Israel has done since October

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:50.790
the seventh

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.083
has been illegitimate,

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.293
since it doesn't have the right

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.752
to self-defense.

00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:56.963
A senior U.N., quote unquote,

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.131
human rights official

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.550
who said the same thing about a week ago,

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.509
that that's going to be

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.011
part of the argument here,

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.721
to say you've gone far enough,

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.139
you don't have to eliminate it,

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.182
just sit down and negotiate with them.

00:05:08.182 --> 00:05:09.726
You can see it coming.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.686
And what I worry about is the pause,

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.396
if it begins in a few hours,

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.064
is just the opening wedge to

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:16.232
achieve that objective.

00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:19.444
So you think that that

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:20.320
once Israel

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.446
has agreed to this

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.281
this pause, once it starts

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.741
just literally in a matter of hours

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:25.325
from now,

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.910
the basically the international criticism

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.745
of Israel

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.538
restarting its military campaign

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:31.789
will be so high

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.292
that they may not actually do it

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.046
Well, I think I think the Israelis

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:38.880
are pretty immune

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.923
to a lot of blabbering internationally.

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:41.924
What I worry about

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:42.967
is that the White House

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.178
is losing its resolve.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.012
There's no secret

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.056
if you if you read an American papers,

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.517
you can see many of the pro-Palestinian

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.936
elements of the Democratic Party

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:54.479
are saying

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.355
they want the pause

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.190
to be transformed into a truce

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.274
or into a cease fire.

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:00.151
A lot of these words become

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.986
interchangeable after a while.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.196
And that's the objective.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.864
And I think Biden recognizes

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:05.323
he's got

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:06.366
a severe problem

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.450
because of the schism

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.160
within the Democratic Party.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.286
So domestic U.S.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.163
politics are going to play a role here.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.539
And if if the

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.166
if the mood can be shifted

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:15.917
Talking about

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.627
the anguish of the hostages.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:18.044
Nobody

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:18.961
nobody really talks

00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:21.047
about the 190 hostages

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.298
who are not going to be released

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:24.050
in the next four days.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.342
You know,

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:26.135
this can have a significant impact.

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:27.428
I think

00:06:27.428 --> 00:06:29.680
really the questioning that Medvedev

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.848
has started off

00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:32.016
of, the legitimacy of

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:33.518
what Israel is doing

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:35.019
is just going to be amplified

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.896
what the Israelis need to do and frankly,

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:39.065
what the United States needs to do

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.566
is reinforce

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:41.692
the legitimacy

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:43.194
of self-defense,

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:45.238
permitting Israel in this situation

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.615
not to minimize the threat,

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.242
but to eliminate the threat.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.577
And the threat really is not just Hamas.

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:52.161
Ultimately,

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.455
think of Hezbollah in the north

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:56.582
for almost the entire seven weeks

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.292
since October the seventh,

00:06:58.292 --> 00:06:59.168
they've been shelling

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:01.212
targets in northern Israel.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.296
All of this

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:03.589
under the watchful eyes

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.258
of the mullahs in Tehran.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.343
This is a much bigger conflict than just

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.011
in the Gaza Strip.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:11.556
Yeah.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:12.932
And Hezbollah is not party

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:14.976
to this temporary truce.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.018
Of course, Ambassador

00:07:16.018 --> 00:07:17.103
John Bolton, as always,

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:17.812
thank you for your time.

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:18.521
Thanks for joining us

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.565
tonight on Thanksgiving.

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:21.983
Thank you.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:22.733
Happy Thanksgiving.
