00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.134
right now, President Biden is

00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:02.769
delivering remarks at the US Capitol.

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:05.772
So we're going to listen in.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:08.274
Thank you.

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.277
Thank you. Sir, please.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:12.679
Thank you to Isaiah

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.981
chapter ten introduction

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:16.383
for your leadership

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:17.450
in the United States

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.953
Holocaust Memorial Museum.

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.956
There are two scholar statesmen

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.291
and, a dear friend,

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.127
Speaker Johnson,

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:30.130
Peter Jeffries, members of Congress,

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.631
and especially the survivors

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.033
of the Holocaust.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.367
My mother here, she look at you.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.802
God love you all.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:38.371
God's love you all

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.907
a Foxman and all other survivors

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:42.342
who embody absolute courage

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:45.345
and dignity and grace are here as well.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.615
During these sacred days of remembrance,

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.383
we grieve.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.652
We give voice to the 6 million Jews

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:55.288
who were systematically targeted,

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.657
murdered by the Nazis

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:58.691
and their collaborators

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.427
during World War Two.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:03.430
We honor the memory of victims,

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.466
the pain of survivors,

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.435
the bravery of heroes

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.335
who stood up to Hitler's

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:12.105
unspeakable evil. And we recommit

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.841
to heading

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.876
and heeding the lessons

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.411
at one of the darkest chapters

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.679
in human history

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.615
to revitalize and realize

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.618
the responsibility of never again,

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:29.055
never again, simply translated from me,

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:32.025
means never forget, never forget.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.327
Never forgetting means

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.963
we must keep telling the story,

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.232
must keep teaching the truth,

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.700
must keep teaching our children

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.769
and our grandchildren.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.904
The truth is, we are at

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:47.907
risk of people not knowing the truth.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.376
That's why growing up,

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.111
my dad

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.345
taught me and my siblings

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.347
about the horrors of the Shoah.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.549
At our family dinner table.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.318
That's why I visited Yad Vashem

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.786
with my family

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.287
as a senator,

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.656
as vice president, and as president.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:04.157
And that's why

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.860
I took my grandchildren to Dachau

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.761
so they could see and bear witness

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.630
to the perils of indifference,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.532
the complicity of silence

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:13.633
in the face of evil that

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:14.567
they knew was happening.

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:18.705
Germany, 1933

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:22.275
Hitler and his Nazi Party rise to power

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.611
by rekindling one of the world's oldest

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.746
forms of prejudice and hate,

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.716
anti-Semitism.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.619
His role didn't begin with mass murder.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.622
It started slowly across economic,

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.858
political, social and cultural life.

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.896
Propaganda demonizing Jews,

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.365
boycotts of Jewish businesses,

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:48.368
synagogues to face with swastikas,

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.803
harassment of Jews in the street

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.972
and schools,

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.742
anti-Semitic demonstrations,

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:58.745
pogroms, organized riots

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.748
with the indifference of the world,

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:02.415
Hitler knew

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.185
he could expand his reign of terror

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.754
by eliminating Jews from Germany

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.189
to annihilate Jews across

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.157
Europe through genocide.

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:14.160
The Nazis call the Final Solution

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.963
concentration camps,

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:19.966
gas chambers, mass shootings.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.703
By the time the war ended,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.272
6 million Jews,

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:27.674
one out of every three Jews

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:30.643
in the entire world, were murdered.

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:32.645
This Asian hatred of Jews

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:33.346
didn't begin with.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:34.948
The Holocaust

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:37.350
didn't end with the Holocaust, either.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.850
Or after.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.786
Even after our victory in World War two,

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:41.487
this hatred

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:44.490
continues to lie deep in the hearts

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:47.160
of too many people in the world

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.062
and requires

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.464
our continued vigilance

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:53.633
and outspokenness.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:54.934
That hatred was brought to life

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:55.835
on October 7th.

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:58.404
In 2023,

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:01.074
on a sacred Jewish holiday.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.409
The terrorist group Hamas

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.677
unleashed the deadliest

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.679
day of the Jewish people

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.315
since the Holocaust, driven

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:09.882
by ancient

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.951
desire to wipe out the Jewish people

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.820
off the face of the earth.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.523
Over 1200 innocent people

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:22.328
babies, parents, grandparents

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:25.231
slaughtered in a kibbutz,

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:27.734
massacred at a music festival,

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.235
brutally raped,

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:32.238
mutilated and sexually assaulted

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.974
thousands more

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:36.976
carrying wounds.

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:37.944
Borrowed some shrapnel

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.646
from the memory of that

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:42.048
terrible day they endured.

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:44.917
Hundreds taken hostage,

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:47.920
including survivors of the Shoah.

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:49.822
Now

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:51.524
here we are,

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:54.494
not 75 years later,

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:57.030
but just seven and a half months later,

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.567
and people are already forgetting.

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:04.003
They're already forgetting

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:07.006
that Hamas unleashed this terror.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.476
That was Hamas, a brutalized Israelis.

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:13.146
It was Hamas

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:16.149
who took and continues to hold hostages.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:19.185
I have not forgotten, nor have you.

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:22.255
And we will not forget.

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:33.599
As Jews around the world

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.101
still cope with the atrocity

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.104
and trauma of that day and its aftermath,

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:40.873
we've seen a ferocious surge

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:42.975
of antisemitism in America

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:45.345
and around the world,

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.347
vicious propaganda

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:50.350
on social media.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.452
Jews

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:55.121
forced to keep their hide,

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:56.389
their keepers under baseball

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.023
hats, tuck

00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:00.026
their Jewish stars into their shirts.

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:03.129
On college campuses, Jewish students

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.998
blocked, harassed, attacked

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.601
while walking to class.

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.970
Antisemitism,

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.973
anti-Semitic posters, slogans

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.643
calling for the annihilation of Israel,

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:20.780
the world's only Jewish state.

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:23.116
Too many people

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:25.151
denying, downplaying

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:26.686
rash lies and ignoring

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:30.490
the horrors of the Holocaust.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.925
And October 7th,

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.828
including Hamas's appalling use

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:38.097
of sexual violence to torture

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:40.333
and terrorize Jews.

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.368
It's absolutely despicable,

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:44.937
and it must stop

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:47.940
silence.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.948
Silencing the vile can hide much,

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:58.684
but it can erase nothing.

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.853
Some adjusted is so heinous,

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:03.656
so graphic, so grievous.

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:06.225
They cannot be married, buried

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:09.228
no matter how hard people try.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.931
In my view,

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.600
a major lesson of Holocaust is,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.835
as mentioned earlier, it's

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:18.471
not always not inevitable.

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.006
We know hate never goes away.

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:22.074
It only hides,

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:23.042
given a little oxygen

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:26.045
and comes off one of the rocks.

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:28.648
We also know it stops hate

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:31.651
one thing all of us.

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:33.986
Later, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:36.789
described antisemitism as a virus

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:39.792
that survived and mutated over time.

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:42.762
Together, we cannot

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:44.063
continue to let that happen.

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:47.266
We have to remember

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:49.836
our basic principles as a nation.

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:51.637
We have an obligation obligation.

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:52.405
We have an obligation

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:54.240
to learn the lessons of history.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.576
So we don't surrender our future

00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:58.778
to the horrors of the past.

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:01.147
We must give hate no safe harbor

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:04.150
against anyone, anyone.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.819
From the very founding, our very founding

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.154
Jewish Americans.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.056
Representative. Only about 2% of the U.S.

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:13.259
population have helped lead cause

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:16.262
of freedom for everyone in our nation.

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:18.297
From that experience,

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:20.833
we know scapegoating and demonizing

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.502
any minority

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.504
is a threat to every minority.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:27.507
And the very foundation of our democracy.

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:29.809
So moments like this,

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.577
I have to put these principles

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:34.580
and we're talking about into action.

00:08:34.947 --> 00:08:35.581
I understand

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:36.015
people have

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.016
strong beliefs

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:39.919
and deep convictions about the world

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.521
in America.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.290
I respect and protect

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.093
the fundamental right to free speech.

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:48.394
To debate, disagree.

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:50.296
To protest

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:53.299
peacefully and make our voices heard.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.103
I understand that's America.

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:59.105
But there is no place on any campus

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:01.941
in America, or any place in America

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:02.975
for anti-Semitism

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:03.709
or hate speech

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.712
or threats of violence of any kind.

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:19.158
Whether against Jews or anyone else,

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:22.261
violent attacks, destroying property.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.196
It's not peaceful protest.

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:26.465
It's against the law.

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.801
And we are not a lawless country.

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.870
We're a civil society.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.972
We oppose the rule of law.

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.340
And no one should have

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.775
to hide to be brave.

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:38.778
Just to be themselves.

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:46.919
The Jewish community

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:49.589
didn't want you to know.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:50.756
I see your fear.

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:53.192
You're hurting your pain.

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:55.261
Let me reassure you.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.230
As you're president, you're not alone.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.333
You belong.

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.336
You always have, and you always will.

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:04.203
And my commitment

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:06.172
to the safety of the Jewish people,

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:07.840
the security of Israel

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.475
and its right to exist as an independent

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:11.110
Jewish state is ironclad,

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.878
even when we disagree.

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:24.557
My administration is

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:26.892
working around the clock

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:29.895
to free remaining hostages,

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:33.299
just as we have freed hostages already.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.333
And we will not rest

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:37.336
until we bring them all home.

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:45.277
My administration,

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:46.312
with our second generals

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.647
leadership, has launched

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:48.247
our nation's

00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:50.116
first national strategy

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.984
to counter antisemitism.

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.519
That's mobilizing the full force

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:54.820
of the federal government

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.623
to protect Jewish community.

00:10:57.623 --> 00:10:59.492
But what we know

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.560
is not to work for government alone

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.462
or Jews alone.

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:06.432
That's why I'm calling on all Americans

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:08.668
to stand united against antisemitism

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.671
and hate in all its forms.

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:12.638
My dear friend,

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:14.206
who became a friend of the late

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:16.542
Ellie Whitesell, said, quote,

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:18.811
one person of integrity

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:20.813
can make a difference.

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:22.248
We have to remember that

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:25.251
now more than ever

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.353
here in Emancipation Hall, the U.S.

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:27.887
Capitol.

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:31.857
Among the towering statue to history

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:35.227
is a bronze bust of role Walmart.

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:38.864
Born in Sweden as a Lutheran.

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:41.934
He was a businessman, a diplomat,

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:44.003
all stationed in Hungary

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:46.105
during World War Two.

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:47.306
He used diplomatic cover

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:48.541
to hide and rescue

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.476
about 100,000 Jews

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:52.678
over a six month period.

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:55.681
Among them was a 16 year old Jewish boy

00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:58.951
who escaped a Nazi labor camp.

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:02.455
After the war ended.

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:03.823
A boy received a scholarship

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:05.991
from the Hallel Foundation

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:08.427
to study in America.

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:11.430
He came to New York City penniless,

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:13.566
but determined to turn his pain

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.234
into purpose.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.268
Along with his wife,

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:18.704
also a Holocaust survivor,

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:19.972
he became a renowned

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:22.641
economist and foreign policy thinker,

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:23.776
eventually making his way

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.711
to this very capital

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:27.646
on the staff of a first term senator.

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:31.784
That Jewish refugee was Tom Lantos,

00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:34.720
and that Senator was made.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.821
Tom and his wife Annette

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:36.989
and their family became dear

00:12:36.989 --> 00:12:39.658
friends to me and my family.

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:40.926
Tom would go on to become

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:42.261
the only Holocaust survivor

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.163
ever elected to Congress,

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:45.631
for became a leading voice

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:46.098
on civil

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:49.101
rights and human rights around the world.

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:52.304
Tom never met Raul,

00:12:52.304 --> 00:12:54.173
who was taken prisoner by the Soviets.

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:56.375
Never to be heard from again,

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:58.410
but through Tom's efforts,

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.413
rolls Busters here in the Capitol.

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:03.682
He was also given honorary U.S.

00:13:03.682 --> 00:13:06.385
citizenship, only the second person ever,

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:09.121
after Winston Churchill.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:11.657
The Holocaust Museum here in Washington

00:13:11.657 --> 00:13:13.959
is located in a rural road

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:16.295
in Ralls, named

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.330
the story of the power

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.099
of a single person.

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:22.401
To put aside our differences,

00:13:22.401 --> 00:13:24.770
to see our common humanity,

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.705
to stand up to hate,

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:27.840
and its ancient story

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.942
of resilience from immense pain

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:31.143
and persecution.

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:32.311
To find hope,

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.679
purpose and meaning in life.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.681
We try to live and

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:37.917
share with one another.

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:40.920
That story endures.

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:43.823
Let me close with this.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.991
I know these days when members

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:48.994
fall on difficult times.

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:52.398
We all do well to remember.

00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:54.300
These days also fall during the month.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.269
We celebrate Jewish American heritage,

00:13:57.736 --> 00:13:58.971
a heritage that stretches

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:00.706
from our earliest days

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:01.240
to enrich

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.243
every single part of American life.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.345
Today,

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:09.415
great Americans, great Jewish American

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:12.451
and Tom Lantos used the phrase

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:15.554
the veneer of civilization is paper thin.

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:19.625
We are its guardians,

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:22.628
and we can never rest.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.731
My fellow Americans, we must.

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:29.201
We must be those guardians.

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:31.537
We must never rest.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.839
Must rise against hate,

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.808
meet across the divide,

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:38.110
share our common humanity

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.844
and God

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:41.847
bless the victims and survivors of Shoah

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:44.183
and the resilient hearts.

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:46.051
A courageous spirit

00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:47.620
and eternal flame of faith

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.087
of the Jewish

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:49.221
people forever

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:50.890
shine their light on America

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.458
and around the world.

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:54.460
Pray God, thank you all.
