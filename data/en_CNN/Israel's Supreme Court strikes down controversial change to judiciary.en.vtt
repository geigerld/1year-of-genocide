00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.302
Now to some breaking news from Israel.

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:06.906
The Supreme Court has struck down
a controversial change to the judiciary,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.043
one that's ignited
deep divisions within the nation.

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:13.847
Let's get right to Elliott
Gotkine in Tel Aviv for us now.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.950
Eliot, this refers specifically
to a proposed amendment

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.053
that would have stripped the Supreme Court
of its ability

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:23.056
to declare government decisions
as unreasonable.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.059
It's a fascinating ruling, flies
in the face of efforts

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.460
by Prime Minister Netanyahu.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.164
I think the big question here
is, will he stand by the Supreme

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:33.033
Court's ruling

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.669
Julia, that's an open question.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:39.105
He has in the past,
including to our very own Wolf

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.642
Blitzer,
avoided directly answering that question.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.478
But make no mistake,
this is an unprecedented decision

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.047
by the Supreme Court.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:52.152
Never before has it struck down
a basic law or an amendment

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:56.222
to a basic law, which is the closest thing
that Israel has to a constitution.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:59.726
And what Prime Minister Netanyahu's
government did is it came out with this

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:04.297
judicial overhaul, which, as you said,
caused months of very deep divisions.

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:07.700
Hundreds of thousands of people
on the streets protesting.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.003
At one point,
he sacked his defense minister

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.073
for suggesting
that he pulls this legislation

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.141
and then quietly forgot
that he'd sacked him.

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.476
And, of course, Defense Minister

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:20.180
Yoav Gallant, somewhat busy right now
with the war with Hamas.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.283
And so this is an incredibly
significant decision

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:26.619
it was a very narrow ruling, eight
to seven against the government.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.290
And what Netanyahu wanted to do was
and what they did, in fact, do,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.958
because it's a law
that's now been struck down,

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.628
it did come into effect for a few months
and it's now been struck down.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:39.365
Netanyahu wanted to remove
the Supreme Court's ability

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:42.502
to strike down government decisions
on the grounds of reasonableness.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.572
And I'll just give you one example
that was very relevant to the beginning

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.674
of this government's tenure,
which is its attempts

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:51.978
to appoint a minister called Aryeh Dairy,
who is from Netanyahu's ally.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:55.381
If one of Netanyahu's allies, the Area
Dairies

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:58.251
Party Shas, is in the governing coalition.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:01.020
Netanyahu wanted to make Aria Dairy
a minister,

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:04.090
but he's been convicted three times
most recently for tax fraud.

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.859
The Supreme Court said, no,

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.095
it's unreasonable to make him a decision
because of his convictions.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:11.464
And as a result,
he wasn't made a minister.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:15.535
So what this means in future now
is that the Supreme Court will continue

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:16.970
to have the power

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.807
to strike down decisions such as those on
the grounds of reasonableness.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.877
It will be seen as a victory
for opponents of Netanyahu

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:27.647
and all those hundreds of thousands
of people who were out on the streets week

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:32.385
in, week out for months on end, protesting
against the government's plans to weaken

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:33.720
the Supreme Court.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.624
It will, of course, also be seen as a loss
on the part of Netanyahu

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:39.692
government's supporters.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.761
We're not seeing any signs of protest
right now.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:45.064
Of course, Israel
is in the middle of that war with Hamas.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:48.601
And indeed, those divisions
that this judicial overhaul created

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:50.670
seem to have been not forgotten.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.072
But certainly shunted to the side.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:56.843
Now, this decision
could potentially threaten to reopen them.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.078
We've heard from the justice
minister, Yariv Levin.

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:02.282
He was the architect of this
judicial overhaul.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.383
He's already assailed

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.152
the timing of this decision,
saying it's the opposite of the unity

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:07.487
that Israel needs right now.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.255
But Julia, just one note on that.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:13.860
The Supreme Court had no decision
but to issue its ruling right now

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.398
because two of the Supreme Court
justices have to step down this month.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:22.569
Julia, it also could have profound
implications for the war, too, Eliot,

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.172
because doesn't it also pick
members of the current war cabinet

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:30.443
against each other to based on their views
on how they should have played

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:31.711
out or shouldn't play out

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.547
I think, Julia,

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:38.318
this war cabinet and we're in particular
talking about one of the opposition

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:42.789
leaders, Benny Gantz and his party,
which is now in the war cabinet,

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:47.193
The judicial overhaul is really not
something that they are there

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.195
to talk about or to discuss

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:52.932
It's not even really been it's
almost been forgotten very bizarrely.

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:53.866
It's almost been forgotten

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:57.503
as a result of this war and Hamas
terrorist attacks of October the seventh.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.773
And so as a result,
I don't think it's going to necessarily

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:05.311
sew divisions in this war cabinet
the country has generally been united

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:09.449
in this war with Hamas in the wake
of those attacks of October the seventh.

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:12.418
And I think that the war cabinet
will remain very much focused

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:15.488
on the job at hand,
which is to destroy Hamas militarily

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:19.425
and to get the 100 plus hostages
still being held in captivity

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.362
by Hamas and other groups
inside the Gaza Strip

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:25.465
for some 80 days
now to get them all back home.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:28.601
Yes, this is a controversial issue,
this judicial overhaul.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:29.702
Yes. The Supreme Court

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:33.840
ruling is also controversial
but I think the war cabinet in particular

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:37.877
will remain very much focused
because this war, certainly from Israel's

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:41.614
perspective, is more important than this
judicial overhaul.

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:42.482
Julia Yes.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.216
The message in there,

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:47.153
I think, for the prime minister to perhaps
now is not the time election.

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:48.688
Thank you for that report there.
