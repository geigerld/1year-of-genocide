&gt;&gt;&gt; BUBBLING BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HERE IN  D.C. ARE SOME REAL RESENTMENTS  OF FELLOW DEMOCRATS STILL  BLAMING ISRAEL FOR THE HOSPITAL  EXPLOSION DESPITE U.S.  INTELLIGENCE CLASSIFIED AND  UNCLASSIFIED SUGGESTING THAT IT  WAS ACTUALLY A MISFIRED  PALESTINIAN ROCKET THAT DID THAT DAMAGE. PENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRATIC SENATOR  JOHN FETTERMAN WROTE QUOTE --  WHO WOULD TAKE THE WORD OF A  GROUP THAT JUST MASSACRED  INNOCENT CIVILIANS OVER OUR KEY  ALLY. INNOCENT ISRAELIS WERE THE  VICTIM OF THE TERRORIST ATTATAC  THAT RESULTED IN THE LARGEST  LIFE OF JEWISH LIVES SINCE THE  HOLOCAUST. NOW WE KNOW IT WAS NOT CAUSED BY ISRAEL. A DEMOCRAT OF FLORIDA WROTE MY  COLLEAGUES WHO BLAMED ISRAEL  SHOULD TAKE DOWN THEIR POSTS,  END QUOTE. ONE NOTED THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE  ASSESSMENT WAS THAT THIS WAS NOT DONE BY ISRAEL BUT THE OTHER  CONGRESSWOMAN OF MICHIGAN, NOT  ONLY HAS SHE NOT UPDATED FROM  HER POST, SHE TOOK THE STAGE TO  ADDRESS PROTESTORS AND ISSUED A  THREAT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENT BIDEN, NOT ALL  AMERICANS WITH YOU ON THIS ONE  AND YOU NEED TO WAKE UP AND  UNDERSTAND THAT! WE ARE LITERALLY WATCHING PEOPLE COMMIT GENOCIDE AND KILLING JUST LIKE THIS AND WE STILL STAND BY  YOU SAY NOTHING! WE WILL REMEMBER THIS. &gt;&gt; AND THE CONGRESSMAN'S TWEET  BLAMING ISRAEL FOR WHAT HAPPENED IS STILL UP. CNN'S JESSICA DEAN JOINS ME NOW. SO, JESSICA, DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN VERY EAGER TO HIGHLIGHT THE  EMBARRASSING DYSFUNCTION OF  HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHEN IT COMES  TO THE SPEAKER CRISIS, BUT THESE ARE SOME TENSIONS THAT WE'RE  SEEING AMONG HOUSE DEMOCRATS ON  THIS ISSUE OF ISRAEL AND THE  PALESTINIANS AS WELL. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SEEING THOSE FAULT  LINES AND I TALKED TO SEVERAL  HOUSE DEMOCRATS TODAY AND ONE  TOLD ME IN THEIR WORDS THAT HER  COLLEAGUES ARE FURIOUS. YES, THAT THEY'RE VERY  FRUSTRATED. IT'S NOT JUST PUBLIC PERCEPTION  OVER THIS. THEY THINK THESE SORTS OF  COMMENTS THAT GO AGAINST U.S.  INTELLIGENCE ARE DANGEROUS IN A  WAY BY SPREADING THAT MESSAGE. AND THEY PUT IT TO ME THIS WAY. THEY SAID WHY IS SHE BELIEVING  HAMAS' WORD OVER THE U.S.  INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES? AND THERE IS I'M TOLD A PUSH FOR HER TO SIT FOR AN INTELLIGENCE  BRIEFING AND SEE THE  INTELLIGENCE HERSELF WITH THE  HOPE THAT THAT WILL INFORM SOME  MESSAGING GOING FORWARD. I DID ASK IF SHE HAS DONE THAT  OR HAS PLANS. I'VE NOT GOTTEN A RESPONSE FROM  THEM. WE KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR  COLLEAGUES HAVE COMPLAINED TO  THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER IN THE  HOUSE, HAKEEM JEFFRIES, ABOUT  THIS. I TALKED TO ANOTHER DEMOCRAT WHO SAID WE'VE SEEN THE HOUSE  DEMOCRATS RANGE FROM BEING  OUTSPOKEN ON THIS. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ SAID  THIS WAS A VILE POSITION TO  TAKE. OTHERS ARE STANDING BACK TO GIVE HER SOME ROOM TO PERHAPS WALK  THIS BACK. BUT THEY SAID THAT FETTERMAN  TWEET THAT YOU JUST READ IN THE  LEAD IN THERE, THAT THAT SUMS UP HOW A LOT OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS  FEEL RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; I TALKED TO A U.S. SENATOR  WHO ATTENDED A CLASSIFIED  BRIEFING WHO SAID THE CLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE MAKES IT CLEAR  THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WAS  PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, BUT  ARE DEMOCRATS AFRAID THAT IF  THEY CALL OUT CONGRESSWOMAN  TALIB THAT THEY WILL ALIENATE  AND ANGER THE PROGRESSIVE BASE  OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT IS  FAR MORE CRITICAL OF ISRAEL? &gt;&gt; FAR MORE CRITICAL OF ISRAEL  AND HAS BEEN PART OF THE  DEMOCRATIC COALITION IN WINNING  THESE ELECTIONS IN THE LAST  SEVERAL CYCLES. SO THEY HAVE BEEN A CRITICAL  PART TO THE DEMOCRATIC  COALITION. THE SENSE I'M GETTING FROM  TALKING TO PEOPLE IS THERE IS  FRUSTRATION THOUGH BUBBLING AND  WHAT I'M INTERESTED TO SEE IS  OVER THE NEXT DAY OR TWO IF SHE  CONTINUES TO HOLD ON TO THIS. IF PEOPLE START TO BE MORE  OUTSPOKEN. IF WE HEAR FROM MORE OF OUR  COLLEAGUES ON THE RECO
