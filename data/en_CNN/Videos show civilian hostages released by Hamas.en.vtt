00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.001
The breaking news

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:01.501
this hour,

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:04.037
an outpouring of emotion here in Israel

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.205
as Hamas releases

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:09.342
24 hostages kidnaped back on October 7th.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.511
CNN's Matthew Chance has details,

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.612
including a closer

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:13.747
look at the video

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.683
Hamas released of the hostage handoff.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.419
Inside Gaza.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.788
They kidnaped and killed,

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.057
but now Hamas is showing its gunmen

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.693
releasing Israelis in Gaza.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.429
For many, these are disturbing scenes.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.798
Nine year old Ohad Munda

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:34.801
being embraced as he set free,

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:35.969
an old woman

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.538
being carried by a masked man.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:43.376
His Palestine lions cheer

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:43.676
after

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.679
49 long days of captivity in Gaza.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.448
Aid workers from the Red Cross

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.384
drive them through the border into Egypt

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.087
and to freedom.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:55.288
Fiction television

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.990
shows a convoy of vehicles

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.525
heading to the crossing.

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.161
Then the hostages, including ten Thais,

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.195
a Filipino

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.131
and the 13 Israeli women and children

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.634
disembarking for checks.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.602
Israeli military posted this

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:10.937
grainy video

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:11.571
of the moment

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.140
they all finally reentered the country.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.775
A step says the Israeli prime

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.077
minister, towards

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:19.846
bringing all hostages home.

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.115
Islam, whatever the visual, we shall.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.583
We have just completed the return

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.351
of the first of our hostages,

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.419
children, their mothers

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:27.687
and additional women.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:29.656
Each one of them is a whole world.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.658
But I emphasize to you, the families

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:33.493
and to you citizens of Israel,

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.661
we are committed to return

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:38.798
all our hostages.

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:39.933
Most of the hostages

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.768
released in this first group

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.770
under the temporary truce

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.939
were taken from near ORs,

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.440
one of the small Israeli

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.008
communities near Gaza

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.245
ravaged by Hamas on October the seventh.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:55.582
At least 38 people there were killed

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:59.619
and more than 70 abducted that day.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.688
People like Danielle Aloni

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:02.522
and her five year

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:04.357
old daughter Emilia,

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:06.726
both freed in this latest release.

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:08.628
But the relatives they were visiting

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.163
when Hamas attacked

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:13.399
remain unaccounted for as hostages.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.969
Behind every release, a poignant

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.972
reminder of those left behind.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.841
Like the family of Omri Almog,

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.343
his brother in law and niece

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.944
killed his sister

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.747
and her three children still hostages.

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:30.583
Yet Omri is now optimistic.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.619
The best is in front of us.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.053
It's going to come.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.456
Whatever happened, we cannot change.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:39.225
The dove is no longer with us.

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:41.461
The beautiful girl is.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.563
Is not with us anymore.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.398
But there's still a chance.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:47.066
Still a chance. Your sister?

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.134
Yes. Yes.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:49.536
We have to bring what's left

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:50.436
within to bring back

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.005
what's left from this family.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.673
It's a broken family.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.676
A broken family in a country

00:02:56.743 --> 00:03:00.780
of shattered lives.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.015
Matthew Chance is joining me

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.616
live here in Tel Aviv right now.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.651
So, first of all, Matthew,

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:05.285
what do we know

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:06.986
about what is expected to happen

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:07.887
tomorrow?

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:09.022
Well, we think, Wolf,

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.724
that it's going to follow a similar kind

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.293
of course already.

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.160
The Israeli officials

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.828
that we spoken to said that Mossad

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:16.796
and the Israeli military

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:18.498
have received a list

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:19.799
of potential hostage

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.768
releases from Hamas via

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:24.637
the mediators in Qatar have told us

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:25.238
is on the list.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:25.638
Of course,

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:26.139
we don't even know

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.540
how many names are on that list.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.043
It's between ten and 13

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.077
like it was today.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:32.178
But Israeli officials say

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:33.279
that they've already informed

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.380
the families involved

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.082
so they can be prepared

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:37.650
to, you know, welcome back

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.484
their loved ones.

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:39.352
I think you have to remember

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:41.421
that the events of today,

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.256
the pause in the fighting,

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.625
the releases of the of the hostages

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.893
and the prisoners from Israeli jails,

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.928
as well as the humanitarian relief

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:50.897
it went remarkably well.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.165
And so I think the hope is that

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:55.168
that can be repeated again and again.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:56.769
Let's hope it does get repeated

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.905
if these hostages are able to come home.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.139
Matthew, thank you very much.

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.474
Matthew Chance reporting.

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:03.276
I want to go to CNN's Oren Liebermann

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:04.043
right now.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:06.346
He's over at the Wolfson Medical Center

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:07.213
here in Tel Aviv.

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:07.780
Oren,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.215
I know you're at this hospital

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:11.150
where hostages have arrived.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.151
Update our viewers.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:16.689
What did you actually see?

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:17.624
Well, Wolf, this is one

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:18.524
of several hospitals

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:21.194
that have taken in the freed hostages

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:22.295
over the course of the past

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:23.062
several hours.

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:24.831
At about 9:00 tonight,

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:25.665
two patients,

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:26.666
two of the first freed

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:28.668
hostages, arrived by ambulance

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:30.236
a couple of hours after that.

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:31.204
Take a look at this video.

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:33.539
This is three more elderly women

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.942
hostages being brought in on helicopter.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.176
There actually is no helipad

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.745
here at the hospital itself.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:39.712
So they landed

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:41.147
at a field nearby

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:43.483
and were brought in on ambulance.

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:44.117
Take a look at this

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.518
video of the hostages

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:47.420
being loaded onto the ambulances.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.254
The cheers,

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:49.656
the unbridled joy,

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:50.890
the happiness

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.192
as they were loaded here in Israel

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:54.127
and brought to the

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.928
brought to the hospital for care.

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.163
It is that same joy

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.432
that played out in the hospital itself,

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:00.400
according to the staff

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.734
here, when they were brought in,

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:02.702
when they were welcomed

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:03.536
and when they began

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:04.037
to receive

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:06.272
the professional medical care of Wolfson

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:09.142
Medical Center. Listen to this.

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.044
I think that there was no one

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:11.944
in the room

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:14.947
that could hold these feelings

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.516
and stop crying

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:19.085
because it was a very emotional

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:21.254
and exciting event.

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:24.457
They met their families and they met

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.493
a very professional, a team here

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:31.097
that was very good, prepared to receive

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:35.601
those hostages.

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.503
Now, the hospital wouldn't say

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:39.739
all that much about their condition,

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.574
their well-being or their mental state.

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:42.475
They said they're going to respect

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:45.011
the privacy of the five hostages

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:45.611
that are here.

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:46.713
They have set up a special

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:48.114
wing of the hospital

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:50.216
just for them and their families

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.385
as they go through all of the checks,

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.020
all of the medical evaluations.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.987
And it's not just a question

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:56.222
of their physical health.

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:57.256
It's also a question

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:58.291
of their mental health.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:58.658
Right now,

00:05:58.658 --> 00:05:59.892
psychologists brought in,

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:01.994
as well as other professionals,

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:03.863
to essentially give them any type of help

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:04.864
they might need.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:06.032
The critical first step

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.867
was reuniting them with their family.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.069
That happened here several hours ago.

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:11.070
And crucially,

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.106
it's not a one time deal here.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:13.873
This isn't a process

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.274
that began and ended.

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:15.842
The hospital

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:16.409
well aware

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:17.910
that there might be more elderly

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.545
freed hostages coming out of Gaza

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:21.614
over the course of the next several days.

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:23.149
And they say they are very much ready

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:24.751
to receive them as well,

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:26.619
with the same sort of open arms

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:30.790
to begin that recovery process.

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:31.958
Oren Wolfson

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.993
is not the only Israeli hospital

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.795
where hostages were taken today.

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:39.265
How is that working?

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:40.266
You're absolutely right.

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:42.268
Wolfson will focus on the elderly.

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:43.736
The five freed hostages

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.872
who were brought here were elderly women.

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:47.039
But there are other hospitals

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.308
that will focus on different populations

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:49.942
or groups.

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:51.277
So Schneider Medical Center,

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:52.512
which is in Petah Tikva,

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:54.180
not all that far from us

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.015
that will focus on the children

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:56.883
who are freed.

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:58.251
And they have set up

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.186
essentially a special area

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:00.987
to try to make it

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:02.355
feel as little as possible,

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:03.322
like a hospital.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:03.956
They want it to feel

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.658
almost like a luxury hotel

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:07.260
to make them as comfortable as possible.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.061
Wolf, another example of software warfare

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:10.196
that is set up to receive

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:11.330
the foreign nationals,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.298
and that's part of the system

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:13.166
here in place

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.836
for the freeing of the hostages.

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:18.805
Oren Liebermann reporting from Tel Aviv.

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.540
Oren, thank you very much.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.576
President Biden says he hopes and expects

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:24.944
American hostages

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.579
will be freed very soon,

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:28.681
even though none were released on this

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:30.750
the first day of the truce.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.984
CNN's Arlette Sines

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:33.386
is traveling with the president

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:34.220
in Nantucket,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.855
Massachusetts, for us right now.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:37.356
Arlette, how is the president

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:41.627
feeling about this deal so far?

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:43.563
Well, Wolf, President Biden welcomed

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:44.630
the initial release

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.399
that occurred of these hostages

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:48.134
being held by Hamas earlier today.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:48.968
He said that this was

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.136
just a start

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:50.970
to the process,

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.171
but said that he believes

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:54.407
that this had unfolded Well,

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:56.442
but it does come as Americans

00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:57.510
were not included

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.979
in that initial batch of hostages

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:00.913
that were released to

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:01.848
the president said that

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:02.782
it is his hope

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:03.950
and expectation

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.551
that there will be three Americans

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:06.953
coming out in the coming days.

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:08.488
That includes two women.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.022
And also for your four year

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.290
old Abigail Oden.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.292
It was her birthday on Friday.

00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:15.061
Her parents were killed on the

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:17.296
in the October 7th attack by Hamas.

00:08:17.296 --> 00:08:18.531
And she has been held

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:20.266
hostage over the course of the past

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:20.867
seven weeks.

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:21.868
But President Biden

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:24.871
had very few details to offer as

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.606
relating to his expectation

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:27.874
on what exactly

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.642
these Americans would be getting out.

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:30.610
Take a listen to what he had to tell

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.346
reporters earlier today.

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:34.547
We don't know when that

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:35.014
will occur,

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.617
but we're going to expect it to occur.

00:08:37.617 --> 00:08:39.151
And we don't know what

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:41.020
the list of all the hostages are

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.421
and when they'll be released.

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:43.890
But we know the numbers.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.358
They're going to be released

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.025
soon as my hope

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.760
and expectation will be soon.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.128
And of the ten Americans

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:50.463
that are unaccounted for,

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:51.797
do you know all of their conditions?

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:52.932
Are they all alive?

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:56.936
We don't know all the conditions.

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:58.838
So still a number of unanswered questions

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:00.907
about the fate of these American hostages

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:02.308
being held by Hamas.

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:03.342
The President Biden today

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:04.410
also expressed

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.380
some optimism that this fight,

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.581
this pause in the fighting

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.383
that's currently slated for

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.450
for four days,

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:11.951
he believes that

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:13.553
that could possibly be extended

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.620
to get even more

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.322
than the 50 women and children

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:17.823
that had been initially negotiated

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:18.791
in this initial deal.

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:19.292
Now, President

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:20.993
Biden has been working the phones

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:21.727
throughout the week,

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:23.262
including the leaders of Egypt,

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:24.497
Qatar and Israel.

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:26.299
He said that he will remain in contact

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.667
with those leaders

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.168
and counterparts in the region

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:30.503
as they are trying to make sure

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:34.206
that this deal stays on track.

00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:35.708
Arlette Sides reporting for us.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:36.576
Thank you very much. Our.
