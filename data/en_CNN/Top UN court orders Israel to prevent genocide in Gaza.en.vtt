00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.401
The International Court of

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:03.103
Justice has ordered Israel

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:04.371
to take all measures

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:05.005
to prevent

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.808
the commission of genocidal acts in Gaza

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:10.543
and to punish any public

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:11.811
incitement of genocide.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.947
That provisional ruling

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:15.315
announced at The Hague.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:16.483
A short time ago,

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:17.217
with the court

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.919
concluding that it has jurisdiction over

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.888
the case brought by South Africa

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.124
alleging Israel's actions in Gaza

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.692
could amount to genocide,

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.427
the court stopped short of calling

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.462
for an immediate cease fire in Israel's

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.630
war with Hamas.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.132
It did order, however, Israel

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:33.633
to submit a report

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:36.302
within one month on what it is doing

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.572
to respond to the court's order

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.207
Israel must, in accordance

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.375
with its obligations

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.310
under the Genocide Convention

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.980
in relation to Palestinians in Gaza,

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:49.649
take all measures within its power

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.885
to prevent the Commission of all Acts

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.086
within the scope of Article

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:56.389
two of the convention, in particular, a

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.359
killing group's members of the group B

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.162
causing serious bodily or mental harm

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.063
to members of the group

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.033
Well, these provisional measures

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.334
come as the Hamas run

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:09.602
health ministry

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:12.906
in Gaza reports the death toll in Gaza

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.207
since the start of the war

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:15.508
has now passed

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:19.846
26,000 with 64,000 people injured.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.882
It says at least 183 were killed

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:24.717
over the past day.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:26.319
There is a lot to unpack here.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.420
We've got Melissa Bell

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.222
connecting us from The Hague.

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:31.157
Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.826
as well as David McKenzie

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:33.660
in Johannesburg.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.762
All standing by for analysis.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.597
Melissa, let's start off with you.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:41.101
We've just heard from the ICJ that

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.235
of course,

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.070
ruling that just came through

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.271
Immediate measures

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.141
it says that Israel must adhere to.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:48.675
Take a seat.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:49.642
What you've heard

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.480
and maybe you can hear behind me lately,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.315
some of the pro-Palestinian protesters

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:56.850
listening on a big screen

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.051
who've been cheering on

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.220
is every one of those counts.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.820
And the ruling

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.123
came from the head

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.691
of the International Court

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.526
of Justice here in The Hague.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:09.295
It was just short of a cease fire,

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.330
of course, that the ruling went.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.997
And, yes,

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:13.066
significantly further towards it

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.001
than any of us had imagined

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.569
when these proceedings began.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.737
We listened on the 10th

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:19.706
and 11th of January

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:20.640
to South Africa

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.742
and then Israel lay out their case.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:24.944
And what we just heard today

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:29.249
was the head of the ICJ essentially

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:31.317
go extremely far

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.720
in the direction of South Africa,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.388
conceding that it was because

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:36.856
of all the genocidal acts

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:38.591
were being committed,

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.093
urging Israel

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.061
to take image urgent measures

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:42.862
to ensure

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:44.297
that there are no further

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:46.866
killings of Palestinians in Gaza.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:47.767
A group, by the way,

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.569
that the court recognizes

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.271
as a protected people

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.105
nor the further

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.474
causing of any mental or bodily

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:55.308
harm to them.

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:57.777
Now that is short of a cease fire,

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:59.512
but very close to it.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.614
And I think this is a ruling

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:02.715
that Israel is now

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.250
going to have to respond to.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.418
It had been said the fact

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:06.085
that it were chosen

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.320
to represent themselves

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.588
as robustly as they did,

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:10.957
an indication of how seriously they took

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:14.394
this court and its rulings and no doubt

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.496
what the wider world will consider

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.232
as it takes in these proceedings. So

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.302
an order that I think

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.737
will now see a great deal

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.673
of pressure on Israel,

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.942
certainly to allow more access to Gaza

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:31.311
and probably

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:34.781
to alter the way in which it is

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.215
perhaps

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.150
going about its military operation

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.152
or certainly the transparency

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.221
with which is going about in the wake

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:42.222
of this,

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.224
the UN's highest court, such

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.192
that it will be a very difficult

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:49.429
ruling for Israel to ignore

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.433
Melissa Bell there for us at The Hague.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.569
And we can see those protesters as well.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:57.770
We've also got Jeremy

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.839
Diamond standing by in Tel Aviv.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:00.273
And in fact,

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.408
we've just heard from

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.643
Netanyahu, from Benjamin

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:04.944
Netanyahu, hailing

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.312
the ICJ ruling

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:07.714
as what he says a rejection

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:10.550
of discrimination against Israel

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.188
Yeah, the Israeli prime minister

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:16.623
in his comments

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:18.691
making clear that Israel's commitment

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:19.792
to international law, in

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.694
his words, is unwavering

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:23.496
and also making clear that Israel

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:25.999
is not going to stop its war in Gaza.

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.233
Talking about the fact

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:28.334
that Israel will continue

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.969
to defend itself against Hamas,

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:30.770
which he calls

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.905
a genocidal terror organization.

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:34.407
But what he is also distinguishing

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:35.942
in this video message

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:39.178
is that the war in Gaza is against Hamas

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:41.314
and not against Palestinian civilians.

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:42.615
And he is also making

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:43.950
note of the fact that Israel

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.151
will, quote, continue

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:46.185
to facilitate

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:47.754
humanitarian assistance

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:49.889
to Palestinian civilians

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.225
and continue its efforts to minimize harm

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:53.559
to Palestinian civilians

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.427
as it continues

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:56.729
its military operations in Gaza.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.333
But we're getting some far stronger

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.402
reaction, perhaps from Israel's

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:03.636
defense minister,

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:04.871
who is making clear that

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.105
those who seek justice,

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.440
he says, will not find it

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.474
in the leather chairs

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.877
of the court chambers in The Hague,

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:13.479
slamming the Hague's decision

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.981
not to reject

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:15.815
South Africa's

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:16.883
petition outright

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:18.918
to allow this case to proceed.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:19.452
I think

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:21.020
now one of the real questions is to

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.222
what extent is Israel going to actually

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.590
abide by the terms

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.425
of this provisional

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.727
reading ruling and to what extent

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:30.063
will they actually compiled this report

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:33.499
that the court has demanded of Israel

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.535
within the next month?

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:36.903
I think it's clear

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:37.470
that Israel

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.137
has decided

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:40.773
to kind of play along with this court

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:43.309
up until now, has chosen

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:44.377
to defend itself

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:46.813
quite arduously in these proceedings.

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:50.149
But now as it relates to specific actions

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:51.050
on the ground,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.051
to what extent will

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:55.455
Israel actually move forward with those

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:57.156
to to another extent,

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:57.623
it's important

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:58.324
to note

00:05:58.324 --> 00:05:59.625
that this ruling obviously didn't

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:01.361
go as far as South Africa

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.429
wanted, as far as Israel feared

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.264
it would in terms of calling

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:07.233
for an outright cease fire in this war.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:08.801
That has not happened here.

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.837
And because of that, there's certainly

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:12.672
a significant sigh of relief

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:14.707
among senior Israeli officials

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:16.075
as they look at this ruling,

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:20.113
even though this court very much laid out

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:21.914
the disastrous humanitarian

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.950
conditions in Gaza, gave some

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:26.352
credence to

00:06:26.352 --> 00:06:27.253
the claims of

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:27.954
South Africa,

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.188
while it made clear that it wasn't

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:31.190
ruling on the merits of the case.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.825
It certainly can

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:34.560
continue to soil Israel's

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.362
international reputation,

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:38.431
but it doesn't go as far as calling

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:40.400
for an outright cessation of hostilities

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.701
which could have potentially

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.202
put Israel in the position

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:45.471
of defying a binding

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:48.307
ruling by this court.

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:49.442
All right.

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:50.510
We've got David McKenzie

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.644
in Johannesburg as well.

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:52.078
And David,

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.980
we also heard from

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.681
the minister of international relations

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:57.750
naledi, Pandor, outside

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.787
the court today and to Jeremy's points.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.388
Yes, the

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:02.655
you know,

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:03.890
the wording in terms

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.892
of the ceasing of fire

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:09.829
off of the the military action

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.232
right now wasn't in this

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:16.235
ruling by the ICJ.

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.370
But what naledi pandor,

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.771
interestingly, said

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:21.174
that if Israel is going to abide by

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.242
what was put out in court today,

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:26.045
that a cessation would have to occur

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:28.981
Well, I think

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.383
what's important here to note

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:33.753
is that this is a matter that isn't over.

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:36.122
As Jeremy mentioned,

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.356
Israel was required

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:39.125
to give a report in about a month

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.093
about how it is going

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:44.230
towards meeting those requests,

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.997
those binding

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:46.632
requests of the court

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:49.101
to avoid what the court says

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:51.604
may at some point amount to genocide

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:52.472
as it does

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.473
its investigation

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.709
into the horrible circumstances in Gaza.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.911
So from the South African perspective,

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:00.546
they will be hoping for the pressure

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:02.315
to be piled on

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:02.849
to try

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:03.349
and improve

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:05.351
the conditions of the people in Gaza.

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:06.752
It was very telling that

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:07.720
when someone asked

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.588
Naledi Pandor,

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:10.690
the Minister of International Relations

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:11.824
and cooperation

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:13.893
on the steps of the court, you know,

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:14.927
what does this say about South

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:15.761
Africa and Israel?

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:16.295
She said, well,

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:18.498
this is about the Palestinian people.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.732
And as you know, Elena,

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:20.867
the ruling party here

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.969
has had a long affinity

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.270
to the Palestinian cause

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.272
all the way back to and before

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:27.373
Nelson Mandela.

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:29.041
This is a consistent

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:29.909
policy stance

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.210
by the South African government.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.645
And they've put the money

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:33.813
where their mouth is, as it were.

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:35.481
She said they couldn't stand idly

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:37.650
by while these alleged

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.218
atrocities happened.

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:41.521
And now they are going to continue

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:43.422
this case in the months

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:45.224
and potentially years ahead.

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:46.325
I think an important thing

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:47.493
to note as well.

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:47.693
South

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:50.162
Africa says that it wants to pursue

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:51.631
this case also to try and

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:52.899
make a statement about

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.067
bodies like the U.N.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:58.271
Security Council not being effective in

00:08:58.271 --> 00:09:01.340
trying to push global cooperation.

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:01.908
They said

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:04.043
this venue may be a way to do it.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.778
Take a listen.

00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:09.815
The member states of the United Nations

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.785
must oversee the process and ensure

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:16.355
that we create a basis

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:19.025
for a global community

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:21.160
in which a resort to arms

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.196
is no longer easily a resort to abuse.

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:26.999
It's no longer easy and that more effort

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:27.733
is now

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:29.969
directed toward negotiation

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:33.039
and towards seeking peaceful means

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:35.641
of ending conflict.

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:38.377
She did allude to powerful

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:39.946
friends of Israel,

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:41.280
and you can read the US

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.649
and that to perhaps persuade

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:43.950
Israel

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.850
behind the scenes

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.386
to change how they are configured

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:48.955
pursuing this war

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:49.822
against Hamas

00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:50.756
in the coming weeks

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:52.592
to avoid possible censure

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.093
in the coming months from this court.

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:56.262
Of course, Israel has repeatedly denied

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:58.831
that it is doing anything

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.600
in the theater of war.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.167
In fact,

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:02.702
they've said that they have tried

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:04.403
to protect civilians

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:06.172
and provide humanitarian aid.

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:07.373
It will be

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:08.708
really important to see

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:10.843
whether the behavior of Israel

00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:12.612
or the sense of how

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:13.279
they are

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.548
working towards these judgments

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:17.283
or at least rulings by the court

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.684
play out in the coming days.
