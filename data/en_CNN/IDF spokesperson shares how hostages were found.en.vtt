00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.875
Israelis are

00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:01.751
on the streets

00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:03.336
protesting, demanding

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:04.921
a cease fire agreement

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:06.131
after defense officials

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:08.383
said they recovered the bodies of six

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:11.469
Israeli hostages murdered by Hamas,

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.763
including Israeli-American Hirsh

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:16.850
Goldberg, Poland, who was 23 years old.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.518
An IDF spokesman said

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:21.187
Hamas brutally killed the six

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.188
young adults

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.356
in an underground tunnel

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:24.315
near Rafah,

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:25.525
a short time before

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.152
Israeli forces arrived.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:29.029
Three of them would have been released

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.613
in the early stages

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:31.865
of a ceasefire agreement,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.659
two Israeli officials told CNN.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:35.201
An agreement,

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.703
President Biden said last night

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.496
was on the verge of happening,

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:38.955
while Vice

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:40.707
President Harris released a statement

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.000
that reads, in part,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.460
the threat Hamas poses

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.045
to the people of Israel

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.380
and American citizens in Israel

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.631
must be eliminated

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.426
and Hamas cannot control Gaza.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.803
The Palestinian people, too,

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:55.180
have suffered under Hamas

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.890
rule for nearly two decades.

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.850
Here with me

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.435
now is IDF spokesman

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.604
Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshana.

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:04.105
Thank you so much for being here.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:07.108
We are so incredibly devastated.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.611
for for Israel,

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:12.614
for all of the families.

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:15.658
it's just hard to even imagine

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.702
how much pain everybody is in.

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:20.163
And as a spokesperson for the IDF,

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:22.123
I'd like for you to explain

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:24.042
exactly what happened

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:27.045
when these six bodies

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:30.048
were found.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:31.883
Thank you.

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:32.967
Thank you for having me.

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.552
This is,

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:37.263
a very sad morning in Israel.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:37.972
Very sad news

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:40.725
coming out of the Gaza Strip. And,

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:41.726
announcing today

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:42.685
after we were able

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:43.812
to talk to the families

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:45.647
and inform them about

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:48.108
finding the bodies of their loved ones.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.359
these were six people

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.028
that were taken on October 7th, and,

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.655
in our operations in Lofa,

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:56.658
in an underground tunnel.

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:57.700
We found their bodies,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.451
and we thought

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.286
we brought them back to Israel.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.538
We examined them,

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:03.373
and we found that they were,

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:06.376
murdered by Hamas recently.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.088
and we were able to inform the families

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:10.547
about it

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.132
and share the news

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:12.757
today, the very,

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:14.342
very sad news about them.

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:17.303
And and just to be clear, just because

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:18.763
we're obviously,

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:21.307
trying to get information about exactly

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:25.770
how this this happened were, IDF soldiers

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:30.275
actually looking for these six hostages,

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:31.693
or did they find them

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:34.237
as part of a separate,

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:37.240
mission?

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:38.158
But we

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.659
we have been operating above

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.827
and underground in that area,

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.872
combating terrorists and, searching

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:44.831
in the underground tunnels,

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.250
as we've done in recent weeks in Lofa.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.253
And this is an area, I remind you, it's,

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:51.296
less than a mile

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:53.631
from where we found off on the,

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:54.966
the hostage that we were able

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.801
to rescue alive a few days ago.

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.970
So there was some idea of hostages

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:59.679
being in the area,

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.890
but this was not a specific mission

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.974
to release hostages.

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:03.766
But,

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:05.435
part of our ordinary,

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.561
combat missions against

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:07.896
Hamas above an underground.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.065
So you said that you

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:14.068
believe that they were murdered recently?

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.738
can you be more specific

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:19.741
about how recently?

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:22.493
Well, we are still, examining

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:23.203
the information

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.621
also operationally in the tunnel

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:27.415
and also examining the bodies.

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:28.374
and this is a process

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.250
that might take a while,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.877
and we are personally obligated

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.504
to inform the families.

00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:35.006
and then we'll have the information

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:35.465
more public.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.259
But according to our initial,

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.094
inquiry of the situation,

00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:41.554
they were murdered recently

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:42.889
by Hamas terrorists.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.058
They were taken alive from Israel.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.185
They were, living in horrible conditions

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:48.603
for almost a month.

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:49.479
And recently,

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.188
they were murdered

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.982
by the terror organization.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.985
and we were able to find them, yesterday.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.321
do you have any idea?

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.073
And I realize this is early

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.241
and obviously,

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.284
understandably, very delicate. Delicate.

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:06.496
But do you have any idea, based on,

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.666
when and where,

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.251
these, individuals

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:14.254
and their bodies were found that

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.383
they were murdered.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.510
After hearing or sensing

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.513
that the IDF was close by.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.182
Well, I

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:27.141
we will be able to put

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:27.976
that information later,

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.686
but I think that that's not the question.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.771
Hamas is a terrorist organization

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.022
that came to Israel,

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:34.482
murdered thousands of people

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.109
and abducted these

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:36.943
innocent civilian

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.112
young people from a party,

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.446
and and they murdered them.

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:41.281
And that is

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.657
because they're a terrorist organization.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:43.783
And I think

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:44.325
I would

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.368
I would not be the one

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:46.661
looking for reasons from us

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.870
for why this this. No.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.871
The terror organization

00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:50.039
killing innocent civilians.

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.042
One of them, an American civilian.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:53.876
you all know of

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:55.920
that was was killed brutally. Yeah.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.213
I yeah.

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.674
And I just want to make no mistake

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:00.258
about this.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.385
Hamas is a terror organization,

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:05.346
and they are the ones, to blame for this.

00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:06.472
I guess the reason I was

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.099
asking that question is

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.476
whether or not

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.395
they were close to being rescued.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:15.398
That was the basis for my question.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.482
Right.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.984
We're we're operating

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.902
and we have a moral obligation

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:21.863
and an operational priority

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:24.157
to bring home their two 101 hostages.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.992
And we are working to bring them home

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.244
as we have been able to bring,

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:29.829
a few home one. Right.

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.122
just last week.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.248
And we're operating for that

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:33.916
and that that was part of our operation

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:34.876
in that area.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.085
Hoping to find hostages.

00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:39.005
And sadly, we found them.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:39.922
we found bodies,

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:41.716
but we're still operating in

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:42.842
all parts of Gaza,

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.260
hoping to find hostages.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.762
There are still many hostages alive.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:46.512
And that's why

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:47.180
it's important for us

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.973
to continue this pressure

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.601
and to try and bring them home alive.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.436
Lieutenant Colonel Shoshana,

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:54.937
thank you so much for being here.

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:56.105
And again, we are

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.066
just devastated

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:01.069
by the news.

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.280
Thank you.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.865
My next guest spoke

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:08.076
forcefully at the Republican convention

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:08.826
in July,

00:06:08.826 --> 00:06:10.370
leading the crowd in chants

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.913
of bring them home!

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:12.747
Here with me now

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.165
are Ronen and Orna

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:15.792
Neutra, the parents of Israeli

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.877
American citizen Omar Neutra

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.505
held hostage by Hamas.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.048
Thank you so much for being here

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.550
this morning.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.096
particularly given the fact that I know

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:29.222
how close you are

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.723
to all of the hostage families,

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.350
but particularly,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.561
the the Goldberg pollens, the two.

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:38.314
Hirsh and Omar, almost the same age.

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:40.400
Omar is

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.860
going to turn 23 next month,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.529
and I can't imagine how difficult

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:45.988
it must be

00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:49.117
to watch this news, knowing that

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:52.370
your beautiful son is still in captivity.

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:56.416
It's absolutely right, Dana.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.042
There are no words for us, really,

00:06:58.042 --> 00:07:00.670
to comfort all the families.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.923
But specifically, we've become very close

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.174
with the Goldberg pollens.

00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:06.342
They're like our family.

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:07.802
We've traveled the world with.

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:10.680
We've met together with leaders,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.348
and we're completely devastated

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:13.766
by this news.

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:15.601
You know, we were holding on to this

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.019
vision that,

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:18.729
Omer and Hirsch are together,

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.356
that they would come out together.

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:23.109
And it's just completely devastating

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:26.696
and a stark reminder to the conditions

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:28.531
that these hostages are being held

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.199
in, that this is a terrorist group

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.492
that is holding on to them,

00:07:31.492 --> 00:07:32.743
and that

00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:34.245
things have to work much

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:35.746
faster for them to come out.

00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:38.249
Well, on that,

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:38.958
Prime Minister

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.836
Netanyahu said he is personally committed

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:43.212
to achieving a deal

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:45.339
to free the remaining hostages.

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:48.342
What is your message to him right now?

00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:53.764
You know, Dana, we we

00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:56.058
we are just hoping

00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:58.352
that he's doing everything he can.

00:07:58.352 --> 00:07:59.896
the situation is dire.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.147
It's urgent.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:01.814
We've seen him

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.733
putting all kind of hurdles.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:04.901
We know the Israeli

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:07.153
people are going out in large numbers

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.196
and calling the government

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:08.696
to do

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:10.531
what their job is,

00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:12.033
to bring the hostages home.

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:15.036
101 hostage is left.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.913
And, dying there.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.248
And every day is huge

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:20.583
risk for each one of them.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:23.586
So we we urge him to do what

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:26.589
is tasked to do, in Israel.

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:29.467
but just as well,

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.344
we are calling on our leaders here

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.429
in United States

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.015
to do what they want us to do.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.266
We are calling on President

00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:38.518
Biden, on Vice

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.394
President Harris

00:08:40.394 --> 00:08:42.396
to do everything in their power

00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:43.564
to reach a deal

00:08:43.564 --> 00:08:45.983
and bring the hostages back.

00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:46.651
We were

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.819
warning about that kind of situation.

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:51.113
It's such a risky time

00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:53.115
for all those hostages.

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:55.451
I mean, Hirsch managed to survive

00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:57.370
11 months in captivity.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.163
He lost his arm.

00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:00.748
And after all of this,

00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:02.458
to be killed a few days,

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:03.876
maybe before a deal.

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:06.420
Yeah, it's it's really devastating.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.672
Really is.

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.048
Of course it is.

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:09.799
Or not.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:13.010
Finally, you say a verse from Psalm 23

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:13.511
every day,

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:14.428
the Psalm of David,

00:09:14.428 --> 00:09:16.013
to send your son protection.

00:09:16.013 --> 00:09:18.933
Can you share what you say

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:19.934
before we let you go?

00:09:23.604 --> 00:09:24.105
You know,

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:27.108
I, I not only say the Psalm, you know,

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:29.443
I pray for my son every single day.

00:09:29.443 --> 00:09:30.987
I pray for the hostages,

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:33.155
as did Rachel Goldberg.

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:34.156
You know, we

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:36.659
we feel that we're doing our share.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.035
You know, and and

00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:40.663
and praying and advocating

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.039
and speaking up for them.

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:43.583
It's time for the leaders

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.668
to get this done and get them out.

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.545
Enough is enough.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:47.920
You know,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.504
the families

00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:50.798
have been warning about this.

00:09:50.798 --> 00:09:53.050
The writing was on the wall,

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.218
and this negotiation

00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:56.345
has been taking way too long.

00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:57.430
They need to come out.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.347
The leaders need to do

00:09:58.347 --> 00:09:59.932
whatever needs to be done for them

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.517
to come out.

00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:01.934
Yeah.

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.686
And did I want to remind you,

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.897
four American living hostages

00:10:06.897 --> 00:10:07.982
still in captivity.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.692
And I want to say their name real quick.

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.152
And and Alexander Skyler

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:14.322
Callahan, our son, Omer Neutra and Keith

00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:17.658
Segal, who was, 64 year old.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:19.577
We got to bring them home.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:20.953
The American administration

00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:22.038
need to come up with a plan

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.040
to bring their own American home

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.750
and the rest of the hostages,

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.460
and, of course, the deceased hostages.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.169
And, of course,

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.254
bring the three deceased hostages.

00:10:30.254 --> 00:10:32.423
Daddy, Judy and Italian.

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:33.883
It's a must.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.384
I hear the desperation

00:10:35.384 --> 00:10:37.178
and the pain in your voice.

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:38.471
And,

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:39.472
what we hear, I'm

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.432
sure, only pales in comparison

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:43.392
to how you feel in your hearts.

00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:46.896
331 is on your stickers, on your

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:47.563
on your shirts.

00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:48.856
That is the number of days

00:10:48.856 --> 00:10:51.859
your beautiful son has been, in captivity

00:10:51.859 --> 00:10:52.777
with others.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.403
Thank you so much for on this

00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:56.489
very difficult day coming on

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.157
and continuing to press

00:10:58.157 --> 00:10:59.825
the way you have been so heroically

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:02.036
for so many months. I appreciate it.
