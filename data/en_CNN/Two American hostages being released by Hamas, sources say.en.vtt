00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.034
We do want to bring you some

00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.602
breaking news, though, right now.

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:05.071
CNN's Alex Marquardt has that for us.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.774
Alex, this has to do with the hostages

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.876
that were being held in Gaza by Hamas.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.544
Yeah, Boris and Brown,

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.112
who understand

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.581
that two of the American hostages

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.415
who have been held

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:17.283
by Hamas are on their way

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:18.918
out of the Gaza Strip.

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.487
We've just learned this

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.121
from a person

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.123
who is familiar with the discussions,

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.524
as well as a diplomatic source

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.592
who has spoken to my colleague,

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.060
Kaitlan Collins.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.461
As we know from the Israelis,

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.295
there have been around

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.831
200 hostages who have been held

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.467
by that militant group, by Hamas

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.002
since the horrific attacks inside

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.371
Israel on October 7th.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.072
What we understand

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.073
from these two sources

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.341
is that the two Americans

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.576
are a mother and a daughter.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.712
They are currently, we're told,

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.580
with the Red Cross

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.016
and heading south in the Gaza Strip.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:53.019
There are two crossings in southern Gaza,

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.422
one that goes into Egypt,

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:56.656
the other that goes into Israel.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.257
So right now,

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.292
we're not sure about which country

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.561
they will be going into.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.830
We're also unclear on the identities

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.199
of this mother and child, but we are told

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.435
that they are being released

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.070
on humanitarian grounds.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.805
That's according to a source

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:12.505
that I spoke with,

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.408
because the mother is not in good health.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.609
Now, of course, and Brianna,

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.312
this has also been announced by Hamas.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:20.747
A spokesman

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:21.781
for the militant group

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:24.150
said that the mother and daughter

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.218
are also being released,

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:27.120
they say, on humanitarian grounds, but

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.756
also because they want to

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.693
contest the claims being made by Biden

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:34.594
and what they call

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.963
his fascist administration,

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.832
because there are false and baseless.

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:39.833
So we have this

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.302
mother and daughter, American citizens,

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.704
who have been held by Hamas

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.372
for much of the past two weeks.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:47.440
Now, we understand

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.808
with the Red Cross on their way

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:51.010
out of Gaza, guys.

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.413
And Alex, to clarify quickly

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.848
the next steps.

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:55.982
Is it clear

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:58.051
exactly where they're headed next?

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.253
Is it going to be Egypt or Israel?

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.522
What do we know now? There are two.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.390
There are two crossings, two gates

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.859
in the southern part of Gaza,

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.060
one called Kerem Shalom,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.995
which is between Gaza and Israel.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:09.762
The other one, Rafah,

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:10.830
which we've been talking about

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.398
so much because of

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:13.533
the question about aid.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:14.801
And that is where the aid

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.836
would go from Egypt into Gaza.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:20.306
So right now, it is not clear for us.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:22.775
Certainly they were abducted in Israel.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.277
We know that.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:25.712
So there is, of course,

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:26.479
a good chance

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.780
that they could be then

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.883
taken back into Israel.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.918
But at the same time,

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.486
it may just be easier

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.455
for whatever reason, logistics,

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:36.923
operational security, to

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.858
to have them go into Egypt.

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:39.626
But I think

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.027
one of the important points is now

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:43.796
they're there with an independent party

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.332
there with the Red Cross, the Red Cross,

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.834
And so that is the best news.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.369
They are no longer.

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.504
We understand, in Hamas custody,

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.840
although, of course, Hamas does control

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.108
the entire Gaza Strip.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.310
So this is not a done deal.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.645
Things are still

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.413
obviously extremely fluid.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:03.783
But here we have both our sources outside

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.320
of Gaza as well as Hamas themselves

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.322
saying that these two Americans

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.657
are being released.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:11.224
All right, Alex,

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.659
I want to bring in Kaitlan Collins,

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.127
who is in Tel Aviv.

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.462
The two of you reported this story out.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:17.630
Kaitlyn, is there anything

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.631
and I don't even know

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:19.566
if there's an answer to this

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:20.066
at this point,

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:20.767
but can we read

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:23.069
into anything at this point

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.138
if the they're being released

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:27.473
because the mother is in poor health.

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.409
Could this be an acknowledgment

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.211
on the part of Hamas

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.547
that they need to perhaps release people

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.482
who are not doing well,

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.650
that they want people

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.252
who maybe are in good health

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:40.119
if they are going to be

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.590
using them as pawns as they perhaps later

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.058
try to utilize them in

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.726
some kind of prisoner exchange?

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.528
Can we read into anything at this point?

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.932
I think a lot of that remains to be seen.

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.300
I mean, this was a big question.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.668
Once Hamas had captured

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.437
so many of these hostages

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:59.138
and taken the boat into Gaza

00:03:59.138 --> 00:03:59.706
after that

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:00.873
October 7th attack,

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:01.241
that was a

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:01.741
question

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.710
was if they are going to try to use them,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.044
as we had seen in the past

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:08.381
when Hamas had kidnaped an IDF officer,

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:10.750
that there was a lot of negotiation

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.884
over, that it took years.

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:13.953
And in the end, Israel released,

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:15.321
I believe there's about a thousand

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.557
Palestinian prisoners in exchange

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:19.025
for that Israeli officer.

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.661
And so that was kind of the basis

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:22.462
that people were looking

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:24.597
at these hostages and the questions over

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:25.632
what would happen here.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:26.933
And we've heard Israeli officials

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.402
say they were not negotiating with Hamas

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.471
for an exchange for the hostages.

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.673
But this news is incredibly significant.

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:35.074
I mean, these hostages, of course,

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:36.509
there's been an open question

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:37.710
of what their fate would be,

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.544
what would happen,

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:40.313
especially as we are waiting to see

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:42.448
that ground incursion potentially happen.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:43.316
And I can just tell you,

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:44.350
we have not heard anything

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.752
from the prime minister's office

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.453
here in Tel Aviv tonight

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.022
on the release of these two

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:49.989
American hostages

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:52.058
that Alex and I have reporting on.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.192
They have not confirmed it.

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:55.061
We are waiting to see what they say

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:55.561
about this.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:56.462
We also have not heard

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:57.163
from the White House

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:58.364
on this front either.

00:04:58.364 --> 00:04:59.132
But I just want to tell you,

00:04:59.132 --> 00:04:59.766
this is something

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:00.800
that is still

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.335
every single day here

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:03.870
in Tel Aviv, everywhere in Israel.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.937
This is something that everyone's

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:05.905
talking about.

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:06.806
Of course, Shabbat

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.875
happens on Friday evenings.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.243
This is when everyone, their family,

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:11.311
their friends get together

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.579
and have a dinner in the Jewish faith.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.514
And earlier,

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:15.982
we went to this

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:16.983
this ceremony

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.284
for all of these families

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:19.252
of these hostages.

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:20.186
And they had this

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:21.587
incredibly long dining

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:23.222
table set up with a seat

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.991
for every person who is believed

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.093
to have been taken hostage by Hamas

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:27.994
and therefore will not be

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.029
with their families for Shabbat dinner.

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.430
And it was an

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.998
incredibly emotional moment.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:32.965
And so

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:34.834
just this news in and of itself

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.202
that two of them

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:37.136
have been released,

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.838
that they are alive

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.740
is something that is going to be helpful

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.541
to these families

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.109
who are waiting for any piece,

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:44.644
any scrap of information

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.112
about their loved ones.

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:47.714
And so, of course, the question remains

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:49.449
what happens to the other hostages?

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.451
What does that look like going forward?

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.386
I think there are still so many questions

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:55.388
for these two American hostages

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:56.389
that are being released,

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.390
including where

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.524
they are going to be released

00:05:58.524 --> 00:05:59.926
and to whether that's Egypt,

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:01.594
whether that's here into Israel.

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:02.962
Those are still big questions

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:04.697
and we're still waiting for details

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:05.798
over what that looks like.

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:06.466
And also, Brianna,

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.000
as you mentioned, what it could mean

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.701
for the others

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.536
and how Hamas plans to use them.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:11.104
One other thing

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:11.804
I will say that

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.106
we talked about last night

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.507
and this was in an interview

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:15.742
with The New York Times,

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.176
a Hamas leader said that

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.511
they are not even in control

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:19.812
over all the hostages,

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:21.314
that there are other terrorist groups,

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:22.582
obviously, in Gaza,

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:24.417
and they did not have full control

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:24.884
over them.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:25.351
Obviously,

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:26.786
something that would complicate

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:28.121
getting the release of these other

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:30.757
hostages. Caitlin, please stand by.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.624
We want to bring in

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:32.425
Jim Sciutto now

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:32.792
because, Jim,

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.260
you just spoke to a long time

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.528
hostage representative.

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:36.763
That's what I spoke to. Jonathan Frank.

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.765
So sure you've spoken with him before.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:39.365
He's been involved.

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:39.832
For instance,

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:40.967
the release of the American travel

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:41.968
read from Russia

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:44.237
also worked on the trafficking case

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.838
in North Korea.

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:46.305
And I asked him

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:48.107
what in his experience,

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:50.109
a release like this might indicate.

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:50.476
He said,

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:51.978
given the number of hostages

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:53.980
that Hamas is holding to release to

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.047
could be an attempt

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:57.150
just to relieve the pressure somewhat.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.618
I mean, you're in the midst of it,

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:00.186
a quite aggressive,

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.220
devastating Israeli

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.722
air campaign threat of a ground

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.524
offensive, demands

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:06.592
for humanitarian supplies

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:07.860
to relieve the pressure.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.862
Does not necessarily portend

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.130
that all the hostages

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.765
are going to be freed quickly.

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:13.733
He makes the point

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:16.302
and Caitlin made this point as well,

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:17.770
that in previous hostage

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.071
exchanges with Hamas,

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.673
they've demanded a great deal

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:22.108
in return, particularly

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.276
when it involves a soldier,

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:23.943
friends, for instance,

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.179
Gilad Shalit, a thousand

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.147
Palestinian prisoners were released.

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:30.016
So so it may be, as you look at this,

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:31.350
that you have different

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.518
kinds of hostages.

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:33.820
Here's a mother and daughter,

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.555
apparently that the mother in ill health.

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:37.056
They can

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:38.024
make the case that

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:40.193
this is more of a humanitarian case

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:40.893
for soldiers.

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:42.328
They might deal differently

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:44.197
for men of military age.

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:45.164
They might be

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:46.098
They might deal different

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:47.633
differently as well.

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:48.901
But again,

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:50.703
Hamas is a group that takes hostages.

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:52.338
Hamas is a group that kills civilians.

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:54.173
We don't need more evidence of that.

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:55.842
A decision like this does not mean

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:57.176
Hamas has changed.

00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:59.312
It means that it sees something

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.980
it wants something in return

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.514
or it sees

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:02.849
this as being in their advantage.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.417
And perhaps there was some pressure

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.018
applied from outside as well.

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:07.420
And Alex, I understand

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.888
you have some information

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:11.457
about how this negotiation went down.

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:13.426
Well, Jim is absolutely right

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:14.293
in terms of the pressure

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:15.428
being applied from outside.

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:16.596
Hamas is considered

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:18.564
a terrorist organization, of course, by

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:19.398
not just Israel,

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:20.600
but the United States as well.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.901
And that means that those two countries

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:24.570
don't have a direct dialog with Hamas.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.571
So in this situation

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:26.405
and this has been the case

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:27.840
for much of the past two weeks

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.942
since these 200 or so people were taken,

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.011
is that it was primarily Qatar

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.447
that was engaging with Hamas

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.616
They are the main conduit for

00:08:37.617 --> 00:08:38.551
Israel in the U.S.

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:40.520
to talk to that militant group,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.821
which has

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:43.389
several Hamas leaders

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:45.358
who live in their capital in Doha.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.859
So this really has

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:48.528
been the portfolio that the U.S.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:51.097
has asked Qatar to undertake

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:52.431
when Secretary

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:53.766
Anthony Blinken was crisscrossing

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:54.166
the region,

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:54.834
going to all these

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:56.435
different Middle Eastern countries.

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:58.471
He very quickly went to Qatar,

00:08:58.471 --> 00:08:59.572
and that was because

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:01.674
they have this direct line into Hamas.

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:02.542
And so

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:04.110
here this is

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.177
both according to the sources

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:06.145
that we have spoken with,

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:07.947
but also Hamas themselves,

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:10.182
the result of this negotiation

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:13.419
between Hamas and Qatar.

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:16.055
But no doubt the presence of these

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.189
still around

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:19.325
200 hostages who will still be

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:23.296
in the custody of Hamas and other groups

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:23.896
we understand,

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:25.031
or subgroups

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:26.332
all across the Gaza Strip

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:27.700
that is going to

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:30.036
wildly complicate the efforts

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:30.736
of the Israeli

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:31.771
military, who, of course,

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:32.204
we believe

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:35.007
are going to go into Gaza on the ground

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:35.775
any day now.

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:36.842
We've been talking about this

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:38.477
sprawling network of tunnels

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:39.645
throughout the Gaza Strip.

00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:41.280
We understand that the hostages

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.315
may be in those tunnels,

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:43.616
maybe in the bunkers.

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:45.084
And so as Israel goes in

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:47.119
to try to decapitate the Hamas

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.422
military and political leadership,

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.289
not only are they

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:51.991
trying to minimize the civilian death

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:53.259
toll on the Palestinian side,

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.161
but they're obviously trying to

00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:56.829
make sure that that nothing happens

00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:57.563
to these hostages

00:09:57.563 --> 00:09:59.098
and try to get them out.

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.733
So while Israel is saying

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:01.901
that they're not going to be negotiating

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:02.868
with Hamas,

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:05.404
over these hostages, this effort by Qatar

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.106
will be ongoing to try

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:08.107
to get more than just these

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:08.975
two Americans out.
