00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.734
We're seeing the U.S.

00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:02.369
Secretary of state, Anthony Blinken,

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:03.937
meeting with the Israeli

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:04.738
defense minister.

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:07.841
Let's listen to hear if they say anything

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:09.209
Mr.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:11.478
Secretary, thank you for coming.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.312
Mr..

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.014
We always know

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:17.050
new that the United States is a good deal

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.286
but today the people in Israel

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:22.022
and in the world

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.391
see it in their own eyes.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.793
You are here for the second time

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.128
in this week.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.062
Senior

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.331
officials of America are here every day.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.099
And

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.236
no American flag is

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.737
on.

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:40.040
There is sailing on board

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.441
in the Mediterranean.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.810
And we know what is the meaning.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.446
So let me tell you, Mr.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.881
Secretary,

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.917
this will be a long walk.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.953
The price will be high,

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.257
but we are going to win

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:00.527
for Israel, for the Jewish people,

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.797
and for the values

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.032
that both countries believe in.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.168
With your permission,

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.070
you will join Hebrew. Please

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:14.908
enough.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.310
Normal. Now, think of it.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:18.878
The most common denominator

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.848
echoed by farmer Shinya Yamanaka

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:22.982
Work walk

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.719
the second day in the dusty dish.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.821
This man was me.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:29.189
That's the Israeli defense minister

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:29.756
you have got.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.524
He is speaking in Hebrew now

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:32.559
after he greeted

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.960
the US Secretary of State,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.861
Antony Blinken.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.530
They are in Tel Aviv right now

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.032
where they have been meeting.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:42.669
This is Blinken's second time in Israel

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:43.636
in just a few days.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:44.737
He left Israel

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:45.672
and then did this

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.574
whirlwind diplomatic mission

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.043
to many countries in the region.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:52.345
But now back in Tel Aviv,

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:53.446
you have got

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:53.847
the defense

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:56.049
minister also mentioned the

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.517
US military presence

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:58.718
not far off the coast.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:01:59.853
There is already one

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:02.288
carrier group, the USS Gerald Ford,

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.590
and now a second

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.025
carrier group, the US, Dwight Eisenhower,

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.962
will be headed to that region.

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.830
I'm talking here

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.332
until they start speaking English.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:12.932
Let's listen again.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.268
You know, our

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.237
deep commitment

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.973
to Israel's right

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.642
and indeed its obligation

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.210
to defend itself

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.012
and to defend its people.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:29.082
And in that you have

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:29.549
always had

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.885
the support of the United States.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:32.619
Thank you.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.487
Thank you very much, sir.

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:36.156
Mr.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.625
Secretary, word

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:39.826
All right.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.261
All business

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:41.928
from the US

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:42.562
Secretary of State

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.097
Antony Blinken, meeting with the Israeli

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.798
Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant.

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.300
Did not take questions,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.601
did not say much of anything.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.702
Other than the U.S.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:53.673
is firmly behind Israel as it prepares

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.875
seemingly for a ground operation

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.844
into Gaza.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.013
Let's get straight to Israel, where CNN's

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:01.381
Nic Robertson is.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:02.682
Nic, what is the latest

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.084
on the ground at this hour?

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.955
It's been a relatively quiet day

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:11.324
in terms of rocket strikes,

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:14.160
missiles, artillery going into Gaza

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.261
and not many missiles

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:17.330
coming out of Gaza either.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.232
It creates the impression

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.267
that they're not a pause,

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.368
but at least

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.469
ammunition in the

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.572
in the amount of military activity

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:26.739
to perhaps

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.874
give some space

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.909
to some of the political discussions.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:31.110
I said that

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.213
and you heard the explosion behind me.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:33.713
Yes.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:35.048
The afternoon has become

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.783
increasingly punctuated

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:38.151
by heavy explosions.

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.019
That does sound like

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.789
a missile strike landing on Gaza there.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:45.391
And perhaps as we go into darkness,

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:46.993
I think we're beginning to see

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:48.161
perhaps a little

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.762
uptick in the tempo here.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:50.530
This is

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.631
northern Gaza

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:52.398
right behind me

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:54.334
that we know that in northern Gaza

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.468
late today,

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:56.402
the IDF said that

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.705
they hit a Hamas commander

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.707
appearing to destroy a building,

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:03.209
taking him out, if you will.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.677
And along this border area,

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.980
we're seeing that continued buildup

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.482
and preparations among the IDF

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:12.018
in readiness for the possibility

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:13.152
of a ground incursion.

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:14.520
Now, I don't know how this may affect

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.888
the military operations,

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:17.790
but there was a very, very heavy

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.993
rainstorm passed through here

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:21.160
earlier today.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.029
But from a UN

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:24.731
and humanitarian perspective,

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.866
inside Gaza, rainstorms

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.501
are the last thing they need.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:29.936
Half a million people

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.005
understood to have left northern Gaza.

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:34.073
There isn't enough shelter for them

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:35.041
in the south of Gaza.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.243
Isn't enough food, isn't enough water.

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:39.012
So real concerns

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:41.281
if the weather does deteriorate more

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.749
and this more rainstorms,

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.685
a lot of civilians inside Gaza

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:47.587
not only trying to dodge missiles,

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.055
but will also be caught out in

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.957
some atrocious conditions.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:52.358
Just a

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:54.260
absolutely terrible situation

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.495
and of course, as soon as you say

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:56.296
that it's been quiet,

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.263
we heard

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.731
the airstrikes behind you

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.500
as darkness has fallen

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.001
where you are on the border, near

00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:04.704
the border between Israel and Gaza.

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:06.539
Thank you so much for that report, Nic.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.441
And I want to now go to Jerusalem

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:10.143
and CNN's Jeremy Diamond.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:10.610
Jeremy,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.911
I know you have been following

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:12.211
and doing

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.246
reporting on what

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:14.814
the secretary of state,

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.949
Antony Blinken, has been doing,

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.085
not just in Israel where you are.

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.053
He is now back,

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:23.589
but also the frantic shuttle diplomacy.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.792
He has been engaged in across the region

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:28.361
Yeah.

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.696
Then between Secretary of State

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:31.130
Tony Blinken's visit to Israel

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.764
last week

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:32.899
and his visit today,

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:34.867
he visited about a half dozen

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:37.170
Arab countries in the region, countries

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.071
ranging from Saudi

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:41.007
Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, Egypt,

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:43.176
Qatar, etc.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.243
And all of this

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:46.145
in a shuttle diplomacy

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:48.381
effort focused on several key lines,

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:49.449
the first of which

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.017
is the humanitarian situation

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.051
inside of Gaza,

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:54.120
trying to get the flow of aid

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.622
back into to Gaza

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.925
as well as allowing Americans

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.393
to be able to leave

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:01.127
through the Rafah

00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:04.230
crossing and go into Egypt.

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:06.199
In addition to that,

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.800
the secretary of state also focused on

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.435
trying to prevent this Hamas

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:10.403
Israel conflict

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:13.072
from blowing up into a wider war.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:13.806
And then, of course,

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:16.709
there is the issue of those 199 hostages

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.511
being held inside of Gaza,

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:18.911
of which

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:20.113
at least 20 of whom

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:22.215
are believed to be American citizens.

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:22.949
Now, we know that

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.617
the secretary of state today

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:25.385
met with the Israeli

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.120
Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.355
as well as the Israeli presidents

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:30.423
and the defense minister.

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:32.291
We just saw the secretary of state

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:33.459
with the defense minister,

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:34.694
where Blinken

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:36.162
effectively reiterated

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:37.163
the US commitment

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:39.031
to the state of Israel to its right.

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:41.334
And what he said is also its obligation

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:42.635
to defend itself.

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:44.203
But one thing became very clear

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:45.505
in this visit today

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:46.773
is that while Blinken

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:47.707
is trying to address

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:49.142
the humanitarian situation,

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:50.676
trying to prevent this war

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:53.179
from becoming a regional situation,

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:55.848
he is not there to prevent war

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:57.450
from a growing bigger

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.085
between Israel and Hamas.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:06:59.986
And that was evidenced

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:01.721
when you heard the Israeli defense

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:03.122
minister, Galen's,

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:05.191
saying that this will be a long war

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:07.293
and also warning that the price

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:09.061
for Israel to defend itself

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:11.130
will indeed be high.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.166
There is no sign as of yet that the U.S.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:14.133
is backing off

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:14.700
from this kind

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.736
of no daylight position with Israel.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:17.937
They are fully supporting

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.605
Israel in its plans

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:20.373
to widen

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:22.875
this military campaign against Hamas.

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:24.343
What they are trying to do

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:25.344
is to get Americans

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:26.546
out of the Gaza Strip

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.647
to get humanitarian

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:29.682
aid into the Gaza Strip,

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:30.917
and also ideally

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:32.385
to try and find some way

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:34.287
of getting those American hostages

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.389
who are in Gaza out of there.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.457
And out of harm's way.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:38.591
Dana, Jeremy,

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.460
thank you so much for that reporting.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.527
And today,

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:44.730
a site the world has been waiting to see.

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:46.899
CNN spotted five U.N.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:48.701
fuel trucks entered Gaza.

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:50.303
It is the first sign

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:51.637
that the Rafah crossing,

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:54.006
the one between Gaza and Egypt,

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:56.008
is even partially open.

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:56.843
But this is important.

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.644
It remains closed to people,

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.013
desperate Palestinian civilians trapped

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.048
in a war zone

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:05.852
As the Egyptians,

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:06.185
they have

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:07.653
to be willing to have that gate open

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:10.122
and have a flow of human traffic

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:11.524
get through that.

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:13.493
And so we're in discussions with them

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.994
about what that could look like

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.362
and how that can be managed in a way

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:17.997
that that protects

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.365
Egypt's national security

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:20.066
interests as well.
