BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE A  PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, THERE  NEEDS TO BE A PATH TO A  PALESTINIAN STATE. &gt;&gt; I WONDER WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO HEZBOLLAH AND ITS BACKER  IRAN. &gt;&gt; DON'T. DON'T, DON'T, DON'T. &gt;&gt; DON'T COME ACROSS THE BORDER, DON'T ESCALATE THE WAR. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; CHRISTIAN AMANPOUR IS LIVE IN LONDON WITH MORE. AND OBVIOUSLY THEY TRY TO DO  WITH WORDS EVERYTHING THEY CAN  TO AVOID A LARGER WAR. BUT NONETHELESS BIDEN SAYING  THAT WHILE HAMAS MUST BE  ELIMINATED, REOCCUPYING GAZA  WOULD BE A MISTAKE. HOW DO YOU READ BETWEEN THE  LINES HERE OF WHAT HE IS SAYING  BUT MOST IMPORTANT WHAT ISRAEL  AND ITS ENEMIES ARE HEARING? &gt;&gt; THERE AREN'T ANY LINES TO  READ. WE DON'T KNOW AND NOR DID THE  ISRAELIS OR AMERICANS KNOW WHAT  THE FINAL END GAME IS. WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU DESTROY  AND D DEC DECEMBER A MATE HAMAS. WHAT IS THE FINAL END GAME. WIDER WAR THAT THE UNITED STATES IS TRYING TO HEAD OFFA MATE HAM. IS TRYING TO HEAD OFF WITH THE  SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY, THAT IS ALSO  A REAL PROBLEM. WHAT HAPPENS. HE SAID DON'T WHEN ASKED ABOUT  HAMAS -- RATHER HEZBOLLAH AND  IRAN'S FOREIGN MINISTER MEETING  WITH HAMAS, HAVING BEEN ALSO TO  MEET WITH HEZBOLLAH, HAS  BASICALLY NOW SAID THAT IRAN  WILL NOT STAND IDLY BY IF THE  AIRSTRIKES AGAINST PALESTINIANS  CONTINUE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THE UNITED STATES -- ISRAEL  RATHER HAS ALREADY BOMBED AIR  STRIPS IN SYRIA IN DAMASCUS AND  ALLEPO AND THERE ARE CONSTANT  SKIRMISHES ACROSS THE BORDER. ISRAEL HAS NOT SAID THAT IT SEES A SMOKING GUN FROM IRAN. CLEARLY NOBODY WANTS TO GET INTO THAT KIND OF WAR. AND THEN ON THE HUMANITARIAN  SIDE, THIS IS ALSO HUGELY  COMPLEX BECAUSE, YES, IT IS  CLOSED TO ALL INTENTS AND  PURPOSE, BUT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING  TO ARAB LEADERS WHO ARE  CONCERNED ABOUT A, QUOTE, E EXODUS, WHERE ARE ALL THESE  PALES PALESTINIANS BEING PUSHED. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE  PALESTINIANS PUSHED PERMANENTLY  OUT OF GAZA AND THEN POTENTIALLY NEVER BEING ALLOWED TO COME  BACK. THEY ALSO DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT AS A PRECEDENT, WHAT HAPPENS IF  CERTAIN ISRAELIS, THE RIGHT  WINGERS WHO HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT  FOR INSTANCE JORDAN IS A  PALESTINIAN HOMELAND, THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT KIND OF PROCESS HAPPENING IN THE WEST BANK. SO THIS IS HUGELY COMPLICATED  RIGHT NOW AND NOT AS SIMPLE --  WELL, CLEARY NOT SIMPLE, BUT  JUST THE IDEA OF HUMANITARIAN  CORRIDORS IS ALSO VERY, VERY  COMPLEX. &gt;&gt; AND TRY DEVOCAL CRITICISM OF  CIVILIAN SITUATION THIS GAZA  FROM THE KING OF JORDAN AND AS  WELL AS THE LEADER OF EGYPT  MAKING IT CLEAR HOW THEY FEEL  THERE. BUT ANTONY BLINKEN JUST CAME  BACK HERE AND HE IS MEETING WITH THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER. NO ONE HAD EXPECTED HIM TO COME  HE WAS HERE LAST WEEK AND IT WAS ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT THAT HE  WOULD RETURN. THE QUESTION WAS WHAT IS HE  RETURNING FOR, WAS HE RETURNING  TO GET NETANYAHU TO PAUSE OR TO  CONSIDER OR PULL BACK OR IS HE  SIMPLY COMING TO ASSIST IN  NEGOTIATIONS OVER BORDER  CROSSINGS. WE WILL HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE  FROM THEM IN A FEW MOMENTS, BUT  DO YOU REALLY THINK IS HAPPENING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS? &gt;&gt; I THINK ALL OF THE ABOVE  FRANKLY. THE UNITED STATES IS TRYING TO  KEEP IT FROM SPILLING OVER. IT HAS TO SUPPORT ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE, BUT IT WANTS TO MAKE SURE IF IT IS AT ALL  POSSIBLE TO KEEP IT TO WITHIN  CERTAIN PARAMETERS. ALSO, YOU KNOW, THE UNITED  STATES IS IMPLICATED, IT IS  INVOLVED BECAUSE 29 AT LEAST OF  ITS CITIZENS HAVE BEEN KILLED  AND THERE ARE APPARENTLY  POTENTIALLY ISRAELI AMERICAN  HOSTAGES. SO THE U.S. IS ABSOLUTELY  INVOLVED. BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE CAUTIONING,  YOU KNOW, THE U.S. WAS ASKED  WOULD THEY PUT BOOTS ON THE  GROUND AND BIDEN SAID DON'T  THINK IT IS NECESSARY. THEY ARE SENDING STRIKE FORCES. WHAT FOR, IS THAT FOR COVER,  WHAT IS IT FOR. AND JUST GO BACK ALL THE WAY TO  1983 WHEN THE U.S. SENT WARSHIPS OUTSIDE LEBANON AND IN SUPPORT  OF ISRAEL, WAS INVOLVED IN THAT  WAR AND IT HAD A TERRIBLE,  TERRIBLE BACKLASH AGAINST THE  UNITED STATES. MASSIVE KILLINGS AT THE BARRACKS IN BEIRUT AND ON AND ON AND ON. IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF REALLY  SERIOUS ANTI-AMERICAN BACKLASH  IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD. SO THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED AS  WELL. &gt;&gt; AND ALSO THE HOSTAGES. LAST NIGHT, HE DID POINT OUT IN  THE \"60 MINUTES\" INTERVIEW  SAYING NO NEED FOR U.S. TROOP ON THE GROUND. OF COURSE JOHN KIRBY HAD LEFT IT ON THE TABLE THAT WHEN IT COMES  TO U.S. HOSTAGES, WE WON'T TAKE  ANYTHING OFF THE TABLE IF YOU  NEED U.S. MILITARY POWER  INVOLVED IN THAT. NOT TAKING IT OFF THE TABLE IS  NOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IT, BUT NONETHELESS THERE IS  STILL THAT UNCERTAINTY. YOU HAVE AMERICANS BEING HELD  HOSTAGE AND THAT IS A WHOLE NEW  THING HERE. &gt;&gt; IT IS. AND AS I SAY, THOSE HOSTAGE  SITUATIONS, MOSTLY STARTED BACK  THERE IN LEBANON AFTER A  CERTAIN, YOU KNOW, AFTER WHAT I  TOLD YOU ABOUT. THE THING IS, THE HOSTAGES  ACCORDING TO ISRAELI EXPERTS AND FORMER HOSTAGE NEGOTIATORS AND  IDF PEOPLE, THEY WILL NOT BE  ABLE TO BE, YOU KNOW, RELEASED  OR FOUND WITHOUT A GROUND  INCURSION. IT IS ONLY ON THE GROUND THAT  YOU CAN GET TO THOSE HOSTAGES. YOU ALREADY HAD A DISCUSSION  ABOUT THE PARAMETERS ADDRESS  DA -- AND DANGERS OF THAT. IF IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF THOSE HOSTAGES HAVE ALREADY BEEN  KILLED IN AIRSTRIKES, AND WE  HAVEN'T HAD CONFIRMATION, BUT  THAT IS WHAT HAMAS HAS SAID, IS  ISRAEL'S FIRST PRIORITY TO SAVE  THE HOSTAGES OR IS ITS FIRST --  AND I'M TALKING ABOUT IN A  GROUND INCURSION.

CHAIRMAN OF HOUSE FOR AFFAIRS, HAS THREATENED TO HOLD TONY BLINKEN IN CONTEMPT, COMPLEMENTING TONY BLINKEN AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR BEING THERE AND BEING ON THE GROUND TO STAND WITH ISRAEL. WHO IS NOT DOING THAT IS THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DONALD TRUMP, AND I WANT TO PLAY FOR EVERYONE WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY, BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO JUST RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE. LISTEN TO THIS. &gt;&gt; I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT BIBI NETANYAHU LET US DOWN. THAT WAS A VERY TERRIBLE THING, I WILL SAY THAT. WHAT I SEE SOMETIMES IN INTELLIGENCE, WE TALK ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE OR YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WENT WRONG OVER THE LAST WEEK. THEY'VE GOT TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT, BECAUSE THEY'RE FIGHTING POTENTIALLY A VERY BIG FORCE. AND THEY SAID, SHE, I HOPE HEZBOLLAH DOESN'T ATTACK FROM THE NORTH. BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST VULNERABLE SPOT. I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU KNOW, HEZBOLLAH IS VERY SMART. THEY'RE ALL VERY SMART. &gt;&gt; VERY SMART. FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THE WHITE HOUSE JUST PUT THIS OUT, A SPOKESPERSON ON THESE STATEMENTS SAYS, WE DON'T COMMENT ON 2024. STATEMENTS LIKE THIS ARE DANGEROUS AND UNHINGED. IT'S COMPLETELY LOST ON US WHY ANY AMERICAN WOULD EVER PRAISE AN IRAN-BACKED TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AS SMART, OR HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE UNITED STATES WARNING TERRORISTS NOT TO ATTACK ISRAEL, ESPECIALLY NOW AS ISRAEL'S FIGHTING BACK AGAINST ONE OF THE WORST ACTS OF MASS MURDER IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THERE USED TO BE AN IDEA THAT WAS -- BY REPUBLICANS. PARTISANSHIP OUGHT TO END AT THE WATER'S EDGE. THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE IN A TIME OF CRISIS LIKE THIS, WITH AN ALLY. THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T HAVE THE DECENCY TO TRY TO UNITE THE NATION, BUT HIS INSTINCT IS ALWAYS TO DIVIDE AND MAKE IT ABOUT HIMSELF. AND THEN TO PRAISE THE TERRORISTS, WHO ARE MURDERING CHILDREN, AS VERY SMART. YOU KNOW, IT REMINDS ME OF LANGUAGE HE USED AFTER TEAM IN SQUARE, WHEN HE PRAISED THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME FOR BEING TOUGH AND SMART. HE SEEMS TO PRAISE VIOLENT ACTIONS BY SO-CALLED STRONGMAN OR GROUPS. AND IT'S PART OF THAT. IT'S THIS INSTINCT TO MAKE IT ALL ABOUT HIMSELF, NOT THINKING ABOUT, OTHERS LET ALONE THINKING ABOUT THE NATION. &gt;&gt; CAN I JUST QUICKLY ASK YOU ABOUT THAT? WE JUST SAW ANTHONY BLINKEN IN A REMARKABLE, UNPRECEDENTED GATHERING OF ISRAELIS, HUGGING HIM, CRYING IN HIS ARMS. HE SECRETARY OF STATE, HE'S WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. DO YOU SEE THIS AS DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO FIND HIS ROLE, TO GET THE ATTENTION HE SO CRAVES AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO GOVERN? TRYING TO SHOW -- &gt;&gt; THAT'S INSTINCT. HE'S GOT TO INSERT HIMSELF. WHAT HE FEELS WHEN IT'S NOT ABOUT HIM, EVEN IF IT'S A TERRORIST ATTACK TRYING TO INSERT HIMSELF IN THIS. THE ABILITY TO RISE ABOVE AND UNITE. I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT ANYTHING MORE THAN HIS EGO AND HIS INSTINCT TO PRAISE STRONG MEN. NO BETTER HOW UGLY THAT IS. THIS IS NOT HARD TO UNITE RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; IS IT AS SIMPLE, ANNA, AS MAYBE -- &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD. &gt;&gt; IT IS BECAUSE FOR ME DONALD TRUMP IS -- HE IS AN INCOHERENT, NARCISSIST, WHO MAKES EVERYTHING ABOUT HIMSELF. BUT FOR ME, THE PROBLEM REALLY IS PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR TIM SCOTT. WHO TALKED ABOUT JOE BIDEN HAVING BLOOD ON HIS HANDS. PEOPLE LIKE RONNA MCDANIEL'S, THE HEAD OF THE RMC, WHO SAID THAT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. THAT IS IRRESPONSIBLE. YOU SEE, AMERICANS HERE HAVE TO TALK WITH ONE VOICE. THERE IS ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS, AND THAT IS HAMAS. AND WHETHER YOU ARE PRO-PALESTINIAN OR WHETHER YOU ARE PRO ISRAELI OR WHETHER YOUR PRO BOTH, YOU HAVE TO BE AGAINST HAMAS. AND THAT IS WHAT OUR FOCUS AS AMERICANS, AND CERTAINLY THE MEMBERS OF OUR GOVERNMENTS AND THOSE WHO HAVE PLATFORMS AND OUR LEADERS SHOULD BE DIRECTING THEIR FIRE AND DIRECTING THEIR VOICE. AND THE CONTRAST, AGAIN, COULD NOT BE STARK. OR AT A TIME WHEN -- THANKING AMERICA AND THANKING JOE BIDEN, AT A TIME WHEN YOU SEE ISRAELIS GATHERING AROUND OUR SECRETARY OF STATE, HUGGING HIM. AND THEY ARE HUGGING HIM AS AN EXTENSION OF AMERICA. YOU SEE HERE IN AMERICA PEOPLE TRYING TO BLAME AMERICANS FOR WHAT JUST HAPPENED IN ISRAEL. COME ON, FOLKS. COME ON. STOP THIS. STOP THE INSANITY, STOP THE PARTISANSHIP. WE HAVE TO UNITE AT A TIME LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. FORMER US  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS  CRITICIZING BENJAMIN NETANYAHU  AND ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE TRUMP  SPEAKING TO SUPPORTERS IN  FLORIDA, RECALLED AN INCIDENT  INVOLVING ISRAEL'S ROLE IN A  2020 US DRONE STRIKE. HE SAID  PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU PULLED  OUT OF THE PLAN TO KILL  ARONNE'S TOP SECURITY AND  INTELLIGENCE COMMANDER WHAT I  SEE, SOMETIMES THE INTELLIGENCE  YOU'D TALK ABOUT THE  INTELLIGENCE SO YOU'RE TALKING  ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT  WENT WRONG OVER THE LAST WEEK.  THEY'VE GOT A STRAIGHTENING OUT  BECAUSE THEY'RE FIGHTING  POTENTIALLY A VERY BIG FOREST.  I DID HAVE A BAD EXPERIENCE  WITH ISRAEL THOUGH, WHEN WE  TOOK OUT SOLEMANI IT WAS US AND  AS YOU WORK IT AS A GROUP AND  THE NIGHT BEFORE IT HAPPENED I  GOT TO CALL THAT ISRAEL WILL  NOT BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS  ATTACK I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT   BIBI NETANYAHU LET US DOWN THAT  WAS A VERY TERRIBLE THING. I  WILL SAY THAT ALL RIGHT,  OLIVIER KNOX, THE AUTHOR OF THE  WASHINGTON POST DAILY TO O2.  AND OF COURSE, NATIONAL   POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IS BACK  WITH US ON THIS.   &gt;&gt; SO OLIVIER THE STAKES ARE  VERY HIGH. OF COURSE, WITH THIS  STORY BUT THE REALITY IS QUITE   PAR FOR THE COURSE WHEN IT  COMES TO DONALD TRUMP   &gt;&gt; YEAH, IT REALLY IS. I MEAN,  WE STILL, WE HAVE TO START BY   SAYING, WHO KNOWS IF WHAT HE  SAID IS TRUE EVEN.  &gt;&gt; BUT YES, WE'RE TRYING TO  FIGURE THAT OUT AS YOU AND I  SPEAK. SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT  CAVEAT. I'M GLAD YOU RAISED,  BUT WE'VE WATCHED WE'VE WATCHED  THE ISRAELI RESPONSE TO THE  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S SUPPORT   OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS.   BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAS, HAS  JUST REPEATEDLY PRAISED THE  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. YOU SAW  THE SHOW OF SOLIDARITY TODAY  WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE,  TONY BLINKEN. IT'S NOT SUPER  HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHY DONALD  TRUMP MIGHT BE ANGRY AT BIBI  NETANYAHU NOW AND I DON'T THINK  IT HAS A LOT TOO. DO WITH A  YEARS OLD RAID AGAINST   AIRSTRIKE. I SHOULD SAY AGAINST  A TOP IRANIAN GENERAL.  &gt;&gt; IT'S   &gt;&gt; IT IS PART FOR THE COURSE IN  ANOTHER WAY WHICH IS OF COURSE  THAT HE HAS HISTORICALLY SAID A  LOT OF NICE THINGS ABOUT A LOT  OF BAD PEOPLE. HE'S PRAISED KIM  JONG UN. HE'S PRAISED THE  CHINESE RESPONSE, THE CHINESE  CRACKDOWN TO TENEMENTS HE  PRAISED VLADIMIR PUTIN. THIS  IS, AS YOU SAY, IT'S, IT'S VERY  PART FOR THE COURSE BUT I DON'T  THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AWAY FROM   THIS.  &gt;&gt; NO, I'M I'M GLAD YOU I'M  GLAD YOU PUT IT THAT WAY. I   AGREE. AND I'M SURE THAT THERE  ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE MISSING. I  WANT TO BRING IN THE REST OF  OUR POLITICAL PANEL HERE NOW,  JOINING US AS BRIAN FALLON, HE  IS THE CO-FOUNDER OF DEMAND  JUSTICE AND THE FORMER PRESS  SECRETARY FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S  2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. AND  WE ALSO HAVE SARAH MATTHEWS,  THE FORMER DEPUTY PRESS  SECRETARY WITH THE TRUMP   ADMINISTRATION. SO SARA, BEFORE  I GET TO BEFORE I GET TO THE  WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE AND TALK  TO BRIAN ABOUT IT, I JUST LIKE  TO KINDA GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO  RESPOND TO WHAT THE FORMER  PRESIDENT SAID HERE ABOUT THIS  RAID. I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY   KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT DID OR DIDN'T  HAPPEN THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO   SHARE WITH US IN TERMS OF  DETERMINING THE VERACITY OF  WHAT HE HAS TO SAY AND IF NOT,  AND PERHAPS IT'S CLASSIFIED SO   PERHAPS I'M ASSUMING THAT IF  NOT I'M JUST CURIOUS. YOU'RE   TAKE ON WHAT HIS MOTIVATIONS   MIGHT BE IN SAYING THIS. NOW   &gt;&gt; I WASN'T AT THE WHITE HOUSE  WHEN THIS RAID HAPPENED, AND SO  I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT   AND HIS THINKING ON THAT   SPECIFIC THING, BUT I THINK  SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY   IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT IT  WAS REPORTED IN 2021 THAT  DONALD TRUMP WAS VERY UNHAPPY  WITH NETANYAHU BECAUSE  NETANYAHU WAS ONE OF THE FIRST  PEOPLE TO CONGRATULATE  PRESIDENT BIDEN ON HIS WIN IN  THE NOVEMBER ELECTION AND SO I  THINK THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY  WHAT IS MOST SIGNIFICANT AND  DRIVING TRUMP'S BEEF WITH  NETANYAHU AND WHY HE MADE THOSE  REMARKS. HE MIGHT SAY IT HAS  SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT  SOLEMANI STRIKE AND THAT COULD  BE PART OF IT, BUT I DO THINK  THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THAT HE WAS  UPSET THAT NETANYAHU   ACKNOWLEDGED THAT BIDEN WON THE  ELECTION FAIR AND SQUARE. AND  SO THAT SEEMS TO BE THE DRIVING  FORCE HERE, BUT IT IS REALLY  DISGUSTING THESE REMARKS THAT I  THINK HE MADE WHERE HE'S THE  FORMER PRESIDENT IS PRAISING  HEZBOLLAH. AND I THINK A LOT OF  REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE BEEN  CRITICAL OF CONGRESSWOMAN TLAIB  FOR REFUSING TO DENOUNCE HAMAS  SHOULD BE EQUALLY UPSET DONE  WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT FOR  PRAISING HEZBOLLAH AND MAKING  THESE REMARKS AT A TIME WHEN WE  NEED TO SHOW SOLIDARITY WITH  ISRAEL AND SHOW UNWAVERING  SUPPORT",
                "Tag": "NP",
                "Lemma": "AND ON THE POLITICAL FRONT, IT IS KIND OF A MIRACULOUS THING WE SEE HAPPENING, WHICH IS THAT WE JUST HAD MIKE MCCAUL, WHO'S CLASHED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION BEFORE. CHAIRMAN OF HOUSE FOR AFFAIRS, HAS THREATENED TO HOLD TONY BLINKEN IN CONTEMPT, COMPLEMENTING TONY BLINKEN AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR BEING THERE AND BEING ON THE GROUND TO STAND WITH ISRAEL. WHO IS NOT DOING THAT IS THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DONALD TRUMP, AND I WANT TO PLAY FOR EVERYONE WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY, BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO JUST RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE. LISTEN TO THIS. &gt;&gt; I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT BIBI NETANYAHU LET US DOWN. THAT WAS A VERY TERRIBLE THING, I WILL SAY THAT. WHAT I SEE SOMETIMES IN INTELLIGENCE, WE TALK ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE OR YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WENT WRONG OVER THE LAST WEEK. THEY'VE GOT TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT, BECAUSE THEY'RE FIGHTING POTENTIALLY A VERY BIG FORCE. AND THEY SAID, SHE, I HOPE HEZBOLLAH DOESN'T ATTACK FROM THE NORTH. BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST VULNERABLE SPOT. I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU KNOW, HEZBOLLAH IS VERY SMART. THEY'RE ALL VERY SMART. &gt;&gt; VERY SMART. FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THE WHITE HOUSE JUST PUT THIS OUT, A SPOKESPERSON ON THESE STATEMENTS SAYS, WE DON'T COMMENT ON 2024. STATEMENTS LIKE THIS ARE DANGEROUS AND UNHINGED. IT'S COMPLETELY LOST ON US WHY ANY AMERICAN WOULD EVER PRAISE AN IRAN-BACKED TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AS SMART, OR HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE UNITED STATES WARNING TERRORISTS NOT TO ATTACK ISRAEL, ESPECIALLY NOW AS ISRAEL'S FIGHTING BACK AGAINST ONE OF THE WORST ACTS OF MASS MURDER IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THERE USED TO BE AN IDEA THAT WAS -- BY REPUBLICANS. PARTISANSHIP OUGHT TO END AT THE WATER'S EDGE. THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE IN A TIME OF CRISIS LIKE THIS, WITH AN ALLY. THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T HAVE THE DECENCY TO TRY TO UNITE THE NATION, BUT HIS INSTINCT IS ALWAYS TO DIVIDE AND MAKE IT ABOUT HIMSELF. AND THEN TO PRAISE THE TERRORISTS, WHO ARE MURDERING CHILDREN, AS VERY SMART. YOU KNOW, IT REMINDS ME OF LANGUAGE HE USED AFTER TEAM IN SQUARE, WHEN HE PRAISED THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME FOR BEING TOUGH AND SMART. HE SEEMS TO PRAISE VIOLENT ACTIONS BY SO-CALLED STRONGMAN OR GROUPS. AND IT'S PART OF THAT. IT'S THIS INSTINCT TO MAKE IT ALL ABOUT HIMSELF, NOT THINKING ABOUT, OTHERS LET ALONE THINKING ABOUT THE NATION. &gt;&gt; CAN I JUST QUICKLY ASK YOU ABOUT THAT? WE JUST SAW ANTHONY BLINKEN IN A REMARKABLE, UNPRECEDENTED GATHERING OF ISRAELIS, HUGGING HIM, CRYING IN HIS ARMS. HE SECRETARY OF STATE, HE'S WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. DO YOU SEE THIS AS DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO FIND HIS ROLE, TO GET THE ATTENTION HE SO CRAVES AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO GOVERN? TRYING TO SHOW -- &gt;&gt; THAT'S INSTINCT. HE'S GOT TO INSERT HIMSELF. WHAT HE FEELS WHEN IT'S NOT ABOUT HIM, EVEN IF IT'S A TERRORIST ATTACK TRYING TO INSERT HIMSELF IN THIS. THE ABILITY TO RISE ABOVE AND UNITE. I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT ANYTHING MORE THAN HIS EGO AND HIS INSTINCT TO PRAISE STRONG MEN. NO BETTER HOW UGLY THAT IS. THIS IS NOT HARD TO UNITE RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; IS IT AS SIMPLE, ANNA, AS MAYBE -- &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD. &gt;&gt; IT IS BECAUSE FOR ME DONALD TRUMP IS -- HE IS AN INCOHERENT, NARCISSIST, WHO MAKES EVERYTHING ABOUT HIMSELF. BUT FOR ME, THE PROBLEM REALLY IS PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR TIM SCOTT. WHO TALKED ABOUT JOE BIDEN HAVING BLOOD ON HIS HANDS. PEOPLE LIKE RONNA MCDANIEL'S, THE HEAD OF THE RMC, WHO SAID THAT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. THAT IS IRRESPONSIBLE. YOU SEE, AMERICANS HERE HAVE TO TALK WITH ONE VOICE. THERE IS ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS, AND THAT IS HAMAS. AND WHETHER YOU ARE PRO-PALESTINIAN OR WHETHER YOU ARE PRO ISRAELI OR WHETHER YOUR PRO BOTH, YOU HAVE TO BE AGAINST HAMAS. AND THAT IS WHAT OUR FOCUS AS AMERICANS, AND CERTAINLY THE MEMBERS OF OUR GOVERNMENTS AND THOSE WHO HAVE PLATFORMS AND OUR LEADERS SHOULD BE DIRECTING THEIR FIRE AND DIRECTING THEIR VOICE. AND THE CONTRAST, AGAIN, COULD NOT BE STARK. OR AT A TIME WHEN -- THANKING AMERICA AND THANKING JOE BIDEN, AT A TIME WHEN YOU SEE ISRAELIS GATHERING AROUND OUR SECRETARY OF STATE, HUGGING HIM. AND THEY ARE HUGGING HIM AS AN EXTENSION OF AMERICA. YOU SEE HERE IN AMERICA PEOPLE TRYING TO BLAME AMERICANS FOR WHAT JUST HAPPENED IN ISRAEL. COME ON, FOLKS. COME ON. STOP THIS. STOP THE INSANITY, STOP THE PARTISANSHIP. WE HAVE TO UNITE AT A TIME LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

Last night, they took to the stage wearing the number 320 for the number of days he's been held prisoner. In an inflamed Middle East. We know the one thing that can most immediately release pressure and bring calm to the entire region. A deal that brings this diverse group of 109 hostages home and ends the suffering of the innocent civilians in Gaza. So there you go. Such an incredible moment. And John and Rachel Goldberg, Poland, join me now. Rachel, we should note you're both wearing 321. You were wearing 320 last night. It's not 321. Did we change it every day? Yeah. And what did that moment mean to you last night? I was so shocked and overwhelmed because we had been told to anticipate in neutral to negative reception. Yeah. and when we walked out and suddenly there were thousands of people who got to their feet and started to chant, bring them home. We were just swelled with support and it was overwhelming. And I just started to weep. Yeah, I think a lot of people were, John, how did that, how did that, resonate with you seeing that? I mean, because I know this week what we've been hearing is obviously there are protests here. There's a lot of deep opposition to the war in Gaza. but there's still in the hearts of a lot of folks in this country. Just pain and agony for what you're going through. It's so easy to politicize everything. And that's the danger and that's what's been happening. But it was heartening last night to see that even before we spoke a word, I think people understood that there's a human side to this story. It's not just an issue. It's not just numbers and ambiguity. These are 109 real human beings with loved ones, with families waiting for them, their innocence on all sides. In the Middle East, conflict to our suffering. And I think the people in the room understood that last night. Yeah, that was what was so important. And you've emphasized the diversity of the hostages, right? Well, I think that there's a real misunderstanding of who this hostage cohort is that this is a monolithic group of people. And as I mentioned last night, they are from 23 different countries. They are Christian. They are Jewish. They're Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists. And this is something that gets lost when someone has a very specific reason to create a narrative a certain way. And we all so very much are constantly saying we are extremely concerned and heartbroken for the innocent civilians in Gaza and the innocent civilians in Gaza who were dragged there on October 7th. You don't have to choose one or the other. This is a humanitarian issue. Absolutely. and everybody's feeling it. Everybody's feeling. And John Hirsh lost part of his left arm in the text. We do. We know of any idea how he's doing, how how he's holding up? 120 days ago, we saw a video that Hamas released of Hirsh. It was the first sign of life we had on him in 201 days, and the last we've had since. But that video is something that no parent would ever want to see of their kid with a limb missing, bruising on their face, looking pale. But at the same time, when that's what you get after 201 days, it just gave us strength to see him, to hear him, and it continues to carry us now that he's a fighter and a survivor and he's going to keep on going. And we need him to know and all the hostages to know that we are not stopping until we get them all out. And, Rachel, I know I was asking this during the commercial break, but do you have any sense? I mean, there are these talks that are going on right now. Do you have any sense as to where they're going? Are they finally going to get to some kind of resolution so we can bring your son and the rest of those hostages home? Well, we're not any more privy to what is going on behind the scenes than any, any regular person watching the news or following. We are always hopeful and optimistic. We know that many of the people who are participating in the negotiations, and in everything that's happening, are really trying to lean forward. At the end of the day, this is up to two men from the two primary parties. Yeah, Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Senor. And, I think until each of them decide that it's time for our children, our loved ones, the whole entire mass of people who are caught in the crosshairs of this conflict no longer should be pawns in this game. It won't end. And it's so important. And I do want to go back to that moment last night that people understand that the human element of this, they're real families suffering, real families in the dark. And to have that outpouring of support, it just must have meant so much that it's still there, have spite everything that's in the political, you know, spectrum right now, the dialog that's happening and so much bitter opposition to what's taking place that it's still there, that I mentioned in my remarks that really one of the things that has carried all of the hostage families to get up every morning and keep on pushing and keep fighting is the tremendous support, strength prayers we get from literally all over the world. And last night was a microcosm of this. I don't know, 2020 5000 people in the building. Not only were they supporting us as we spoke, but afterwards just people stopping us. And as we walked out shouting, we're with you, we're supporting you, our prayers are with you. Keep going. It was really none of the none of the reaction that you were prepared for that they told you you might receive. Correct. That's that's so important. Yeah. It's so important. And and I'm sure it sustains you to some extent. It's not. It doesn't do everything right. But it's obviously helpful. And I think it is really important. We don't all have to agree. And that was a big theme last night that a lot of the different speakers discussed. But we have to try to understand. We don't have to agree. We just have to try to understand those with whom we don't share the same opinions. That's all right. That's what we have to try to understand each other. There was a lot of talk about looking out for your neighbors, you know, and that that crosses our boundaries. You know, nations. We honestly did not even know that we were speaking on the night that was under the freedom theme. Interesting. But it makes sense, right? That's that's what we're pushing for. we've been pushing for 321 days and are going to continue to fight for it. Well, thank you very much to both of you. Really appreciate I know we say it, time and again, but, we are thinking of you and praying for you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. Appreciate it. Rachel and John, thanks so much.",

                "Lemma": "one of the most moving moments of the DNC unfolded last night. It was not the stirring speech of a gifted politician, but the heartbroken words of this man's parents, 23 year old Hirsch Goldberg. Poland is an Israeli American hostage held by Hamas. He is one of eight Americans still held nearly 11 months. That's right, 11 months after the terror attacks on Israel.

                "Token": "Is rescuing the hostages a priority at all? I mean, Israeli news media, like Haaretz, they say it doesn't seem like it at all. And frankly, Jake, if my kids were being held hostage in Gaza and as you know, there are Americans being held hostage in Gaza right now, I'd want you you to send in the Navy SEALs. What's the conversation like in the White House about the U.S. conducting any sort of operations in order to save Americans being held hostage in Gaza? Well, the president has been very clear that he has no higher priority than getting Americans back safe, Americans who are being held hostage by Hamas. The Israelis are bombing the crap out of Gaza. And I mean, it doesn't seem like saving the hostages are a priority at all right now. Well, for President Biden, they are a priority. They're the highest possible priority. And he has sent hostage experts to coordinate and consult with the Israeli government on hostage recovery efforts. He's also made sure that our diplomats are in touch with third countries in the region to explore avenues for their safe release. I have to be cautious about how much I can say about certain efforts he's undertaking because we want to protect those efforts to give us the best possible chance of getting our people home. Now, Jake, one important point when it comes to the issue of the Navy SEALs is we do not at this point have pinpoint location information for where the American hostages are. So we have to continue to refine our understanding of where they are and even Jake, who they are, because we know there are 15 unaccounted for Americans, but we cannot confirm the precise number of American hostages being held by Hamas at this time. All we can do is to continue to work closely with the Israeli government on hostage recovery options, which we are doing, and then work through third countries to see if there are avenues for release. Those efforts are underway. Our hope is that they can produce results. We will continue to stay focused on this. It's as high a priority as the president has. One senior political operative with Hamas floated the possibility a few days ago of a potential prisoner swap with the U.S. for the release of hostages with the U.S.. Entertain that. We have not looked at that. We have not heard from them. Something like that. That's not something that is currently under active discussion. It has not been proposed. What we are focused on instead, as I said before, are pursuing avenues with third countries for release. I'm not going to get into the details of what that might look like again, to protect those channels in hopes that they can bear some fruit. But I will say that President Biden has shown over the course of the past few years that he will make hard decisions to get American hostages home. In this case, our focus is on working through those third country channels and I'll leave it at that for now. So I think there are serious reasons to question how good any intelligence about what is in Gaza is. I mean, obviously, Hamas was able to carry out this horrific attack eight days ago, catching everybody completely off guard. You just said that we don't know where the hostages are in Gaza. And yet the Israelis claim the IDF claims that it is bombing places that it knows are Hamas targets. How can we be sure that that's true? I mean, I Hamas is a terrorist group. Don't get me wrong. But how do we know anything about what they're hitting? Given the fact that it doesn't sound like any of the intelligence inside Gaza is particularly good? Well, Jake, Israel has known where particular parts of Hamas's terrorist infrastructure have been located. They know, for example, where rockets are fired from and they can go back to those locations to take out the rocket emplacements. They know from various forms of intelligence collection where certain individuals are located, who are senior commanders in Hamas, who are part of the bloody and barbaric attacks that took place against Israel last Saturday. So they do have information to be able to go after specific targets, actionable targets, similar to the way the United States has been able to do that. In other places, in other contexts. The United States has taken a very clear stand. It is a stand that we don't just take in this situation, but we've taken all along, which is that we stand for the rule of law. We stand for the law of war, we stand for the protection of civilians. And we want to make sure that innocent Palestinians who have nothing to do with Hamas, can get to safe areas where they will be safe from bombardment and where they will have access to necessities like food, water, shelter and medicine. Well, I mean, you say you stand for the rule of law. Again, Hamas is vile. What they did eight days ago, they're targeting civilians. It's horrific. But what's going on right now is not just a punishment of Hamas. More than 700 children have been reportedly killed in Gaza. And obviously, electricity, food, water, supplies have been cut off by Israel to the totality of Gaza. Obviously, the blockade is not just by Israel, it's by Egypt, too. Take a listen to what Secretary Blinken said last year when Putin was targeting Ukrainian infrastructure, heat, water. Electricity for children, for the elderly, for the sick. These are President Putin's new targets. He's hitting them hard. This brutalization of Ukraine's. People is barbaric. Now, look, Israel is not Russia. Gaza is not Ukraine. It's a different situation. But cutting off supplies, cutting off heat, cutting off water to civilians. What's the difference? Well, first, thank you for saying that Israel is not Russia, because Israel is not Russia's, but. Civilians are civilians. We are civilians to civilians. Yes, absolutely they are. And they deserve, as I said before, access to water and medicine and food. And we are working actively to ensure that that happens. And I can tell you this morning, Jake, that I have been in touch with my Israeli counterparts just within the last hour who report to me that they have, in fact, turned the water pipe back on in southern Gaza. That has been the subject of discussion over the course of the past few days. The United States is going to continue working with Israel, with the U.N., with Egypt, with Jordan, and with a lot of the groups on the ground to make sure that innocent Palestinians get access to those basic necessities and are protected from bombardment because they deserve that right, the right to those necessities and the right to safety and security every bit as much as Ukrainian civilians do or civilians anywhere do. And the United States hasn't made any bones about that. We're working hard on that. We're working to make sure that that is the case as this unfolds. And it's something that has been a high priority for President Biden, for Secretary Blinken, and for myself. But you're not telling the Israelis to let the Palestinian hospitals have power. Our position is that hospitals should be able to function. Hospitals should not be targeted. People should be able to get access to lifesaving medical care. We don't qualify this statement if we don't say that there is some kind of caveat to them. These are simple, clear, declarative statements. It is our position that's consistent with the law of armed conflict, the law of war. It's consistent with our view as we have presented it. And I would just say, Jake, that there's a lot of reports in the fog of war about things that happen. We're not going to respond to every one of those because we will seek clarity in the appropriate way. But we will never back off our basic principles and our basic proposition, which we have made both publicly and privately about our view about how civilians have to be protected. I haven't asked you over the any the fog of war stories. I've seen stories that blame Israel for things that later on it turns out Hamas did them. I get it. I understand. But we have reports and I'm sure you have them, too, that hundreds of the individuals stuck in Gaza are American citizens. You know that, too. There are also hundreds of thousands of Americans in Israel that are trying to get out also. And the Biden administration is doing a lot to get those individuals out. 29 of the individuals killed by Hamas were American. And there are, I think what is it like something like 40 Americans that are unaccounted for who were maybe taken prisoner by Hamas? But I want to talk to you about one Palestinian-American woman we talked to named Janine O'Connell. She's from New Jersey. She's got three kids, eight two and two months. I sent you the interview we did with her earlier in the week. She got to the border, the Rafah crossing. She can't get out. She can't get out of Gaza because the Egyptians won't open the crossing. Listen to what she told me earlier this week. We tried to contact the U.S. embassy so many times. Unfortunately, they couldn't tell us at all. I contacted them through the phone via email. I texted and I. I called different numbers, but nobody I couldn't hear back from any. We are all here feeling abandoned that and we're feeling that we're left alone. I don't know how many billions of dollars we give the Egyptians every year. Why can't you tell President Sisi to open the border, to let Americans out? We have told President Sisi to open the border, to let Americans out. The situation there at the crossing is actually more complicated. The Egyptians have, in fact, agreed to allow Americans to depart to get safe passage through the Rafah crossing. The Israelis agreed to ensure that the area around there would be safe as at least as far as they were able to do so. The question when we tried to move a group yesterday was actually Hamas taking steps to try and stop that from happening. But we are continuing to work this around the clock and we are doing all that we can that American citizens who are in Gaza can get through that border crossing. Secretary Blinken, in fact, is in Egypt today meeting with the president of Egypt. This is at the top of his list to help get those American citizens out of Gaza. Anyone on who is a U.S. citizen should have the right to free passage through there and then have the U.S. government facilitate their travel home. Yeah, I don't I don't doubt that the biggest problem in all of this Escobar's.",

The Egyptians have, in fact, agreed to allow Americans to depart to get safe passage through the Rafah crossing. The Israelis agreed to ensure that the area around there would be safe as at least as far as they were able to do so. The question when we tried to move a group yesterday was actually Hamas taking steps to try and stop that from happening. But we are continuing to work this around the clock and we are doing all that we can that American citizens who are in Gaza can get through that border crossing. Secretary Blinken, in fact, is in Egypt today meeting with the president of Egypt. This is at the top of his list to help get those American citizens out of Gaza. Anyone on who is a U.S. citizen should have the right to free passage through there and then have the U.S. government facilitate their travel home. Yeah, I don't I don't doubt that the biggest problem in all of this Escobar's."

Sara Ben Sala barely survived. He's shown here dancing with friends just hours before the massacre. And I spoke to him from hospital in Tel Aviv. And a warning to his story is difficult to hear. I want to make it clear. First thing first, it was at this festival and we and we did nothing to provoke them. We just was dancing and having fun. I can't. I can forget the moment that when I got in the festival and I don't know anybody, anyone there, it was something like 34,000 people. And just got into the entrance and a just a guy that I don't even know then came to me and start to hug me and bless him for coming for the festival. We had a small camp next to us, the German people from German, just tourist who came all over the way from Berlin or wherever they came, and we made drinks together. We had laugh. It's just so much happiness. What happened to you? Tell me how you got wounded. And I forget when I saw the story. The first moment that we realized that there is myself, I was really come in first because it's not the first time to the same missiles I was fighting in there took it down. And then I was doing. I've been serving the army. And then then the start towards the missiles. And one of the producers of the festival just jumped on the fence and screamed that the terrorists are coming and legs and legs just they kind of landed not there for myself. And then the panic begin. It was a big panic. Everybody was jumping on the fence. Everybody ran to their cars and there was a lot of fire out there. Just even in the biggest war thing that we seen in the movie movies. I can explain almost how many bullets and missile were flying around up, not to the big mister like RPG and everything was RPG all over. I was fighting in the war. Never seen so many RPG history. And how did you get shot? And Sahar, how did you get get shot? The part of the story, we tried to go to another place and they turned us around again. And then when we saw a policeman standing next to a shelter and the look of us and the policeman look at us say, there is no ID, there are, they are all over the place. Get inside the shelter. It's the only way we got inside. The shelters are suffering. I remember 30 or 40 people, but my friend say that was six still living there, 50 or 60 people. And we got inside. The shattered was something like two meters at all, like just two meter square. And we got inside and then the shooting started and the policeman tried to come down. It's not a terrorist is the IDF. But the shooting was on us. I could see the shot. I couldn't. I can feel on the on the stance of the soldier killed at the bullets. In this case, it's not IDF. It's not IDF. And then just look at us, say, stay inside, pull out the gun. And then it was a mass of shots all over the place. We can see in the intensive, the shelter, a lot of bullets flying inside, but they couldn't get us because if they can turn left, but because it was an entrance and then left to the shelter, a small something like. So we made the saw. It sounds to me like you're directed to take shelter, but you were like a cornered animal in this shelter because that's where the. Shelter it wasn't. It wasn't the shelter. It was animal slaughter. It's like they take all the animals to one place and shoot them all. the policeman got shot in the run away and he killed one of the terrorists, but got shot and thrown away. I found him on soccer life and God, the policeman and one second, silly. Then they they dropped the first grenade drop inside. It was to explode in the entrance. I'm sorry if it's too much to. Take my life. Okay. I need to tell about this. Just a second, please. Thank you. After the first grenade of something like 45 seconds, it dropped the second grenade and they hit the wall, hit my head and blow to the back of the rope for the people of the people in the back row and explode on their. And then was it something like a lot of smoke inside? And they my friend, their friend, they start to choke. And she wanted to go out and to start to run away from the shelter. We tried to catch her. I remember I wasn't the second of the people. I tried to catch her with my hand and it was sleeping and she tackle, I think she tackled the terrorists and the shutter Then from the zero, from zero point blank. From point blank. Point blank from point blank and after, after each other. Then it just got to the side. I could never forget the face of it. It was smiling at us. It looks like the devil just looked at us one point. The gun, the column, the machine gun in front again, face. And just to spread everything around all the people. I was in the second row, all the people in the first or in the second row shot dead. I just opened my eyes and opened my mouth and start to go down the world because I got I understood that I got hit. But then in a state where yet because it was blood all over and screaming and from all the adrenaline, I got it it in my body. But I can't really understand what happened. And I think his gun was broken that way. Stopped the shot and there was a third grenade inside of the building, but it didn't explode. We found him on the floor. We would you say with that we don't don't touch it so it wouldn't explode. You know what, Sara? I'm just pleased that you made it out. What a complete and utter horror. I wish it was all over in all the movie. You can go outside somehow. We then. And no joke. I saw the kids that the bodies full of bullets again, that all all the body parts on the floor. And she was calling to her boyfriend and dead boyfriend and start to kiss him until she got she died by herself. Wow. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for you. I'm so happy that you survived. And we wish you all the best. And we thank you for this story, because as you say, it's important for people to hear Thank you very. Much. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Just really wanted to make it clear. Just last think. It wasn't the war. It was a slider. Cicely. It was a big slider that didn't care about animals or people.

                "Token": "Former CIA director and retired four star General David Petraeus, who also served as commander of U.S. Central Command, which includes part of the Middle East. Director Petraeus, thanks for joining us. What's your assessment of the attack by Iran? Was this a genuine attempt to retaliate, to overwhelm Israel's defenses, to cause mass damage, or was this a show of force or Iran by indicating that they don't want actually to escalate further? Well, I don't believe so. I think it was probably a bit more of the latter than the former. Clearly, it was unprecedented. There never has been an attack that came from Iranian soil. And, of course, these attacks also included some of the proxies in Iraq and Syria and southern Lebanon. There's never been something like this in the past, but it seemed a little bit less than what they might have thrown if they were really serious. In fact, it was probably a good bit less than if they really wanted to cause massive damage. It struck me as a little bit like that attack the Iranians did after the U.S. killed cousin Soleimani in Baghdad. That time, they telegraphed it well in advance and again, no casualties out of that one in this case at most. It appears that there was one Arab-Israeli girl who was seriously injured and may have died. So there's a tiny bit of this Goldilocks aspect to this, I think, although, again, a very significant attack. Iran and Israel been fighting this shadow war in the Middle East for decades now. This is the first time that Iran has directly attacked Israel from inside Iranian territory, not using proxies like Hamas or Hezbollah or the Houthis. Just how significant a moment is this for the Middle East? Well, it is significant. It's a very big deal. And I think Israel will have to take some action in response. I think it's very clear that the U.S. would like to see that be as limited as this possible. Keep in mind that the real issue here, in addition to Israel's security, of course, which is first and foremost, but it's also about freedom of navigation from the Gulf for the oil and gas that come from the Gulf and fuel much of the global economy. That's the biggest issue here. And Iran, I don't think, wants to have that disrupted either because they export about 1.6 or 1.7 million barrels a day themselves. So keep your eye on that. Brant crude is already above $90 a barrel, and it would really spike if there was something that interfered with freedom of navigation. In fact, we need to figure out what's going on. Iran did take a ship the other day that they claimed was in some way dealing with Israel. But this is another step up the rung of escalation. I think it's in the interests of everyone to stop the increasing escalation. But we'll have to see what Israel decides to do in this case. President Biden told Prime Minister Netanyahu that the United States will not participate in any offensive strikes by Israel against Iran. How would you advise Israel to respond to this? How worried are you that any responsible only throws fuel on the fire Well, that has to be a concern, and I'm sure they're conscious of that, Jake. There's a whole menu of actions that they can take, not all of which are necessarily overt. They can pursue covert, they can pursue asymmetric attacks, cyberspace and so forth. And keep in mind that, of course, Washington is meeting with the other G7 countries to determine what kind of diplomatic and economic responses should follow in a coordinated effort as well. Can't really take your eye off Gaza, though. At the end of the day, Got to get those hostages back. And I believe still do need to destroy Hamas. You don't send the the fire department to extinguish. 80% of the fire They still have work to do there. All right. General Petraeus, always good to see you. Thank you so much for your insights. Joining us now, the former director of national intelligence under President Obama, a retired General, James Clapper. So, first of all, just the size and scope of this, we've never seen anything quite like this in terms of Iran directly launching attack on Israel. So it does seem to mark a change, an inflection point of some sort. Yes. Oh, no question, Jake. That a Rubicon was has been crossed here with Iran directly attacking from Iranian Iran proper to Israel proper. That said, though, the size of the attack, I think was very measured. It did not. I think the Iranians had to know that it would not overwhelm the coalition air defense system. And then at the end of it, they declared it was done without having accomplished much in the way of damage. So I think there was a messaging here. But I still believe despite this very profound event, that the Iranians don't want a wider war, as strange as that may seem. But so explain to people at home who think General or they're saying, General Clapper, how can you say they don't want a wider war? They just fired 300 attack drones. And missiles at Israel. But you think that the way they did it is significant? Well, I do, because first they telegraphed it. They sent slow moving drones out first, which you had hours to to prepare for. And the Iranians have a lot of missiles, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. So if they had wanted to, I believe they could have overwhelmed the Israeli air defense system and out of the coalition, which was very important you know, I guess 20% or so of the projectiles were neutralized by U.S. or other coalition elements. So the whole way they went about this, I think, was very deliberate, very measured. I don't think they want a wider war. Of course, now it's all up to the Israelis So the United States does not have an embassy in Iran. Iran doesn't have an embassy in the United States. You think that this information about a week ago maybe or maybe a little bit less, the Biden administration started announcing or leaking to newspapers. There's intelligence that Iran is going to attack Israel. You think it's possible that Iran leaked that intentionally? I think it's quite possible. They may have conveyed it to us. they probably weren't all that careful about masking their preparation. The fact that came back from Delaware early, convene the national security team. All these things tell me that we had good insight into what the Iranians were going to do. And so why do it? So why would they do it? Well, I think the Israelis have the Iranians have their own domestic political pressures. They have they have some very there are some very hard liners now surrounding the supreme leader So I think they have that that constituency to placate. And the fact that they showed the parade or, if you will, of solitary the parade in Tehran of the joyful Iranians, so happy about the attack. And I think that's what was important to the Iranians. And I still believe they don't want a wider war, as incongruous as that may sound. But their proxy is are doing things that are not meant to be eliminated. Their proxies Hamas slaughtering you know 1200 Israelis. Hezbollah firing rockets into the north of Israel. So as you know, tens of thousands of Israelis can't even live in their homes. The Houthis shutting down coastal passages, I mean, ocean passages. So that seems incongruous to it does. And I think that raises the question of just how much control Iran actually has over the over the proxies there. I think they have their own objectives and and they're going to try to fulfill them. And in the case of particularly in the case of Hezbollah. Well, this is a great opportunity for them to weigh in and increase the attacks from southern Lebanon and into northern Israel. So, you know, this is not a rosy picture for Iran either. I'll put it that way. Retired General James Clapper, former director of national intelligence, thanks so much for being here. Appreciate it.",

But you think that the way they did it is significant? Well, I do, because first they telegraphed it. They sent slow moving drones out first, which you had hours to to prepare for. And the Iranians have a lot of missiles, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. So if they had wanted to, I believe they could have overwhelmed the Israeli air defense system and out of the coalition, which was very important you know, I guess 20% or so of the projectiles were neutralized by U.S. or other coalition elements. So the whole way they went about this, I think, was very deliberate, very measured. I don't think they want a wider war. Of course, now it's all up to the Israelis So the United States does not have an embassy in Iran. Iran doesn't have an embassy in the United States. You think that this information about a week ago maybe or maybe a little bit less, the Biden administration started announcing or leaking to newspapers. There's intelligence that Iran is going to attack Israel. You think it's possible that Iran leaked that intentionally? I think it's quite possible. They may have conveyed it to us. they probably weren't all that careful about masking their preparation. The fact that came back from Delaware early, convene the national security team. All these things tell me that we had good insight into what the Iranians were going to do. And so why do it? So why would they do it? Well, I think the Israelis have the Iranians have their own domestic political pressures. They have they have some very there are some very hard liners now surrounding the supreme leader So I think they have that that constituency to placate. And the fact that they showed the parade or, if you will, of solitary the parade in Tehran of the joyful Iranians, so happy about the attack. And I think that's what was important to the Iranians. And I still believe they don't want a wider war, as incongruous as that may sound. But their proxy is are doing things that are not meant to be eliminated. Their proxies Hamas slaughtering you know 1200 Israelis. Hezbollah firing rockets into the north of Israel. So as you know, tens of thousands of Israelis can't even live in their homes. The Houthis shutting down coastal passages, I mean, ocean passages. So that seems incongruous to it does. And I think that raises the question of just how much control Iran actually has over the over the proxies there. I think they have their own objectives and and they're going to try to fulfill them. And in the case of particularly in the case of Hezbollah. Well, this is a great opportunity for them to weigh in and increase the attacks from southern Lebanon and into northern Israel. So, you know, this is not a rosy picture for Iran either. I'll put it that way. Retired General James Clapper, former director of national intelligence, thanks so much for being here. Appreciate it."

                "Token": "I guess, first of all, I mean, the images of this tunnel are just kind of mind here. What is your take on all this? What was your reaction to that? When you saw that? Yeah, my my reaction is this is what Israel has been talking about since the beginning of this conflict. They knew that these kind of tunnels existed. I mean, we've been showing on CNN the single file tunnels that you almost have to squeeze through, but you can't conduct an operation of literally thousands of terrorist when you're squeezing them all through. So you're talking about a tunnel in this case that's 50 meters, about 200 feet or so underground that has the capability to hold weapons, have large meeting spaces, travel around and even bring vehicles in. It's just part of the network that subterranean under the Gaza Hamas has been building for the last several years, in fact, close to a decade. And how they have been shifting the money away from the Palestinian citizens to build these kind of things to to to construct their military apparatus. And it's just it's just mind boggling. It is. But it also shows the difficulty of fighting in this kind of subterranean environment. Yeah. I mean, our Jeremy Diamond was saying just a short while ago that, I mean, this this tunnel is almost big enough or maybe big enough for vehicles to move through. I mean, that that that is a different kind of tunnel. There's no question about it. And General, today the IDF announced it's taking control of parts of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The Hamas run health ministry also reported an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza. What's your sense of things right now? I mean, President Biden has been concerned about what he's described as indiscriminate bombing in Gaza, but what's your sense of where things stand right now tonight? I don't I'm not in concurrence, Jim, with the the the indiscriminate bombing. It may be somewhat excessive and we could talk about that. But, you know, from the very beginning of this conflict, starting a weeks ago, you and I were talking about how they would start in northern Gaza, in Gaza City, and then go to potentially Haim Yunis, then to Karbala, where and then even down south into Rafah. The Israeli government has said this operation will take many more months, whereas many of the United States administration is saying they'd like to see it ended in terms of the kinetic operation by the end of December. I've said from the beginning, I don't think that's going to happen, given the size and strength of the Hamas terrorist groups that are in these subterranean tunnels. And we're seeing in each section of Gaza that there are more and more underground headquarters. And Hamas has been very diligent in terms of setting traps for the Israeli forces as they go through. So anyone that says, hey, we ought to shift from using airpower to ground and special operations forces, that's easy to say on the outside. But truthfully, with some of the constructs that we've seen, Hamas using these underground networks and some of the uses of civilian buildings have to be struck. I think it will continue on. Secretary Austin is going to discuss that with the Israeli government over the next couple of days. But I think we're going to see a continuation of these kind of strikes until Israel determines that Hamas is defeated. And I did want to ask you about the three Israeli hostages who were mistakenly killed by the IDF. We've talked to a variety of people this week. And so I certainly want to get your your take on all of this. When I spoke with the IDF spokesman, Jonathan Conricus, yesterday, I mean, he really didn't indicate that there's going to be a major shift in their tactics or rules of engagement. They're going to remind their soldiers that they may come across hostages from time to time who have escaped captivity and they need to be able to recognize that. But, I mean, the three men came out of a building shirtless, waving a white flag. They were shot anyway. The IDF says those troops were not following the proper rules of engagement. But Colonel Conricus was saying, look, you know, we have Hamas fighters who are pretending to be civilians, who are doing things to draw in IDF forces to entrap them and kill them. It is such a messy, chaotic battlefield I'm wondering, General, what's your advice on all this? Well, I don't have any advice, Jim, but truthfully, what I would say is Hamas and any terrorist organization is going to use deception and trickery. And you add to that the fact of the conditions of the battlefield, as you just said. And I would bet that the hostages, as they came out of the building, probably did not look like the Clean-Cut young men we see in their photos that have been appearing on air. They've been in captivity for two months. The soldiers, the Israeli soldiers who were always anxious in any kind of firefight with adrenaline surgeon, and especially depending on what their level of training experience is. You know, truthfully, Jim, I had a fratricide incident in a command I was in in Iraq. And it devastates the individuals who shoot their fellow citizens. And in this case, I'm sure it's not only devastated whoever engaged those three hostages but I would believe that this is rippled through the Israeli Defense Forces. And they are attempting to conduct their operations according to rules of engagement. But truthfully, as you just said, the conditions on this battlefield are extremely complex and complicated. You don't know who the enemy is When people hop out of buildings, especially buildings, as the Israelis have been showing, contain a vast amount of ammunition and they contain ambush sites. It's very difficult to differentiate. But I believe that the Israeli Defense Forces will review their rules of engagement. And I know their chief of staff has addressed this issue with all of their soldiers in the fight right now. But it's tough. It's really heartbreaking. Yeah, very heartbreaking. General Hertling, great to have you on as always. Thanks so much.",

The suspect posted at least one threat from the area where the university is located and also admitted to posting the threat, posting the threats in an interview with the FBI. CNN's Athena Jones, very latest on this. She also sat down with a group of Jewish high school students about this terrifying and dangerous rise in anti-Semitism. Athena, now that first and foremost after the arrest at Cornell, what is what is the latest that you're hearing? Well, we know that this suspect, Patrick Dye, is expected to appear this afternoon in court. They'll discuss, you know, his representation, whether he'll be able to be released on bail or not. But this all comes as Jews, Jewish people all across America are concerned about the rise in anti-Semitism. I sat down with five Jewish teenagers, and concerns about anti-Semitism are the very first thing that that came up in that discussion. Another thing that really struck me immediately upon sitting down with them is just what a strong connection each and every one of them has to Israel. Each of them has family and friends there. They've gone multiple times to visit Israel over the course of their life. They consider this a second home and they spoke about their concerns about how the war will impact their loved ones in Israel, how it affects their lives here in America, and how it will affect the world. It's a situation that hits close to home. We're such a tight knit community. This is like our family. It's this shock that's like consistent and you can't escape it. I started reaching out to people to check up, and it was hours later. I'm still checking up on people and there's still more people to reach out to and talk to and people that I was really worried about. What have the last few weeks been like being here in America, observing what's going on in Israel and Gaza? I think it's been this sort of balancing act of worrying about like, when's the other shoe going to drop here in America and caring for and like making sure to be a good support system for like my friends and family in Israel. Waiting for the other shoe to drop? How do you mean? I feel like right now in America, we're in kind of this grace period with Israel where Israel was attacked and the general feeling towards Israel is still fairly positive and that pity is not going to be there anymore. And I think that that's when bad things are going to start happening in America to Jews. I disagree with the fact that the majority of American sentiment is one of pro-Israel or pity or sympathy. I think now that, you know, Israel has been bombing Gaza and there have been attempts to get the hostages back and all this all that the military apparatus. They say the political response to the war has been that especially what they're seeing on social media. It's a very, I think, inherent Jewish value in times of grief to sit in your pain and sit in your discomfort and faster in prayer and community and acknowledge what's going on. And that's our way of dealing with grief and processing. And I think to have such raw pain be turned into something political is very, very difficult to deal with. It's an impossible situation when you've been attacked by this terror group that's also governing and hiding behind its own people. I can't, like watch innocent Palestinians die, but like, it's like you poke a bear and Hamas poked a bear and then went and hid behind a behind a bunch of little cubs. It's hard for me to hear. Free Gaza, a free Palestine, because that's not that Hamas is hurting Gaza's citizens just as much as it's hurting Israeli citizens, like being pro-Palestine or pro Gaza should not mean being pro Hamas. How do you think this ends. When you're working on the amount of precedent that there is with Israel, with Gaza, with the Palestinians, with Hamas? I don't foresee this ending in a way that will feel very final. Israel has lost the innocent civilians in Gaza have lost. Nobody can win a war like this. And so what does the end look like? It looks like loss. Where do you find the hope in a situation like this? I have no hope that this conflict will be resolved in the next century. Like not at all. I think this will be an almost immutable fact of the Middle East Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This is where I turn to religion and prayer. God, you know, really the core of Judaism. And that's that's helping me get through this. Frances Geller was planning to spend a gap year in Israel before going to college. That plan is now uncertain. I truly believe that perseverance is in our DNA. We've been on we've been around for all this time. They try to get rid of us. They won't. And how can you not believe that? That's who we are. Hopefulness and fighting. And it's undeniable. So a really powerful and important conversation with these teenagers. And another thing that struck me from this conversation is this overwhelming desire to help every one of them feels guilty that they can't do more from their perch here in America. One young man said that his best friend and he they live parallel lives until his best friend's family moved to Israel. And now his best friend is in a few months going to be joining the Israeli military. And here he is in America feeling like he can't really do much. So a lot of feelings of helplessness and guilt consuming them. Just to reinforce, these are high school students. I'm just amazed at their eloquence and their ability to put voice to the complexity of the pain and what they're living through, but also knowing that this started with a terror attack coming from Hamas. But my God, John. Yeah. And also living with the fear now that they feel increasingly under threat. I will say. Athena, terrific job. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks.",

                "Token": "Retired U.S. Army General David Petraeus, also the former director of the CIA. He has a brand new book titled Conflict The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine. General, always good to have you on. One of the things that struck me about the book, which is an area of expertize which is something that I hope the Israelis are reading is about urban combat and the 2004 battle of Fallujah, the largest of the Iraq war Bloody costly street by street. And we had General Kimmitt here not long ago and he was saying that what Israel is going to face, what the Israeli forces are going to face in Gaza will be probably even more grueling than Fallujah. What do you think it will be? Orders of magnitude more difficult. The enemy has had months to prepare the defenses. They'll undoubtedly employ improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers, car bombs, tunnels, a lot of infrastructure that they have. They know the territory very, very well. And it's many times the size of Fallujah. We did a number of urban operations over those years. And then more recently, we watched one that might be more appropriate as an analogy, which was the Iraqi security forces supported by a US led coalition clearing the Islamic State out of Mosul, a city about the same size as Gaza City. And again, it's very, very challenging fighting in this hospital bombing. And by the way, I'll take the side of the IDF spokesman any day over Hamas. Needless to say, there are in a democracy, the truth is going to come out. They know it. And they've done apparently a very good and thorough investigation quite quickly. But in the case of urban combat, you're going to have tremendous damage to civilian infrastructure. You're going to have considerable civilian loss. You're going to take a lot of friendly casualties. You don't just have to clear every building floor, a room basement tunnel. You have to leave substantial forces behind, or else the enemy will REINFELDT And you have to do this progressively sequentially. You have to clear and hold and then continue farther, spread the oil spot. In fact, it really should be thought of as a counterinsurgency operation, not just a conventional military operation, because you are fighting among the people and because of the importance of not overlooking what happens after Hamas is destroyed. And by the way, a spokesman today said they also intend to dismantle the Hamas political structure, the political wing that's different from the military wing which is the Hamas terrorists and also the Islamic Jihad terrorists. Right. But then the question is, what next? Who's going to take over? Who's going to oversee? There has to be nation building. There's going to be restoration of basic services, repair of damaged infrastructure, getting schools, markets, clinics all reopened. You know that we've learned all of that sometimes the hard way. We learned in the fight to Baghdad that you've got to have a very good plan with a lot of different assumptions, because once you take down the regime and you turn to the folks that said, just get us to Baghdad, Dave, we'll take it from there. That plan proved inadequate. So I think the big subject of discussion, I suspect already between the Israeli generals and the political authorities is about what comes after. They're going to take enormous casualties to do this. I believe that is right to destroy Hamas. But you can't have that for naught. This can't be another case where you mow the lawn all the way down to the dirt in this case. But then you pull back out and the remnants will be able to reconstitute themselves. So what follows? Could there be an interim international authority? What is it? I don't I doubt I mean, the ambassador told me Sunday that they do not want to reoccupy no. Gaza. So, I mean, I think the president has said don't do it. So it has to be some other. So what the United Nations or the Arab League or some group is going to have to fight because there will be an insurgency you know, they'll try to retake, control the remnants of Gaza and there will be of Hamas. There will be some of those there. So this is the real challenge, Jake. And I'm not sure it's getting quite enough attention. In the book, we talk about the importance of a strategic leader getting the big ideas right. This is crucial. Getting the strategy right. Vengeance is not a strategy And that's my next question. Component is some, but you have to do more. And that's my next question because I've been thinking about how and understandably so, but how immediate and swift the response by the Israeli military was in the aftermath of Hamas's barbaric terrorist attack on October 7th, which, of course, reminds me of nine 11. And you remember when I interviewed you when I did the documentary, about 20 years of war in Afghanistan. And I also interviewed General McChrystal for that same documentary. And he told me something interesting, and I want to get your your take on it, because I said, if you could go back, what would you do differently? Listen to your your colleague and friend, General McChrystal, right after the nine 11 attacks. I would have made a decision inside the U.S. government to do nothing substantive for a year. What I mean by nothing, no bombing, no strikes, etc. I would have gone around the world as the aggrieved party and built up a firm coalition for what what we do about al Qaeda. I would have done a mass effort to train Americans in Arabic Pashtu, Urdu, Dari, to get ourselves ready to do something that we knew would be very, very difficult. Now, I said to him, if you were a president, you also would be impeached for not doing it, for not doing anything after the nine 11 attack. He has a point, but but he has a point. And guys have a point. And I want you to talk about that, about the idea of you get you get horrifically hit, but you take a breath before responding. Yes. Keep in mind, this is much worse than nine elevenths in relative terms. It's like 35,000 people being killed. Jake, it's actually over 40,000 now because they're up to 1300. So. Yes. And so that response, the desire for vengeance is absolutely understandable. And there should be vengeance. There should be destruction of the organization that did this but not if you haven't thought through what comes after that. And that's, I think, the component of this that certainly is not yet visible. I'm sure that they're wrestling with this. I'm sure part of the reason the president is going to Amman, Jordan, is to start discussing that. And one would hope that some of the Arab countries in particular in the region that have often expressed sympathy for the Palestinians, will contribute to some kind of effort that would enable the rebuilding and so in Prime Minister Netanyahu, I think, should provide a vision for what life will be like for the Palestinian people, not just in Gaza, by the way, but also in the West Bank, something that has just been looming out there for quite some time In any event, let's let's let this be a catalyst. Remember, after the 73 war, all of a sudden you had peace between the two warring factions between Egypt and Israel and arrangements with Syria and Jordan as well. Of course, a very different situation. Henry Kissinger, I was just in a meeting with him. He could call for people and get that deal done. President of Egypt Assad in Damascus, the king in Amman, and Golda Meir. Yeah, there's nobody here to do that. So you've got this is much more challenging in that regard. And I'd contended the military task here is more challenging as well. It's not tank on, tank out in the desert. Certainly, there was an existential moment for Israel when Egypt achieved the early success. But once that was resolved, that was a straightforward military operation. This is much more than just an offensive operation, a clear hold and build. You have to then have what's going to follow. Absolutely. Retired General David Petraeus, maybe they should call you. You'd be you'd be good to help this. The book is Conflict the Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine. Please check it out.",

                "Lemma": "Retired U.S. Army General David Petraeus, also the former director of the CIA. He has a brand new book titled Conflict The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine. General, always good to have you on. One of the things that struck me about the book, which is an area of expertize which is something that I hope the Israelis are reading is about urban combat and the 2004 battle of Fallujah, the largest of the Iraq war Bloody costly street by street. And we had General Kimmitt here not long ago and he was saying that what Israel is going to face, what the Israeli forces are going to face in Gaza will be probably even more grueling than Fallujah. What do you think it will be? Orders of magnitude more difficult. The enemy has had months to prepare the defenses. They'll undoubtedly employ improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers, car bombs, tunnels, a lot of infrastructure that they have. They know the territory very, very well. And it's many times the size of Fallujah. We did a number of urban operations over those years. And then more recently, we watched one that might be more appropriate as an analogy, which was the Iraqi security forces supported by a US led coalition clearing the Islamic State out of Mosul, a city about the same size as Gaza City. And again, it's very, very challenging fighting in this hospital bombing. And by the way, I'll take the side of the IDF spokesman any day over Hamas. Needless to say, there are in a democracy, the truth is going to come out. They know it. And they've done apparently a very good and thorough investigation quite quickly. But in the case of urban combat, you're going to have tremendous damage to civilian infrastructure. You're going to have considerable civilian loss. You're going to take a lot of friendly casualties. You don't just have to clear every building floor, a room basement tunnel. You have to leave substantial forces behind, or else the enemy will REINFELDT And you have to do this progressively sequentially. You have to clear and hold and then continue farther, spread the oil spot. In fact, it really should be thought of as a counterinsurgency operation, not just a conventional military operation, because you are fighting among the people and because of the importance of not overlooking what happens after Hamas is destroyed. And by the way, a spokesman today said they also intend to dismantle the Hamas political structure, the political wing that's different from the military wing which is the Hamas terrorists and also the Islamic Jihad terrorists. Right. But then the question is, what next? Who's going to take over? Who's going to oversee? There has to be nation building. There's going to be restoration of basic services, repair of damaged infrastructure, getting schools, markets, clinics all reopened. You know that we've learned all of that sometimes the hard way. We learned in the fight to Baghdad that you've got to have a very good plan with a lot of different assumptions, because once you take down the regime and you turn to the folks that said, just get us to Baghdad, Dave, we'll take it from there. That plan proved inadequate. So I think the big subject of discussion, I suspect already between the Israeli generals and the political authorities is about what comes after. They're going to take enormous casualties to do this. I believe that is right to destroy Hamas. But you can't have that for naught. This can't be another case where you mow the lawn all the way down to the dirt in this case. But then you pull back out and the remnants will be able to reconstitute themselves. So what follows? Could there be an interim international authority? What is it? I don't I doubt I mean, the ambassador told me Sunday that they do not want to reoccupy no. Gaza. So, I mean, I think the president has said don't do it. So it has to be some other. So what the United Nations or the Arab League or some group is going to have to fight because there will be an insurgency you know, they'll try to retake, control the remnants of Gaza and there will be of Hamas. There will be some of those there. So this is the real challenge, Jake. And I'm not sure it's getting quite enough attention. In the book, we talk about the importance of a strategic leader getting the big ideas right. This is crucial. Getting the strategy right. Vengeance is not a strategy And that's my next question. Component is some, but you have to do more. And that's my next question because I've been thinking about how and understandably so, but how immediate and swift the response by the Israeli military was in the aftermath of Hamas's barbaric terrorist attack on October 7th, which, of course, reminds me of nine 11. And you remember when I interviewed you when I did the documentary, about 20 years of war in Afghanistan. And I also interviewed General McChrystal for that same documentary. And he told me something interesting, and I want to get your your take on it, because I said, if you could go back, what would you do differently? Listen to your your colleague and friend, General McChrystal, right after the nine 11 attacks. I would have made a decision inside the U.S. government to do nothing substantive for a year. What I mean by nothing, no bombing, no strikes, etc. I would have gone around the world as the aggrieved party and built up a firm coalition for what what we do about al Qaeda. I would have done a mass effort to train Americans in Arabic Pashtu, Urdu, Dari, to get ourselves ready to do something that we knew would be very, very difficult. Now, I said to him, if you were a president, you also would be impeached for not doing it, for not doing anything after the nine 11 attack. He has a point, but but he has a point. And guys have a point. And I want you to talk about that, about the idea of you get you get horrifically hit, but you take a breath before responding. Yes. Keep in mind, this is much worse than nine elevenths in relative terms. It's like 35,000 people being killed. Jake, it's actually over 40,000 now because they're up to 1300. So. Yes.

                "Token": "Former CNN war correspondent Arwa Damon has been to the enclave three times during this war with her charity, Inara, and she says that each trip reveals that there is, quote, less aid and more need. I reached her this week from Daryl Balla on the Gaza coast. Arwa Damon, welcome back to the program from Gaza. Thank you for having me on. Appreciate it. Well, last time you were here, after one of your trips, you were in the studio and you said essentially, you know, things just get exponentially worse. I asked you last time how it was. What is it like this time compared to when you were last there? It's a sorrow that is eclipsing any kind of sorrow I've seen before. It's misery beyond the scope of misery. It's less humanitarian assistance, less ability to support those who are in need and an increasingly growing population that extends to just about every single human being in this wretched stretch of land who cannot cope with even the most basic of things. Christiane, we, international aid organizations and local ones have been reduced to trying to advocate for something as simple as a bar of soap. Honestly, it's become a lot. It's terrible to hear you say that. And I know you tweeted that. Just explain what you mean by that and what what difference in life and death would soap make right now? So the bare bones of it is that access to soap and the ability to maintain a certain level of hygiene, reduces the spread of disease by 40%. What we are seeing right now is a significant increase in diseases like hepatitis A. I went down to Nasser Hospital, and the head of the pediatric department there told me that two children a week are dying just in that hospital because of hepatitis A. It also means meningitis is spreading. It also means that this horrific skin disease called impetigo, which is especially prevalent in children and highly contagious and can potentially be lethal because if left untreated, it can lead to kidney failure, which can lead to death is also all over the place. These are all diseases that can be controlled, which in return would empty a bed space in these hospitals to be able to deal with the catastrophic injuries that they're getting from the bomb blasts. But there's no soap. We go into these camps and families are begging us for soap. What are they use instead of soap? Well, one family I spoke to said that they were going down to the beach, getting sand, mixing it with a little bit of salt and lemon. And that's how they've been cleaning themselves for the last five months. So if the cease fire, which we've all been advocating for, to get more humanitarian aid and obviously hasn't materialized for the last ten months, we are now trying to simplify it down to soap. Oh my goodness. I mean, that's really awful to hear you say that. and I just need to say, because there's a report that actually where you are, I think near Deborah. Right. There's the coast. There is apparently showing up all brown and murky because of massive sewage spills. So these people are going there also to try to get clean, but there's not even clean seawater. And Christiane, what people don't realize when they hear about evacuation orders is, yes, we are very familiar with that horrendous image of people just carrying what they can. But each evacuation order impacts organizations ability to distribute and produce safe, clean water. So the most recent evacuation orders over the last two weeks from hand hygiene units reduced the population's access to clean water by 70%. So that has already had an impact on what people are going through. But if we extrapolate beyond that and look at what's happening in the ICUs, I was in the ICU at hospital. There's a 13 year old boy with severe burn injuries. He is in the ICU because he has a blood infection and signs of early sepsis, because there weren't enough bandages to keep his wounds properly clean. There was a little year and a half old girl who is not stabilizing from her catastrophic injuries, because the small piece of plastic called a tracheotomy or something is not available in her size. Now, we were luckily able to secure some for her and deliver them to the hospital. But if this little girl wakes up, Christiane, she's going to wake up and find out that she's an orphan. Oh, no. Oh, this is just so awful. We hear about the huge number of children who have become orphans. We also hear a polio reported for the first time in 25 years in the Gaza Strip. Apparently, a ten month old baby was partially paralyzed. I don't know whether you've been able to hear from the other humanitarians, the U.N., but apparently they're trying to start even in the midst of this war and destruction of a polio vaccine program. Is that possible? Yeah, they have to. And, you know, there is movement in terms of, you know, getting a cold chain in, getting the vaccine in and training of people to be able to deliver the vaccine. The plan is on the table, but the plan, absolutely, 100% cannot be implemented unless there is some sort of a pause in the fighting that is taking place. And if that pause does not happen, and if polio starts to spread, we are going to start seeing and hearing more and more horrific stories of more and more children ending up paralyzed of something that, again, is completely preventable. I do not have the words to begin to describe just how hard it is to provide people with even the most basic of items, because things are not available. I just came back from a fresh vegetable distribution, to a couple of the shelters that that we work with, some of the families, and we purchased this locally, by the way, because aid isn't really moving in, but commercial trucks are. We purchased some of these items at 20 times their original price either. Doesn't matter because these families had not eaten a fresh vegetable for anywhere from five months, and then at best, one month was the last time they had had fresh vegetables. Oh, listen, I mean, is the fighting worse now than it was two, three, four months ago? I mean, the Israelis seem to say they're busy degrading Hamas. They're in these cease fire hostage swap negotiations. and yet, as you say, aid is not getting in. And we can quote also this week, the U.N. said humanitarian efforts ground to a halt because of new Israeli evacuation orders. The International Rescue Committee also had to stop aid during these evacuation orders. It I mean, it's getting worse. The international community says it's trying to get aid in, but you're saying is practically at a trickle. At best, it's less than a trickle. It's like that tiny little drop that barely comes out of the faucet. And we also had to suspend our usual sort of programs and activities for a few days, because two of our staff and five of the shelters that we worked with were under evacuation orders. And I myself have, moved around a couple of times in the last two weeks that that I've been here. The problem we have with aid is the same as what it was two months ago, but significantly worse. We cannot access the aid that Israel permits to enter Kerem Shalom, because the route that Israel designates for us to use to get that aid is basically run by looters and criminal gangs, and Israel is not securing that route, nor is it providing us with alternate routes. There are alternatives that exist. We can use what's known as defense route, where in theory, Israel had at one point stated that it would allow 40 trucks to go through there, mostly trucks carrying medicine and fuel. These days, on a lucky day. And it's not even daily you're getting about 18 trucks moving through there, items that get into the north through eddies right now. So that's soap. I've been talking about those hygiene kits. They actually do get into the northern part of Gaza, but we are not permitted to move them from the north to the south. So we can't even scale up what's being sent through the north. Why they will not give us a straight answer. We do not get straight answers as to why we cannot properly move aid from the South. So, for example, fresh vegetables, because we have them down here, we can buy them and send them to the north. Nor are we allowed to move what gets into the north. Hygiene kits down for the population in the south.",

                "Lemma": "Former CNN war correspondent Arwa Damon has been to the enclave three times during this war with her charity, Inara, and she says that each trip reveals that there is, quote, less aid and more need. I reached her this week from Daryl Balla on the Gaza coast. Arwa Damon, welcome back to the program from Gaza. Thank you for having me on. Appreciate it. Well, last time you were here, after one of your trips, you were in the studio and you said essentially, you know, things just get exponentially worse. I asked you last time how it was. What is it like this time compared to when you were last there? It's a sorrow that is eclipsing any kind of sorrow I've seen before. It's misery beyond the scope of misery. It's less humanitarian assistance, less ability to support those who are in need and an increasingly growing population that extends to just about every single human being in this wretched stretch of land who cannot cope with even the most basic of things. Christiane, we, international aid organizations and local ones have been reduced to trying to advocate for something as simple as a bar of soap. Honestly, it's become a lot. It's terrible to hear you say that. And I know you tweeted that. Just explain what you mean by that and what what difference in life and death would soap make right now? So the bare bones of it is that access to soap and the ability to maintain a certain level of hygiene, reduces the spread of disease by 40%. What we are seeing right now is a significant increase in diseases like hepatitis A. I went down to Nasser Hospital, and the head of the pediatric department there told me that two children a week are dying just in that hospital because of hepatitis A. It also means meningitis is spreading. It also means that this horrific skin disease called impetigo, which is especially prevalent in children and highly contagious and can potentially be lethal because if left untreated, it can lead to kidney failure, which can lead to death is also all over the place. These are all diseases that can be controlled, which in return would empty a bed space in these hospitals to be able to deal with the catastrophic injuries that they're getting from the bomb blasts. But there's no soap. We go into these camps and families are begging us for soap. What are they use instead of soap? Well, one family I spoke to said that they were going down to the beach, getting sand, mixing it with a little bit of salt and lemon. And that's how they've been cleaning themselves for the last five months. So if the cease fire, which we've all been advocating for, to get more humanitarian aid and obviously hasn't materialized for the last ten months, we are now trying to simplify it down to soap. Oh my goodness. I mean, that's really awful to hear you say that. and I just need to say, because there's a report that actually where you are, I think near Deborah. Right. There's the coast. There is apparently showing up all brown and murky because of massive sewage spills. So these people are going there also to try to get clean, but there's not even clean seawater. And Christiane, what people don't realize when they hear about evacuation orders is, yes, we are very familiar with that horrendous image of people just carrying what they can. But each evacuation order impacts organizations ability to distribute and produce safe, clean water. So the most recent evacuation orders over the last two weeks from hand hygiene units reduced the population's access to clean water by 70%. So that has already had an impact on what people are going through. But if we extrapolate beyond that and look at what's happening in the ICUs, I was in the ICU at hospital. There's a 13 year old boy with severe burn injuries. He is in the ICU because he has a blood infection and signs of early sepsis, because there weren't enough bandages to keep his wounds properly clean. There was a little year and a half old girl who is not stabilizing from her catastrophic injuries, because the small piece of plastic called a tracheotomy or something is not available in her size. Now, we were luckily able to secure some for her and deliver them to the hospital. But if this little girl wakes up, Christiane, she's going to wake up and find out that she's an orphan. Oh, no. Oh, this is just so awful. We hear about the huge number of children who have become orphans. We also hear a polio reported for the first time in 25 years in the Gaza Strip. Apparently, a ten month old baby was partially paralyzed. I don't know whether you've been able to hear from the other humanitarians, the U.N., but apparently they're trying to start even in the midst of this war and destruction of a polio vaccine program. Is that possible? Yeah, they have to. And, you know, there is movement in terms of, you know, getting a cold chain in, getting the vaccine in and training of people to be able to deliver the vaccine.

The Israeli military says it struck Hamas terrorists operating command center embedded in the humanitarian safe zone in Khan Yunis. Hamas denies its fighters were present. Civil Gaza civil defense officials say entire families disappeared into the sand. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says civilians in the alma area had no way to escape. If you try and picture the area, these are the most crowded surroundings you could imagine. There's barely room to walk in between tents that are crowded on the beaches. It was late at night. Colleagues heard what they believe was with the strikes and and and just absolutely devastating. No way whatsoever that the civilians in these areas were able to protect themselves. While Israeli forces have previously here is almost in their pursuit of Hamas commanders, a strike in mid-July killed at least 90 Palestinians. Or for more. CNN's Matthew Chance, monitoring this from Tel Aviv in Israel and I know that the detail still coming in. But what more do we know about this strike in an area? As I say, previously struck by the IDF in pursuit, they say, of Hamas terrorists back in July. Well, Becky, I mean, first thing, first thing you can notice, one of the first things you notice as we look at the video and the images that are coming out of the Amira Sea region in the Gaza Strip is that this was a massive attack. I mean, the the weaponry that was involved is extremely powerful. Clearly, some of the craters that have been left by the strikes are seven meters deep. And so an extraordinary amount of damage has been caused in what would have been a densely populated sort of area humanitarian zone in the Gaza Strip. And of course, civilians and ordinary people are again paying that very high price. Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's rescue workers scrambled for survivors. Eyewitnesses say the Israeli strikes targeted what was meant to be a safe zone in the southern Gaza Strip, ripping through tents and makeshift shelters, leaving deep craters. Dozens of killed and injured people, Judy. And they told us this area was safe, says this man. I swear the people here were just normal, he says, not fighters. And by daylight you can see the extent of the destruction. Israel's military says it conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists, operating a command and control center inside this humanitarian zone, and IDF statement says prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians. But this was a heavily populated area and civilians were caught up in the powerful blasts. So many. This man says his two daughters were completely buried under the sand. Only one survived, he says, and he says he found the body parts of his neighbors strewn around. This 12 year old girl is nursing a broken shoulder, suffered when her tent collapsed, she says, trapping her and her mother inside. Good thing I was scared because the strikes were so close, she says. A long walk for his rail accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields, and insists the Israeli military takes extensive measures to enable civilians in Gaza to avoid combat zones. But there's little real security in this brutal war. Well, Becky, as you mentioned, this exact humanitarian zone, this camp had been struck before back in July with Palestinian health officials saying that 90 people were killed back then, Israeli military saying they were targeting Hamas militants. But the health ministry in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, of course, saying that these half of that figure were women and children. So again, underlining just what a poor state of security exists inside the Gaza Strip. Matthew, meantime, the IDF has said an investigation has been launched into the death last week of an American killed in the West Bank. Now, the US secretary of state has just weighed in on that. So I want you and our viewers just to have a listen to what Anthony Blinken has just said. No one, no one should be shot and killed for attending a protest. No one should have to put their life at risk just for freely expressing their views. in our judgment, Israeli security forces need to make some fundamental changes in the way that they operate in the West Bank, including changes to their rules of engagement. Well, I assume we haven't yet had an IDF statement in response to Anthony Blinken. His words, which were in the past couple of hours. But what are the IDF saying at this point? They've said that they've launched the investigation. Do we have results of that? the investigation has been launched, certainly. to try and get to the bottom of it. There's been a sort of preliminary announcement by the Israeli Defense Forces saying that they believe that the killing of this American Turkish activist, Aisha, or Ezgi AG, was unintentional. And indirect. and they said that actually what they've learned is that that the shots were fired at one of the protesters, that would have been had been hurling stones and burning tires in front of Israeli forces, in the West Bank. but, you know, we're expecting more information to come out in the hours ahead. There's going to be a briefing shortly with the, the chief spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Force. And so we'll get some more, more clarity. But clearly, the the United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, they're not happy at all, that, you know, another American. And there's been a couple who have been killed in the West Bank while protesting. To recap what he said. And no one should be killed for attending a protest. And, of course, he called on Israel later on, to fundamentally change the way it operates inside the West Bank.

Israeli forces report close quarters combat with Hamas fighters saying they are destroying terrorists infrastructure. Hundreds of thousands of people, meantime, are fleeing their homes once again under yet new evacuation orders. Gaza's civil defense says bodies are trapped under buildings and lying in the streets, but it's just too dangerous for crews to try and retrieve them. The Palestinian Red Crescent says all of its medical clinics in Gaza and Gaza City are now out of service. You want to go to our Jeremy Diamond now for more is live for us in Jerusalem. You know what a nightmare repeating itself here again. I mean, evacuations ordered. And again, it's a familiar horror, right? Where the heck do these people go? What more are you learning about exactly? The Israeli operation that is underway and what it means for civilians. Well, you're right, Paula. Tens of thousands of Palestinians are once again on the move. We have seen over the course of just the last week, evacuation orders for parts of Khan Younis and then in northern Gaza, several evacuation orders in different neighborhoods of Gaza City. And that is where the Israeli military has been concentrating its military operations over the last 48 hours or so inside Gaza City neighborhoods, where the Israeli military says, that, Hamas has returned to areas that the Israeli military had previously cleared. and that is what we are continuing to see in Gaza, absent a long term strategy for the governance, an alternative to Hamas's governance in Gaza, the Israeli military going back into areas that it had previously withdrawn from. And not only is that resulting in increased fighting, increased artillery shelling, airstrikes, but also, of course, the impact to civilians, not only those who are killed and wounded in the fighting, rescue workers having trouble actually reaching the dead and the wounded as a result of the heavy fighting. And then, of course, as we were talking about the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, in some cases of people who are, moving to areas of central Gaza, to that almost the coastal area where they are simply finding that there are not enough resources for the number of people who are currently displaced in Gaza, even things like tents, are, running in short supply in Gaza at the moment. And for now, the only salve that they could potentially get is if indeed there is a cease fire agreement. We are seeing those negotiations continuing this week in Cairo as well as in Doha, Qatar. But for now, no deal as of yet. You know, the other aspect you that you've been following closely has been whether or not this will also be a conflict on another front, Israel's northern border. What did you learn by visiting? Well, late last, last week we traveled to Shula, which is just a few hundred feet away from the Lebanese border, to get a sense of just how tense things are there and to see some of the destruction wrought by Hezbollah's anti-tank missiles. They're going to see us right when we get up there. And we have three minutes. Colonel Jordan Hertzberg is talking about Hezbollah. After three minutes, though, they can start the fire. So a very quick he's taking us to an Israeli community on the front lines of Israel's simmering conflict with the Lebanese militant group up a winding mountain road, past a roadblock in a security fence and into the village of Shula, which sits right on the Lebanese border. We've just entered the village of Shula. This is, a community of about 300 people normally, but right now it's just an absolute ghost town. Let's go quick. The three minute countdown starts as soon as we are within line of sight of southern Lebanon. Look how close you are to the border here where Hezbollah militants armed with anti-tank missiles are closely watching the border prepare to fire once again. This house was hit by a high tech missile right here, past the window. Two homes, one next to the other, hit in the same attack. According to the Israeli military, this is one of the most dangerous places in northern Israel. Right now, we're in Shula, and you can see the Lebanese border just right across there, across from those concrete barriers. We're just a few hundred feet. And what that means is that we are within range of those anti-tank guided missiles. And that is exactly what has wrought this destruction on this civilian home. The threat of anti-tank missiles is part of why Israel wants to push Hezbollah back to the Litani River, about 18 miles north of the border, outside the range of those missiles. Okay, we have 35 seconds. We've been here for three minutes. The colonel has been watching his watch the entire time that we've been here. And now he's telling us it's time to go. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones at northern Israel since October 8th. Israel has responded with air strike after airstrike, devastating parts of southern Lebanon, where more than 90,000 people have fled their homes since October. In northern Israel, about 60,000 Israelis have been displaced. People like Ori Eliyahu and his nine dogs. To this day, leader. His grandfather was among the first people. Israel settled in Shula in the late 1960s, and after spending his summers there as a child, Ori decided to move there. Meaning there still is a special place for you. It's my heart to be honest. If you could return to Shula, you would. Of course I wouldn't. I would have, and the first moment I would have been to. Yeah. But he says that may not be the case for families with children. I don't think that there is a condition that will make them come back, because whenever they know the tree symbolizes, like Hamas can do what they did in October 7th and attack them, they want to be with them. And there is no real solution because a big wall might ruin everything. A big war is exactly what the Israeli military is preparing for. Our division has been training for this war for a long, long time. Whether that war materializes is unclear, but for Colonel Hertzberg, the objective is obvious get Israel's northern residents back into their homes. Whether it happens before a major ground operation or after ground operation. I can't tell you I'm in the tactical open mind of the political level or the policy level, but the people are going to come back sooner than later. And, Paula, the situation along that border still remains very, very tense. And it's not clear yet whether it will blow up into that all out war that has been feared. What we do know, though, is those cease fire negotiations happening this week in Doha, Qatar. They could not only, unlock a cease fire in Gaza, but they could also potentially unlock a broader peace in the region. Yeah. And as you pointed out in your report, tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border want to get back to their lives. it's obviously an agricultural hub as well. And we'll wait to see if there is progress on these cease fire talks. Jeremy Diamond for us. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.",

                "Token": "&gt;&gt; CNN's Becky Anderson in Doha are, Qatar, we appreciate it. Senior adviser to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and ambassador to the united Kingdom, mark Greg is with us in tel aviv. First, let me ask you, military people in Israel not just the United States have their own language. When the idf says that military ground excursion has expanded, ground operations expanded, I didn't know, what does this mean that ground operation is expanding. Doesn't mean Israeli troops, soldiers on the ground in gaza? ? &gt;&gt; I'm not gonna go into anything operational especially if the operation is ongoing. But I can say that, yes, we're beefing up the pressure on hamas. That pressure increase and continue to increase until we achieve our goal. &gt;&gt; Is there are a ground, ground operations expanded does that mean it's happening it's what it sounds like to me again I don't speak military lingo whether it's in the Pentagon, idf what is it mean? &gt;&gt; I said a moment ago operations are ongoing. &gt;&gt; I still don't know that means. &gt;&gt; What about this barrage of airstrikes going on in gaza right now. &gt;&gt; I cannot go into anything technical, I can say this we are focused on our goal which is the elimination of hamas, the destruction of its military capabilities, military machine, and the end of its political control over the gaza strip. &gt;&gt; The idf released earlier toy, a 3D map of command and control center of hamas, the idf says it's under a hospital in gaza. It's not photographs, it's a graphic depiction, where does it where it is that information come from? &gt;&gt; That information is enclave, based on Israeli intelligence. If you ask the gazans who are honest with you, they'll tell you for years they've known that how mask uses hospitals, in this case a sherpa hospital for their command and control. The idf spokesperson and people in gaza must have seen it, when the war started on the 7th of October with that massacre, they expected Israel to strike back. There was a surge of hamas activists, terrorists, scores of them finding shelter. &gt;&gt; So, obviously, it's been known and it's been reported, Anderson's been to gaza, it's known that hamas fires rockets from civilian centers from apartments, et cetera -- &gt;&gt; From schools, U.N. Facilities. &gt;&gt; It's been reported, it's not just idf claiming it but it's been reported by independent journalist on the ground. This is real consider hospitals to be targets, there are also as you will acknowledge, patients, doctors, nurses in these hospitals. &gt;&gt; We were pointing out the facts, we want the world to understand the enemy that we're up against. A ruthless enemy that has been reported widely, has no trouble massacring Israeli civilians, they did so in all the gruesome reality that we saw on October seven. They have no qualms whatsoever about impending themselves and humanitarian buildings like hospitals. Which it shows us exactly what we're up against. When this is over and we have defeated hamas, we've destroyed it's military machine, we've removed it from the position of power it holds in gaza today. I think not only we doing Israelis of flavored freeing these terrorists from the south, or doing the people of gaza favor, or freeing them from this extremist dictatorship run by a bunch of cutthroat terrorists. &gt;&gt; Who takes over in gaza when and if you defeat hamas? Who takes over? &gt;&gt; We will defeat hamas, will eliminate them. &gt;&gt; Who takes over? &gt;&gt; We have contingency plans. We're looking at different scenarios, we've been discussing them with friends and allies, like Washington, at this stage I cannot go into details. The focus at the moment is defeating hamas. And anything is superior, preferable to continue hamas ruling in gaza. We've seen what it brings, it brings them a spare we saw on Israel and October seven. We don't want to go back there. &gt;&gt; Senior hamas official says hamas is ready to -- defeat troops if they enter gaza. He went on to say, quote, the resistance is ready. What I laid out what your soldiers are gonna be facing in gaza, it's it is, the challenges this vast network of 200 kilometers of tunnels that they've been building for 20 years. It's very sophisticated, the defense minister said to me earlier today, all the money going to gaza over the years not to build university, not to build factories, to build tunnels and by rockets. A ruthless terrorist group Wellington blow themselves up and do anything, use their own people as a human camouflage, urban where fair or the toughest warfare there is, 2 million civilians you do not want to Cal, you don't want to hurt them, you're unfortunately killing them. But you do not want to. We're making an effort not to like your killing a lot of them. This is a task, it's seeming impossible and you are sending soldiers and duet. &gt;&gt; Obviously, -- &gt;&gt; On top of a humanitarian crisis ongoing. &gt;&gt; First of all, the entire situation wherein is precisely because hamas attacked us on October 7th, were responding to I have no doubt that we're going to battle facing risks, you're 100 percent correct. The enemy is horrific and it's barbarity, it's fanaticism, and it's disregard rules of war, that's clear. The young soldiers going, you need to do this why, the current status quo, this terrorist I.S.I.S. Enclave in our southern border is unsustainable. We will not live like that any longer. We saw what they are capable of doing. We saw a gruesome, terrible horrific violence. We refuse to live with that neighbor anymore. We are now going to a redo",

That pressure increase and continue to increase until we achieve our goal. &gt;&gt; Is there are a ground, ground operations expanded does that mean it's happening it's what it sounds like to me again I don't speak military lingo whether it's in the Pentagon, idf what is it mean? &gt;&gt; I said a moment ago operations are ongoing. &gt;&gt; I still don't know that means. &gt;&gt; What about this barrage of airstrikes going on in gaza right now. &gt;&gt; I cannot go into anything technical, I can say this we are focused on our goal which is the elimination of hamas, the destruction of its military capabilities, military machine, and the end of its political control over the gaza strip. &gt;&gt; The idf released earlier toy, a 3D map of command and control center of hamas, the idf says it's under a hospital in gaza. It's not photographs, it's a graphic depiction, where does it where it is that information come from? &gt;&gt; That information is enclave, based on Israeli intelligence. If you ask the gazans who are honest with you, they'll tell you for years they've known that how mask uses hospitals, in this case a sherpa hospital for their command and control. The idf spokesperson and people in gaza must have seen it, when the war started on the 7th of October with that massacre, they expected Israel to strike back. There was a surge of hamas activists, terrorists, scores of them finding shelter. &gt;&gt; So, obviously, it's been known and it's been reported, Anderson's been to gaza, it's known that hamas fires rockets from civilian centers from apartments, et cetera -- &gt;&gt; From schools, U.N. Facilities. &gt;&gt; It's been reported, it's not just idf claiming it but it's been reported by independent journalist on the ground. This is real consider hospitals to be targets, there are also as you will acknowledge, patients, doctors, nurses in these hospitals. &gt;&gt; We were pointing out the facts, we want the world to understand the enemy that we're up against. A ruthless enemy that has been reported widely, has no trouble massacring Israeli civilians, they did so in all the gruesome reality that we saw on October seven. They have no qualms whatsoever about impending themselves and humanitarian buildings like hospitals. Which it shows us exactly what we're up against. When this is over and we have defeated hamas, we've destroyed it's military machine, we've removed it from the position of power it holds in gaza today. I think not only we doing Israelis of flavored freeing these terrorists from the south, or doing the people of gaza favor, or freeing them from this extremist dictatorship run by a bunch of cutthroat terrorists. &gt;&gt; Who takes over in gaza when and if you defeat hamas? Who takes over? &gt;&gt; We will defeat hamas, will eliminate them. &gt;&gt; Who takes over? &gt;&gt; We have contingency plans. We're looking at different scenarios, we've been discussing them with friends and allies, like Washington, at this stage I cannot go into details. The focus at the moment is defeating hamas. And anything is superior, preferable to continue hamas ruling in gaza. We've seen what it brings, it brings them a spare we saw on Israel and October seven. We don't want to go back there. &gt;&gt; Senior hamas official says hamas is ready to -- defeat troops if they enter gaza. He went on to say, quote, the resistance is ready. What I laid out what your soldiers are gonna be facing in gaza, it's it is, the challenges this vast network of 200 kilometers of tunnels that they've been building for 20 years. It's very sophisticated, the defense minister said to me earlier today, all the money going to gaza over the years not to build university, not to build factories, to build tunnels and by rockets. A ruthless terrorist group Wellington blow themselves up and do anything, use their own people as a human camouflage, urban where fair or the toughest warfare there is, 2 million civilians you do not want to Cal, you don't want to hurt them, you're unfortunately killing them. But you do not want to. We're making an effort not to like your killing a lot of them. This is a task, it's seeming impossible and you are sending soldiers and duet. &gt;&gt; Obviously, -- &gt;&gt; On top of a humanitarian crisis ongoing. &gt;&gt; First of all, the entire situation wherein is precisely because hamas attacked us on October 7th, were responding to I have no doubt that we're going to battle facing risks, you're 100 percent correct. The enemy is horrific and it's barbarity, it's fanaticism, and it's disregard rules of war, that's clear. The young soldiers going, you need to do this why, the current status quo, this terrorist I.S.I.S. Enclave in our southern border is unsustainable. We will not live like that any longer. We saw what they are capable of doing. We saw a gruesome, terrible horrific violence. We refuse to live with that neighbor anymore. We are now going to a redo"

                "Token": "81% of Americans over the age of 65 feel the response by the Israeli government is fully justified. But just 27% of Americans 18 to 34 years old feel that way. The humanitarian crisis is also top of mind for many Americans. 71% of Americans feel a lot of sympathy for the people of Israel. 41% feel a lot of sympathy for the Palestinian people. Former U.N. ambassador and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley joins us now. Ambassador Haley, thanks so much for joining us. If you were president right now, would you consider using the U.S. special operations to rescue American hostages being held in Gaza? You just heard Jake Sullivan say that one of the complications with that is we don't know exactly where the hostages are, but I'm wondering how much you would consider such a thing. Thanks for having me, Jake. You know, I think it's important you have to tell hard truth to Americans. And and when you're talking about this, you know, when you show those percentages of what people think and what they think we should do, you have to be honest with them. This is messy. Right. I mean, we desperately want to get those American hostages out. But if you saw those kids in the hands of those terrorists, like with a mom heart, it made me sick to my stomach for all those parents having to see their children in those terrorists hands. So of course, we want them out. But why is it so easy that we can do that? It's because we don't know where they are. And I have been in those tunnels that are massive, that are sophisticated and that Hamas uses to hide equipment and ammunition and to do their dirty work and maybe to have those hostages. But where are those tunnels? They're underneath hospitals. They're underneath schools. They're in hard to find places. So this is incredibly tough. I feel, for the Israeli families. I feel for the American families, and I feel for any other families who've lost a loved one or have someone in a hostage situation, because it's really bleak right now. And it's hard for anyone to feel good about this. We just showed images that your your office gave us of when you visited Israel in 2017 and the IDF took you to those tunnels near the kibbutz in as well. You said that because those tunnels in Gaza are near civilian sites, it's going to get bad. It's already pretty bad. Obviously, there are more than 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza. More than half of them are children. Do you think the U.S., Israel, Egypt needs to be doing more to help these innocent Palestinian civilians get out of harm's way, although you just heard Jake Sullivan say one of the problems is Hamas is keeping the civilians in Gaza. They don't want them to leave. There are a couple of things at play here. Hamas is going to do everything they can to not have them leave because guess what? They want them all to die. One, they want to use them as human shields, but two, they want to blame Israel and show images of dead children and say, look at what Israel did. But don't ever forget what Hamas did. Don't ever forget those girls running for their life. Don't ever forget those babies that were killed in cribs. Don't ever forget the people that they were dragging through the streets. And what were they saying, Jake? They were saying death to Israel. Death to America. That's who we're dealing with. But I dealt with this at the United Nations. You're going to hear all of those Arab countries vilify Israel for what's about to happen. You're going to hear all of them say, how dare you not do more for the Palestinian people? And you know what? We should care about the Palestinian citizens, especially the innocent ones, because they didn't ask for this. But where are the Arab countries? Where are they? Where is Qatar? Where is Lebanon? Where is Jordan? Where is Egypt? Do you know we give Egypt over $1,000,000,000 a year. Why aren't they opening the gates? Why aren't they taking the Palestinians? You know why? Because they know they can't vet them and they don't want Hamas in their neighborhood. So why would Israel want them in their neighborhood? So let's be honest with what's going on. The Arab countries aren't doing anything to help the Palestinians because they don't trust who is right, who is good, who is evil, and they don't want it in their country. So they're going to come and blame America. They're going to come and blame Israel and don't fall for it because they have the ability to fix all of this if they wanted to. They have the ability to go in and tell Hamas right now to stop what they're doing. They have the ability to tell Hamas to let those people out. But you know what? Qatar is going to continue to work with Hamas and their leadership. Iran's going to continue to fund all of this and not say anything. And who's silent? Every one of those Arab countries are going to be silent. But expect for the finger to point to Israel and the finger is going to point to Israel, to America. I want you to take a listen to this statement that Governor Ron DeSantis made about all I guess he's talking about, all of the 2.3 million Palestinians. He said this on the campaign trail in Iowa yesterday. If you look at how they behave, not all of them are Hamas, but they are all anti-Semitic. None of them believe in Israel's right to exist. Now, just for our viewers, edification, according to recent polling earlier this year from the Washington Institute, which is a pro-Israel group using the polling of a Palestinian center for public opinion, 62% of Gazans wanted the cease fire with Israel to stay in place. 50% of Gazans want Hamas to stop calling for Israel's destruction. Want Hamas to accept a permanent two state solution based on the 1967 borders. 70% of Gazans wanted the Palestinians authority from the West Bank to take over Gaza. So I'm not really certain that Governor DeSantis has a real read on the difference between Hamas and the people of Gaza. What was your response when you heard what Governor DeSantis said? You know, I dealt with this every day for two years. And you know, what I can tell you is you have to realize that whether we're talking about Gazans and Palestinians, you know, all of them don't. You've got half of them. At the time that I was there didn't want to be under Hamas's rule. They didn't want to have terrorists overseeing them. They knew that they were living a terrible life because of Hamas. You had the other half that supported Hamas and wanted to be a part of that. We see that with Iran to the Iranian people don't want to be under that Iranian regime. They don't. We saw what happened. Amasa meaning we saw how they treat them. There are so many of these people who want to be free from this terrorist role. They want to be free from all of that. And America's always been sympathetic to the fact that you can separate civilians from terrorists and that's what we have to do. But right now, we can never take our eyes off of the terrorists. I mean, what Hamas did was beyond thuggish, brutal and sick. What the Iranian regime is doing to help them is terrible. But let's look back at what did Biden do. Biden turned around and fell all over himself to get into the Iran deal. Obama did it before that. You gave all of this money and what did you do? You empowered Iran to go and strengthen Hamas, strengthen Hezbollah, strengthen the Houthis to spread their terrorist activity. We went and strengthened those sanctions and decimated Iran's economy. And what happened? Biden has loosened the sanctions. Now we've got the fact that he gave 6 billion and hostage money. Okay, now you've frozen it. But we have all these American hostages. Guess what they're going to want? If you gave them 6 billion for five people and released hostages, guess what? They're going to be asking for all these others that we have. So we've created this scenario where you've given Iran, the Iranian regime, too much power and too much Poland to be able to do this. We've got to be strong. We've got to have Israel's back. And remember, as awful as these images are, and we have the back of Israel because they've been hit terribly. We have to have the back of them when they hit back as well. So speaking of having Israel's back, listen to what Donald Trump had to say about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a few days ago. He has been hurt very badly because of what's happened here. He was not prepared. He was not prepared and Israel was not prepared. And under Trump, they wouldn't have had it be prepared. He went on to call Hezbollah, which the U.S. classifies as a terrorist group, very smart. He called the defense minister a jerk and he went on and on. This was, I think, Wednesday. So four days after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. What was your response when you heard that? It's why I continue to say it is time for a new generational leader. We've got to get past the headlines of the past. I mean, look, he congratulated the Chinese Communist Party not too long ago. He's saying Hezbollah is smart. I can tell you at the United Nations when I was there and I dealt with all of them every day, you don't go and compliment any of them, because what that does is that makes America look weak. It doesn't make America look strong. It doesn't make America have friends with them. What you do is you show strength. You let them know what we expect of them. So complimenting Hezbollah and going and complimenting or criticize a leader who has just watched so many of his citizens brutally murdered, it's the wrong place at the wrong time. This isn't about Trump. It's not about him. It's not about what happened in the past. We've got to look forward. This is going to be tough days ahead for everyone involved. This is not the time to sit there and bash a leader. This is a time to sit there and give him the support he needs, Give the Israeli people the support they need and to help us get through this in the best way possible. Before you go, the House still doesn't have a speaker. For the first time in American history. This is nearly two weeks after Kevin McCarthy was stripped of his leadership. They still can't even pass a resolution condemning the Hamas attacks. It's starting to look like there is not one House Republican who can get 217 votes. Republican Congressman Austin Scott said the chaos, quote, makes us look like a bunch of idiots, unquote. Is he right? Well, I'll tell you, what's right is under the Biden administration, we've seen chaos within. You can't blame the fact that you. Can't blame that on Biden. You can't blame this on Biden. No, you. Well, you have to let me finish. We have seen chaos with inflation. We've seen chaos with the lack of transparency in education. We've seen chaos on the border. with crime on the streets. And now we're seeing chaos around the world. What I'm saying is you can't fix Democrat chaos with Republican chaos. They need to get it together. They need to get in a room and figure out who this is going to be and come out unified. That's what Republicans need to do. This is not a good look. This is not good for our country. We saw what happened to Israel when they were distracted. America looks so distracted right now. When America is distracted, the world is less safe. We can't sit there and act like this is September 10th. We better get it together and remember what it felt like September 12th, because we've got a lot of threats around us and a lot of chaos around us. And we need some strength. We need some stability. And again, I'll say we need a new generational leader to right this ship.",

WE WANTED TO  BRING TO YOU I WITNESSES AND  THE HAMAS-RUN PALESTINIAN  MINISTRY OF HEALTH SAY THAT  MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE WERE   KILLED IN WHAT IS BEING  DESCRIBED AS A CHAOTIC  INCIDENT, AS IDF SOLDIERS   OPENED FIRE AS PEOPLE WERE  TRYING TO GET FOOD FROM AID   TRUCKS. CNN'S JEREMY DIAMOND IS GATHERING NEW DETAILS. HE'S  BEEN PICKING UP SOME NEW  REPORTING. JEREMY, BRING US UP  TO SPEED HERE   &gt;&gt; WELL FIRST OF ALL, KATE, I  THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE  THAT THE AID SITUATION, THE  HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN  NORTHERN GAZA, IS JUST SO, SO  DESPERATE AND THAT SEEMS TO BE  PART OF WHAT LED TO THIS SCENE. HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE SURROUNDING SOME OF  THESE AID TRUCKS THAT WERE ABLE TO ENTER NORTHERN GAZA. SOME OF THE VERY FEW AID TRUCKS THAT  HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT IN THERE. AND YOU CAN SEE IN THIS VIDEO BY THE ISRAELI, FROM THE ISRAELI MILITARY, THE  CROWDS OF PEOPLE AROUND THESE  TRUCKS. BUT WHAT APPEARS TO  HAVE HAPPENED IS THAT THE   ISRAELI MILITARY OPEN FIRE ON  SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE   SURROUNDING THESE TRUCKS AND  ISRAELI MILITARY OFFICIAL  TELLING US THAT THE CROWD  APPROACHED THE FORCES IN A  MANNER THAT POST WAS A THREAT  TO THE TROOPS. AND THEY SAY  THAT THOSE TROOPS THEN  RESPONDED WITH LIVE FIRE. NOW,  EYEWITNESSES ON THE SCENE HAVE  TOLD US THAT ISRAELI TANKS AS  WELL AS DRONES OPENED FIRE ON  THIS CROWD   &gt;&gt; AND THAT   &gt;&gt; FOLLOWING THAT, THERE WAS A  CHAOTIC SCENE. IT'S SOME OF  THE DRIVERS OF THESE AID TRUCKS APPARENTLY TRIED TO GET AWAY   AMID THIS GUNFIRE AND KILLED  SEVERAL ADDITIONAL PEOPLE, WERE TOLD THAT 104 PEOPLE WERE   KILLED IN THIS INCIDENT, 760  PEOPLE INJURED ACCORDING TO THE PALESTINIAN MINISTRY OF HEALTH, IT'S NOT CLEAR YET HOW MANY OF THOSE WERE KILLED BY ISRAELI  GUNFIRE VERSUS BUY HE'S TRUCKS AND THE ENSUING CHAOS BUT ARE  EYEWITNESSES ON THE GROUND   INDICATE THAT IT WAS THE  ISRAELI GUNFIRE THAT PROMPTED   SOME OF THOSE TRUCKS TO FLEE  THE SCENE. AND IN THE PROCESS,  RUN OVER SOME OF THESE   INDIVIDUALS. BUT WE ARE STILL  WORKING TOGETHER ADDITIONAL  DETAILS. THE ISRAELI MILITARY   SAYS FOR ITS PART THAT THE  INCIDENT IS UNDER REVIEW AND  THEY ARE ALSO SAYING IN A   STATEMENT THAT GAZAN RESIDENTS  SURROUNDED THE TRUCKS, LOADED  THE SUPPLIES BEING DELIVERED,   AND THAT DURING THE INCIDENT,  DOZENS OF GAZANS, THEY SAY WERE INJURED AS A RESULT OF PUSHING  AND TRAMPLING.

                "Lemma": ", ARE FOLLOWING SOME BREAKING  NEWS OUT OF GAZA. WE WANTED TO  BRING TO YOU I WITNESSES AND  THE HAMAS-RUN PALESTINIAN  MINISTRY OF HEALTH SAY THAT  MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE WERE   KILLED IN WHAT IS BEING  DESCRIBED AS A CHAOTIC  INCIDENT, AS IDF SOLDIERS   OPENED FIRE AS PEOPLE WERE  TRYING TO GET FOOD FROM AID   TRUCKS. CNN'S JEREMY DIAMOND IS GATHERING NEW DETAILS. HE'S  BEEN PICKING UP SOME NEW  REPORTING. JEREMY, BRING US UP  TO SPEED HERE   &gt;&gt; WELL FIRST OF ALL, KATE, I  THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE  THAT THE AID SITUATION, THE  HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN  NORTHERN GAZA, IS JUST SO, SO  DESPERATE AND THAT SEEMS TO BE  PART OF WHAT LED TO THIS SCENE. HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE SURROUNDING SOME OF  THESE AID TRUCKS THAT WERE ABLE TO ENTER NORTHERN GAZA. SOME OF THE VERY FEW AID TRUCKS THAT  HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT IN THERE. AND YOU CAN SEE IN THIS VIDEO BY THE ISRAELI, FROM THE ISRAELI MILITARY, THE  CROWDS OF PEOPLE AROUND THESE  TRUCKS. BUT WHAT APPEARS TO  HAVE HAPPENED IS THAT THE   ISRAELI MILITARY OPEN FIRE ON  SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE   SURROUNDING THESE TRUCKS AND  ISRAELI MILITARY OFFICIAL  TELLING US THAT THE CROWD  APPROACHED THE FORCES IN A  MANNER THAT POST WAS A THREAT  TO THE TROOPS. AND THEY SAY  THAT THOSE TROOPS THEN  RESPONDED WITH LIVE FIRE. NOW,  EYEWITNESSES ON THE SCENE HAVE  TOLD US THAT ISRAELI TANKS AS  WELL AS DRONES OPENED FIRE ON  THIS CROWD   &gt;&gt; AND THAT   &gt;&gt; FOLLOWING THAT, THERE WAS A  CHAOTIC SCENE. IT'S SOME OF  THE DRIVERS OF THESE AID TRUCKS APPARENTLY TRIED TO GET AWAY   AMID THIS GUNFIRE AND KILLED  SEVERAL ADDITIONAL PEOPLE, WERE TOLD THAT 104 PEOPLE WERE   KILLED IN THIS INCIDENT, 760  PEOPLE INJURED ACCORDING TO THE PALESTINIAN MINISTRY OF HEALTH, IT'S NOT CLEAR YET HOW MANY OF THOSE WERE KILLED BY ISRAELI  GUNFIRE VERSUS BUY HE'S TRUCKS AND THE ENSUING CHAOS BUT ARE  EYEWITNESSES ON THE GROUND   INDICATE THAT IT WAS THE  ISRAELI GUNFIRE THAT PROMPTED   SOME OF THOSE TRUCKS TO FLEE  THE SCENE. AND IN THE PROCESS,  RUN OVER SOME OF THESE   INDIVIDUALS. BUT WE ARE STILL  WORKING TOGETHER ADDITIONAL  DETAILS. THE ISRAELI MILITARY   SAYS FOR ITS PART THAT THE  INCIDENT IS UNDER REVIEW AND  THEY ARE ALSO SAYING IN A   STATEMENT THAT GAZAN RESIDENTS  SURROUNDED THE TRUCKS, LOADED  THE SUPPLIES BEING DELIVERED,   AND THAT DURING THE INCIDENT,  DOZENS OF GAZANS, THEY SAY WERE INJURED AS A RESULT OF PUSHING  AND TRAMPLING. THIS WAS CLEARLY MORE THAN JUST PUSHING AND   TRAMPLING. AND WE HAVE   EYEWITNESSES MAKING VERY CLEAR  THAT THE ISRAELI MILITARY DID  INDEED OPEN FIRE HAIR ON THESE  INDIVIDUALS AS WELL. NOW, WE  SHOULD NOTE THAT THIS IS ONLY  HAPPENING BECAUSE OF HOW  DESPERATE THE HUMANITARIAN  SITUATION IS IN NORTHERN GAZA.  VERY FEW AID TRUCKS HAVE  ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT  IN THERE. THE WORLD FOOD  PROGRAM RECENTLY SUSPENDED AID  DELIVERIES TO NORTHERN GAZA,   SAYING THAT IT WAS TOO UNSAFE.

SHE'S TELLING HER STORY. THIS MORNING, AT THE HOSPITAL, 85-YEAR-OLD YOCHEVED LIFSHITZ TOLD REPORTERS HOW SHE WAS ABDUCTED AND HELD CAPTIVE UNDERGROUND FOR WEEKS. &gt;&gt; THE GRANDMOTHER SAYS FOUR OF HAMAS FIGHTERS STORMED HER KIBBUTZ DURING THE MASSACRE AND TOOK HER WAY ON A MOTORBIKE AND BEAT HER WITH SIX. SHE SAYS THEY TOOK RENT HAMAS'S UNDERGROUND TUNNEL NETWORK AND HELD HER WITH FOUR OTHER HOSTAGES. THEY HAD GUARDS, A DOCTOR, AND A PARAMEDIC WHO TOOK CARE OF THEM, GAVE THE MEDICINE. SHE SAYS HAMAS HAD A STOCKPILE OF SHAMPOO AND OTHER TOILETRIES FOR HOSTAGES TO USE. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE HUGE NETWORK OF TUNNELS UNDERNEATH. IT LOOKS LIKE A SPIDER WEB. WHEN SHE FIRST ARRIVED, THEY TOLD HIM THAT THERE ARE MUSLIMS, AND THEY ARE NOT GONNA HURT THEM. AND THAT THEY ATE THE SAME FOOD THAT THE HAMAS WAS EATING. &gt;&gt; HAMAS HAS NOW RELEASED FOUR HOSTAGES AS ISRAELI TROOPS GEAR UP TO LAUNCH AN ASSAULT THEY SAY ON GAZA BY GROUND, SEE, AND AIR. ISRAELI MILITARY SIT STRUCK MORE THAN 400 TARGETS ACROSS GAZA IN THE PAST DAY, KILLING HAMAS COMMANDERS AND FIGHTERS. THIS AS MORE THAN 200 HOSTAGES ARE STILL BELIEVED TO BE HELD BY HAMAS INSIDE GAZA, AND WE'VE LEARNED THAT INCLUDES 30 CHILDREN. LET'S GO TO ERIN BURNETT. SHE JOINS US LIVE IN THIS HOUR IN TEL AVIV. AARON, HEARING FROM HER, ALL OF THOSE DETAILS, INCLUDING, BY THE WAY SOME CRITICISM OF THE IDF AND LACK OF PREPAREDNESS, WAS REMARKABLE THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; IT WAS REMARKABLE. SHE DIDN'T HAVE CRITICISM FOR THE IDF, YOU KNOW HOW THEY OBVIOUSLY WERE NOT THERE. YOU KNOW, ALSO, POPPY, SOMETHING STOOD OUT IN THE MUNDANE NECESSITY. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TUNNELS. WE KNOW THESE TUNNELS HAVE VENTILATION. WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE AIR CONDITIONING. THIS IS ALL BEEN REPORTING THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ISRAELIS OVER THE YEARS. BUT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SAYING SHE WAS HELD UNDERGROUND FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS, THAT THERE WAS SHAMPOO, THERE WAS ANTIBIOTICS, THERE WAS A GUARD PER HOSTAGE IN THE EXPERIENCE SHE HAD. THAT THERE WERE MEDICS AND PARAMEDICS AND OBVIOUSLY SHE IS ELDERLY. THE OTHER WOMAN WHO WAS RELEASED ALSO ELDERLY AND HAD MEDICAL NEEDS, AND THEN THEY HAD THE MEDICINE NEEDED, AND IF, NOT SOMETHING SIMILAR TO REPLACE IT. IT IS PRETTY STUNNING. BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO CONTRAST THAT WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING ABOVE THE GROUND, RIGHT, WHERE THERE IS NOT WATER, NEVER MIND SHAMPOO. THEY DON'T HAVE WATER, THEY ARE USING TOILET WATER. THERE IS NO MORPHINE FOR ANY KIND OF AMPUTATIONS, ANTIBIOTICS, NO. BUT HAMAS HAD STOCKPILED ALL OF THAT AND HAS ALL OF THE UNDERGROUND. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE LEARNING FROM HER. &gt;&gt; SO THAT, POINT ERIN, WE WANT TO PLAY THIS OUT FOR ON THIS. BECAUSE IT GETS AT JUST HOW PREPARED THEY WERE FOR TAKING HOSTAGES, INCLUDING AT THE SCALE THAT THEY TOOK. THEM TAKE A LISTEN. &gt;&gt; THEY LOOKED VERY WELL PREPARED. THEY PREPARED IT FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. ALL OF THE NEEDS FOR WOMEN NEED. SHAMPOO, CONDITIONER. ME &gt;&gt; DID THAT SURPRISE YOU? I KNOW EVERYONE WAS SURPRISED BY THE SCALE OF THE ACTUAL TERROR ATTACK ITSELF. BUT THE PREPARATIONS FOR HOSTAGE TAKING ALSO SEEMED TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF THE PLAN. &gt;&gt; YES. WHEN THEY SAY PREPARED FOR WOMEN'S NEEDS, THEY WERE THERE FOR PREPARED, I MEAN, LET'S JUST GO AHEAD. I THINK WE'RE BEING HONEST ABOUT. IT MEANS THEY HAD TAMPONS AND THINGS. THAT IS A LEVEL OF PREPARATION FOR WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO. AND IT SHOWS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE PEOPLE OF ALL DIFFERENT AGES. IT SHOWS A PREPARATION FOR THAT. AND WE SAW THAT IN THE PLANS THAT WE'VE SEEN IT TAKEN FROM THE BODIES OF HAMAS MILITANTS WHO WERE KILLED IN THE TERRORIST ATTACK. YOU KNOW, THAT IT LAYS OUT WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO IN EVERY SINGLE KIBBUTZ, AND THEY ALSO LAID OUT VERY EXPLICITLY THE ONES THAT I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO READ WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO WITH HOSTAGES. TAKE AS MANY AS POSSIBLE. HERE IS THE COMMUNAL EATING AREA IN THIS CABOOSES, WHERE THEY GO, THIS IS HOW YOU GET THERE, HERE IS THE MAP. IT IS CIRCLED. TAKE THE HOSTAGES TH SO THAT WAS VERY MUCH A PART OF THE PRINTED PLAN. AND I SEE THE OTHER END OF IT. THE LEVEL OF PREPARATION THAT WENT INTO IT. AGAIN, IN THE MUNDANE REALITY OF HAVING FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS. SHAMPOO, ANTIBIOTICS. IT IS THOSE VERY SPECIFICS THAT I THINK THAT ARE MOST STRIKING. &gt;&gt; FOR SURE, AND ERIN, I ALSO WONDER ABOUT IF WE WILL LEARN FROM HER OR SOME OF THE OTHER HOSTAGES RELEASED HOW MUCH THEY HAD, WHICH WOULD INDICATE HOW LONG THEY HAD BEEN PLANNING, OR HAD BEEN PLANNING TO HOLD THE SO WE'LL SEE. I ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS STRIKING THAT HER DAUGHTER, SHARON, SPOKE AT THAT NEWS CONFERENCE AS WELL. AND THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT HER DAD, WHO OF COURSE, IS YOU VETS HUSBAND. LISTEN TO THIS. &gt;&gt; MY MOM AND MY DAD WERE SEPARATED AT THE VERY BEGINNING. &gt;&gt; WE DO NOT KNOW, FROM MY MOM'S STORY, WHAT HAPPENED TO MY DAD. WE DO KNOW THAT HE WAS INJURED. &gt;&gt; INJURED, AND VERY LIKELY COULD STILL BE BEING HELD. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. THEY WERE HELD IN SEPARATE PLACES. SO AS MUCH AS HAMAS AGAIN GIVING THIS IMAGE OF HUMANE TREATMENT TO HOSTAGES, YOU MUST REMEMBER AGAIN THAT THEY WERE REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT GET TO BECOME HOSTAGES. DEPLORABLE, INHUMAN METHOD OF THEIR BRUTAL MASSACRE AND SLAUGHTER. BUT THEN, WHEN THEY DO TAKE PEOPLE HOSTAGE, THEY WOULD SEPARATE. SO A HUSBAND AND WIFE NOT BEING TOGETHER, SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE HE IS. AND THAT OF COURSE IS THE OBVIOUS RAISED POINT. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE BEING HELD, AND ARE THERE ANY BEING HELD IN LARGER GROUPS. WE KNOW HAMAS HAS SAID THAT SOME OF THE HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN KILLED IN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES. WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'VE BEEN KILLED, WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WERE KILLED BY ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES OR ANYTHING ELSE. BUT ALL WE KNOW AT THIS POINT IS WHAT HAMAS HAS SAID. THEY'VE INDICATED 22 OF THEM HAVE BEEN KILLED IN STRIKES. WE JUST DON'T KNOW IF IT IS TRUE. THE ISRAELI FORCE IS PREPARING FOR THE GAZA GROUNDED PATIENT GETTING COUNCIL FROM AN AMERICAN MILITARY LATER IN THE ISRAEL MARINE CORPS LIEUTENANT JAMES GLIM WAS HEAD OF THE MARINE FORCES SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND, AND IT IS UNCLEAR THOUGH, WHILE OF COURSE HE HAS THE EXPERIENCE AND THE RESUME FOR SUCH A SITUATION, IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT HIS SPECIFIC ROLE IS HERE. BUT UNOFFICIAL DOES SAY GENERAL GLYNN HAS DECADES OF EXPERIENCE AND CAN ASK, WHAT THEY SAY, ARE THE HARD QUESTIONS, AS UNITED STATES DOES NOT HAVE A CLEAR SENSE OF ISRAEL'S INTENTIONS IN GAZA. THEY SAID THEY ARE GOING TO GET RID OF HAMAS AND ALL RESPECTS. BUT BEYOND, THAT WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS, THEY HAVE NOT PROVIDED ANY SPECIFICS. CNN'S NIC ROBERTSON IS IN SDEROT, ISRAEL, WHERE HE HAS BEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS WAR. AND AS WE HAVE BEEN IN THE MIDST OF WHAT IS NOW 17 DAYS INTO A WAR, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN TERMS OF MILITARY MOVEMENT THIS MORNING, AND THE CONTEXT OF WHAT? MORE THAN 300 STRIKES THAT ISRAEL IS SAYING THEY CONDUCTED IN THE PAST 24 HOURS IN GAZA. &gt;&gt; YEAH. JUST GO BACK TO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING THERE ABOUT THE FORMER MARINE GENERAL. I THINK THE ONLY PIECE OF CONTEXT HERE, OF COURSE, IS THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME MARINE EXPEDITIONARY UNIT OF 2000 WHO HAVE BEEN ON READINESS AND STANDBY TO COME IN AND GIVE LOGISTIC SUPPORT ANOTHER UNSPECIFIED SUPPORT TO THE ISRAELI MILITARY. AT A TIME WHEN THERE ARE AMERICAN HOSTAGES BEING HELD BY HAMAS INSIDE GAZA. SO IT SEEMS, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH GENERAL TO COME AND GIVE WHAT SORT OF ADVICE, YOU ARE ALSO PICKING ONE WHO WOUL VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE SORT OF EXPERTISE, READINESS, OF WHAT THESE MARINES WHO ARE SITTING JUST OFF SHORE HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL. IT SPEAKS TO ME AS A NATION AS WELL. OF COURSE, THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE BEING TOLD, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE READINESS, WE HEARD FROM A PRIME MINISTER TODAY, PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT, EMMANUEL MACRON, WHO HAS GIVEN HIS SUPPORT TO ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO STRIKE BACK AT HAMAS. THE PRIME MINISTER SAID IT COULD BE A LONG WAR. I'M STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT HE SAID IT COULD BE, BECAUSE UNTIL NOW, HE'S BEEN VERY, VERY CLEAR. SAYING HE WILL GO AFTER THEM, AND WE WILL GET THE JOB DONE. WE WILL COMPLETELY GET RID OF HAMAS. BUT I THINK THIS IS ALSO INDICATIVE OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO STEPPING BACK FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF A GROUND INCURSION. WE ARE NOT SEEING ANYTHING ON THE GROUND AT THE MOMENT THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT. WE ARE STILL HEARING HEAVY DETONATIONS COMING FROM WITHIN GAZA, WE'VE HEARD MILITARY HELICOPTERS IN THE AREA THIS MORNING. SO WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE ISRAELI DEFENSE CHIEF YESTERDAY, AND GENERAL STAFF, KIND OF GENERAL STAFF SAYING THAT THEY ARE READY. THAT TROOPS ARE READY, THAT THEY ARE GETTING ADDNAL TRAINING. BUT I THINK THE POSTURE IS SET FOR WHEN THE COMMAND COMES. THAT THE TROOPS ARE READY FOR THAT INCURSION, VERY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE BEING PAUSED. VERY CLEAR THAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH HUMANITARIAN AID, HAS TO DO WITH HOSTAGES, NEEDS THAT. BUT THE FORCES, THEY'RE READY TO GO. I DON'T SEE ANYONE PULLING IT BACK AT THAT MOMENT, ERIN. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, NICK ROBERTSON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALONG WITH THE GAZA BORDER AND SDROT, I WANT TO GO NOW TO THE IDF SPOKESPERSON, LIEUTENANT COLONEL PETER LERNER. LIEUTENANT, I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. I'M GLAD TO SPEAK TO YOU THIS I WANT TO GIVE YOU FIRST CHANCE TO RESPOND TO WHAT WE WERE SAYING WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STOOD UP AS THESE HOSTAGE HAVE SPOKEN OUT. THAT HAMAS WAS PREPARED FOR THIS, FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS, SHAMPOO, ANTIBIOTICS, AND PARAMEDICS, MEDICAL CARE, EATING THE SAME FOOD AS THE HOSTAGES EIGHT. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT? &gt;&gt; WELL, CLEARLY, ERIN. THEY WERE PREPARED FOR THE ATTACK. WE SEE JUST THE MAGNITUDE OF THEIR ATTACKS. THEY HAD A VERY CLEAR PLAN OF ACTION, SO IT SHOULD NOT BE ANY SURPRISE TO US THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY HAD UNDERGROUND AS THEY ABDUCTED OVER 200 PEOPLE INTO GAZA. I REMIND YOU, THEY DID A COORDINATED ATTACK WITH MORE THAN 20 POINTS OF BREACH, OVERGROUND, AT GROUND, AND ETSY. THEY PENETRATED SOME 30 DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PART OF ISRAEL. AND MURDERED AND OVER 1400 PEOPLE. SO WHY SHOULD WE BE SURPRISED?",

THE ISRAELI FORCE IS PREPARING FOR THE GAZA GROUNDED PATIENT GETTING COUNCIL FROM AN AMERICAN MILITARY LATER IN THE ISRAEL MARINE CORPS LIEUTENANT JAMES GLIM WAS HEAD OF THE MARINE FORCES SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND, AND IT IS UNCLEAR THOUGH, WHILE OF COURSE HE HAS THE EXPERIENCE AND THE RESUME FOR SUCH A SITUATION, IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT HIS SPECIFIC ROLE IS HERE. BUT UNOFFICIAL DOES SAY GENERAL GLYNN HAS DECADES OF EXPERIENCE AND CAN ASK, WHAT THEY SAY, ARE THE HARD QUESTIONS, AS UNITED STATES DOES NOT HAVE A CLEAR SENSE OF ISRAEL'S INTENTIONS IN GAZA. THEY SAID THEY ARE GOING TO GET RID OF HAMAS AND ALL RESPECTS. BUT BEYOND, THAT WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS, THEY HAVE NOT PROVIDED ANY SPECIFICS. CNN'S NIC ROBERTSON IS IN SDEROT, ISRAEL, WHERE HE HAS BEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS WAR. AND AS WE HAVE BEEN IN THE MIDST OF WHAT IS NOW 17 DAYS INTO A WAR, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN TERMS OF MILITARY MOVEMENT THIS MORNING, AND THE CONTEXT OF WHAT? MORE THAN 300 STRIKES THAT ISRAEL IS SAYING THEY CONDUCTED IN THE PAST 24 HOURS IN GAZA. &gt;&gt; YEAH. JUST GO BACK TO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING THERE ABOUT THE FORMER MARINE GENERAL. I THINK THE ONLY PIECE OF CONTEXT HERE, OF COURSE, IS THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME MARINE EXPEDITIONARY UNIT OF 2000 WHO HAVE BEEN ON READINESS AND STANDBY TO COME IN AND GIVE LOGISTIC SUPPORT ANOTHER UNSPECIFIED SUPPORT TO THE ISRAELI MILITARY. AT A TIME WHEN THERE ARE AMERICAN HOSTAGES BEING HELD BY HAMAS INSIDE GAZA. SO IT SEEMS, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH GENERAL TO COME AND GIVE WHAT SORT OF ADVICE, YOU ARE ALSO PICKING ONE WHO WOUL VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE SORT OF EXPERTISE, READINESS, OF WHAT THESE MARINES WHO ARE SITTING JUST OFF SHORE HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL. IT SPEAKS TO ME AS A NATION AS WELL. OF COURSE, THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE BEING TOLD, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE READINESS, WE HEARD FROM A PRIME MINISTER TODAY, PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT, EMMANUEL MACRON, WHO HAS GIVEN HIS SUPPORT TO ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO STRIKE BACK AT HAMAS. THE PRIME MINISTER SAID IT COULD BE A LONG WAR. I'M STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT HE SAID IT COULD BE, BECAUSE UNTIL NOW, HE'S BEEN VERY, VERY CLEAR. SAYING HE WILL GO AFTER THEM, AND WE WILL GET THE JOB DONE. WE WILL COMPLETELY GET RID OF HAMAS. BUT I THINK THIS IS ALSO INDICATIVE OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO STEPPING BACK FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF A GROUND INCURSION. WE ARE NOT SEEING ANYTHING ON THE GROUND AT THE MOMENT THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT. WE ARE STILL HEARING HEAVY DETONATIONS COMING FROM WITHIN GAZA, WE'VE HEARD MILITARY HELICOPTERS IN THE AREA THIS MORNING. SO WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE ISRAELI DEFENSE CHIEF YESTERDAY, AND GENERAL STAFF, KIND OF GENERAL STAFF SAYING THAT THEY ARE READY. THAT TROOPS ARE READY, THAT THEY ARE GETTING ADDNAL TRAINING. BUT I THINK THE POSTURE IS SET FOR WHEN THE COMMAND COMES. THAT THE TROOPS ARE READY FOR THAT INCURSION, VERY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE BEING PAUSED. VERY CLEAR THAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH HUMANITARIAN AID, HAS TO DO WITH HOSTAGES, NEEDS THAT. BUT THE FORCES, THEY'RE READY TO GO. I DON'T SEE ANYONE PULLING IT BACK AT THAT MOMENT, ERIN. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, NICK ROBERTSON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALONG WITH THE GAZA BORDER AND SDROT, I WANT TO GO NOW TO THE IDF SPOKESPERSON, LIEUTENANT COLONEL PETER LERNER. LIEUTENANT, I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. I'M GLAD TO SPEAK TO YOU THIS I WANT TO GIVE YOU FIRST CHANCE TO RESPOND TO WHAT WE WERE SAYING WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STOOD UP AS THESE HOSTAGE HAVE SPOKEN OUT. THAT HAMAS WAS PREPARED FOR THIS, FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS, SHAMPOO, ANTIBIOTICS, AND PARAMEDICS, MEDICAL CARE, EATING THE SAME FOOD AS THE HOSTAGES EIGHT. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT? &gt;&gt; WELL, CLEARLY, ERIN. THEY WERE PREPARED FOR THE ATTACK. WE SEE JUST THE MAGNITUDE OF THEIR ATTACKS. THEY HAD A VERY CLEAR PLAN OF ACTION, SO IT SHOULD NOT BE ANY SURPRISE TO US THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY HAD UNDERGROUND AS THEY ABDUCTED OVER 200 PEOPLE INTO GAZA. I REMIND YOU, THEY DID A COORDINATED ATTACK WITH MORE THAN 20 POINTS OF BREACH, OVERGROUND, AT GROUND, AND ETSY. THEY PENETRATED SOME 30 DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PART OF ISRAEL. AND MURDERED AND OVER 1400 PEOPLE. SO WHY SHOULD WE BE SURPRISED?"

The attack came during intense Israeli bombardment a bombing Sunday night. The IDF has not commented on the incident. United Nations officials today said 70% of people in the Gaza Strip are displaced. Many living conditions and living in conditions a statement called, quote, inhumane. The secretary general said the Gaza is becoming a, quote, graveyard for children. Israel's ambassador to the U.N. lashed out at those at the comments called for the secretary general's resignation. Emily Kelly Callahan is a nurse activity manager for Doctors Without Borders, MSF She was evacuated last Wednesday and arrived back in the US just over the weekend. First of all, how does it feel to be out? A lot of people keep asking me that and I really don't have a good answer. I obviously have a sense of relief that I'm home and I'm with my family and feel safe for the first time in 26 days and I'm having a really hard time finding any joy in any of it. Because me being safe is the result of having to leave people behind. People watching this have seen images from Gaza and they've seen the hospital images they've seen the horror of children dead. Day after day after day after day. I mean, they've seen all the images but to actually be there and to experience it, you're experiencing all these things which a camera can never capture. So can you just talk a little bit about what stand when you close your eyes at night, what is it you think about now? I think the answer to that question, I think I'll start at KITV, which was we were we were relocated about five times over the course of 26 days due to security concerns. And one of the places we wound up was the Communist Training Center. We call it quits. That's when people that evacuated to the South Sea or in the south. And then we went to below what he calls a line and there were by the time we left there, there were 35,000 internally displaced people living alongside us. There were children with just massive burns down their faces, down their necks, all over their limbs. And because the hospitals are so overwhelmed, they are being discharged immediately after and they're being discharged to these camps with no access to running water. There's 50,000 people at that camp now in four toilets. They're given 2 hours of water every 12 hours. And the toilets for 50,000 people. Yes. And that's where we were living too. And they have these fresh open burns and wounds and partial amputations that are just walking around these conditions. And parents are bringing their children to us, going, Please, can you help? Please? Can you help? And we have no supplies when in situations where there are tens of thousands of people and it is a war and people don't can't feed their kids. Things get strange very fast and things get tough very, very fast and people turn on each other. You saw that up close at sea. We were the reason we had to leave was because we were starting to be harassed. People, desperate people who are losing loved ones right and left are angry. And they would point at me and scream American walking past. And at that point, we had no idea what was coming in the next few days. And they would yell things in Hebrew to see if we were Israeli. They accused our national staff of either being traitors or said, you're you're pretending to be Arab. We know that. You're just pretending to be Arab. Stop lying to us and our staff had to defend themselves. And we said to them over and over again, you don't have to stay. We understand if you want to leave us. And they said, you are family, too, and we're not going anywhere. Your staff, the Palestinians who worked for MSF, for Doctors Without Borders, we're concerned about your safety. We would have died within a week without them. They they are the only reason we are alive. It's incredible that this took so long to get Americans sick. People start to move through that Rafah border crossing. It's it's inexplicable. And we were desperate. We we did a calorie count at one point based on our supplies and figured out that if all of us there's 50 people with us living in a parking lot now, only eight 700 calories a day, if that's all we had. We had two days of food left and that's it. And our national staff took off. We had no cell service at that point. So we had no idea what had happened to them. There's bombs going off all around us because there's no safe place in Gaza, even getting through that Rafah border crossing. What was that like? They didn't leave our side for a second. You're the national staff because they feared for your safety, even at the border crossing, they made sure they were standing between us and desperate people. They made sure that they were talking to every official that they could find, trying to push us through, trying to get us on the bus, trying to get us out. And we're sitting there and we're watching these incredible men who have sacrificed everything for us, who have sacrificed time with their families, their own physical safety, their own water supply. They were giving to us. And we're watching them fight to get us across the border knowing that we were not bringing them with us. And they didn't they didn't waiver. Abraham was right in the front with our passports, fighting so hard to get us on. And we get to Irish that night and find out his parents are dead. They were losing family members and friends. You said if if it wasn't for your national staff, you think you would have been killed by people who were just desperate? We either would have starved to death or run out of water. They were the ones that negotiated all of that. They Gaza is a small city, so everyone knows everyone. And they would call in favors and call their friends and say, who do you know that has food? Who do you know that's open? Where can we get this? And they would drive all over the place to find water. And when we ran out of bottled water in Gaza, they were the ones that were able to figure out that the water truck was coming here at these times. And, oh, I know this guy has a grocery store and they still have power. Sometimes I think I can probably get something from them. Like when I say we would have starved to death without them. I'm I'm not exaggerating And in the moments of absolute desperation of civilians, they were steadfast and calm and just talked to them and said, these people are also in the same boat that you are. They have no supplies. They also have no food and water. They are also sleeping outside on the concrete and did it in such a beautiful way that they were able to talk them down with love and kindness. There was no violence in their heart and it calmed everyone around them down as well. Would you go back to Gaza? In a heartbeat? In an absolute heartbeat. My heart is in Gaza. It will stay in Gaza. The Palestinian people that I worked with both our national staff in the office as well as my staff at Indonesia Hospital were some of the most incredible people I've ever met in my life. Whenever a thing went off and we got the notice to move south of Wadi, Gaza, I was texting my my nurses at Indonesia Hospital and I said, we we lost a nurse weekend one. He was killed when the ambulance outside the hospital was blown up and I was texting them when we got the evacuation orders and I said, Did any of you move south? Did any of you get out or any of you coming down this way? And the only answer I got was, this is our community. This is our family, these are our friends. If they're going to kill us, we're going to die saving as many people as we can. And I said, If I can ever have an ounce of the heart that you have, I will I will die a happy person. They were incredible. I would like to send out a reminder that there are civilians seeking shelter there and that my doctors and nurses didn't leave out of loyalty to their community. And I know that there is an idea being pushed right now that anyone that stayed behind is going to be considered some kind of a threat. And I want to remind people that the people that stayed behind our heroes, the people that stayed behind, are they know they're going to die and they're choosing to stay behind anyway. We're trying our doctors, nurses in the hospital. I wake up every morning and I send out a text message and I ask Are you alive?

                "Token": "Investigators in the US and around the world have identified a revenue source being exploited by Hamas online donors offering support in cryptocurrency. Now, even before Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, US officials had been probing the group's use of cryptocurrency through alleged money launderers. Hamas's use of digital currency represents just one of the many ways the terrorist organization has sought to raise funds while evading sanctions. Hamas and other terrorist groups have used Facebook and acts to publicly post their crypto wallet addresses asking for donations. That's according to a report by US authorities. All right. Joining me now is military man seeking CEO of the crypto analytics software firm Beto O'Rourke. Thanks so much for being here with us. So just first, how significant a role is crypto in terms of funding Hamas? Well, from our side, we've analyzed and studied deeply the addresses belonging to companies controlled by Hamas, as indicated in two orders 15, 22 and 1923. It's public. So the total amount of almost $41 million was received at this addresses. And this is a total to turn over all the addresses listed in to previous seizure orders and this was this significant amount received from September 2021 and April 2024. So over four years, with the majority accounts being received between December 2022 and April 2023. So yes, all the things. So, so that's a lot. But obviously it could be a lot more that we don't know about. So how exactly does it work? How do they they get the money? I understand they fundraise on social media. I mean, how does that all work? So they gather different, different social media and putting the different wallets, addresses and then they're collecting money, I mean, crypto from all over the world. And then they are using intermediary addresses from a different kind of exchanges around the world and then collecting them into several wallets and and funds. This means they are laundering money using crypto. Well, it happens, unfortunately. Is it untraceable in terms of the people who are who are donating this money? Almost. So in case if somebody say in investing or donating, terrorists are going to be organizations directly via centralized exchanges. It's possible, but nobody is doing that. So they are actually they are usually using decentralized wallets and non-custodial wallets and then those organizations are laundering money to avoid such. So just closing. So it's almost impossible. Yeah. So I mean, we're talking about, you know, people donating money on social media, but in terms of these intermediaries and so on, I mean, what what role does Iran play here? You mean centralized exchanges and so on, so we can determine the precise origin of the funds. So whether they were directly sent from from other terrorist groups or source from donations, etc.. But however, our investigation revealed that a significant portion of this funds primarily originated from cryptocurrency exchanges. Some of them are really popular, some of them are have Russia origin, but it's not connected with Russia. So because it's not it's not, you know, exchanges, they are not aiming to help terrorists. That's the most important thing here. But in some of the cases, they are blind and they cannot understand what really happened. And early and sometimes weeks or months should be passed till the exchanges are revealing such bad things happening. So it's not it's not online. So time should pass. And now we may see that some of the exchanges fall under such bad circumstance in terms of money laundering and terrorist financing. So, I mean, it sounds very hard to stop. I mean, what more can be done to to cut off this source of funding for Hamas? Yeah, that's the good question. I mean, crypto is still in the gray zone, but things that thankfully for you, you know, international anti-money and anti-money laundering measures are coming. And because of legislation helping to reveal the source of funds, the dirty money in crypto, it goes more and more better to reveal. And from my perspective, the best way is to use KYC. AML measures in any kind of wallets exchanges and to to put exchanges, put exchanges attention on that. And, you know, after all, crypto is not about crime, is not about terrorist organizations, financing, etc., but anybody should be aware of it because of where we are. So it happens and everybody should pay a lot of attention on it. Yeah, it's it's very complex for most of us to untangle, but really appreciate getting your insights on this Dmitri magic. And thank you so much. Thanks.",

Well, from our side, we've analyzed and studied deeply the addresses belonging to companies controlled by Hamas, as indicated in two orders 15, 22 and 1923. It's public. So the total amount of almost $41 million was received at this addresses. And this is a total to turn over all the addresses listed in to previous seizure orders and this was this significant amount received from September 2021 and April 2024. So over four years, with the majority accounts being received between December 2022 and April 2023. So yes, all the things. So, so that's a lot. But obviously it could be a lot more that we don't know about. So how exactly does it work? How do they they get the money? I understand they fundraise on social media. I mean, how does that all work? So they gather different, different social media and putting the different wallets, addresses and then they're collecting money, I mean, crypto from all over the world. And then they are using intermediary addresses from a different kind of exchanges around the world and then collecting them into several wallets and and funds. This means they are laundering money using crypto. Well, it happens, unfortunately. Is it untraceable in terms of the people who are who are donating this money? Almost. So in case if somebody say in investing or donating, terrorists are going to be organizations directly via centralized exchanges. It's possible, but nobody is doing that. So they are actually they are usually using decentralized wallets and non-custodial wallets and then those organizations are laundering money to avoid such. So just closing. So it's almost impossible. Yeah. So I mean, we're talking about, you know, people donating money on social media, but in terms of these intermediaries and so on, I mean, what what role does Iran play here? You mean centralized exchanges and so on, so we can determine the precise origin of the funds. So whether they were directly sent from from other terrorist groups or source from donations, etc.. But however, our investigation revealed that a significant portion of this funds primarily originated from cryptocurrency exchanges. Some of them are really popular, some of them are have Russia origin, but it's not connected with Russia. So because it's not it's not, you know, exchanges, they are not aiming to help terrorists. That's the most important thing here. But in some of the cases, they are blind and they cannot understand what really happened. And early and sometimes weeks or months should be passed till the exchanges are revealing such bad things happening. So it's not it's not online. So time should pass. And now we may see that some of the exchanges fall under such bad circumstance in terms of money laundering and terrorist financing. So, I mean, it sounds very hard to stop. I mean, what more can be done to to cut off this source of funding for Hamas? Yeah, that's the good question. I mean, crypto is still in the gray zone, but things that thankfully for you, you know, international anti-money and anti-money laundering measures are coming. And because of legislation helping to reveal the source of funds, the dirty money in crypto, it goes more and more better to reveal. And from my perspective, the best way is to use KYC. AML measures in any kind of wallets exchanges and to to put exchanges, put exchanges attention on that. And, you know, after all, crypto is not about crime, is not about terrorist organizations, financing, etc., but anybody should be aware of it because of where we are. So it happens and everybody should pay a lot of attention on it. Yeah, it's it's very complex for most of us to untangle, but really appreciate getting your insights on this Dmitri magic. And thank you so much. Thanks."

THEY WERE HELPFUL IN GETTING  FIVE AMERICANS OUT OF IRAN LAST  MONTH, AND SENT HUNDREDS OF  MILLIONS INTO GAZA, AND THEY DO  HAVE RELATIONS WITH HAMAS, AND  THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND THE  MILITARY SITUATION ARE ALL VERY  COMPLICATED, BUT IF THERE IS  GOING TO BE A PEACEFUL SITUATION FOR SOME OF THIS TO THE HOSTAGES THE QATARI GOVERNMENT IS THE  MOST LIKELY VENUE.  &gt;&gt; PETER, IT IS A STAGGERING  NUMBER OF POTENTIAL HOSTAGES  FROM A WIDE RANGE OF COUNTRIES  AND NOT JUST ISRAELI, BUT  COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD.

AND IS THERE THE INTERNATIONAL  OUTRAGE THAT THEY HAD EXPECTED  FROM IT? &gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT THEY ARE GETTING  OUT OF IT IS FIRST OF ALL HUMAN  SHIELDS TO GO BACK TO THE FIRST  GULF WAR.  SADDAM HUSSEIN DID SOMETHING  SIMILAR AND HE GATHERED  LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF HUMAN  SHIELDS TO HAVE AN ATTACK  AGAINST HIM.  AND THIS IS CLOSE TO THE SCALE  OF 200 HOSTAGES IT SEEMS.  AND SO, A, KIND OF DISWADING ANY KIND OF ISRAELI MILITARY ACTION, AND OBVIOUSLY A DEAL DOWN ROAD,  AND HAMAS HAS NOTHING TO SHOW  FOR THE CONFLICT IN TERMS OF ANY REAL POLITICAL GOAL.  IF THEY CAN GET SOME PRISONERS  BACK, OBVIOUSLY, THAT IS  SOMETHING THEY WANT.  MAYBE THAT IS THE INTENTION IN  THE BEGINNING OF THIS, AND  OBVIOUSLY THE OPERATION BECAME  BIGGER AND THEY KILLED MORE  PEOPLE THAN INITIALLY WAS THE  PLAN.  AND IS IT GETTING THE  INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION, AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES, AND 30  NATIONALITIES OF VARIOUS KINDS,  AND THIS SEEMS TO BE A GREAT  DEAL OF CONCERN AROUND THE  WORLD, INCLUDING FROM THE UNITED STATES ABOUT THESE HOSTAGES, AND HOPEFULLY THERE CAN BE A SUCCESS RESOLUTION STARTING WITH THE  CHILDREN AND THE ELDERLY AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK.

LOOK, I MEAN, FOR THIS IS A HUGE DILEMMA FOR GOVERNMENTS.  THE STATED POSITION FOR THE  UNITED STATES IS THAT WE WILL  MAKE NO CONCESSION TO TERRORIST  GROUPS, AND WELL, IN PRACTICE,  WE WILL MAKE CONCESSIONS AND WE  WILL DO PRISONER EXCHANGES, AND  WITH THE GOVERNMENTS THAT WE  DON'T RECOGNIZE LIKE IRAN, AND  WE WILL DO PRISONER EXCHANGES  WITH TERRORIST GROUPS LIKE THE  TALIBAN AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE  PAST, AND ISRAEL HAS A LONG  RECORD OF DOING PRISONER  EXCHANGES, AND THE POLITICS  AROUND THIS RIGHT NOW MAY  PREVENT THEM FROM DOING ANYTHING AT ALL AND HAVING ANY  COMMUNICATIONS WITH HAMAS.

LAST MONDAY, I DID A LIVE INTERVIEW WITH HIS MOM RACHEL AND HIS DAUGHTER JOHN. THEY TOLD ME HIS ARM HAD BEEN BLOWN OFF BY HAMAS GUNMAN WHO TOSSED GRENADES -- AFTER HE ESCAPED FROM THE MUSIC FESTIVAL. WITNESSES HAD TOLD THEM HER SON WAS PUT INTO A TRUCK FROM GUNMAN AND TAKEN OFF. THEY HAD NO VIDEO OF THEIR SON. SO, DURING THE LIVE INTERVIEW A WEEK AGO, WE SHOWED A PICTURE OF HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN'I REALIZE I ACTUALLY SAW THEIR SON AND HAD A VIDEO OF THEIR SON ON MY PHONE. IT HAD BEEN SHOWN TO ME BY A SOLDIER AT THE MUSIC FESTIVAL. WE RECORDED OF HIS PHONE, WE HAVE PERMISSION FROM HIM TO DO. SO IT HAD NEVER BEEN RELEASED PUBLICLY. I DID NOT WANT THE SHOT OF DURING THE INTERVIEW SO, I WAIT FOR IT TO BE DONE. THEN I CALLED RACHEL AND JOHN IMMEDIATELY, AND I SENT THEM THE VIDEO. IT WAS THEIR SON, HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN. I'VE BEEN TOUCH THE FAMILY A LOT THIS LAST WEEK, AND THEY WOULD LIKE EVERYONE TO SEE THIS VIDEO, THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEIR CHILD, AND THEY WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED PEOPLE WHO WERE TAKEN BY HAMAS. THIS VIDEO WAS PROOF OF THAT. WE WERE NOT SOME PARTS OF, IT WE WANT TO WARN YOU THAT IT IS DISTURBING. &gt;&gt; [SPEAKING IN A NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE] WHAT GOD IS GREAT, THE GOVERNMENT, SHOUTS RECORDING ON HIS PHONE. [SPEAKING IN A NON-ENGLISH HE CHECKS A CAR, LOOKING FOR ANYONE ELSE HIDING. OTHER GUNMAN SHOT AS THEY BRING SURVIVORS FROM THE SHELTER. CALM, CALM, THEY. YELLOW THEM. THAT IS HURT ON THE RIGHT WITH ANOTHER HOSTAGE. HIS LEFT HAND AND PART OF HIS ARM IS BLOWN. OF THE BONE STICKS OUT. THE OTHER HOSTAGE APPEARS WOUNDED AS WELL. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER WOUNDED HOSTAGES DRAGGED BY HIS HAIR AND TOSSED INTO THE TRUCK. A FOURTH MAN IS THROWN ON TOP OF THEM. &gt;&gt; WHEN I SENT THE VIDEO TO YOU, WHAT WAS YOUR INITIAL? &gt;&gt; IT'S A CRAZY SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT WE TALK TO YOU THROUGH A COMPUTER SCREEN AND THEN GET A PHONE CALL FROM YOU SAYING, I HAVE A VIDEO OF YOUR SON. &gt;&gt; I DID NOT WANT TO SAY ON LIVE TELEVISION. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE COURSE APPRECIATED. THE WAY EVERYTHING HAS UNFOLDED, THE GENTLENESS THAT YOU USE, BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU ARE A JOURNALIST, AND JOURNALIST WON A STORY. THAT COU HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH IN MANY OTHER WAYS THAT WERE NOT KIND AND GENTLE. &gt;&gt; SO, FIRST SEEING THAT VIDEO IN GENERAL GAVE US A DOSE OF OPTIMISM. AS HORRIBLE AS IT IS AS A PARENT TO SEE YOUR KID UNDER GUNPOINT BEING PUSHED WITH ONE ARM, THE COMPOSURE FROM WHICH HE'S WALKING ON HIS OWN LEGS, PULLING HIMSELF WITH HIS ONE WEEK HAN, HE'S A LEFTY, AND HIS LEFT ARM WAS BLOWN, OF PULLING HIMSELF IT IS ONE-WEEK HAND ONTO THE TRUCK, GAVE ME A REAL GHOST OF HIS STRENGTHS THAT HE IS HANDLING A HORRIBLE SITUATION, AND HE IS DOING IT WOULD COMPOSURE. &gt;&gt; WE'RE SAYING HE WALKED OUT CALMLY, WHICH HE DID, BUT I THINK IT WAS FROM SHOCK. &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE THIS PHOTO TAKEN INSIDE THE SHELTER BEFORE HAMAS GUNMAN BEGAN THROWING GRENADES INSIDE. RACHEL SAYS, AS MANY AS 29 PEOPLE WERE CRAMMED TOGETHER. THAT IS HERSH, AND THIS IS HIS FRIEND. &gt;&gt; HURST AND HIS FRIEND WENT TO THE FESTIVAL TOGETHER. THEY'VE KNOWN TO THE SINCE THEY WERE KIDS. HONOR WAS BEHIND THE DOOR, AND BY ANYONE'S ACCOUNT WHICH WE SPOKE TO, AS THEY WERE THROWING GRENADES, HE WOULD KEEP PICKING THEM UP AND THROWING THEM OUT, PICKING THEM UP THROWING THEM OUT. ALL THESE WITNESSES SAID THERE WERE 11 GRENADES THROWN IN. HE THREW OUT EIGHT. &gt;&gt; RACHEL SAYS EIGHT PEOPLE SURVIVED AND DEVOTED CAPTURED BY HIDING BENEATH THE BODIES OF THE DEAD. HIS FRIENDS ARE TO MAKE IT OUT ALIVE. &gt;&gt; HIS PARENTS CAME TO HER HOUSE ON FRIDAY, AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IDENTIFYING BODIES ACTUALLY LET THEM KNOW THAT THE IDENTIFIED HIM WITH DNA, BUT IN HIS HAND HE WAS HOLDING A GRENADE. HIS DEAD BODY HAD A GRENADE IN IT IN HIS HAND. THIS MEANS HE IS THE REAL HEROES. THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE, AND EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO WALKED OUT AND ARE NOW IN GAZA, IT IS BECAUSE OF HONOR. &gt;&gt; HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO GET THROUGH EACH DAY? &gt;&gt; I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO KEEP RUNNING TO THE END OF THE EARTH TO SAVE HIM. WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING AND BELIEVING THAT SOMEHOW HE GOT TREATMENT, AND HE IS THERE, AND HE IS IN PAIN, AND SUFFERING, BUT HE'S ALIVE AND THERE. THERE ARE ALSO THE MOMENTS IN THIS UNIVERSE THAT WE NOW LIVE, WHERE YOU SAY, MAYBE HE DIED ON THE TRUCK. MAYBE HE BLOOD OUT IN THE TRUCK. MAYBE HE DIED YESTERDAY. MAYBE HE DIED FIVE MINUTES AGO. THERE ARE THOSE MOMENTS WHERE YOU THINK, HOW ARE THESE THOUGHTS EVEN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE THOUGHTS. THEY ARE REAL THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; THEY OFTEN GO DOWN TO SEE THEIR SONS ROOM. &gt;&gt; THIS IS HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN'S ROOM? &gt;&gt; IT'S A STEEL DOOR BECAUSE IT'S OUR BOMB SHELTER AS WELL. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN FEEL HIM HERE CLOSE, HIS GLOBE, HIS BOOKS, AND MOMENTOUS, IT'S ALL JUST AS HE LEFT THEM. RACHEL DID MAKE HIS BED HOWEVER, SHE WANTS IT READY FOR WHEN HE RETURNS. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A PORCH THAT'S FACING SOUTH, AND THEY WENT OUT FRIDAY NIGHT. I WAS SCREAMING TO HIM. HOPING. FRIDAY NIGHT WE BLESS OUR CHILDREN TRADITIONALLY, AND JEWISH HOMES YOU BLESS YOUR CHILDREN ON FRIDAY NIGHT. SO, I WAS SCREAMING. IT'S A TRADITIONAL BLESSING FROM THE BIBLE. I WAS SCREAMING THE BLESSING TO HIM. MY HANDS OUT. I USUALLY PUT MY HANDS ON HIS HEAD WHEN HE'S HOME. &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THE BLESSING SAY? &gt;&gt; IT SAYS, MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY HIS FACE SHINE UPON YOU AND BE GRACIOUS TO YOU. MAY GOD'S COUNTENANCE BE LIFTED UP TOWARDS YOU AND GIVE YOU PEACE. &gt;&gt; WOULD YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT HERSH? &gt;&gt; HE'S A SUPER CURIOUS KID, AND THIS WANDERLUST HE DEVELOPED WHEN HE WAS SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD HAS BEEN HIS LIFE, OBSESSION ALWAYS ASKING FOR MAPS AND GLOBES AND ATLAS IS FOR HIS BAR MITZVAH. THESE LAST FEW YEARS HE'S REALLY SAVED EVERY PENNY TO GO ON THIS TRIP THAT HE HAS A TICKET FOR ON DECEMBER 27TH. HE WAS GOING TO GO TO INDIA, AND THEY'LL ALL POINTS. EAST &gt;&gt; RACHEL AND JOHN WERE ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE WORLD TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE PLAY OF THE HOSTAGES, PARTICULARLY THOSE LIKE HER TO HAVE SERIOUS WOUNDS OR MEDICAL ISSUES. &gt;&gt; AS AMERICANS ISRAELIS, WE HAVE BEEN EMBRACED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE SUPPORT IS THERE. THE EMPATHY IS THERE FROM THE U.S.. WE ARE OBVIOUSLY HUNGRY FOR MORE THAN THAT. WE WANT ACTION. WE WANT RESULTS. THERE ARE HOSTAGES FROM SOMEWHERE AROUND 30 COUNTRIES, WHY HAVE WE NOT YET SEEN PRIME MINISTERS, FOREIGN MINISTERS, GLOBAL LEADERS SCREAMING TO GET THE WOUNDED HELP? &gt;&gt; RACHEL ALSO GOT TO BE IN A POOL WITH OTHER AMERICAN FAMILIES AND PRESIDENT BIDEN. &gt;&gt; HE STAYED FOR 90 MINUTES AND LISTEN TO US, AND CRIED WITH US. &gt;&gt; I KNOW LOSS, I HAVE LOST TWO CHILDREN, I LOST MY WIFE, AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH THIS, BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO REMEMBER THAT YOU WILL BE STRONG AGAIN FOR YOUR FAMILY. HE SAID THINGS THAT BECAUSE HE KNOWS LAWS, SO IT WASN'T PLATITUDES, IT WAS SOMEONE SPEAKING WHO HAS LOST CHILDREN, SPEAKING TO A MOTHER WHO LOST HER TWO CHILDREN. IT'S WAS REAL MOMENT OF COMING TOGETHER JUST AS PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT'S PAIN IS. THIS VERY EXCRUCIATING PARTS OF PAIN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A PARTICULAR KIND OF &gt;&gt; CORRECT. THERE IS NO PLAYBOOK FOR THIS THAT WE KNOW OF. THE GAME DAILY IS HE ALIVE? IS HE GETTING TREATMENT? DID HE DIE 15 DAYS AGO? WE ARE ON THE HEAD OF A PEN, AND EVERY DIRECTION YOU FALL IS A BAD DIRECTION. SO, A LOT OF HOW WE GET THROUGH THE DAY WHEN YOU ASKED THAT REPORT IS WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE ON THE HEAD OF THE PIN AND JUST GET EVERYTHING DONE WITH THE HOPE THAT HE WILL COME HOME TO US ALIVE, AND HE'LL GO ON THAT TRIP WITH ONE HAND. &gt;&gt; JOHN AND RACHEL. WITH ME NOW IS VETERAN CHIEF OF JERUSALEM POST. THE SITUATION WITH THE HOSTAGES IS SO HORRIFIC AND SICKENING. DO YOU HEAR, WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE DO WHAT DO THEY TALK ABOUT FIRST, WHAT DO YOU HEAR FROM PEOPLE? I THINK THE RALLIES ARE IN A STATE OF SHOCK AND TRAUMA. THEY'RE ALSO IN THIS WAITING GAME, NOT KNOWING WHETHER THIS GROUND OFFENSIVE IS GOING TO HAPPEN OR NOT. THERE ARE 360,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE MASKED ON THE BORDER, AND THAT AFFECTS FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE, SIBLING, SPOUSES, PARENTS IN SOME CASES. SO, I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE MOST OF. THE HOSPITALITY WAGING IS VERY MUCH ON PEOPLES MINDS. THAT HAS BEEN VERY MUCH THE CONVERSATION THIS TIME. &gt;&gt; HAMAS COULD RELEASE ALL THEIR HOSTAGES RIGHT AWAY. THE GAME THEY ARE PLAYING OF RELEASING TWO BY TWO IS VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS A TACTIC THERE AND THE STRATEGY THERE, THE MANIPULATION OF IT. IT IS INCREDIBLE TO ME THAT WOUNDED HOSTAGES, AND FANS, TODDLERS, PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MEDICAL CONDITIONS ARE STILL BEING HELD. &gt;&gt; IT'S SHOCKING. THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE ANYTHING WE'VE ENCOUNTERED OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS. I DON'T KNOW THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAS THE VOCABULARY TO ENABLE US TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH. BUT, THE HORROR OF HAVING SMALL INFANTS, ELDERLY PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OR",

MAY GOD'S COUNTENANCE BE LIFTED UP TOWARDS YOU AND GIVE YOU PEACE. &gt;&gt; WOULD YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT HERSH? &gt;&gt; HE'S A SUPER CURIOUS KID, AND THIS WANDERLUST HE DEVELOPED WHEN HE WAS SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD HAS BEEN HIS LIFE, OBSESSION ALWAYS ASKING FOR MAPS AND GLOBES AND ATLAS IS FOR HIS BAR MITZVAH. THESE LAST FEW YEARS HE'S REALLY SAVED EVERY PENNY TO GO ON THIS TRIP THAT HE HAS A TICKET FOR ON DECEMBER 27TH. HE WAS GOING TO GO TO INDIA, AND THEY'LL ALL POINTS. EAST &gt;&gt; RACHEL AND JOHN WERE ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE WORLD TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE PLAY OF THE HOSTAGES, PARTICULARLY THOSE LIKE HER TO HAVE SERIOUS WOUNDS OR MEDICAL ISSUES. &gt;&gt; AS AMERICANS ISRAELIS, WE HAVE BEEN EMBRACED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE SUPPORT IS THERE. THE EMPATHY IS THERE FROM THE U.S.. WE ARE OBVIOUSLY HUNGRY FOR MORE THAN THAT. WE WANT ACTION. WE WANT RESULTS. THERE ARE HOSTAGES FROM SOMEWHERE AROUND 30 COUNTRIES, WHY HAVE WE NOT YET SEEN PRIME MINISTERS, FOREIGN MINISTERS, GLOBAL LEADERS SCREAMING TO GET THE WOUNDED HELP? &gt;&gt; RACHEL ALSO GOT TO BE IN A POOL WITH OTHER AMERICAN FAMILIES AND PRESIDENT BIDEN. &gt;&gt; HE STAYED FOR 90 MINUTES AND LISTEN TO US, AND CRIED WITH US. &gt;&gt; I KNOW LOSS, I HAVE LOST TWO CHILDREN, I LOST MY WIFE, AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH THIS, BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO REMEMBER THAT YOU WILL BE STRONG AGAIN FOR YOUR FAMILY. HE SAID THINGS THAT BECAUSE HE KNOWS LAWS, SO IT WASN'T PLATITUDES, IT WAS SOMEONE SPEAKING WHO HAS LOST CHILDREN, SPEAKING TO A MOTHER WHO LOST HER TWO CHILDREN. IT'S WAS REAL MOMENT OF COMING TOGETHER JUST AS PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT'S PAIN IS. THIS VERY EXCRUCIATING PARTS OF PAIN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A PARTICULAR KIND OF &gt;&gt; CORRECT. THERE IS NO PLAYBOOK FOR THIS THAT WE KNOW OF. THE GAME DAILY IS HE ALIVE? IS HE GETTING TREATMENT? DID HE DIE 15 DAYS AGO? WE ARE ON THE HEAD OF A PEN, AND EVERY DIRECTION YOU FALL IS A BAD DIRECTION. SO, A LOT OF HOW WE GET THROUGH THE DAY WHEN YOU ASKED THAT REPORT IS WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE ON THE HEAD OF THE PIN AND JUST GET EVERYTHING DONE WITH THE HOPE THAT HE WILL COME HOME TO US ALIVE, AND HE'LL GO ON THAT TRIP WITH ONE HAND. &gt;&gt; JOHN AND RACHEL. WITH ME NOW IS VETERAN CHIEF OF JERUSALEM POST. THE SITUATION WITH THE HOSTAGES IS SO HORRIFIC AND SICKENING. DO YOU HEAR, WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE DO WHAT DO THEY TALK ABOUT FIRST, WHAT DO YOU HEAR FROM PEOPLE? I THINK THE RALLIES ARE IN A STATE OF SHOCK AND TRAUMA. THEY'RE ALSO IN THIS WAITING GAME, NOT KNOWING WHETHER THIS GROUND OFFENSIVE IS GOING TO HAPPEN OR NOT. THERE ARE 360,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE MASKED ON THE BORDER, AND THAT AFFECTS FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE, SIBLING, SPOUSES, PARENTS IN SOME CASES. SO, I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE MOST OF. THE HOSPITALITY WAGING IS VERY MUCH ON PEOPLES MINDS. THAT HAS BEEN VERY MUCH THE CONVERSATION THIS TIME. &gt;&gt; HAMAS COULD RELEASE ALL THEIR HOSTAGES RIGHT AWAY. THE GAME THEY ARE PLAYING OF RELEASING TWO BY TWO IS VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS A TACTIC THERE AND THE STRATEGY THERE, THE MANIPULATION OF IT. IT IS INCREDIBLE TO ME THAT WOUNDED HOSTAGES, AND FANS, TODDLERS, PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MEDICAL CONDITIONS ARE STILL BEING HELD. &gt;&gt; IT'S SHOCKING. THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE ANYTHING WE'VE ENCOUNTERED OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS. I DON'T KNOW THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAS THE VOCABULARY TO ENABLE US TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH. BUT, THE HORROR OF HAVING SMALL INFANTS, ELDERLY PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OR"

Pulling it all been murdered in a tunnel in Gaza. His story became one of the most well known, in part because of the tireless efforts of his two parents, Rachel Goldberg and John Poland, to advocate for their son, Hirsh, and all the other hostages. We warn you, some of the video you're about to see is graphic. Five days after the October 7th massacre at the Nova music Festival site, an Israeli soldier showed me a disturbing video of a young Israeli man with his left hand blown off, being kidnaped, loaded into a pickup truck. I didn't know who he was, but four days later, by coincidence, I interviewed John Poland and Rachel Goldberg for the first time on CNN. When I turned on my phone, which I don't normally use on the Jewish Sabbath, that's when I saw two texts pop up at eight, ten, eight, 11 in the morning. The first one said, I love you. And the second one said, I'm sorry. And immediately I knew something horrible must have been happening or was about to happen. I didn't know they were the parents of the young man I'd seen in that video, until John said this during our interview. And we know from three eyewitness accounts of survivors that basically, there were at least 11 grenades thrown into the bomb shelter. Our son, by all accounts, officer of the witnesses, had his left arm blown off at some point during the attack. That's when I realized I'd seen their son. And they had no idea the video of him being taken hostage existed. I waited till the interview was over and called them and then sent them the video I had. I met with them a week later. First of all, it's it's a crazy sequence of events that we talked to you through a computer screen and then get a phone call from you saying, I have a video of your son. I didn't want to say on live television, which is so appreciated. Of course, the way everything has unfolded, the gentleness that you used. Because at the end of the day, you're a journalist and journalists want a story. And that could have been dealt with in many other ways that were not kind and gentle. Seeing that video in general gave us a dose of optimism. How were you able to get through each day? I personally feel like we have to keep running to the end of the earth to save him, and we have to try to go believing that somehow he got treatment and he's there. They showed me Hirsch's room, which Rachel would visit to feel close to him. We have reports that face himself, and I went out Friday night and it was like screaming to him and hoping him just because Friday night, you know, we bless our children traditionally in Jewish homes. You bless your children on Friday night. So I was screaming. It's a traditional blessing for us. The Bible, what is the blessing today? It says, May God bless you and keep you. May God may God's face shine upon you and be gracious to you. May God's countenance countenance be lift up to lifted up towards you, and give you peace. In the weeks after Rachel and John worked tirelessly to raise awareness about Hirsch and the other hostages, Richard would. You're wearing, a tag that says 26. Don't tell people what that is. Well, this morning I realized, you know what? It's day 26, and I don't know if anyone is really counting. I don't know how many people really care every single day until these people come home. I'm going to be where and what day it is. So this is my new. Fashion statement. The weeks turned into months. This was them in April. We're living on another planet, so I don't know that we comprehend time the way that you do. Or normal people. We feel that everybody has failed our leaders. All of them have failed to make this suffering on all sides. Stop. we feel that we as parents have failed because as a parent, your job is to keep your children safe. It feels good. But then suddenly, a few weeks later, Hamas released this hostage video of Hirsch. It was the first proof his parents had. He was alive. We were sobbing, tears and emotional, overwhelmed feelings were just abounding. we weren't even listening to what he was saying. Just hearing his voice and seeing him moving and that he was alive. Then in late June, another video was released by the hostages and missing families, for this one taken on October 7th. Moments after the first video I'd sent them ended. You had so much concern about, whether Hirsch had made it out just from his injury alone. you see a tourniquet being put on at later on in the video? That. I mean, do you think that probably saved his life? Well, I'm happy that for whatever reasons, that he was obviously treated because, as we all know, on day 201, we had a video released that shows Hirsch with a stump where that jagged bone had been. But we know from day 201, thank God that he is alive. 129 days later, that hope became heartbreak. On day 330, Hirsch Goldberg Poland's body was found with five other hostages. Alexander Loeb in off Carmel, got Almog Suruchi, Adin Yerushalmi, and Ori Danilo. Israel says they were executed in a tunnel in Gaza, shot to death at close range. According to the Israeli prime Minister's office, there believed to be about 101 hostages still remaining in Gaza, 35 are believed to be dead. Short time ago, I spoke with Orna and Ronen Neutra, whose son Omer is another Israeli American still being held captive. Orna Ronen, thank you for talking with me today. I know you consider John Poland and Rachel Goldberg, Poland family. How are you dealing with what's happened? We are completely devastated, Anderson. This shouldn't have happened. Hirsch was supposed to come out in the first phase of a deal that's been on the table for a long time now, and it's just completely outrageous and devastating that this is what happened. Hirsch managed to survive in the 11 most terrible months with the monsters of, of of Hamas in Gaza, and yet was murdered and executed a couple of days ago in a most brutal way. It just heartbreaking. Rachel, yesterday, at the funeral said, that that she hopes that that Hirsch's death will be what she called a turning point in this horrible situation. And, and John said maybe, just maybe, your death, meaning Hirsch's death is the stone, the fuel that will bring home the remaining 101 hostages. Do you think that's possible? Do you feel like something may be different now for for Omer and the others? You know, it's it's not a clear path. we're seeing still many challenges, in the region. We're seeing a prime minister, that is not willing to make the compromises needed to reach a deal to bring our son and the other hostages back. We sure see, the Israeli public pouring in big numbers into the streets and telling the Israeli government that this event of the six hostages that were murdered few days back, it just unacceptable that this will continue. And we just hoping that this outpour outrage that, we see in Israel is going to affect the government and Bibi Netanyahu himself to, to reach that so desired deal and get the hostages back, as we know, this is urgent. And among them are 22 year old son, who, by the way, turns 23 on October 14th and this will be his second birthday, being held hostage. A very true, true. It's hard to think about that. No, we can't think that far. And we really hope that that, a deal, that the US government is working so hard with the partners in the region will be caught between Israel and Hamas and the two leaders, Hamas leader and Israeli, government must reach that deal, or else we won't see our deal once coming back. Do you have faith on unthinkable in in the prime minister, in Netanyahu, he asked for forgiveness that the six murdered hostages weren't brought back alive. He also said Hamas will pay a heavy price for this. Do you think he has the hostages front and center in his priorities? Well, we don't, unfortunately not. we met him in the white House with President Biden. We looked him in the eyes and unfortunately, our feeling is that he has his own political future ahead of him rather than the safety of our son. It's not just our son. I don't believe that he has the interest of the Israeli people, as his top priority. anyone you know that's looking at this can see that Israelis need the hostages to come home for them to be able to recover from this, to move forward. But the first step would be to bring the hostages back to to make the families whole, to, bring back some sense of security. Right. This was a breach between the Israeli government and its people,",

We must warn you that you are about to see in this segment is going to be very difficult to watch out. For. All these are the scenes overnight of the camp in Rafah set ablaze Israeli military claim to CNN Hamas officials were killed in the strike with what they called precise munitions. Local officials say most of the casualties were women and children. Now you can see the location of the camp on this map, and it's a reminder that over a million people have been sheltering in Rafah as the war forced people further south, though many have fled yet again as Israel ramps up the operations in that area. The strike came just two days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah. On Sunday, Hamas fired rockets at Tel Aviv, the first attack of its kind into Israel since January. CNN's Not Bashir Following developments for us, he's standing by in London, but a distressing video out of Rafah. A lot of that video we actually cannot share because it is so disturbing. Help us understand the impacts of this strike. Well, a colony, as you mentioned, many of those who were sheltering in this Talal Sultan neighborhood in Rafah have been displaced. Time and time again, they have been pushed south into the southern city of Rafah by the Israeli military, told that this would be a safe zone. And in fact, over the last month, we have been hearing warnings from the IDF telling civilians now to evacuate parts of Rafah to Gaza's coastal area for their safety and protection, ahead of a looming full scale ground operation. This was not one of those areas. This was not an area that received an evacuation order. This was supposed to be a safe zone for civilians. Clearly, that is not the case. And seen this incident overnight. Airstrikes targeting an area that is densely populated by civilians filled with tents, makeshift tents sheltering civilians. And we have seen graphic, disturbing, horrifying video emerging from the scene last night. Tents completely engulfed in flames, charred bodies being pulled from the burning shelters, including the bodies of children. Now, as we have heard from the health authorities in Gaza, the majority of those casualties More than 240 people have so far said to have been badly wounded and injured. We've heard from health authorities saying they simply do not have the capacity in the remaining hospitals in the area to care for that number of casualties. So this is an overall disastrous situation for many of those civilians in the southern city of Rafah. Huge amount of concern. Of course, we've been hearing widespread condemnation and warnings against further military action in Rafah. Clearly, those warnings have not been heeded. So, yeah, and you know what is, of course, you know, getting a lot of attention as well. Is this just a few days after the ICJ ruling for Israel to halt operations in Rafah? We have seen some reaction, firstly, to whether Israel is going to be adhering to that ruling and of course, the criticism of the way that Israel is conducting this operation in Rafah. What more do we know? Yeah, absolutely. We've been hearing fierce criticism, of course, from European leaders. We heard earlier this morning from the EU's foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, saying that Israel must adhere to the ICJ ruling that it must immediately halt military operations in Rafah. We've heard from the German foreign minister saying earlier today that the international Court of Justice order for Israel to halt its military operation in the southern Gaza City is binding and has to be followed. And in fact, President Macron. France has also issued a statement. He said that he was outraged by last night's attack on Rafah, that these operations must stop. There are no safe areas in there for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and for an immediate ceasefire. And of course, there is huge amount of concern around the potential for further military action in Rafah. We've had previously from one of Israel's closest allies, the Biden administration, President Biden himself speaking to CNN, saying that if Israel were to fully go into Rafah, than the U.S. would not be able to support in the form of arms and weapons, that that would not be the case. It remains to be seen whether this latest incident is in fact, a red line for President Biden. This has certainly drawn outrage amongst many in the international community, particularly, of course, from the United Nations, which has repeated, he warned, against a full operation in Rafah and continued airstrikes in Rafah. This is an area that is densely populated still with civilians, the vast majority internally displaced. And of course, there is simply nowhere safe left for civilians to turn. there are questions around how this will impact ongoing ceasefire negotiations. That is another point of concern. We heard today from Qatar officials saying that they are worried that this could hinder the ongoing discussions around a potential truce between Israel and Hamas. Only that. Nada. Bashir, thank you so much for that update. Well, the Palestinian Authority is calling on the United States to put more pressure on Israel to stop the violence and said the US bears responsibility for these crimes that shames humanity. We have not heard from the Biden administration yet regarding the attack on the refugee camp. Just a few weeks ago, the US president seemed to put forward a red line when it came to targeting civilians in Rafah. If I go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with a deal with the cities, a deal with that problem. We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks that came out of the and Middle East recently. But it's it's just wrong. We're not going to we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used. Well, we are closely following the response from the Americans, and we will bring it to you when we get us.",

Just a few weeks ago, the US president seemed to put forward a red line when it came to targeting civilians in Rafah. If I go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with a deal with the cities, a deal with that problem. We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks that came out of the and Middle East recently. But it's it's just wrong. We're not going to we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used. Well, we are closely following the response from the Americans, and we will bring it to you when we get us."

                "Token": "There are new signs this morning that the Israeli Defense Force could move into Gaza at any minute. CNN has seen a buildup of military right along the border and now flares late into the night. This comes as Israeli government officials tell CNN's Nic Robertson that the troops have the, quote, green light to enter Gaza. Now, those officials also say that Gaza a 50 mile border with Israel, will look radically different after any military incursion. They tell CNN that a tough buffer zone will be established, one that would essentially be a no go zone in the IDF will be able to go into Gaza and arrest people whenever they want, theoretically on their terms, much like they can now in the West Bank. Joining us now at the magic wall. CNN military analyst, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling serve. Good to see you. I want to start with the flares because Nic Robertson was pointing this out show video of it right now, and he made clear that that's not the norm necessarily in this moment. What does that tell you? It just tells me that the Israeli forces are looking for something or they're trying to use a little bit of psychological warfare against the people inside of Gaza. This is not that big of a deal. It is just to show potentially the commanders that are on the scene where different crossing points are what they're looking for. It's to orient those who are new to the area. The big question is, will this become a regional conflict? The president talked about that last night. Let's talk about what we have just seen in the region. The fact that two sources told CNN overnight that Navy warships, U.S. Navy warships operating in the Middle East had to counter multiple projectiles fired on the coast of Yemen yesterday. And then you couple that with what the Pentagon says are drone attack attempts in Iraq and where U.S. officials are in Iraq and and and Syria. Yeah, a couple of things that happened yesterday. The drone attack out off the coast of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden down here against the USS Carney, drew a lot of attention. Integrated air defense from that ship shot the drones and the missiles down that were coming out of Yemen. That's important. But the range from there to Israel is pretty far. And it's they don't have a great missile force, let's put it that way. But the other things that were occurring are would be a normal day in some in some countries, like the drone attack at Al-Tanf in Syria. That is a U.S. military base in that particular reason. It's been there for a while. Other drone attacks outside Air Force Base. I've been out there are many times in Iraq, Erbil, Baghdad and in the southern part of Iraq just tells me that the popular mobilization fronts, the Iranian backed rebels are actually targeting those kinds of locations just as harassment attacks. There was also two Israeli citizens killed in Egypt, which just shows that there's a swell of a ground movement that is a result of some of the things that have been going on there. And all of these Arab street does not want Israel to go into Gaza. Just take a step back to what your point has been. And I think it's very valuable to note that these bases, these U.S. bases are often harassed or often subject to drone attacks or rocket attacks. All of it happening on the same day, the same day the president gives an Oval Office address as Israel is preparing for what looks like a ground incursion, different proxies from Iran. But does that tell you something? Yeah, it's a call for it's a call for harassment. It's a call for attacks. It is a jihad. They are receiving information from Iran saying let's upped the ante a little bit and show our displeasure at what's going on in Israel. Moments ago, a large group of people were seen rallying for the opening of the Rafah crossing on the Egypt border. And you can see this. This is right outside that border a few miles around that crossing. There's craters in front of it. We understand about 20 trucks. Some of those drivers have told us they actually saw the Egyptian moving concrete as if there was a mate, maybe the possibility of an opening. But subsequently, CNN has learned that the Rafah crossing will not open today as had been anticipated. But that sense of on the ground and that that terrain desert gives you some perspective on where we stand right now. Just moments ago, we did hear from the U.N. secretary general, Antonio Gutierrez, who is at the Rafah border crossing on the Egyptian side. So he is there you got a U.N. compound on the other side where where we know people are better supplied than most places, but still with dwindling, dwindling supplies. And of course, he's standing where all those trucks loaded with aid are waiting to enter Behind these walls. We have 2 million people that is suffering enormously. So these trucks are not just trucks. They are a lifeline. They are the difference between life and death for so many people. In Gaza. What we need is to make them move, to make the move to the other side of this wall, to make the move as quickly as possible. So those cement blocks that I referenced, we actually have video of that. CNN has obtained that from some of these truck drivers who are sitting there night upon night and waiting, moving those blocks at the entrance of the crossing. There are those 20 trucks they are expected to enter once the crossing opens. The United Nations is saying that it needs, though, 100 trucks a day to provide adequate aid to the people inside Gaza. 20 trucks right now. And they need 100 a day. This comes as Gaza's main medical facility is in danger of running out of fuel within hours. No fuel has been coming into Gaza now for days. And, of course, to run a generator, you need fuel. All of that is now running out. Doctors Without Borders said yesterday that the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City only had enough fuel to run its generators for 24 more hours. That hospital is one of the few places in Gaza that actually even has electricity for now. And on that front, we have been getting dispatches from people inside Gaza daily. And, you know, we get these small clips and they cut out because of the phone connections because they don't have the power. Our journalist, Ibrahim Dam on Escape Northern Gaza in the south was his wife and two sons. He's been filing these dispatches for OUTFRONT every night. And here's his latest report on the situation in Khan Younis. A lot. And genuineness. I mean, Sarah, it matters. A man in front of a lot newness or no danger and official Baird will be there. And in between, the men lurking the land mines and so on will but the joy of newness will cost very much right JLP. If anyone is sarbjit done. I've done my hammamet my soul. Well, I'm I've been so budget done for my official fish, my the shuttle side of the of joy. We actually required to go and didn't get a little bit of something a month ago. So the world is turning into a white cloud. Something poetic and profound about that, that horrible image. Joining us now is Apple Brand. While the US executive director for Doctors Without Borders and Apple, I appreciate speaking with you again. I know that you have a team in this main hospital in Gaza, the Al-Shifa hospital. Can you give us any update on their situation Yes. I mean, we are really beside ourselves because we often lose contact with them, as you mentioned, with the lack of electricity, the inability to charge phones, cell signals often being cut out, very difficult to get real time information from the team. And what we do know is that our medical coordinator was warning that the fuel was reaching catastrophic lows. And of course, they will ration they will try to stretch it out as much as possible because you need that fuel to run generator for the lifesaving medical equipment, including incubators for neonates, dialysis machines and just just general functioning for all the trauma surgeries that they're trying to do.",

                "Token": "an Israeli official says prime minister Benjamin&nbsp; Netanyahu has disbanded the war cabinet which was&nbsp;&nbsp; responsible for key decisions relating to&nbsp; the Israel Hamas War it was formed in the&nbsp;&nbsp; days after the October 7th Hamas attacks the&nbsp; decision comes after opposition leader Benny&nbsp;&nbsp; gance withdrew from the body last week&nbsp; meanwhile Israel's military announced a&nbsp;&nbsp; daily tactical pause along a specific route and&nbsp; specific times to allow for humanitarian Aid&nbsp;&nbsp; into Gaza the IDF later clarified that it's&nbsp; still its troops are still fighting in Rafa&nbsp;&nbsp; and parts of Gaza CNN's Paula hanock is joining&nbsp; us now from Southern Israel Paula let's start&nbsp;&nbsp; with uh Benjamin netanyahu's decision to&nbsp; disband his War cabinet what's behind that decision well am in the war cabinet there were&nbsp; always three men who are basically making the&nbsp;&nbsp; decisions which was the Prime Minister the defense&nbsp; minister and the opposition leader Benny Gant now&nbsp;&nbsp; of course since Gant has resigned saying uh he's&nbsp; in protest of the fact there's no uh plan to get&nbsp;&nbsp; the hostages out no day after plan uh for Gaza&nbsp; and another plan to to get people back to Northern&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel as well who've been evacuated it is now&nbsp; effectively a twers war cabinet so what he has&nbsp;&nbsp; done is he's disbanded that and he has said&nbsp; according to an official in his office that&nbsp;&nbsp; the decisions when it comes to the war in Gaza&nbsp; will be made on a uh a security cabinet basis&nbsp;&nbsp; which is uh a wider cabinet basis uh also saying&nbsp; that or experts are saying that this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; avoids the uh the pressure that was coming from&nbsp; the far right of his Coalition uh some of those&nbsp;&nbsp; far right elements wanted to be part of the war&nbsp; cabinet uh so by disbanding it potentially he&nbsp;&nbsp; has uh uh got rid of that problem as well he&nbsp; doesn't have to accept or reject them because&nbsp;&nbsp; he does have a balancing act when it comes&nbsp; to his Coalition at this point uh but they&nbsp;&nbsp; do say within the prime minister's office this&nbsp; won't make a difference to actually making the&nbsp;&nbsp; decisions on the uh the war in Gaza and if they&nbsp; have to they will have smaller groups to decide&nbsp;&nbsp; tactical changes amra and regarding that tactical&nbsp; pause uh if there is still fighting going on in&nbsp;&nbsp; Rafa and parts of Gaza as the IDF says is this&nbsp; tactical pause in effect to allow humanitarian Aid in so this is a pause that comes from the&nbsp; Kem Shalom Crossing where we just were&nbsp;&nbsp; and it goes into Gaza and then up the salahadin&nbsp; road which is effectively the the north south Road&nbsp;&nbsp; uh that runs through Gaza now from the idf's point&nbsp; of view they say that they are securing that road&nbsp;&nbsp; so it will be safe for uh in uh International Aid&nbsp; organizations to distribute AIDS which they say is&nbsp;&nbsp; stuck on the Gaza side uh of the Kem Shalom border&nbsp; they say there's more than a thousand trucks that&nbsp;&nbsp; are there currently but we've spoken to some of&nbsp; those Aid groups including the UN groups in Gaza&nbsp;&nbsp; uh and they say that sometimes it is simply too&nbsp; dangerous for them to be able to get to that&nbsp;&nbsp; cross in and pick up the aid it's not just the&nbsp; fighting that they're concerned about it's also&nbsp;&nbsp; the sense of of lawlessness uh in Gaza there is&nbsp; a lot of looting uh they say it's very dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp; for them to be able to try and distribute the&nbsp; aid I did ask the IDF spokesperson if there&nbsp;&nbsp; would be some kind of military uh escort with uh&nbsp; these uh these trucks to try and get the aid in&nbsp;&nbsp; and that was uh not answered so at this point&nbsp; it doesn't appear that that would be the case&nbsp;&nbsp; we've also heard from the Gaza media office&nbsp; saying uh that as far as they're concerned&nbsp;&nbsp; there's been no tactical pause uh so they believe&nbsp; that it is Israeli lies in their uh words now the&nbsp;&nbsp; IDF has been quite clear that the fighting will&nbsp; continue it will continue in Rafa which is very&nbsp;&nbsp; close to where this uh this route is uh for the&nbsp; Tactical pause uh as they will be continuing uh&nbsp;&nbsp; what they have been doing since last month Amar&nbsp; all right Paula hanock watching this for us from&nbsp;&nbsp; Southern Israel thank you Paula meanwhile a&nbsp; US Special Envoy arrives in Israel Monday as&nbsp;&nbsp; tensions escalate on Israel's northern border&nbsp; with Lebanon CNN's Ben Weedman is joining us&nbsp;&nbsp; now live from Beirut uh Ben you and officials&nbsp; are warning that there is a very real danger&nbsp;&nbsp; of miscalculation escalating the conflict along&nbsp; uh the Israel and lebanon's Border what have you learned well what we've been seen is that&nbsp; certainly in the last few weeks uh things&nbsp;&nbsp; on the border have gotten much hotter in terms&nbsp; of the daily back and forth between hisbah and&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel although I must add that it's a currently&nbsp; a Muslim holiday and yesterday on the at least&nbsp;&nbsp; from hisbah side they didn't fire anything at&nbsp;

inside Israel the price for Israel would be very&nbsp;&nbsp; high but prime minister Netanyahu is under&nbsp; intense pressure from the public in Israel&nbsp;&nbsp; to allow those people who fled the north to go&nbsp;

there was a release of hostages in exchange for&nbsp;&nbsp; Palestinian prisoners and detainees the Border&nbsp; along between Lebanon and Israel was quiet hisb&nbsp;&nbsp; has made it clear if the fighting stops in&nbsp;

                "Lemma": "an Israeli official says prime minister Benjamin&nbsp; Netanyahu has disbanded the war cabinet which was&nbsp;&nbsp; responsible for key decisions relating to&nbsp; the Israel Hamas War it was formed in the&nbsp;&nbsp; days after the October 7th Hamas attacks the&nbsp; decision comes after opposition leader Benny&nbsp;&nbsp; gance withdrew from the body last week&nbsp; meanwhile Israel's military announced a&nbsp;&nbsp; daily tactical pause along a specific route and&nbsp; specific times to allow for humanitarian Aid&nbsp;&nbsp; into Gaza the IDF later clarified that it's&nbsp; still its troops are still fighting in Rafa&nbsp;&nbsp; and parts of Gaza CNN's Paula hanock is joining&nbsp; us now from Southern Israel Paula let's start&nbsp;&nbsp; with uh Benjamin netanyahu's decision to&nbsp; disband his War cabinet what's behind that decision well am in the war cabinet there were&nbsp; always three men who are basically making the&nbsp;&nbsp; decisions which was the Prime Minister the defense&nbsp; minister and the opposition leader Benny Gant now&nbsp;&nbsp; of course since Gant has resigned saying uh he's&nbsp; in protest of the fact there's no uh plan to get&nbsp;&nbsp; the hostages out no day after plan uh for Gaza&nbsp; and another plan to to get people back to Northern&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel as well who've been evacuated it is now&nbsp; effectively a twers war cabinet so what he has&nbsp;&nbsp; done is he's disbanded that and he has said&nbsp; according to an official in his office that&nbsp;&nbsp; the decisions when it comes to the war in Gaza&nbsp; will be made on a uh a security cabinet basis&nbsp;&nbsp; which is uh a wider cabinet basis uh also saying&nbsp; that or experts are saying that this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; avoids the uh the pressure that was coming from&nbsp; the far right of his Coalition uh some of those&nbsp;&nbsp; far right elements wanted to be part of the war&nbsp; cabinet uh so by disbanding it potentially he&nbsp;&nbsp; has uh uh got rid of that problem as well he&nbsp; doesn't have to accept or reject them because&nbsp;&nbsp; he does have a balancing act when it comes&nbsp; to his Coalition at this point uh but they&nbsp;&nbsp; do say within the prime minister's office this&nbsp; won't make a difference to actually making the&nbsp;&nbsp; decisions on the uh the war in Gaza and if they&nbsp; have to they will have smaller groups to decide&nbsp;&nbsp; tactical changes amra and regarding that tactical&nbsp; pause uh if there is still fighting going on in&nbsp;&nbsp; Rafa and parts of Gaza as the IDF says is this&nbsp; tactical pause in effect to allow humanitarian Aid in so this is a pause that comes from the&nbsp; Kem Shalom Crossing where we just were&nbsp;&nbsp; and it goes into Gaza and then up the salahadin&nbsp; road which is effectively the the north south Road&nbsp;&nbsp; uh that runs through Gaza now from the idf's point&nbsp; of view they say that they are securing that road&nbsp;&nbsp; so it will be safe for uh in uh International Aid&nbsp; organizations to distribute AIDS which they say is&nbsp;&nbsp; stuck on the Gaza side uh of the Kem Shalom border&nbsp; they say there's more than a thousand trucks that&nbsp;&nbsp; are there currently but we've spoken to some of&nbsp; those Aid groups including the UN groups in Gaza&nbsp;&nbsp; uh and they say that sometimes it is simply too&nbsp; dangerous for them to be able to get to that&nbsp;&nbsp; cross in and pick up the aid it's not just the&nbsp; fighting that they're concerned about it's also&nbsp;&nbsp; the sense of of lawlessness uh in Gaza there is&nbsp; a lot of looting uh they say it's very dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp; for them to be able to try and distribute the&nbsp; aid I did ask the IDF spokesperson if there&nbsp;&nbsp; would be some kind of military uh escort with uh&nbsp; these uh these trucks to try and get the aid in&nbsp;&nbsp; and that was uh not answered so at this point&nbsp; it doesn't appear that that would be the case&nbsp;&nbsp; we've also heard from the Gaza media office&nbsp; saying uh that as far as they're concerned&nbsp;&nbsp; there's been no tactical pause uh so they believe&nbsp; that it is Israeli lies in their uh words now the&nbsp;&nbsp; IDF has been quite clear that the fighting will&nbsp; continue it will continue in Rafa which is very&nbsp;&nbsp; close to where this uh this route is uh for the&nbsp; Tactical pause uh as they will be continuing uh&nbsp;&nbsp; what they have been doing since last month Amar&nbsp; all right Paula hanock watching this for us from&nbsp;&nbsp; Southern Israel thank you Paula meanwhile a&nbsp; US Special Envoy arrives in Israel Monday as&nbsp;&nbsp; tensions escalate on Israel's northern border&nbsp; with Lebanon CNN's Ben Weedman is joining us&nbsp;&nbsp; now live from Beirut uh Ben you and officials&nbsp; are warning that there is a very real danger&nbsp;&nbsp; of miscalculation escalating the conflict along&nbsp; uh the Israel and lebanon's Border what have you learned well what we've been seen is that&nbsp; certainly in the last few weeks uh things&nbsp;&nbsp; on the border have gotten much hotter in terms&nbsp; of the daily back and forth between hisbah and&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel although I must add that it's a currently&nbsp; a Muslim holiday and yesterday on the at least&nbsp;&nbsp; from hisbah side they didn't fire anything at&nbsp; the Israelis as far as we can tell but this&nbsp;&nbsp; Envoy Amos Hawkin who's the senior energy&nbsp; adviser at the White House and he's really&nbsp;&nbsp; the point man in dealing with the sort of the&nbsp;

                "Token": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will address a joint meeting of Congress ahead of his speech, hundreds of protesters staged a sit in inside the Capitol calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are planning to skip the speech as the party remains divided over his handling of the war. CNN's Lauren Fox is with me now. What are we expecting today? Loren? Yeah, this address is coming at such a tumultuous time. And not just U.S. politics, but also Israeli politics. And as Benjamin Netanyahu faces challenges back home. This is a high stakes speech for him, given the fact that there are lawmakers who are going to be in this audience, who have serious questions, serious doubts about Netanyahu's leadership right now. And that includes some Republicans. I was talking last night to Senator Joni Ernst. She serves on the Armed Services Committee, and she said she has to hear a very clear and concise message from Netanyahu today about the path forward in this war and how he is going to get hostages home. She said. It is far beyond time for that to happen. But you are also going to see many Democrats not attending this speech today. There are more than 80 House Democrats who we know are going to be boycotting six U.S. senators who are going to be boycotting, including Patty Murray, who is a top Democrat in leadership, who is not going to be attending this speech today. Overseeing it is going to be Senator Ben Cardin. He's going to be presiding. And I think that that just says a lot about this moment right now as Netanyahu comes in to give this address. You know, there are some Democrats who are going to be having alternative programing. This is Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, who said in a statement, instead of attending Benjamin Netanyahu's address, I will attend a panel discussion led by the Center of American Progress and other organizations on the path to Peace. This event will feature a Palestinian leader, a Jewish Israeli leader and a former IDF soldier, all of whom are dedicated to finding a path toward peace and security. And I just want to remind people that this address is happening after the initial invitation went out from speaker Mike Johnson. Obviously, it's going to be really interesting to see what House Republicans think of this speech. Meanwhile, last night on the Senate floor, a series of Democrats addressed the issues that they see happening and concerns that they have about Benjamin Netanyahu coming. This is independent Senator Bernie Sanders. It will be the first time in American history that a war criminal has been given that order. Frankly, this invitation to Netanyahu is a disgrace and something that we will look back on with regret. And earlier this year, remember, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer actually called on the Israeli people to hold a new election and replace Benjamin Netanyahu. Laura Fox in Washington will be watching this very closely. Lauren, thank you very much. will address the US Congress for a record fourth time. Now he hopes to shore up American support for the war in Gaza. But many of the families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza are criticizing his trip, with some saying he should have remained at home to secure a deal to release the hostages. Now his trip comes amid an upheaval in U.S. politics. Though his visit was orchestrated by Republican leaders, many prominent Democrats like Vice President Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren won't be in attendance for his speech. I'm not going because, Benjamin Netanyahu has led that region into a complete humanitarian disaster. He has put his own personal interests ahead of the interests of the people of his country. And what he has done in Gaza is unspeakable right now. Prime Minister Netanyahu is scheduled to meet President Biden on Thursday and former President Trump on Friday. CNN's Not a Beshear joins us now live from London. so not a what can you tell us about the upcoming speech and what Netanyahu here expects to achieve? Look, mean? There is growing pressure from representatives and family members of those hostages still held captive by Hamas in Gaza. For Prime Minister Netanyahu to strike a deal. They want that to be the focus of his address to Congress. In fact, we've heard from the host of Challenge Forum, which has said they want to see Netanyahu opening his address by saying that is a deal. And we have heard some optimistic notes from the Israeli prime minister, and we've even heard some signs of optimism from U.S. officials as well. It's understood that there is a clear framework on the deal that they're just hammering out those finer details and technicalities. But as you mentioned, there is growing criticism of the Israeli prime minister back home in Israel and from the family members and representatives still have cut to saying that he should be at home focusing on the return of those hostages, bringing an end to the war in Gaza, securing that ceasefire agreement. Now, of course, all eyes will be on his address. Now, as you mentioned, we are already seeing backlash in Washington DC, not only as members of the Democrat Party now choosing to boycott, to not attend the congressional address by the Israeli prime minister. But we're also seeing protests as well. Of course, we saw protests yesterday. Members of the Jewish Voice for peace movement occupying is staging a sit in in congressional building. We've also seen, of course, other protest taking place across the country and are expecting to see more today. But of course, that growing black backlash is not only centered in Israel and in Washington. It is a global backlash. And, of course, the U.S. has been vocal in pushing the Israeli government for a cease fire deal to be struck. Now, at this stage, we've heard from President Biden speaking on Monday, he believes that the parties involved in this negotiation are, in his words, on the verge of coming to some sort of agreement. The State Department has said that the gap separating those two is narrowing, that there are still some issues which remain. But of course, pressure is mounting. And of course, the situation in Gaza is only worsening as well. If a deal isn't struck soon, we will be entering ten months of this war. That is, ten months with hostages still held captive in Hamas. That is, ten months with civilians in Gaza being killed on a daily basis. That death toll now topping 39,000. The UN warning that famine is spreading throughout the Gaza Strip, and we are seeing the humanitarian situation worsened with that disease, is spreading rapidly across the Gaza Strip. We're seeing continued airstrikes in southern Gaza as well. Of course, deadly strikes in Khan Younis, where hundreds, thousands, even civilians have been ordered to evacuate once again. So it is a deteriorating situation. We're seeing mounting pressure from U.S. officials. Many have been careful to clarify that the U.S. maintains its strong relationship with Israel, that Israel continues to be one of the United States closest and perhaps most important allies in the Middle East. But again, we have seen those tensions mounting, particularly between President Biden and the Israeli Prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. They are expected to meet, of course, on Thursday. Netanyahu now also expected to meet with with Donald Trump formally as president, and of course, also with Kamala Harris. So important meetings taking place. But all eyes will be on that congressional address later today, expectations around what he might say. And of course, the reaction, crucially from the Democrats as well, and all of the very real dynamics that you laid out, particularly on the humanitarian front, playing out in the politics of who will attend Netanyahu's address. surely not a Beshear. Thank you so much for the reporting. Now, the head of the opposition Labor Party in Israel is blasting the trip. Yeah, your goal and posting on it, saying, quote, Netanyahu went to the US for an extravagant show in the middle of the war without a deal to return hostages. I want to bring in CNN global affairs analyst Mark Esper. He was U.S. defense secretary under President Trump. good to see you. Thanks for being here. Now, Secretary of State Antony Blinken says they're inside the ten yard line, driving toward the goal line and getting a cease fire. That's his metaphor, not mine. But in getting a cease fire and hostage agreement that would produce, a cease fire. How optimistic are you of a deal getting done at this stage? And what do you make of Netanyahu appearing before Congress without a finalized deal? Right. Well, I was actually with, Jake Sullivan and Tony Blinken this past weekend in Aspen, and we talked about this and both believe are confident that we're within the ten yard line, as you said. But they also note that the often those last ten yards are the most difficult. look, I would say in some ways we've been here before. There have been numerous proposals on the table for Hamas. at the last minute they've raised the ante with, asking for adjustments and amendments and so forth. So we'll see. I mean, there is hope that there will be some type of agreement, but my view has been that Hamas is not going to be interested in any deal that does not call for a complete cease fire and the removal of all Israeli troops from Gaza. And, I see the Israeli government, Netanyahu unwilling to go there yet. if you look, the polling shows that a majority of, Israelis want to see, no more Hamas in Gaza. And they are very concerned about what might happen if, if Hamas is not dismantled. So I think they're probably further apart than we would like, but we'll see what happens in the coming days.",

                "Token": "Today, a phone call that could alter the course of a war. The planned phone call between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This will be the first call between the two leaders since that tragic incident where seven aid workers were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza this week. Top White House officials are telling CNN that Biden is both angry and outraged about it. This morning, the founder of World Central Kitchen, the aid workers work for chef Jose Andres is accusing Israel of systematically his word, targeting the aid convoy car by car. And he is calling for an independent investigation into it. This was not just but like the situation where, oops, we dropped the bomb in the wrong place or or No, but I know is that we were targeted deliberately, nonstop until everybody was dead in this convoy. CNN's Arlette Sines is at the White House with more for us and Arlette. Democratic Senator Chris Coons is very close to Joe Biden. He was just on speaking to Sara and he said this phone call he expects is going to be very important in the next step in the US Israel relationship. Yeah, Kate. And President Biden is expected to convey his personal anger and frustration directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they speak in the coming hours. The the Israeli strike that killed these seven aid workers with World Central Kitchen really marks the latest flashpoint in an increasingly tense relationship between Biden and Netanyahu. And many are questioning whether this moment could serve as a turning point in U.S. support for Israel as it conducts his campaign to root out Hamas in Gaza. Now, the president has expressed his outrage about the incident. Frustration has been rising here at the White House. The president is expected to focus on the death of those aid workers, while also broadening out the conversation, trying to discuss ways to ensure that there are protections for humanitarian aid workers. We have sources have told us that U.S. officials have already started talking to the Israelis about the need to change the way that information is transmitted when it comes to the locations of aid workers. We also anticipate the president to talk about the ongoing hostage and humanitarian aid negotiations to try to get a temporary cease fire, as well as that operation that Israel is expected to wage in Rafah. Now, ahead of this call, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, where a Pentagon spokesperson said that he conveyed his outrage while also saying that this incident reinforces U.S. concerns about needing to protect civilians in any type of operation that Israel conducts in Rafah. But even as we have seen this heightened rhetoric from the administration expressing anger and outrage, well, we have not seen yet is any shift in policy when it comes to the U.S. approach to Israel, especially when it comes to the U.S. continuing to provide military support to Israel without any conditions. Officials here at the White House said that they are not at that point where there is a shift in policy, though a senior administration official says that there has been a shift in the frustrations from the president. Now, this all comes as President Biden is also facing significant pressure here at home when it comes to his handling of this conflict. He heard that directly from Muslim community leaders here at the White House on Tuesday. But many are questioning whether this exact moment could serve as any turning point in the administration's strategy. As of now, it doesn't seem that they're changing any pathway forward in the imminent future. Or plans at the White House. Thank you so much, our lot, Sara. All right. Thank you, Kate. CNN chief International anchor Christiane Amanpour is joining us now. Christiane, we just heard from Senator Coons, who says there is a line and there should be conditions and the president of the United States has been very frustrated, we know, with Netanyahu and Israel's approach in Gaza at this point. The pressure is really mounting on Israel from other close allies. What are you hearing? Well, precisely that. And really in the United States, you'd have to go back as far as the first George W. George H.W. Bush administration when they expressed public frustration and anger over different issues, the increasing building of settlements. And James Baker held out a phone number for the State Department to say, when you're serious, give us a call. You have the number. But what does this actually change, this mounting pressure, As you heard from all that, it's unlikely to change any shift towards sending military aid to Israel. But that is precisely what governments around the world, Israel's allies, are being asked to do, including here in the U.K. Defense minister, former prime minister and Foreign Minister David Cameron has said that he has demanded to his Israeli counterpart an immediate investigation into this appalling attack on aid workers. And he said, we want to see that happen very, very soon. The problem here is that all the allies say that Israel has a right to defend itself after what happened on October seven, but that it must act within the rules of the international road that are international laws that include not firing on civilian convoys. And let's not forget this one, like the others, were heavily coordinated with Israel. This is what the U.N. humanitarian chief told me about the World Central Kitchen assassinations or attacks on Monday. Yes, it's a duty of care problem, but it's also a legal problem. A attacks on humanitarian institutions and workers is prohibited under international law. So whether it's intentional or not, it's a crime. And we must be very conscious of this as I say. It's been happening, as you know, Christiane, to our colleagues from the outset. And as you know, hundreds, nearly 200 U.N. and other aid workers have been killed, the vast majority of them Palestinians. Sara. You know, it strikes me in your conversation that he said whether it's intentional or not, it is still a crime. What is the impression that Netanyahu and his administration is giving to those who are calling for for better treatment of civilians? Well, look, it's really, really difficult to understand this. Even former President Trump has told and you can see it on an Israeli website, Israel Hayom, it's a right wing website. They interviewed him earlier and even he said, you've got to stop your war. Yes, you could defend yourself, but you've got to stop this. You're losing your international credibility and support. And we cannot keep seeing these bodies piling up in Gaza. So this is really becoming a memory Trump gave Netanyahu everything he wanted, moving the consulate and the embassy to Jerusalem, giving them sovereignty over the Golan Heights, practically inviting them to annex the West Bank. He was very much in Netanyahu's camp. But right now, as we as I've said, there's an increasing number of allied governments, allies of Israel, who are looking at the very serious matter of continuing to send the massive weapons systems and the bombs, 2000 ton bombs from the United States that owe to time bombs that are being sent. And again, here is Jose Andres on his conversation with President Biden. I spoke to President Biden yesterday and Biden made this statement, which seems it's already a harder stand. But it's very complicated to understand that we are going to be sending America is going to be sending his Navy on these military to do humanitarian work, when at the same time weapons provided by America, not not to defend Israel itself from missile attacks, but used weapons that are killing civilians in this moment. And as you can imagine, if international aid organizations like the UN, like Jose Andres, stop doing their vital humanitarian work, who is going to do it? Is Israel going to do it? That's all that's left. And we saw the catastrophe when they tried that, you know, freelancing a few weeks ago and some 118 people were killed in shootings and a stampede. It's a very critical issue right now. Christiane Amanpour, thank you so much for all of your reporting, as always. John. As we are standing by for that phone call between the president and prime minister, there already has been one conversation between us and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart. So what took place there seen as the torture portrait at the Pentagon to torture? What did they have to say? Well, John, it was largely, largely a mirror image of the conversation that President Biden had or that the statement that President Biden had issued earlier this week that he was expressing outrage over this W.K. strike. Secretary Alston apparently told the Israeli defense minister that he, too, was outraged by this attack, and he urged them to conduct a swift, thorough and independent investigation into this attack. And importantly, something that we've heard from other administration officials as well, they want the results of this investigation to be made public and they want someone to be held accountable for this tragic mistake, which is what the Israelis are characterizing it as. But the administration is really, at this point kind of withholding judgment about whether or not this was deliberate. And for that reason, they are not giving any sense of whether or not they're going to shift their policy towards Israeli defense and arms sales, which have been ongoing, as we reported earlier this week. The administration is set to approve an $18 billion F-15 sale to the Israelis, where the jets won't necessarily be delivered for another 4 to 5 years. There are questions about why the administration, while they're expressing outrage over this strike, while they're expressing outrage over the fact that Israel does not appear to be doing enough to protect civilians, is engaging in these arms sales with the Israelis and thereby kind of affirming that they view them as kind of a professional military that is capable of carrying out these operations in a way that is consistent with how the U.S. would expect their allies to. And so Secretary Austin did reiterate that he is angry about this strike. It remains to be seen whether anything is actually going to change when it comes to concrete. U.S. actions, because at this point, it does not seem as though the Israelis are necessarily listening to what the U.S. is saying. And we're seeing that play out in real time, of course, with the operation that they're planning in southern Gaza in Rafah. Yes, indeed, Indeed, that is the case. Obviously, a very important day as we watch it unfold. Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon, thank you very much.",

                "Token": "A little girl named Abigail turned four years old. She spent her birthday that birthday, at least 50 days before that held hostage by Hamas. Today, she's free. And Jill and I, together, as so many Americans, are praying for the fact that she is going to be all right. You know, she's free and she's in Israel now. And so those who are now wrapping Abigail in loving care, the supportive services she needs. She's been through a terrible trauma. You know, her mom was killed in front of her when it when a kibbutz was attacked by Hamas terrorists on October 7th. Abigail ran to her dad there, who then was gunned down, gunned down as well, while using his body to shield little Abigail. She then ran to a neighbor for help where they were all taken hostage. That entire house and neighbors were taken hostage by Hamas and held for 50 days. What she endured is unthinkable. Abigail was among 13 hostages released today from Gaza. Under that brokered and sustained, though intensive U.S. diplomacy. She's now safely in Israel and we continue to press and expect four additional Americans will be released as well. We will not stop working until every hostage is returned to their loved ones. As I said when I spoke about this deal on Friday, this has been the product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement for me and my team. We have been in close contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt and Israel, speaking with each one of them repeatedly over the past few weeks to help secure this deal. We spoke again yesterday with the emir of Qatar. I owe special thanks to in order to keep the hostages release on track and push for Abigail to be part of this release. And I'll be speaking again shortly with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And we will continue to remain personally engaged, personally engaged to see that this deal is fully implemented and work to extend the deal as well. For weeks, I've been advocating a pause in the fighting for two purposes to increase the assistance, get into Gaza civilians who need help and to facilitate release of hostages. We know that innocent children in Gaza are suffering greatly as well because this war that Hamas has unleashed is so has such consequences. Thousands have been killed and from the earliest days of this crisis. I've worked closely with President Sisi of Egypt, the Israeli government, and King Abdullah of Jordan, and leaders throughout the region to expand the delivery of critical humanitarian assistance to help innocent Palestinians in need. We're not part of Hamas under this deal. The fighting in Gaza has now been paused for three days. Over that time, 58 hostages have been released, including two Thai, Filipino and Russian nationals. Dozens of families have been reunited. And we worked urgently, urgently to take advantage of the pause to surge aid into Gaza. We've moved approximately 200 aid trucks into Gaza each day, loaded with food, water, medicine, fuel and cooking gas. More is needed. But this deal is delivering life saving results. Critically needed aid is going in and hostages are coming out and they're still structured so that it can be extended to keep building on these results. That's my goal. That's our goal to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief into into those. And who in need in Gaza. We've seen this is a day by day approach, hour by hour process. Nothing is guaranteed and nothing is being taken for granted. But the proof that this is working and worth pursuing further is in every smile and every grateful tears we see on the faces of those families who are finally getting back together again. The proof is little Abigail. More than 20 other children, 18 years and younger, have been released. They've been released through this deal as well. They've endured a terrible ordeal. They can now begin the long journey toward healing. I'm going to continue working with the emir of Qatar, President Sisi, Egypt, Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, to do everything possible to see the hostages are freed. All the hostages. I'm grateful for the personal partnership as we pursued this deal from each of those men I just mentioned. As we work together to see the and see all this implement and now to try to extend it further. I continue working with all our partners to take the hard but necessary steps to build an integrated and more prosperous and more peaceful future in the region. A two state solution is the only way to guarantee the long term security of both Israelis and Palestinian people, to make sure Israel and Palestinians alike live in equal measure of freedom and dignity. We will not give up on working toward that goal. Thank you very much. Thank God she's home. I just can't imagine the enjoyment in it. I just wish I were there to hold her. Mr. President. Do you have an update on the other Americans who are being held in any sense as to when they would be released? We are hopeful, but I don't have anything firmly to tell you at this moment. So do you expect that if you are able to use this momentum to extend the pause, have you extracted any guarantees about proof of life for other hostages, or do you have an expectation of how much longer you can push this? Well, look, you know, the deal calls for for every for every ten hostages released to extend another day. So I'm hopeful this is not the end that's going to continue. But we don't know. And but I get a sense that all the players in the region, even the neighbors who aren't and we have been directly involved now are looking for a way to end this. So the hostages are all released. And Hamas is just completely, how can I say no longer in control of any portion of Gaza? Do they have control of all of the hostages? Are there still other militant groups that you have to deal with? We think there are probably other militant groups. We're not certain. Mr. President, Mr. President, how is Abigail doing? What's her physical condition? Well, I haven't gotten that information. I just want to let you know immediately they were going to cross into Egypt. As you recall, that was a group about an older, non-American, elderly, elderly woman is very sick who was in need of immediate medical help. So they arranged to cross directly into Israel to be able to take her to a hospital. All I know is that she was being held. I don't know. I haven't seen a photograph. I've just been in communication with my team. But she is safely ensconced in Israel. But there's a lot more work to be done. How many days would you like to see the hospital on board? I would like to see us move to a point where we were able to. Well, let me put it this way. I'd like to see the pause go on. As long as prisoners kept coming out. All right. Thank you all so very much. I know. You know, we have to call you. I know you say why she called me with only 10 minutes or so and I said, that's No. Two sided because we didn't know. I didn't want to be having this press conference if they weren't physically even when they were in the Red Cross ambulance. I didn't want to do it because they were not out there. They were still in Gaza. So I don't thank you enough and thanks for your patience. And I know we're here. So I was doing okay. Happy hour as you guys.",

                "Lemma": "A little girl named Abigail turned four years old. She spent her birthday that birthday, at least 50 days before that held hostage by Hamas. Today, she's free. And Jill and I, together, as so many Americans, are praying for the fact that she is going to be all right. You know, she's free and she's in Israel now. And so those who are now wrapping Abigail in loving care, the supportive services she needs. She's been through a terrible trauma. You know, her mom was killed in front of her when it when a kibbutz was attacked by Hamas terrorists on October 7th. Abigail ran to her dad there, who then was gunned down, gunned down as well, while using his body to shield little Abigail. She then ran to a neighbor for help where they were all taken hostage. That entire house and neighbors were taken hostage by Hamas and held for 50 days. What she endured is unthinkable. Abigail was among 13 hostages released today from Gaza. Under that brokered and sustained, though intensive U.S. diplomacy. She's now safely in Israel and we continue to press and expect four additional Americans will be released as well. We will not stop working until every hostage is returned to their loved ones. As I said when I spoke about this deal on Friday, this has been the product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement for me and my team. We have been in close contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt and Israel, speaking with each one of them repeatedly over the past few weeks to help secure this deal. We spoke again yesterday with the emir of Qatar. I owe special thanks to in order to keep the hostages release on track and push for Abigail to be part of this release. And I'll be speaking again shortly with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And we will continue to remain personally engaged, personally engaged to see that this deal is fully implemented and work to extend the deal as well. For weeks, I've been advocating a pause in the fighting for two purposes to increase the assistance, get into Gaza civilians who need help and to facilitate release of hostages. We know that innocent children in Gaza are suffering greatly as well because this war that Hamas has unleashed is so has such consequences. Thousands have been killed and from the earliest days of this crisis. I've worked closely with President Sisi of Egypt, the Israeli government, and King Abdullah of Jordan, and leaders throughout the region to expand the delivery of critical humanitarian assistance to help innocent Palestinians in need. We're not part of Hamas under this deal. The fighting in Gaza has now been paused for three days. Over that time, 58 hostages have been released, including two Thai, Filipino and Russian nationals. Dozens of families have been reunited. And we worked urgently, urgently to take advantage of the pause to surge aid into Gaza. We've moved approximately 200 aid trucks into Gaza each day, loaded with food, water, medicine, fuel and cooking gas. More is needed. But this deal is delivering life saving results. Critically needed aid is going in and hostages are coming out and they're still structured so that it can be extended to keep building on these results. That's my goal. That's our goal to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief into into those. And who in need in Gaza. We've seen this is a day by day approach, hour by hour process. Nothing is guaranteed and nothing is being taken for granted. But the proof that this is working and worth pursuing further is in every smile and every grateful tears we see on the faces of those families who are finally getting back together again. The proof is little Abigail. More than 20 other children, 18 years and younger, have been released. They've been released through this deal as well. They've endured a terrible ordeal. They can now begin the long journey toward healing. I'm going to continue working with the emir of Qatar, President Sisi, Egypt, Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, to do everything possible to see the hostages are freed. All the hostages. I'm grateful for the personal partnership as we pursued this deal from each of those men I just mentioned. As we work together to see the and see all this implement and now to try to extend it further. I continue working with all our partners to take the hard but necessary steps to build an integrated and more prosperous and more peaceful future in the region. A two state solution is the only way to guarantee the long term security of both Israelis and Palestinian people, to make sure Israel and Palestinians alike live in equal measure of freedom and dignity. We will not give up on working toward that goal. Thank you very much. Thank God she's home. I just can't imagine the enjoyment in it. I just wish I were there to hold her. Mr. President. Do you have an update on the other Americans who are being held in any sense as to when they would be released? We are hopeful, but I don't have anything firmly to tell you at this moment. So do you expect that if you are able to use this momentum to extend the pause, have you extracted any guarantees about proof of life for other hostages, or do you have an expectation of how much longer you can push this? Well, look, you know, the deal calls for for every for every ten hostages released to extend another day. So I'm hopeful this is not the end that's going to continue. But we don't know. And but I get a sense that all the players in the region, even the neighbors who aren't and we have been directly involved now are looking for a way to end this. So the hostages are all released. And Hamas is just completely, how can I say no longer in control of any portion of Gaza? Do they have control of all of the hostages? Are there still other militant groups that you have to deal with? We think there are probably other militant groups. We're not certain. Mr. President, Mr. President, how is Abigail doing? What's her physical condition? Well, I haven't gotten that information. I just want to let you know immediately they were going to cross into Egypt. As you recall, that was a group about an older, non-American, elderly, elderly woman is very sick who was in need of immediate medical help. So they arranged to cross directly into Israel to be able to take her to a hospital. All I know is that she was being held. I don't know. I haven't seen a photograph. I've just been in communication with my team. But she is safely ensconced in Israel. But there's a lot more work to be done. How many days would you like to see the hospital on board? I would like to see us move to a point where we were able to. Well, let me put it this way. I'd like to see the pause go on. As long as prisoners kept coming out. All right. Thank you all so very much. I know. You know, we have to call you. I know you say why she called me with only 10 minutes or so and I said, that's No. Two sided because we didn't know. I didn't want to be having this press conference if they weren't physically even when they were in the Red Cross ambulance. I didn't want to do it because they were not out there. They were still in Gaza. So I don't thank you enough and thanks for your patience. And I know we're here. So I was doing okay. Happy hour as you guys."

                "Token": "right now, President Biden is delivering remarks at the US Capitol. So we're going to listen in. Thank you. Thank you. Sir, please. Thank you to Isaiah chapter ten introduction for your leadership in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. There are two scholar statesmen and, a dear friend, Speaker Johnson, Peter Jeffries, members of Congress, and especially the survivors of the Holocaust. My mother here, she look at you. God love you all. God's love you all a Foxman and all other survivors who embody absolute courage and dignity and grace are here as well. During these sacred days of remembrance, we grieve. We give voice to the 6 million Jews who were systematically targeted, murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators during World War Two. We honor the memory of victims, the pain of survivors, the bravery of heroes who stood up to Hitler's unspeakable evil. And we recommit to heading and heeding the lessons at one of the darkest chapters in human history to revitalize and realize the responsibility of never again, never again, simply translated from me, means never forget, never forget. Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, must keep teaching the truth, must keep teaching our children and our grandchildren. The truth is, we are at risk of people not knowing the truth. That's why growing up, my dad taught me and my siblings about the horrors of the Shoah. At our family dinner table. That's why I visited Yad Vashem with my family as a senator, as vice president, and as president. And that's why I took my grandchildren to Dachau so they could see and bear witness to the perils of indifference, the complicity of silence in the face of evil that they knew was happening. Germany, 1933 Hitler and his Nazi Party rise to power by rekindling one of the world's oldest forms of prejudice and hate, anti-Semitism. His role didn't begin with mass murder. It started slowly across economic, political, social and cultural life. Propaganda demonizing Jews, boycotts of Jewish businesses, synagogues to face with swastikas, harassment of Jews in the street and schools, anti-Semitic demonstrations, pogroms, organized riots with the indifference of the world, Hitler knew he could expand his reign of terror by eliminating Jews from Germany to annihilate Jews across Europe through genocide. The Nazis call the Final Solution concentration camps, gas chambers, mass shootings. By the time the war ended, 6 million Jews, one out of every three Jews in the entire world, were murdered. This Asian hatred of Jews didn't begin with. The Holocaust didn't end with the Holocaust, either. Or after. Even after our victory in World War two, this hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness. That hatred was brought to life on October 7th. In 2023, on a sacred Jewish holiday. The terrorist group Hamas unleashed the deadliest day of the Jewish people since the Holocaust, driven by ancient desire to wipe out the Jewish people off the face of the earth. Over 1200 innocent people babies, parents, grandparents slaughtered in a kibbutz, massacred at a music festival, brutally raped, mutilated and sexually assaulted thousands more carrying wounds. Borrowed some shrapnel from the memory of that terrible day they endured. Hundreds taken hostage, including survivors of the Shoah. Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting. They're already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. That was Hamas, a brutalized Israelis. It was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget. As Jews around the world still cope with the atrocity and trauma of that day and its aftermath, we've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world, vicious propaganda on social media. Jews forced to keep their hide, their keepers under baseball hats, tuck their Jewish stars into their shirts. On college campuses, Jewish students blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class. Antisemitism, anti-Semitic posters, slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's only Jewish state. Too many people denying, downplaying rash lies and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust. And October 7th, including Hamas's appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews. It's absolutely despicable, and it must stop silence. Silencing the vile can hide much, but it can erase nothing. Some adjusted is so heinous, so graphic, so grievous. They cannot be married, buried no matter how hard people try. In my view, a major lesson of Holocaust is, as mentioned earlier, it's not always not inevitable. We know hate never goes away. It only hides, given a little oxygen and comes off one of the rocks. We also know it stops hate one thing all of us. Later, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks described antisemitism as a virus that survived and mutated over time. Together, we cannot continue to let that happen. We have to remember our basic principles as a nation. We have an obligation obligation. We have an obligation to learn the lessons of history. So we don't surrender our future to the horrors of the past. We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone, anyone. From the very founding, our very founding Jewish Americans. Representative. Only about 2% of the U.S. population have helped lead cause of freedom for everyone in our nation. From that experience, we know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority. And the very foundation of our democracy. So moments like this, I have to put these principles and we're talking about into action. I understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world in America. I respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech. To debate, disagree. To protest peacefully and make our voices heard. I understand that's America. But there is no place on any campus in America, or any place in America for anti-Semitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind. Whether against Jews or anyone else, violent attacks, destroying property. It's not peaceful protest. It's against the law. And we are not a lawless country. We're a civil society. We oppose the rule of law. And no one should have to hide to be brave. Just to be themselves. The Jewish community didn't want you to know. I see your fear. You're hurting your pain. Let me reassure you. As you're president, you're not alone. You belong. You always have, and you always will. And my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree. My administration is working around the clock to free remaining hostages, just as we have freed hostages already. And we will not rest until we bring them all home. My administration, with our second generals leadership, has launched our nation's first national strategy to counter antisemitism. That's mobilizing the full force of the federal government to protect Jewish community. But what we know is not to work for government alone or Jews alone. That's why I'm calling on all Americans to stand united against antisemitism and hate in all its forms. My dear friend, who became a friend of the late Ellie Whitesell, said, quote, one person of integrity can make a difference. We have to remember that now more than ever here in Emancipation Hall, the U.S. Capitol. Among the towering statue to history is a bronze bust of role Walmart. Born in Sweden as a Lutheran. He was a businessman, a diplomat, all stationed in Hungary He used diplomatic cover to hide and rescue about 100,000 Jews over a six month period. Among them was a 16 year old Jewish boy who escaped a Nazi labor camp. After the war ended. A boy received a scholarship from the Hallel Foundation to study in America. He came to New York City penniless, but determined to turn his pain into purpose. Along with his wife, also a Holocaust survivor, he became a renowned economist and foreign policy thinker, eventually making his way to this very capital on the staff of a first term senator. That Jewish refugee was Tom Lantos, and that Senator was made. Tom and his wife Annette and their family became dear friends to me and my family. Tom would go on to become the only Holocaust survivor ever elected to Congress, for became a leading voice on civil rights and human rights around the world. Tom never met Raul, who was taken prisoner by the Soviets. Never to be heard from again, but through Tom's efforts, rolls Busters here in the Capitol. He was also given honorary U.S. citizenship, only the second person ever, after Winston Churchill. The Holocaust Museum here in Washington is located in a rural road in Ralls, named the story of the power of a single person. To put aside our differences, to see our common humanity, to stand up to hate, and its ancient story of resilience from immense pain and persecution. To find hope, purpose and meaning in life. We try to live and share with one another. That story endures. Let me close with this. I know these days when members fall on difficult times. We all do well to remember. These days also fall during the month. We celebrate Jewish American heritage, a heritage that stretches from our earliest days to enrich every single part of American life. Today, great Americans, great Jewish American and Tom Lantos used the phrase the veneer of civilization is paper thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest. My fellow Americans, we must. We must be those guardians. We must never rest. Must rise against hate, meet across the divide, share our common humanity and God bless the victims and survivors of Shoah and the resilient hearts. A courageous spirit and eternal flame of faith of the Jewish people forever shine their light on America and around the world. Pray God, thank you all.",

                "Token": "We're watching President Biden as he approaches the podium at the White House. Good afternoon. Listen to his remarks. You know, there are moments in this life I I mean this literally when the pure, unadulterated evil is unleashed on this world. The people of Israel live through one such moment this weekend. Bloody hands of the terrorist organization, Hamas group, whose stated purpose for being is to kill Jews This was an act of sheer evil. More than 1000 civilians slaughtered, not just kill, slaughtered in Israel. Among them, at least 14 American citizens killed, parents butchered, using their bodies to try to protect their children. Stomach churning reports of babies being killed. Entire families slain. Young people massacred while attending a musical festival. To celebrate peace. To celebrate peace. Women raped, assaulted, paraded as trophies. Families hid their fear for hours and hours, desperately trying to keep their children quiet. To avoid drawing attention And thousands of wounded. Alive. But carrying with them the bullet holes and the shrapnel wounds. And the memory of what they endured. You all know these traumas never go away. There's still so many families desperately waiting to hear the fate of their loved ones. Not knowing if they're alive. Or dead. Or hostages. Infants in their mother's arms. Grandparents in wheelchairs. Holocaust survivors abducted and held hostage. Hostages whom Hamas has now threatened execute in violation of every code of human morality. It's abhorrent. The brutality of Hamas is blood thirsty and is brings to mind the worst the worst rampages of vices. This is terrorism. But sadly for the Jewish people, it's not new. This attack is brought to the surface. Painful memories. The scars left by a millennium, antisemitism and genocide. The Jewish people So in this moment, we must be crystal clear. We stand with Israel. And we will make sure, as has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself and respond to this attack. There's no justification for terrorism. There's no excuse Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination. Stated purpose is annihilation of the state of Israel. On the murder of Jewish people They use Palestinian civilians as human shields. Mass offers nothing but terror and bloodshed with no regard to who pays the price The loss of innocent life is heartbreaking. Like every nation in the world. Israel has the right to respond and deed has a duty to respond to these vicious attacks. I just got off the phone with the third called Prime Minister Netanyahu. I told him the United States experience is an experience in our response to be swift, decisive and overwhelming. We also discussed how democracies like Israel and United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law. Terrorist purposely target civilians kill them. We uphold the laws of war, law of war. It matters. There's a difference Today, Americans across the country are praying for all those families who have been ripped apart. A lot of us know how it feels. It leaves a black hole in your chest when you lose family feeling like you're being sucked in. The anger the pain the sense of hopelessness This is what they mean by a human tragedy, an atrocity on an appalling scale. We're going to continue to stand united, supporting the people of Israel who are suffering unspeakable losses and opposing the hatred and violence of terrorism. My team has been in near-constant communication with our Israeli partners and partners all across the region and the world. From the moment this crisis began. We're charging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome. We're going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens. My administration has consult closely with Congress throughout this crisis. When Congress returns, we're going to ask them to take urgent action to fund the national security requirements of our critical partners. This is not about party or politics. This is about the security of our world, security of the United States of America. We now know that American citizens are among those being held by Hamas I've directed my team to share intelligence and deploy additional expertize from across the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts in hostage recovery recovery efforts. Because as president, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world. The United States has also enhanced our military force posture in the region to strengthen our deterrence. The Department of Defense has moved the USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group, the Eastern Mediterranean, and bolstered our fighter aircraft presence. And we stand ready to move in additional assets as needed Let me say again to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of the situation, I have one word don't don't Hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear. Yesterday, I also spoke with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and U.K. to discuss the latest developments with our European allies and coordinate our united response This comes on top of days of steady engagement with partners across the region. We're also taking steps at home in cities across the United States of America. Police departments have stepped up security around centers of Jewish life The Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working closely with state and local law enforcement and Jewish community partners to identify and disrupt any domestic threat that could emerge in connection with these horrific attacks. This is a moment for the United States to come together to grieve with those who are mourning Let's be real clear. There is no place for hate in America, not against Jews, not against Muslims. Not against anybody. We reject. What we reject is terrorism. We condemn the indiscriminate evil just we have always done. That's what America stands for. You know, just over 50 years ago, I was thinking about this morning talk from the secretary of state, the vice president in my office over 50 years ago. As a young senator, I visited Israel for the first time as a newly elected senator, and I had a long, long trip meeting with Goldman in her office just before the Yom Kippur War. I guess you could see the consternation on my face as she described what was being faced. She knew they were facing walked outside in that sort of hallway outside her office to have some photo. She looked at me all of a sudden, said, Would you like to have a photograph? And so I got up and followed her out here, standing there silent, looking at the press. You could tell, I guess I was concerned. She leaned over and whispered to me. She said, Don't worry, Senator Biden, we have a secret weapon here in Israel. My word is what she said. We have no place else to go. For 75 years is also the only guarantor security of Jewish people around the world. So the atrocities of the past could never happen again. Let there be no doubt the United States has Israel's back. We will make sure the Jewish democratic state of Israel can defend itself today, tomorrow, as we always have to. Simple as that. These atrocities sickening We're with Israel Just make no mistake. Thank you. Mr. President, what was your reaction on the ground?",
                "Tag": "NP",
                "Lemma": "We're watching President Biden as he approaches the podium at the White House. Good afternoon. Listen to his remarks. You know, there are moments in this life I I mean this literally when the pure, unadulterated evil is unleashed on this world. The people of Israel live through one such moment this weekend. Bloody hands of the terrorist organization, Hamas group, whose stated purpose for being is to kill Jews This was an act of sheer evil. More than 1000 civilians slaughtered, not just kill, slaughtered in Israel. Among them, at least 14 American citizens killed, parents butchered, using their bodies to try to protect their children. Stomach churning reports of babies being killed. Entire families slain. Young people massacred while attending a musical festival. To celebrate peace. To celebrate peace. Women raped, assaulted, paraded as trophies. Families hid their fear for hours and hours, desperately trying to keep their children quiet. To avoid drawing attention And thousands of wounded. Alive. But carrying with them the bullet holes and the shrapnel wounds. And the memory of what they endured. You all know these traumas never go away. There's still so many families desperately waiting to hear the fate of their loved ones. Not knowing if they're alive. Or dead. Or hostages. Infants in their mother's arms. Grandparents in wheelchairs. Holocaust survivors abducted and held hostage. Hostages whom Hamas has now threatened execute in violation of every code of human morality. It's abhorrent. The brutality of Hamas is blood thirsty and is brings to mind the worst the worst rampages of vices. This is terrorism. But sadly for the Jewish people, it's not new. This attack is brought to the surface. Painful memories. The scars left by a millennium, antisemitism and genocide. The Jewish people So in this moment, we must be crystal clear. We stand with Israel. And we will make sure, as has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself and respond to this attack. There's no justification for terrorism. There's no excuse Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination. Stated purpose is annihilation of the state of Israel. On the murder of Jewish people They use Palestinian civilians as human shields. Mass offers nothing but terror and bloodshed with no regard to who pays the price The loss of innocent life is heartbreaking. Like every nation in the world. Israel has the right to respond and deed has a duty to respond to these vicious attacks. I just got off the phone with the third called Prime Minister Netanyahu. I told him the United States experience is an experience in our response to be swift, decisive and overwhelming. We also discussed how democracies like Israel and United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law. Terrorist purposely target civilians kill them. We uphold the laws of war, law of war. It matters. There's a difference Today, Americans across the country are praying for all those families who have been ripped apart. A lot of us know how it feels. It leaves a black hole in your chest when you lose family feeling like you're being sucked in. The anger the pain the sense of hopelessness This is what they mean by a human tragedy, an atrocity on an appalling scale. We're going to continue to stand united, supporting the people of Israel who are suffering unspeakable losses and opposing the hatred and violence of terrorism. My team has been in near-constant communication with our Israeli partners and partners all across the region and the world. From the moment this crisis began. We're charging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome. We're going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens. My administration has consult closely with Congress throughout this crisis. When Congress returns, we're going to ask them to take urgent action to fund the national security requirements of our critical partners. This is not about party or politics. This is about the security of our world, security of the United States of America. We now know that American citizens are among those being held by Hamas I've directed my team to share intelligence and deploy additional expertize from across the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts in hostage recovery recovery efforts. Because as president, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world. The United States has also enhanced our military force posture in the region to strengthen our deterrence. The Department of Defense has moved the USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group, the Eastern Mediterranean, and bolstered our fighter aircraft presence. And we stand ready to move in additional assets as needed Let me say again to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of the situation, I have one word don't don't Hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear. Yesterday, I also spoke with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and U.K. to discuss the latest developments with our European allies and coordinate our united response This comes on top of days of steady engagement with partners across the region. We're also taking steps at home in cities across the United States of America. Police departments have stepped up security around centers of Jewish life The Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working closely with state and local law enforcement and Jewish community partners to identify and disrupt any domestic threat that could emerge in connection with these horrific attacks. This is a moment for the United States to come together to grieve with those who are mourning Let's be real clear. There is no place for hate in America, not against Jews, not against Muslims. Not against anybody. We reject. What we reject is terrorism. We condemn the indiscriminate evil just we have always done. That's what America stands for. You know, just over 50 years ago, I was thinking about this morning talk from the secretary of state, the vice president in my office over 50 years ago. As a young senator, I visited Israel for the first time as a newly elected senator, and I had a long, long trip meeting with Goldman in her office just before the Yom Kippur War. I guess you could see the consternation on my face as she described what was being faced. She knew they were facing walked outside in that sort of hallway outside her office to have some photo. She looked at me all of a sudden, said, Would you like to have a photograph? And so I got up and followed her out here, standing there silent, looking at the press. You could tell, I guess I was concerned. She leaned over and whispered to me. She said, Don't worry, Senator Biden, we have a secret weapon here in Israel. My word is what she said. We have no place else to go. For 75 years is also the only guarantor security of Jewish people around the world. So the atrocities of the past could never happen again. Let there be no doubt the United States has Israel's back. We will make sure the Jewish democratic state of Israel can defend itself today, tomorrow, as we always have to. Simple as that.

We must be thankful for an America The food in our tables, the family and loved ones in our homes. And the many blessings that come from living in the greatest nation on earth. Today, we can also be thankful of families being recruited and reunited with loved ones who have been held hostage for nearly 50 days. Beginning this morning, under a deal reached by extensive U.S. diplomacy, including numerous calls I've made from the Oval Office to leaders across the region fighting in Gaza will halt for four days. There's still also a structure to allow a pause to continue for more than 50 hostages to be released. That's our goal this morning. I've been engaged with my team as we began the first difficult days of implementing this deal. It's only a start but so far it's gone well. Early this morning, 13 Israeli hostages were released, including an elderly woman, her grandmother and mothers with their young children. Some under the age of six years old. Separately, several Thai nationals and Filipino nationals were also kidnaped by Hamas on the seventh. They were released as well. All of these hostages have been through a terrible ordeal. And this is the beginning of a long journey of healing for them. The teddy bear is waiting to greet those children at the hospital are a stark reminder of the trauma these children have been through and at such a very young age. Jill and I are Jill's with me here, keeping them all in our prayers today. Today today has been a product, a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement. From the moment Hamas kidnaped these people, I, along with my team, have worked around the clock to secure their release. We saw the first results of this ever with the release of two American hostages in late October, followed by the release of two Israeli hostages. I've consistently pressed for a pause in the fighting for two reasons to accelerate and expand humanitarian assistance going into Gaza and to to facilitate the release of hostages. And over the past several weeks, I've spoken repeatedly with the emir of Qatar, the President Sisi of Egypt, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to help secure this deal, to nail it down. And I want to thank all three leaders for their personal partnership to get this done. I spoke with the emir and President el-Sisi, the prime minister Netanyahu again on Wednesday to confirm the elements of the engagement. As I said, today's release are the start of a process. We expect more hostages to be released tomorrow and more the day after, more the day after that. Over the next few days, we expect that dozens of hostages will be returned to their families. We also remember all those who are still being held. And renew our commitment to work for their release as well. Two American women and 14 year old child, Abigail who remains among those missing. We also will not stop until we get these hostages brought home in an answer to their whereabouts. I remain in personal contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt and Israel to make sure this stays on track and every aspect of the deal is implemented. You know, this extended pause brings a critical opportunity to deliver much needed food, medicine, water and fuel to the civilians in Gaza. And we are not wasting one single minute since my trip to Israel last month. I've been focused on accelerating the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Gaza in coordination with the United Nations and the Red Cross. I just spoke with my special envoy for the Middle East humanitarian issues, David Satterfield, for an update. And I've asked him to monitor our progress hour by hour and keep me personally informed. From the beginning. We put in place mechanisms to prevent Hamas from diverting these supplies. And we're continuing that effort to make sure aid gets to the people who need it. More than 200 trucks arrived at the crossing point in Egypt into Gaza today. These trucks carry food and medicine as well as fuel, fuel and cooking gas. The fuel will be used not only to power the trucks delivering this lifesaving supplies, but for desalinization, for water wells, for hospitals, and for bakeries. And hundreds more trucks are getting them positioned as well, ready to enter Gaza over the coming days to support the innocent Palestinians who are suffering greatly because of this war that Hamas has unleashed. Hamas doesn't give a damn about them. We also look to the future. As we look to the future, we have to end this cycle of violence in the Middle East. We need to renew our resolve to pursue this two-State solution, where Israelis and Palestinians can one day live side by side in a two-State solution with equal measure of freedom and dignity to states for two peoples. And it's more important now than ever. Hamas unleashed this terrorist attack because they fear nothing more than Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace in order to continue down the path of terror and violence and killing war. Did you give Hamas what they seek? We can't do that. So today, let's continue to be thankful for all the families who are now and those who will soon be brought together again. And I want to once again thank the emir of Qatar. President Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister Netanyahu for their partnership to make what we've done so far and possible and for their continued leadership as we all keep working to implement this deal. And over the coming days, I'll remain engaged with leaders throughout the Middle East as we all work together to build a better future for the region. A future where this kind of violence is unthinkable, a future for all children and region. Every child, Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab. Grow up knowing only peace. That's what we do. We're waiting now. We have just a matter. I thought maybe even as soon as by the time I got here, but in the next hour or so, we'll know what the second wave of releases are. And I'm hopeful that is sensible as we anticipate. So thank you all for listening. I'll take a few questions. Mr. President, when will that first American hostages be released and so were included today? We don't know when that will occur, but we're going to be expected to occur, and we don't know what the list of all the hostages are and when they'll be released. But we know the numbers. They're going to be released. So it's my hope and expectation would be soon. And other ten Americans either unaccounted for or do not all of our conditions. Are they all alive? We don't know all the conditions. President, how long expected this war is going to take? Have you heard Prime Minister Netanyahu's exact timeline to say I have encouraged the prime minister to to focus on trying to reduce the number of casualties while he is attempting to eliminate Hamas, which is a legitimate objective. Yes, that's a difficult task. And I don't know how long it will take. My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the Arab world in the region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this down, to bring this to an end as quickly as we can. President, what are the chances of a truce could be extended by a few days? Or more? I think the chances are real. there are members of your party who would like to see conditions placed on aid to Israel. What is your view on that? They would like to see the adoption Well, I think that works well for it. But I don't think if I started off with that, we haven't gotten to where we are today. We have to take this a piece of the time Mr. President, you trust Hamas, but I don't trust Hamas to do anything right. I only trust Hamas to respond to pressure from the center, hoping to get cooperation from Arab leaders. What are you hearing from them when you talk to them? What do you want to see? I'm hearing a lot, but I'm not going to speak to it right now. There's an overwhelming desire on the part of the region to let me back up. I cannot prove what I'm about to say. But I believe one of the reasons why Hamas struck when they did was they knew that I was working very closely with the Saudis and others in the region. To bring peace to the region by having recognition of Israel and Israel's right to exist. You may recall when we did the G-20 about a little while ago, I was able to get a resolution. I made a statement passed through there saying we're going to build a railroad from Riyadh all the way through the Middle East into into Saudi Arabia, Israel, etc., and all the way up to Europe, not the not the railroad, but being an underground pipeline and then railroad. The whole idea is there's overwhelming interest. And I think most Arab nations know it and coordinating with one another to change the dynamic in their region for a longer term peace. And that is what I'm going to continue to work on. Thank you all very, very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving to all I hope you enjoy.",

                "Token": "We need to go to Secretary of State Blinken. He is in Brussels. Let's listen in and we'll come back to that. And I made clear then the commitment of the United States to Israel's security and to ensuring that October 7th could never happen again. I also underscored Israel's moral, strategic and legal requirements to protect civilians and provide humanitarian assistance to those who needed it. Now, of course, what happened after October 7th could have ended immediately if Hamas had stopped hiding behind civilians, released the hostages and put down its weapons But Israel is not Hamas. Israel is a democracy. Hamas, a terrorist organization, and democracies place the highest value on human life. Every human life, as has been said, whoever saves the life, saves the entire world. That's our strength. It's what distinguishes us from terrorists. Like Hamas. If we lose that reverence for human life, we risk becoming indistinguishable from those we confront Here's the current reality in Gaza. Despite important steps that Israel has taken to allow assistance into Gaza. The results on the ground are woefully insufficient and unacceptable. 100% of the population in Gaza knows acute levels of food insecurity. 100% of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance and those working heroically to provide that assistance are doing so in great peril to their own lives. This week's horrific attack on the world's central kitchen was not the first such incident. It must be the last. President Biden spoke a short while ago with Prime Minister Netanyahu. The leaders discussed the situation in Gaza. The president emphasized that the strikes on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian situation are unacceptable. He made clear the need for Israel to announce a series of specific concrete and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering and the safety of aid workers. He made clear that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel's immediate action on these steps. He underscored as well that an immediate cease fire is essential to stabilize and improve the humanitarian situation and protect innocent civilians. And he urged Prime Minister Netanyahu to empower his negotiators to conclude a deal without delay to bring the hostages home. The two leaders also discussed public Iranian threats against Israel and the Israeli people. President Biden reaffirmed the United States strong support for Israel in the face of these threats and our commitment to Israel's security Right now, there is no higher priority in Gaza than protecting civilians. Surging humanitarian assistance and ensuring the security of those who provide it. Israel must meet this moment. We've been. We discussed Secretary of State Antony Blinken at NATO's headquarters on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the organization. He's live in Brussels, Belgium. Some significant remarks when it comes to the conflict in Gaza. The secretary of state saying that he has communicated to Israeli officials not only the U.S. his commitment to Israel and its war against Hamas, but also the moral obligation that Israel has to protect civilians and aid workers in the Gaza Strip. He specifically said, and I quote, If we lose reverence for human life, we become indistinguishable from them, from Hamas terrorists. He described the efforts so far by Israel since October seven to protect civilians and humanitarian aid workers as woefully inadequate. And he laid out what we just got a readout from the call that President Biden had with the prime minister that the United States would consider its approach to Israel based on concrete steps to change the way that Israelis handled civilians and aid workers. That's what they're expecting data from Israel, which is clear. He said, that they need to have concrete, measurable steps to address harm to civilians, civilians suffering, and also to aid workers. And he said that US aid to Gaza may be determined by those steps. That's essentially what he said. And this is really significant because it comes on the heels of a very close Biden ally. Senator Coons, talking this morning about being open to putting conditions on aid to Israel, which is really the first time that we have heard the administration go so far. And this is even as we're hearing from a senior administration official, that the policy hasn't changed. The president is frustrated. The policy hasn't changed. This is signaling a potential policy change. So nonetheless, this is this is big. Absolutely. Notably, the timing of the the apparent accidental strike coming almost a day after the U.S. announced this enormous deal. $18 billion to sell F-15 fighter jets to Israel. The question now being, is this rhetoric that actually moves the needle or do there have to be conditions on arms in order to get Prime Minister Netanyahu and some of the other Israeli officials to carry out significant change in the way that they've been conducting the war? We have with us retired Colonel Cedric Leighton to give us some perspective. Colonel Leighton, from what you heard from the secretary of state there, it is a noticeable shift saying that the policy toward Israel will change, determined on the way that Israel conducts its operations in Gaza. And in essence, what we're talking about, Boris here is conditioning the aide on Israeli conduct going forward. I and I guess in this case, you can kind of say past is prolog because the past conduct of Israeli operations has not met U.S. standards. And at this point in time, it appears as if it appears as if the Department of Defense and the administration are looking at changing the policy potentially where they actually say, look, you cannot use these weapons against civilian targets, you cannot use these weapons against aid workers. And that's the kind of thing that I think might be happening here. Whether or not it does, of course, is is going to be borne out in the next few days, probably. But didn't you mention the F-15 sale to Israel? That's something that's going to take place over the next four or five years to actually get those weapons to the Israelis. But the other part of this is they have already delivered, Aaron, in the process of delivering more £2,000 bombs That's a much more immediate thing. It's going to be interesting to see whether or not that delivery is stopped before they actually are put into Israeli airplanes for potential use. And that's that's going to be a significant thing. There are two things that the Israelis that the U.S. is worried about with Israel. One of them is the immediate conduct in Gaza. The second thing is using Israel as a buffer against Iran. And that is going to be kind of the balancing act that the administration has to deal with at this point. Let's listen in to Admiral Kirby in Gaza are unacceptable. the need for Israel to announce and to implement and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering will be determined by our assessment He underscored that an immediate cease fire is essential to stabilize and to protect innocent civilians. And he urged the prime minister President Biden made clear that the United States strongly supports Israel in the face of those threats. That's all I have. Admiral, you're not specifying what concrete steps Israel must take. Example, I. I gave you some of a broad sense of it. We want to see more crossings opened up. We want to see more trucks getting in, particularly from Jordan. We want to see tangible steps that the mitigation of civilian harm, particularly to humanitarian aid workers, but obviously all civilians. But we want to see that they have that they have moved forward on proper steps to de-conflict with aid workers as they move around, that the information flow is vital. Their language we've heard for weeks now, you're not talking about sort of telling us how exactly you will measure those measurable steps right. What I said was we're going to examine our policy approaches based on the our assessment of the way the Israeli side modifies their behavior, modifies their policy and decision making processes. And so, first of all, let's see what they say they're going to do. And then let's watch and see how they execute to what they say. And I don't want to get ahead of them on what they are and what they what they plan to say about the changes they're going to make. But we'll base our policy decisions based on an assessment of how they execute to their policy decisions. You're not talking about what potential US policy changes are on the table. Can you say whether the president share that with the Prime Minister on this phone call? The President made clear that the that absent changes in the protection of civilians on the ground, absent changes to the volume of humanitarian assistance getting in, absent absent any movement on a cease fire that will allow hostages to get out and more aid to get in. Absent, you know, a calming down that he will have to reconsider his own policy choices with respect to Gaza.",

                "Lemma": "We need to go to Secretary of State Blinken. He is in Brussels. Let's listen in and we'll come back to that. And I made clear then the commitment of the United States to Israel's security and to ensuring that October 7th could never happen again. I also underscored Israel's moral, strategic and legal requirements to protect civilians and provide humanitarian assistance to those who needed it. Now, of course, what happened after October 7th could have ended immediately if Hamas had stopped hiding behind civilians, released the hostages and put down its weapons But Israel is not Hamas. Israel is a democracy. Hamas, a terrorist organization, and democracies place the highest value on human life. Every human life, as has been said, whoever saves the life, saves the entire world. That's our strength. It's what distinguishes us from terrorists. Like Hamas. If we lose that reverence for human life, we risk becoming indistinguishable from those we confront Here's the current reality in Gaza. Despite important steps that Israel has taken to allow assistance into Gaza. The results on the ground are woefully insufficient and unacceptable. 100% of the population in Gaza knows acute levels of food insecurity. 100% of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance and those working heroically to provide that assistance are doing so in great peril to their own lives. This week's horrific attack on the world's central kitchen was not the first such incident. It must be the last. President Biden spoke a short while ago with Prime Minister Netanyahu. The leaders discussed the situation in Gaza. The president emphasized that the strikes on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian situation are unacceptable. He made clear the need for Israel to announce a series of specific concrete and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering and the safety of aid workers. He made clear that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel's immediate action on these steps. He underscored as well that an immediate cease fire is essential to stabilize and improve the humanitarian situation and protect innocent civilians. And he urged Prime Minister Netanyahu to empower his negotiators to conclude a deal without delay to bring the hostages home. The two leaders also discussed public Iranian threats against Israel and the Israeli people. President Biden reaffirmed the United States strong support for Israel in the face of these threats and our commitment to Israel's security Right now, there is no higher priority in Gaza than protecting civilians. Surging humanitarian assistance and ensuring the security of those who provide it. Israel must meet this moment. We've been. We discussed Secretary of State Antony Blinken at NATO's headquarters on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the organization. He's live in Brussels, Belgium. Some significant remarks when it comes to the conflict in Gaza. The secretary of state saying that he has communicated to Israeli officials not only the U.S. his commitment to Israel and its war against Hamas, but also the moral obligation that Israel has to protect civilians and aid workers in the Gaza Strip. He specifically said, and I quote, If we lose reverence for human life, we become indistinguishable from them, from Hamas terrorists. He described the efforts so far by Israel since October seven to protect civilians and humanitarian aid workers as woefully inadequate. And he laid out what we just got a readout from the call that President Biden had with the prime minister that the United States would consider its approach to Israel based on concrete steps to change the way that Israelis handled civilians and aid workers. That's what they're expecting data from Israel, which is clear. He said, that they need to have concrete, measurable steps to address harm to civilians, civilians suffering, and also to aid workers. And he said that US aid to Gaza may be determined by those steps. That's essentially what he said. And this is really significant because it comes on the heels of a very close Biden ally. Senator Coons, talking this morning about being open to putting conditions on aid to Israel, which is really the first time that we have heard the administration go so far. And this is even as we're hearing from a senior administration official, that the policy hasn't changed. The president is frustrated. The policy hasn't changed. This is signaling a potential policy change. So nonetheless, this is this is big. Absolutely. Notably, the timing of the the apparent accidental strike coming almost a day after the U.S. announced this enormous deal. $18 billion to sell F-15 fighter jets to Israel. The question now being, is this rhetoric that actually moves the needle or do there have to be conditions on arms in order to get Prime Minister Netanyahu and some of the other Israeli officials to carry out significant change in the way that they've been conducting the war? We have with us retired Colonel Cedric Leighton to give us some perspective. Colonel Leighton, from what you heard from the secretary of state there, it is a noticeable shift saying that the policy toward Israel will change, determined on the way that Israel conducts its operations in Gaza. And in essence, what we're talking about, Boris here is conditioning the aide on Israeli conduct going forward. I and I guess in this case, you can kind of say past is prolog because the past conduct of Israeli operations has not met U.S. standards. And at this point in time, it appears as if it appears as if the Department of Defense and the administration are looking at changing the policy potentially where they actually say, look, you cannot use these weapons against civilian targets, you cannot use these weapons against aid workers. And that's the kind of thing that I think might be happening here. Whether or not it does, of course, is is going to be borne out in the next few days, probably. But didn't you mention the F-15 sale to Israel? That's something that's going to take place over the next four or five years to actually get those weapons to the Israelis. But the other part of this is they have already delivered, Aaron, in the process of delivering more £2,000 bombs That's a much more immediate thing. It's going to be interesting to see whether or not that delivery is stopped before they actually are put into Israeli airplanes for potential use. And that's that's going to be a significant thing. There are two things that the Israelis that the U.S. is worried about with Israel. One of them is the immediate conduct in Gaza. The second thing is using Israel as a buffer against Iran. And that is going to be kind of the balancing act that the administration has to deal with at this point. Let's listen in to Admiral Kirby in Gaza are unacceptable. the need for Israel to announce and to implement and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering will be determined by our assessment He underscored that an immediate cease fire is essential to stabilize and to protect innocent civilians. And he urged the prime minister President Biden made clear that the United States strongly supports Israel in the face of those threats. That's all I have. Admiral, you're not specifying what concrete steps Israel must take. Example, I. I gave you some of a broad sense of it. We want to see more crossings opened up. We want to see more trucks getting in, particularly from Jordan. We want to see tangible steps that the mitigation of civilian harm, particularly to humanitarian aid workers, but obviously all civilians. But we want to see that they have that they have moved forward on proper steps to de-conflict with aid workers as they move around, that the information flow is vital. Their language we've heard for weeks now, you're not talking about sort of telling us how exactly you will measure those measurable steps right. What I said was we're going to examine our policy approaches based on the our assessment of the way the Israeli side modifies their behavior, modifies their policy and decision making processes. And so, first of all, let's see what they say they're going to do. And then let's watch and see how they execute to what they say. And I don't want to get ahead of them on what they are and what they what they plan to say about the changes they're going to make. But we'll base our policy decisions based on an assessment of how they execute to their policy decisions. You're not talking about what potential US policy changes are on the table. Can you say whether the president share that with the Prime Minister on this phone call? The President made clear that the that absent changes in the protection of civilians on the ground, absent changes to the volume of humanitarian assistance getting in, absent absent any movement on a cease fire that will allow hostages to get out and more aid to get in. Absent, you know, a calming down that he will have to reconsider his own policy choices with respect to Gaza."
