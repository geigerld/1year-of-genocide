00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.750 line:71%
Israel is pressing ahead with

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.875 line:71%
a major military offensive

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:03.625 size:81% position:41% line:71%
in Gaza City,

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:04.833 size:81% position:41% line:71%
as Hamas warns

00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:07.750 position:63% line:71%
the attacks could send cease fire efforts

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.208 line:71%
back to square one.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:10.416 line:71%
Israeli forces report

00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:11.750 line:71%
close quarters combat

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.750 line:71%
with Hamas fighters

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.041 line:71%
saying they are destroying

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:15.833 line:71%
terrorists infrastructure.

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.583 line:71%
Hundreds of thousands of people,

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:19.083 position:56% line:71%
meantime, are fleeing their homes

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:20.291 size:75% position:38% line:71%
once again

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:23.083 line:71%
under yet new evacuation orders.

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:23.666 size:78% position:39% line:71%
Gaza's civil

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.291 size:78% position:39% line:71%
defense says

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.333 position:56% line:71%
bodies are trapped under buildings

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.625 line:71%
and lying in the streets,

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:29.125 line:71%
but it's just too dangerous

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:31.041 position:58% line:71%
for crews to try and retrieve them.

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:33.000 line:71%
The Palestinian Red Crescent

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.041 position:61% line:71%
says all of its medical clinics in Gaza

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:38.250 position:59% line:71%
and Gaza City are now out of service.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.041 size:81% position:41% line:71%
You want to go

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:40.333 line:71%
to our Jeremy Diamond

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.750 position:63% line:71%
now for more is live for us in Jerusalem.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.666 line:71%
You know what a nightmare

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.041 line:71%
repeating itself here again.

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:46.458 line:71%
I mean, evacuations ordered.

00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:48.458 position:63% line:71%
And again, it's a familiar horror, right?

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:51.000 position:56% line:71%
Where the heck do these people go?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.583 position:63% line:71%
What more are you learning about exactly?

00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:55.791 position:59% line:71%
The Israeli operation that is underway

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:57.166 line:71%
and what it means for civilians.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:00:59.583 line:71%
Well, you're right, Paula.

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:01.416 position:56% line:71%
Tens of thousands of Palestinians

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:03.250 line:71%
are once again on the move.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.500 line:71%
We have seen over the course

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.666 line:71%
of just the last week,

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.583 size:88% position:44% line:71%
evacuation orders

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:07.916 line:71%
for parts of Khan Younis

00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:09.875 line:71%
and then in northern Gaza,

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:11.375 line:71%
several evacuation orders

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.583 position:61% line:71%
in different neighborhoods of Gaza City.

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:15.583 position:59% line:71%
And that is where the Israeli military

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:16.916 line:71%
has been concentrating

00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:18.833 line:71%
its military operations

00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:20.333 line:71%
over the last 48 hours

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.458 line:71%
or so inside Gaza City

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:24.208 position:63% line:71%
neighborhoods, where the Israeli military

00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:27.958 position:61% line:71%
says, that, Hamas has returned to areas

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.125 line:71%
that the Israeli military

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:31.083 line:71%
had previously cleared.

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:33.041 position:56% line:71%
and that is what we are continuing

00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:34.750 line:71%
to see in Gaza, absent

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.000 line:71%
a long term strategy

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.875 line:71%
for the governance,

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:37.791 size:81% position:41% line:71%
an alternative

00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:40.000 line:71%
to Hamas's governance in Gaza,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.875 line:71%
the Israeli military

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:42.250 line:71%
going back into areas

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.333 position:59% line:71%
that it had previously withdrawn from.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.083 line:71%
And not only is that resulting

00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:47.666 line:71%
in increased fighting, increased

00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.583 line:71%
artillery shelling, airstrikes,

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:50.166 size:75% position:38% line:71%
but also,

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.083 position:58% line:71%
of course, the impact to civilians,

00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:53.250 line:71%
not only those who are killed

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.833 line:71%
and wounded in the fighting,

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:56.583 position:59% line:71%
rescue workers having trouble actually

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:57.708 size:88% position:44% line:71%
reaching the dead

00:01:57.708 --> 00:01:58.500 size:84% position:42% line:71%
and the wounded

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.375 position:56% line:71%
as a result of the heavy fighting.

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:01.125 line:71%
And then, of course,

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:02.250 line:71%
as we were talking about

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.791 line:71%
the tens of thousands,

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:05.083 line:71%
hundreds of thousands,

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:08.583 position:61% line:71%
in some cases of people who are, moving

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:10.500 position:56% line:71%
to areas of central Gaza, to that

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.208 line:71%
almost the coastal area

00:02:12.208 --> 00:02:13.500 position:56% line:71%
where they are simply finding that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.916 line:71%
there are not enough resources

00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:16.125 line:71%
for the number of people

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:18.083 position:58% line:71%
who are currently displaced in Gaza,

00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:20.208 line:71%
even things like tents, are,

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:21.958 line:71%
running in short supply

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.416 line:71%
in Gaza at the moment.

00:02:23.416 --> 00:02:25.416 line:71%
And for now, the only salve

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:26.750 position:56% line:71%
that they could potentially get is

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.375 size:75% position:38% line:71%
if indeed

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:28.666 line:71%
there is a cease fire agreement.

00:02:28.666 --> 00:02:30.333 line:71%
We are seeing those negotiations

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:31.916 line:71%
continuing this week in Cairo

00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:33.291 line:71%
as well as in Doha, Qatar.

00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:35.916 line:71%
But for now, no deal as of yet.

00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:36.375 size:75% position:38% line:71%
You know,

00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:37.375 line:71%
the other aspect you

00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:38.041 line:71%
that you've been following

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:39.958 line:71%
closely has been whether or not

00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.000 line:71%
this will also be a conflict

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.833 size:88% position:44% line:71%
on another front,

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.375 line:71%
Israel's northern border.

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:45.625 line:71%
What did you learn by visiting?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.375 size:84% position:42% line:71%
Well, late last,

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:50.083 line:71%
last week we traveled to Shula,

00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:51.750 line:71%
which is just a few hundred feet

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.083 line:71%
away from the Lebanese border,

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:54.083 line:71%
to get a sense of just

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:55.708 line:71%
how tense things are there

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.208 position:56% line:71%
and to see some of the destruction

00:02:57.208 --> 00:02:58.166 line:71%
wrought by Hezbollah's

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:01.208 line:71%
anti-tank missiles.

00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:02.416 line:71%
They're going to see us right

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:03.708 line:71%
when we get up there.

00:03:03.708 --> 00:03:05.125 line:71%
And we have three minutes.

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:06.708 line:71%
Colonel Jordan Hertzberg

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:09.083 line:71%
is talking about Hezbollah.

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:10.083 line:71%
After three minutes, though,

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:10.916 line:71%
they can start the fire.

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:12.000 size:84% position:42% line:71%
So a very quick

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.041 position:59% line:71%
he's taking us to an Israeli community

00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:15.625 line:71%
on the front lines of Israel's

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:16.791 size:88% position:44% line:71%
simmering conflict

00:03:16.791 --> 00:03:17.583 size:88% position:44% line:71%
with the Lebanese

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:18.916 size:88% position:44% line:71%
militant group up

00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:20.750 line:71%
a winding mountain road,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.000 position:58% line:71%
past a roadblock in a security fence

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.375 line:71%
and into the village of Shula,

00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:27.750 position:61% line:71%
which sits right on the Lebanese border.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.125 position:61% line:71%
We've just entered the village of Shula.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:29.916 size:72% position:36% line:71%
This is,

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:32.750 position:63% line:71%
a community of about 300 people normally,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.083 size:88% position:44% line:71%
but right now it's

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:35.291 line:71%
just an absolute ghost town.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.208 size:84% position:42% line:71%
Let's go quick.

00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:39.125 position:56% line:71%
The three minute countdown starts

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:40.333 size:88% position:44% line:71%
as soon as we are

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:43.333 position:63% line:71%
within line of sight of southern Lebanon.

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:45.083 position:63% line:71%
Look how close you are to the border here

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:46.541 line:71%
where Hezbollah militants

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:49.333 position:63% line:71%
armed with anti-tank missiles are closely

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:50.333 line:71%
watching the border

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:52.875 line:71%
prepare to fire once again.

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:54.375 position:56% line:71%
This house was hit by a high tech

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:57.375 line:71%
missile right here,

00:03:57.375 --> 00:03:58.458 size:84% position:42% line:71%
past the window.

00:03:58.458 --> 00:03:59.333 size:75% position:38% line:71%
Two homes,

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:00.791 line:71%
one next to the other,

00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:02.583 line:71%
hit in the same attack.

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:04.875 position:56% line:71%
According to the Israeli military,

00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:06.666 position:61% line:71%
this is one of the most dangerous places

00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:07.458 line:71%
in northern Israel.

00:04:07.458 --> 00:04:08.708 line:71%
Right now, we're in Shula,

00:04:08.708 --> 00:04:10.833 position:58% line:71%
and you can see the Lebanese border

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:12.458 line:71%
just right across there, across

00:04:12.458 --> 00:04:14.125 line:71%
from those concrete barriers.

00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:15.666 line:71%
We're just a few hundred feet.

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:16.833 line:71%
And what that means

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:18.291 line:71%
is that we are within range

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.166 position:58% line:71%
of those anti-tank guided missiles.

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:21.416 line:71%
And that is exactly

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:23.125 position:56% line:71%
what has wrought this destruction

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:24.500 line:71%
on this civilian home.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.125 line:71%
The threat of anti-tank

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:27.208 line:71%
missiles is part of

00:04:27.208 --> 00:04:28.041 size:75% position:38% line:71%
why Israel

00:04:28.041 --> 00:04:29.208 line:71%
wants to push Hezbollah

00:04:29.208 --> 00:04:32.333 position:61% line:71%
back to the Litani River, about 18 miles

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:33.791 line:71%
north of the border,

00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:36.250 position:58% line:71%
outside the range of those missiles.

00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:39.833 line:71%
Okay, we have 35 seconds.

00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:41.291 position:56% line:71%
We've been here for three minutes.

00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:43.375 position:61% line:71%
The colonel has been watching his watch

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:45.416 position:59% line:71%
the entire time that we've been here.

00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:48.416 position:61% line:71%
And now he's telling us it's time to go.

00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:51.500 position:56% line:71%
Hezbollah has been firing rockets,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.000 line:71%
missiles and drones

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.666 position:59% line:71%
at northern Israel since October 8th.

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:56.958 line:71%
Israel has responded

00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:57.833 size:84% position:42% line:71%
with air strike

00:04:57.833 --> 00:04:59.125 size:84% position:42% line:71%
after airstrike,

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:01.708 position:59% line:71%
devastating parts of southern Lebanon,

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:03.208 line:71%
where more than 90,000

00:05:03.208 --> 00:05:04.750 line:71%
people have fled their homes

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.666 size:81% position:41% line:71%
since October.

00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:08.708 line:71%
In northern Israel,

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.250 size:78% position:39% line:71%
about 60,000

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.291 line:71%
Israelis have been displaced.

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:14.083 line:71%
People like Ori Eliyahu

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:16.750 position:61% line:71%
and his nine dogs. To this day, leader.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.166 line:71%
His grandfather was among

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:19.250 size:88% position:44% line:71%
the first people.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.958 line:71%
Israel settled in Shula

00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.875 size:88% position:44% line:71%
in the late 1960s,

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:24.416 line:71%
and after spending his summers

00:05:24.416 --> 00:05:25.666 size:88% position:44% line:71%
there as a child,

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:27.708 line:71%
Ori decided to move there.

00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:28.208 size:81% position:41% line:71%
Meaning there

00:05:28.208 --> 00:05:29.708 position:56% line:71%
still is a special place for you.

00:05:29.708 --> 00:05:30.291 size:81% position:41% line:71%
It's my heart

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:32.500 size:81% position:41% line:71%
to be honest.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.041 position:61% line:71%
If you could return to Shula, you would.

00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:37.250 line:71%
Of course I wouldn't.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.041 size:81% position:41% line:71%
I would have,

00:05:38.041 --> 00:05:39.041 line:71%
and the first moment

00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:40.833 line:71%
I would have been to. Yeah.

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:42.791 position:58% line:71%
But he says that may not be the case

00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:44.416 line:71%
for families with children.

00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:46.125 position:61% line:71%
I don't think that there is a condition

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:48.000 line:71%
that will make them come back,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.625 line:71%
because whenever they know

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:50.625 line:71%
the tree symbolizes,

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:51.750 size:88% position:44% line:71%
like Hamas can do

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.708 line:71%
what they did in October 7th

00:05:53.708 --> 00:05:55.583 size:84% position:42% line:71%
and attack them,

00:05:55.583 --> 00:05:57.333 line:71%
they want to be with them.

00:05:57.333 --> 00:05:58.791 line:71%
And there is no real solution

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:01.750 position:63% line:71%
because a big wall might ruin everything.

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:03.916 line:71%
A big war is exactly

00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:05.333 line:71%
what the Israeli military

00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:06.958 size:88% position:44% line:71%
is preparing for.

00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.166 line:71%
Our division has been training

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:10.000 position:58% line:71%
for this war for a long, long time.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.791 position:63% line:71%
Whether that war materializes is unclear,

00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:14.041 line:71%
but for Colonel Hertzberg,

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.916 line:71%
the objective is obvious

00:06:15.916 --> 00:06:17.541 line:71%
get Israel's northern residents

00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:19.375 line:71%
back into their homes.

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:20.916 size:88% position:44% line:71%
Whether it happens

00:06:20.916 --> 00:06:22.708 line:71%
before a major ground operation

00:06:22.708 --> 00:06:24.750 line:71%
or after ground operation.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.416 position:63% line:71%
I can't tell you I'm in the tactical open

00:06:26.416 --> 00:06:27.625 line:71%
mind of the political level

00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:28.833 line:71%
or the policy level,

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:30.041 position:59% line:71%
but the people are going to come back

00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:30.625 size:88% position:44% line:71%
sooner than later.

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:35.333 size:78% position:39% line:71%
And, Paula,

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:36.625 line:71%
the situation along that border

00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:38.666 line:71%
still remains very, very tense.

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:39.708 line:71%
And it's not clear yet

00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:41.416 position:56% line:71%
whether it will blow up into that

00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:43.541 position:56% line:71%
all out war that has been feared.

00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:44.500 line:71%
What we do know, though,

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.916 line:71%
is those cease fire negotiations

00:06:45.916 --> 00:06:47.708 position:58% line:71%
happening this week in Doha, Qatar.

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:49.500 line:71%
They could not only,

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.208 line:71%
unlock a cease fire in Gaza,

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:52.875 position:59% line:71%
but they could also potentially unlock

00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:55.041 line:71%
a broader peace in the region.

00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:55.416 size:69% position:34% line:71%
Yeah.

00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:56.916 position:59% line:71%
And as you pointed out in your report,

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:57.875 line:71%
tens of thousands of people

00:06:57.875 --> 00:06:58.833 line:71%
on both sides of the border

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:00.416 line:71%
want to get back to their lives.

00:07:00.416 --> 00:07:00.833 size:81% position:41% line:71%
it's obviously

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:02.666 line:71%
an agricultural hub as well.

00:07:02.666 --> 00:07:03.583 line:71%
And we'll wait to see

00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:04.458 line:71%
if there is progress

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:05.666 line:71%
on these cease fire talks.

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:06.500 line:71%
Jeremy Diamond for us.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.416 line:71%
Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
