. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. SO LET ME START WITH YOU,  MATTHEW, AND YOUR REPORTING. U.S. OFFICIALS ARE SAYING IN  TERMS OF WHAT STARTED THIS  ATTACK AND POSSIBLY WHAT COULD  DETERMINE HOW MUCH BIGGER THIS  CONFLICT GETS. U.S. OFFICIALS ARE SAYING THAT  THERE IS NO PROOF OR SUGGESTION  OF DIRECT IRANIAN INVOLVEMENT. WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING? &gt;&gt; WELL, I MEAN, IN GENERAL  TERMS, ISRAELI OFFICIALS I'VE  SPOKEN TO AGREE WITH THAT  ASSESSMENT IN THE SENSE THAT  THEY'RE SAYING, LOOK, THE  BACKDROP OF THIS IS THAT IRAN  PROVIDES MATERIAL SUPPORT,  TRAINING, POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR  HAMAS. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE  JUST SAID THEN AND WHAT ISRAELI  INTELLIGENCE IS SUGGESTING. THEY ARE SAYING TO ME, THE  SENIOR ISRAELI OFFICIAL TELLING  ME EARLIER THAT IRAN GREEN  LIGHTED THE IDEA OF THIS  OPERATION, DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE TIMING PERHAPS, DIDN'T QUITE  UNDERSTAND PERHAPS AS MANY OF US DIDN'T, THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT THIS OPERATION WOULD BE BUT KNEW THIS OPERATION WAS BEING  PLANNED. AND THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT TO  HAVING NO INVOLVEMENT  WHATSOEVER. IT'S NOT THAT IRAN WAS PULLING  THE STRINGS, BUT IT'S SOMEWHERE  IN THE MIDDLE. &gt;&gt; SO, A SENIOR HAMAS OFFICIAL  IS NOW CLAIMING THAT THEY SPENT  TWO YEARS -- THAT'S AMAZING TO  THINK ABOUT THAT AS MATTHEW AND  I ARE STANDING HERE -- TWO YEARS PREPARING FOR THIS UNPRECEDENTED ISRAEL AND THAT IT DID FINANCIAL AS WELL AS WEAPONS SUPPORT FROM  IRAN. ALSO SAYING THAT RUSSIA REACHED  OUT AFTER THE ATTACK. GENERAL HODGES, WHEN YOU PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER, HOW SIGNIFICANT  IS THIS? THE INVOLVEMENT THEY ARE SAYING  THEY HAD FROM BOTH RUSSIA AND  BUT ALSO THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THEY ARE SAYING THEY PLANNED  THIS THAT ISRAEL DID NOT SEE IT  COMING. &gt;&gt; SO, ERIN, I THINK THIS IS  RUSSIA OPENING UP A SECOND  FRONT. I MEAN, WHAT'S GOING ON NOW IS  DISTRACTING SO MUCH ATTENTION  AND EVEN RESOURCES AWAY FROM  UKRAINE, WHICH, OF COURSE,  BENEFITS RUSSIA. NOBODY EVEN HAS MENTIONED  UKRAINE HARDLY IN THE LAST 96  HOURS. I THINK IT'S PROBABLY ACCURATE  WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS  THERE WAS NO DIRECT INVOLVEMENT, BUT THE WAY YOU AND MATT HAVE  LAID IT OUT, IT'S GREEN LIGHTING THE WEAPONS, I MEAN, I WATCHED  THE TRAINING VIDEO OF THESE GUYS WHAT, THEY WERE DOING TO PREPARE FOR THIS ATTACK. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU DO IN  YOUR GARAGE OR YOUR BASEMENT. THIS IS REALLY HIGH-QUALITY  EFFORT ON THE SIDE OF HAMAS. &gt;&gt; AND, MATTHEW, WE'RE  TALKING -- I WAS TALKING TO  SOMEONE TODAY. THERE ARE THESE STORIES ABOUT  IDF FIGHTERS TAKING ON EIGHT TO  TEN OF THESE FIGHTERS AND  FIGHTING FOR HOURS AND HOURS IN  HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT, THAT THIS  WAS ALSO GOING ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME, THAT THESE WERE NOT JUST  HIGHLY MOTIVATED BUT HIGHLY  PREPARED AND HIGHLY ARMED  INDIVIDUALS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE  SHOCK, ERIN, OF COURSE, TO THE  PEOPLE OF ISRAEL, THEY'RE  ENRAGED BY IT. AND, OF COURSE, IT'S BEEN  SURPRISING AS WELL. AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY  SURPRISING FOR HAMAS AS WELL. FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING,  THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO  BE SO SUCCESSFUL, IF I CAN USE  THOSE TERMS. PERHAPS THEY WANTED TO GET SOME  ISRAELI HOSTAGES, PERHAPS THEY  WANTED TO USE THAT TO NEGOTIATE  BETTER TERMS IN GAZA. BUT WHERE THEY'VE GONE TO HAS  LED TO THE BRINK OF UTTER  CATASTROPHE FOR THEM AND FOR  GAZA. &gt;&gt; AND, GENERAL HODGES, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ACTUALLY SAW ON THE BORDER TODAY RIGHT ALONG  THAT BORDER THREE MILES AWAY,  VERY BLATANT MASSING OF ISRAELI  FORCES. THEY ARE BUSING THEM IN. WE HEARD HEAVY OUTGOING FIRE. WE HEARD THE FIGHTER JETS AND  THE EXPLOSIONS AND WE SAW THEM  IN GAZA. AND THEN AT ONE POINT 60 ROCKETS CAME IN. IT WAS A BARRAGE, IT WAS AN  ONSLAUGHT. THAT'S THE TEMPO THAT WE  EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT THE  AFTERNOON TODAY. GENERAL HODGES, WHAT DOES THIS  SAY TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IS NEXT? DO YOU SUSTAIN THIS SORT OF BACK AND FORTH IF SOMETHING ISN'T  ABOUT TO IMMINENTLY OCCUR? &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M PUTTING  MYSELF IN THE SHOES OF THE  COMMANDER OF, SAY, A BATTALION  COMMANDER. AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS MY  MISSION. SOLDIERS CANNOT STAY IN A CROUCH OR COILED LIKE THIS  INDEFINITELY. SO, WHAT YOU HAVE SHOWN VERY  CLEARLY IS THAT THEY ARE IN THIS CROUCH GETTING READY FOR  SOMETHING. BUT ARE THEY GOING IN THERE TO  DO A PUNITIVE STRIKE, GO IN FOR  A FEW DAYS, KILL AS MANY HAMAS  AS THEY CAN? OR IS THIS GOING TO END UP IN AN OCCUPATION THAT MAYBE LASTS FOR  SEVERAL MONTHS? THAT'S A DIFFERENT SORT OF  THING. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD WANT TO KNOW IF I WAS THE COMMANDER. WHAT'S THE END STATE WE'RE BEING SENT IN TO ACHIEVE. NO MATTER WHICH, EITHER OF THESE TWO POSSIBILITIES, IT'S GOING TO BE VERY, VERY DIFFICULT. YOU'VE POINTED OUT THE  BULLDOZERS. THE ISRAELIS ARE PROBABLY AS  GOOD AS ANYBODY IN THE WORLD AT  USING BULLDOZERS AND OTHER  CAPABILITIES INSIDE A DENSELY  POPULATED AREA LIKE THIS. THEY KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. BUT EVEN WITH THAT, IT'S STILL  GOING TO BE VERY COSTLY. &gt;&gt; AND, MATTHEW, AS YOU HAVE  SPENT SO MUCH TIME IN UKRAINE,  AND WE WERE THERE AS THE WAR  BEGAN, THERE ARE MORE THAN  DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THAT PUTIN HAD AT ONE POINT ON THAT  BORDER AT THE BEGINNING ALONG  THIS BORDER WITH GAZA. A VERY SMALL -- EVERYTHING HERE  IS IN A VERY SMALL SPACE. JUST TO GIVE EVERYONE A SENSE OF THE MASSIVE FORCE THAT IS  PREPARED. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE GOING TO NEED  OVERWHELMING FORCE BECAUSE GAZA  IS ONE OF THE MOST DENSELY  POPULATED AREAS IN THE WORLD,  IT'S GOT THIN NARROW STREETS,  TERRIBLE FIGHTING CONDITIONS. IT'S CRISSCROSSED BY A NETWORK  OF TUNNELS THAT ARE CONTROLLED  BY -- AND THE OTHER THING IS 150 HOSTAGES INSIDE GAZA. THAT'S GOT TO COMPLICATE ANY  KIND OF MILITARY OPERATION.
