5-year-old Shams eyes are a portal&nbsp; to the Past she cannot forget there&nbsp;&nbsp; are the streets and homes scarred by War&nbsp; this building where she recited her final&nbsp;&nbsp; prayers and then there is the indelible sight&nbsp; of her father and sister shot dead before her eyes sh's mother saah who suffered&nbsp; Burns as a child will never forget that day but there's more to their story than&nbsp; tragedy and loss in war Tor Gaza sham and&nbsp;&nbsp; sa's story is unlike any other we have come&nbsp; across in 10 months of War that's because&nbsp;&nbsp; saah doesn't just accuse Israeli troops&nbsp; of killing her husband acram and daughter&nbsp;&nbsp; Yasmin an Israeli soldier may also have saved&nbsp; her life on November 24th the week-long truce&nbsp;&nbsp; between Israel and Hamas begins thousands of&nbsp; people begin heading back to their homes in&nbsp;&nbsp; Northern Gaza sa and her family are among them&nbsp; but as they approach the salatin neighborhood&nbsp;&nbsp; where they lived they find themselves&nbsp; walking alone and then shots ring out her husband soon decides to crawl away&nbsp; to try to find help but moments later he&nbsp;&nbsp; is shot again fatally sah lies on the ground&nbsp; bleeding cradling her eldest daughter yasine [Music] as a mother I mean you must have felt&nbsp; absolutely helpless in that moment yasine soon died in her mother's arms&nbsp; for hours sah lies here with Sham&nbsp;&nbsp; unable to move until she finally&nbsp; finds the strength to crawl down&nbsp;&nbsp; the street and into this nearby home&nbsp; we obtained footage from that house&nbsp;&nbsp; after our first interview with sah this&nbsp; is the first time she and Sha are seeing it and Sham begins to tell my&nbsp; colleague air Salman what happened to her an explosion then rocks the&nbsp; bathroom Israeli soldiers enter&nbsp;&nbsp; the house and call out in Arabic what happens&nbsp; next is captured on muted body camera footage&nbsp;&nbsp; provided by the Israeli military Two&nbsp; Soldiers treating sana's gunshot wounds the medic soon realizes her condition&nbsp; is serious she needs to get to a hospital Israeli soldiers carry saana&nbsp; out of the building on a stretcher&nbsp;&nbsp; her hands clutching sham nothing&nbsp; about this footage should be be&nbsp;&nbsp; extraordinary militaries must protect&nbsp; and care for wounded civilians when&nbsp;&nbsp; possible under international law but&nbsp; in this war this site is exceedingly rare for eight months sa and Sham have lived&nbsp; in this Jerusalem Hospital their Journey here&nbsp;&nbsp; was no less traumatic interrogation and&nbsp; strip searches came before treatment at&nbsp;&nbsp; an Israeli Hospital Israeli authorities are now&nbsp; planning to send them back to Gaza next month&nbsp;&nbsp; unless another country takes them in the Israeli&nbsp; military for its part told CNN in a statement that&nbsp;&nbsp; sa and her family were caught in the crossfire&nbsp; the IDF says its soldiers issued verbal warnings&nbsp;&nbsp; after the family stumbled upon a concealed&nbsp; military position drawing a militant attack&nbsp;&nbsp; the four people who entered in the area were&nbsp; caught in the intense exchange of fire between&nbsp;&nbsp; the terrorists and our troops the troops did not&nbsp; open fire at the four people nor did they aim at them I wonder what would you say to that&nbsp; one soldier if if you could see him again sana's pain is as raw as ever and seeing her home&nbsp;&nbsp; again in footage film this&nbsp; spring brings a flood of emotion mundane objects&nbsp; are transformed into relics and saana is taken back in time to&nbsp; the life she will never get back and&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeremy's joining us now from Tel Aviv&nbsp; Jeremy very very powerful story I want&nbsp;&nbsp; to know whether there's any update to&nbsp; the fact that you report the IDF says&nbsp;&nbsp; they're going to send her back with&nbsp; her daughter is that is that really possible as of now Israeli authorities are&nbsp; planning to send s and Sham back to Gaza at&nbsp;&nbsp; some point early next month but as I understand&nbsp; it if a third country comes in and says that they&nbsp;&nbsp; will take them in then there is an option here&nbsp; for them to not go back to Gaza and I do want&nbsp;&nbsp; to stress what that could mean if they were&nbsp; sent back to Gaza I spoke with Sham actually&nbsp;&nbsp; just in the last sorry I spoke with Sana in&nbsp; just the last hour and she told me that she&nbsp;&nbsp; is terrified of going back to Gaza terrified&nbsp; of what life would be like if she were living&nbsp;&nbsp; with her family who are currently living in&nbsp; makeshift shelters they've been displaced&nbsp;&nbsp; four times in Gaza already so far during this&nbsp; war but most of all she is terrified about what&nbsp;&nbsp; going back to Gaza could mean for her daughter&nbsp; sham uh you know I first met sham five months&nbsp;&nbsp; ago and and the girl that she is now is very&nbsp; different from the girl she was 5 months ago&nbsp;&nbsp; she has opened up so much more and her mother is&nbsp; terrified that should they go back to Gaza all&nbsp;&nbsp; of the progress that she has made since then uh&nbsp; could effectively be erased in an instant it is&nbsp;&nbsp; incredible how resilient children can be given&nbsp; half the chance but I want to know what about&nbsp;&nbsp; the bigger picture in terms of a ceasefire&nbsp; for everybody's sake uh transfer of hostages&nbsp;&nbsp; and prisoners um there's all sorts of leaking as&nbsp; you know and Reporting um of blaming and finger&nbsp;&nbsp; pointing at the Netanyahu government for for&nbsp; not pushing these ahead even within the Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp; establishment there are criticisms for the way&nbsp; this is going and even Egypt has been leaking that&nbsp;&nbsp; they don't think the Israelis want a a&nbsp; ceasefire what do you think is going on&nbsp;&nbsp; H how much do you how much store do you set&nbsp; by what the Americans are saying that it's so close it is so hard to know who or what&nbsp; information to believe at this stage and so&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we have to just kind of keep an open mind&nbsp; about various different possibilities there's no&nbsp;&nbsp; question though that it very much seems like the&nbsp; Americans are the most kind of optimistic the most&nbsp;&nbsp; gung-ho about this current negotiating process and&nbsp; at times it really does feel like they are almost&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to will this uh ceasefire agreement&nbsp; into existence you know yesterday we heard&nbsp;&nbsp; the Secretary of State Anthony blinkin saying&nbsp; that Israel has accepted this bridging proposal&nbsp;&nbsp; which is intended to bridge the gaps between the&nbsp; Israeli position and the Hamas position but at&nbsp;&nbsp; the same time we are still hearing doubts in the&nbsp; Israeli government about Israel's full commitment&nbsp;&nbsp; uh to the current version of the ceasefire&nbsp; proposal and in addition to that Hamas is&nbsp;&nbsp; saying that they believe this bridging proposal&nbsp; is effectively caving to a series of Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp; demands which they view as total non-starters so&nbsp; right now it's it seems difficult to imagine how&nbsp;&nbsp; a deal could come together this week uh which is&nbsp; what the United States has said their goal is um&nbsp;&nbsp; but it is clear that at least negotiations&nbsp; are continuing and we expect the Secretary&nbsp;&nbsp; of State Anthony blinkin as he arrives in Doha&nbsp; cutter to get a better sense from the cutteries&nbsp;&nbsp; who are the key interlocutors with Hamas about&nbsp; exactly where their head is at behind the scenes&nbsp;&nbsp; so these negotiations certainly continuing&nbsp; very hard to see where they go from here
