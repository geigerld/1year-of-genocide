00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.572
It's a
place the Israeli

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:08.575
military doesn't want us to see.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:20.520
CNN has gained

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.955
exclusive evidence

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.391
of Palestinian prisoner abuse

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.360
from multiple Israeli whistleblowers.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.101
At the Sede Teman facility

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.403
in southern Israel.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.538
We joined human rights activists

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.406
amid growing

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:40.807
public concern

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.710
for the detainees being held inside.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.946
This is a protest by Israeli citizens

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:49.983
outside a detention center close to Gaza,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.217
where we know

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.920
hundreds of Palestinians have been held.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.488
You can see it's a closed

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:56.623
military facility.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.158
It's behind the barbed wire fence.

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.093
We're not permitted access,

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.962
and there's hostility from passers by.

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.465
We just had somebody drive past in a car

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.233
and they shouted out to us in Hebrew,

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.601
you're defending murderers.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.136
No defending. What do you feel?

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.238
We're defending basic human rights.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.674
And eyewitnesses are now speaking out.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.877
Way from the

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.045
military facility

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:21.014
near the beaches of Tel Aviv.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.650
One young Israeli army reservist

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.118
agreed to speak

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:28.121
about scores of detainees at city to man,

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:31.357
he says are kept in cages or pens,

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:34.360
constantly shackled and blindfolded,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.962
many for weeks on end.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:38.131
We've hidden his identity and voice

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.233
to shield him from prosecution.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:40.934
We were told

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:41.968
they are not allowed to move

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:43.503
and must sit upright.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:44.404
They're not allowed to talk

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:46.206
or peek under their blindfolds.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:46.840
And what happened

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.875
if they if they did do that?

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.610
What kind of punishments were meted out?

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.611
We were allowed to pick out

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.446
problematic people and punish them.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.714
Having them stand with their hands

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:56.883
above their heads for an unlimited time.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.384
If they didn't keep their hands up,

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.687
we could zip tie them to the fence.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:02.155
These really military says

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.756
detainees are handcuffed

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:04.858
based on their risk

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:07.060
level and health status,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.261
but the account tallies

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.130
with photographic evidence

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.630
obtained

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.267
by CNN of Palestinian detainees inside

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:15.134
Sede Teman

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.204
and with hand and wrist

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:19.239
injuries shown

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.242
to CNN by dozens of Palestinians

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.978
released back into Gaza.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.580
I was zip tied and blindfolded, says this

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.748
former detainee,

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:31.351
and tortured in a way I never imagined.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.051
One source

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:34.587
telling us the restraints were so tight

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:37.323
that to amputate a man's hand.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.958
The view that I've heard expressed

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.293
is that,

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:40.894
you know,

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.362
how do you think Israeli hostages

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.763
are treated by Hamas?

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:44.831
This sentiment was voiced

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:45.899
in the facility.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:46.566
But I think that

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.301
if Hamas is so abominable,

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.802
which I agree with,

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.571
then why use Hamas as a bar?

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:54.574
It's a descent into dehumanization.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:59.379
A descent that's accelerated

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.814
since the rampage by Hamas

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:03.883
on October the 7th last year.

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:05.118
The killing, an abduction

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.287
to Gaza of hundreds of Israelis,

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:10.757
provoked outrage and a brutal response

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.593
made Israel's wrath.

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:14.260
Tens of

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.562
thousands of Palestinians

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:18.565
have been killed.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.303
And thousands detained for interrogation.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:26.472
Transported to facilities like

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:27.373
Sede Teman

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:28.975
where one Israeli guard

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:32.645
tells CNN prisoners are routinely beaten.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.216
We've hidden his identity and voice, too.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.484
You can take them out and hit them

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:41.421
maybe 4 or 5 times with a club.

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:42.622
It's not done in the face

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:43.957
so you don't see blood.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.425
The detainees lie belly

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.293
down, being hit and kicked,

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:48.261
people screaming

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:49.862
and dogs barking at them.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.064
It's terrifying.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.832
Some detainees are taken away

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.100
and beaten really hard.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.302
So bones and teeth are broken.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:59.439
So you saw people who were subject to

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.273
these beatings,

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.542
had their bones broken,

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:04.577
and you had their teeth broken.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:04.978
Yes.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:05.645
It's a practice

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.313
which commanders know about.

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:08.514
They want intelligence,

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:10.617
but they also want revenge and punishment

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:12.252
for what happened on October 7th.

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:14.420
The Israeli

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.557
military hasn't approved CNN's requests

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:20.126
for access to Sede Teman

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.694
the gates of the facility.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:24.697
We challenged the Israeli guards.

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:37.577
This is a facility.

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:40.413
As we leave, masked soldiers approach.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:48.554
in the property of, of the army.

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:56.763
they tried to take our cameras.

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:06.606
Then order us to leave.

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:09.709
Well, we're driving now

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:10.743
to meet one

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:13.713
Israeli with personal experience of this.

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:16.316
A day time and facility.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.751
It's experience that he says

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:19.319
has left him

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.087
shocked at the condition

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:23.056
and the medical treatment

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:24.991
of Palestinian detainees that

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:27.660
he told us he treated

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.228
Palestinian detainees

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:30.863
with gunshot wounds

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:33.333
fresh from the war zone in Gaza,

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.868
but was appalled at the lack of equipment

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.437
and expertise.

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:39.672
The problem is Gazans who are brought in

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:41.140
are labeled as terrorists,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.543
and it is very popular opinion over here

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:45.445
that terrorists deserve to die.

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:46.713
So they do not deserve

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:49.449
the same medical care as everyone else.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.452
Satellite imagery obtained by CNN shows

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:54.220
how the Sede Teman facility

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.555
was expanded

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.924
after the October 7th attacks,

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:59.492
with detention facilities

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:00.193
and makeshift

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.128
medical bays being added

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:04.897
after public hospitals in Israel refused

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:07.900
to treat injured guards and suspects.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.237
Eyewitness accounts describe a field

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:14.240
hospital with 15 to 20 patients,

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:17.043
virtually naked and blindfolded,

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.378
with hands and feet

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.979
shackled to their beds

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.447
and wearing diapers.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.015
What eye witness told CNN

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:25.351
painful procedures were carried out

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.720
by underqualified medics.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.187
Treatment,

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:29.122
the medical worker

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:32.125
told us, amounts to punishment.

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:32.892
In my view,

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:35.294
it's the idea of total vulnerability.

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:37.663
If you imagine being unable to move,

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:40.333
being unable to see what's going on.

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.567
That's something that borders,

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.902
if not crosses into

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.237
psychological torture.

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:45.772
The Israeli

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:46.806
military says

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.374
prisoners are stripped

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:50.143
for security checks,

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:52.412
and that investigations are opened

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.214
when there's suspicion of misconduct.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:55.815
Still,

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:56.416
the counts

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.951
from Israelis and Palestinians inside,

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:00.753
and the shocking images

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:03.756
paint a disturbing picture.

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:06.959
Matthew Chance, CNN at Sede Teman

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:08.027
in southern Israel.
