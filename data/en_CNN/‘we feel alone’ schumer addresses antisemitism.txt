&gt;&gt;&gt; In the weeks since the October 7th&nbsp; attacks in Israel killing thousands Israelis,&nbsp;&nbsp; including women, children, and doing so with some&nbsp; barbaric way, we have seen a rise of anti-semitism&nbsp;&nbsp; around the world, particularly here in the U.S.&nbsp; Jew hate, senate minority leader chuck Schumer,&nbsp;&nbsp; just addressed this crisis in a&nbsp; powerful speech on the senate floor.&nbsp; &gt;&gt; I have noticed the significant disparity&nbsp; between how jewish people regard the rise of&nbsp;&nbsp; anti-semitism and how many of my non-jewish&nbsp; friends regard it. To us, the jewish people,&nbsp;&nbsp; the rise of anti-semitism is a crisis. A&nbsp; five-alarm fire that must be extinguished. [12:09:10 PM] extinguished. For so many other people&nbsp; of good will, it is merely a problem,&nbsp;&nbsp; a matter of concern. After October 7th, jewish&nbsp; Americans are feeling singled out, targeted and&nbsp;&nbsp; isolated. In many ways, we feel alone. &gt;&gt; Melanie zanona joins me from capitol&nbsp;&nbsp; hill. It's so interesting to hear somebody&nbsp; like chuck Schumer say what he just said and&nbsp;&nbsp; really take up the mantle to speak for Jews&nbsp; in America in a way that we don't always hear&nbsp;&nbsp; jewish leaders, even chuck Schumer. &gt;&gt; It is personal.

A&nbsp;&nbsp; message that could have been directed a the&nbsp; some of the members of his own party. This&nbsp;&nbsp; comes as congress has been wrestling&nbsp; with an aid package. As of right now,&nbsp;&nbsp; that package really hinges on whether they can&nbsp; find bipartisan agreement on a border security&nbsp;&nbsp; provision package. That is the complex issue.&nbsp; As you know, it's something that is long alluded&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington for many years. We'll see if they can&nbsp; get it done. As of right now, they are trying to&nbsp;&nbsp; make some progress hoping to get a handshake on&nbsp; that part of the package. Could see something&nbsp;&nbsp; on the floor, but it's a high task over here&nbsp; in congress to get something like that done.
