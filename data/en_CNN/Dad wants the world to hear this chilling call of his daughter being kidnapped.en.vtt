00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.266
It's been

00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.836
nearly two weeks since Hamas militants

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:03.737
abducted dozens

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:05.905
and dozens of hostages in Israel,

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.041
and their families are growing desperate.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.509
More tonight from my colleague

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.279
Erin Burnett, who's in Tel Aviv Erin.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.181
Abbi, it has been 12 days

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.950
since those hostages were abducted.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.918
I mean, you have to think about what

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.353
they've been enduring in that time,

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.355
we understand, maybe held in tunnels.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.657
Who knows what the circumstances are?

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:24.991
And of course,

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.359
their families are desperate

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.428
for any sign of their loved ones.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.929
They all tell us

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.231
they just want a sign of life,

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:33.199
any kind of a sign of life.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:33.800
Earlier today,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.968
I had a chance to talk

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.803
to the parents of two of the hostages,

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.671
Maya and E.J. Regev.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.607
They were both abducted by Hamas

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:41.741
at the music festival.

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.576
At least 260 people were killed,

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.412
of course, at that festival,

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.046
and their parents

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.047
thought they were among them.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:47.814
At first,

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:48.782
their father played me

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.283
a harrowing phone call

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:50.950
from his daughter,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.718
Maya,

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.053
as she came face to

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.721
face with Hamas terrorists,

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.324
to my husband to

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.860
I can hold

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.731
onto my call and

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.369
my thought

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.442
I've heard that.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.377
But I guess that's my effort.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.813
Their method, my

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:22.148
coping

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:24.384
with

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.920
whatever she said.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.954
She over

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:31.257
30 wanted to hear my sense of humor

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:35.662
the only bad moments to see me coming

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:37.931
out

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.013
you know,

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.182
I the suffering

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.044
took some water,

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.179
some water

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:32.285
some hummus,

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:34.787
the form of

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.559
I felt she was the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.296
I thought both of them did

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.831
the most.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.634
My son, both both of my child in the car

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:50.670
he chose to kill me.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.206
To kill me. I love you, Bob.

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:53.740
I love you.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.044
The AP, obviously,

00:02:58.378 --> 00:02:59.846
it's incredible to watch that.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.015
You can see Marines reaction.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.684
And Alon, of course,

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:05.752
the heartbreak

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.720
but they wanted the world to hear

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.022
that call.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.024
Ilan had not listened to it

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.159
since he actually spoke to his daughter.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.562
Marie had not heard it until that moment.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:16.896
And you could see her

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.398
steeling herself to hear it.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:19.732
But she wanted the world to hear it

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.868
because they want the world to know.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:23.836
They they also told me

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.471
that they saw video on social media

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:26.272
a very brief

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:28.308
one from Hamas that showed their son

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.609
taken hostage.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.511
And they haven't seen any video

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.312
of their daughter,

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:32.946
although they say

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.047
that Israeli authorities

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.281
just a few days ago

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.116
told them the Israeli army came

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.851
and told them on Monday night

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.019
that both of their children

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.321
are being held in Gaza.

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.188
So they thought it

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.156
obviously very important

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:44.257
that the Israeli government, Avi,

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:48.194
knew that but the Israeli army refused

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.162
to tell them

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:51.531
exactly how they know this information.

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:51.965
But, of course,

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:52.165
I mean,

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.066
you can see the anguish

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:53.733
and the pain

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.735
as those parents wait and wait

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:56.936
and pray for a sign

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:58.171
of life of their children.
