00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.835
Here's my take.

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:03.303
Hamas's brutal

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:05.872
and inhuman attack on Israel last week

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:08.608
took the world by surprise.

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:10.744
Most importantly, and tragically,

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.212
it took the Israeli government

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.380
by surprise,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:13.980
which meant a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.215
delayed response

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.984
to the slaughter of its civilians.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.020
But this was no black swan event.

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.890
Instead, as the scholar Amy Zegart notes,

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.925
it was a white swan,

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.828
something utterly predictable.

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.764
This is the sixth war between

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.665
Israel and Hamas in Gaza

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.734
over the last 15 years.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:35.702
Israel controls

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.104
air, land and sea access to the Strip.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.440
Israeli intelligence is supposed to have

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.042
an extensive network

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.411
of informants in Gaza.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.546
So what happened?

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:47.280
We'll need time

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.581
to reach a full assessment.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:49.949
But it does appear that

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.084
the Netanyahu government

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.152
was so focused

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.254
on judicial overhaul at home

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.122
and the Saudi deal abroad

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:57.023
that it ignored

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.492
the possibility of an upheaval in Gaza.

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:02.529
Despite allegedly receiving warnings

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:03.296
from Egypt.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.764
Professor

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:05.799
Dimitri Chomsky

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:06.332
of Hebrew

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.568
University writes more provocatively

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.905
that for years, Netanyahu developed

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.173
and advanced

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:14.707
a destructive, warped

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:16.176
political doctrine

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.511
that held that strengthening Hamas

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:19.646
at the expense

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.381
of the Palestinian Authority

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:23.349
would be good for Israel.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.950
This approach

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.119
divided the Palestinians, undermined

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.320
the Palestinian Authority

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.455
in the West Bank,

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.890
and made it easy for Netanyahu to claim

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:33.660
there was no path to a Palestinian state.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.863
Chomsky cites a Jerusalem Post report

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:39.666
that at a Likud Party meeting in 2019,

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.134
Netanyahu made clear

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.069
that he supported the money

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.304
that the Qatari government

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.139
was sending to Hamas.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.640
That way, Bibi is reported

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.508
to have said

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:49.742
Israel would foil

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.945
the establishment of a Palestinian state.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:53.513
Tal Schneider

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:55.348
references the same meeting

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:56.249
and also notes

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.884
that most of the time

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.919
Israel policy was to treat

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.387
the Palestinian Authority

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:04.724
as a burden and Hamas as an asset.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:05.925
Like Israel's

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:08.294
current finance minister once asserted,

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.130
the Netanyahu

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.297
government was pursuing

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:11.831
a policy

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:13.133
premised on the notion

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.067
that it could ignore

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.135
the Palestinian issue

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.603
and make a deal directly

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:18.138
with the Gulf Arabs

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.672
who were increasingly nervous

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.608
about Iran's rise in the region

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.643
and eager to tie up with Israel's

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.979
booming, technology driven economy.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.847
The assumptions

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:30.750
behind that strategy exploded last week,

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.720
but there is a broader backdrop

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.622
for last week's terror attack.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:36.890
For the last two decades,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.358
the Middle East has been shaped

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.593
by Washington's actions,

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.262
above all, by the Iraq war

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:44.030
and the subsequent withdrawal

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.232
of American power.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.434
The war upset the delicate balance

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:50.270
between Iran and the Arabs

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.305
and the Shiites and the Sunnis.

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.541
When the US toppled Saddam Hussein's

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:57.143
Sunni dominated government in Baghdad,

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:58.645
Iran gained

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.914
unprecedented influence in Iraq,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.183
which is majority Shia.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.117
Then began

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.419
the American retreat from the Middle East

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.888
which left a vacuum in the region

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:11.090
and to which many players entered

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.227
Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Russia

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.361
and Israel

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.463
each trying to promote its own interests.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:19.365
We think of the

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:19.832
world as

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.467
having been reasonably stable

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:22.802
for these last two decades

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:26.072
until Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.975
But that is not true of the Middle East,

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:30.109
where the last two decades

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.312
have been particularly bloody.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.447
Hundreds of thousands died in Iraq.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.649
Then came the Syrian civil war,

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:37.617
which displaced

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.719
more than 14 million people

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:40.486
and killed

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:42.855
still more hundreds of thousands.

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:45.024
That was followed by a war in Yemen,

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.626
which quickly became the worst

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.695
humanitarian crisis in the world.

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.297
And in all of these crises and conflicts,

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:53.533
regional players have picked sides

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.835
trying to maximize their advantages

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:58.104
and bleed their foes.

00:03:58.104 --> 00:03:59.973
We're seeing a worldwide contest

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:02.308
between the forces of order and disorder.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:05.511
Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.080
are trying to erode

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.348
the international system.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.116
If Hamas

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:12.385
succeeds, it will encourage others,

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:14.287
Hezbollah, the Houthis,

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:17.724
to flex their muscles as well.

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:20.059
Defeating Hamas is a daunting challenge.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.394
That terrorist group

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:21.995
is hoping

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.530
for a massive Israeli overreaction

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.199
that produces thousands

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.967
of civilian casualties

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:30.603
and bogs down Israeli troops.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.538
Hamas is also hoping for the collapse

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.907
of any possible deal with Saudi Arabia.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.644
The more brutal Israel's response,

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.012
the more likely it is

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:41.281
that that deal will collapse.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.416
Israel's goal should be to respond

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:44.651
to Hamas

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.386
deal with the Palestinian issue

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.453
in the way

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:48.621
that still allows

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:50.690
for the resumption of negotiations

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.059
on Saudi normalization.

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:55.228
That is the strategic prize.

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:57.830
The establishment of normal relations

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.299
between Israel and Saudi

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.268
Arabia would be the severest setback

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:04.771
for Hamas Hezbollah and Iran.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.107
One lesson is clear

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:10.076
the United States cannot walk away

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:11.978
from the Middle East entirely.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.414
It can forswear military interventions

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:15.782
and it can recognize

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:17.717
the centrality of Asia.

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.819
But it needs to remain politically

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.088
and diplomatically active in the region.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.324
American engagement

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.693
is a stabilizing force in the world.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.162
For those unconvinced.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:29.896
Look at

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:32.465
the emerging post-American Middle East

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:36.569
Go to CNN dot com slash Fareed for a link

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.338
