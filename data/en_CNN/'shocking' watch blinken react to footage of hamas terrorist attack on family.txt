♪♪ &gt;&gt;&gt; WE START WITH SECRETARY OF  STATE ANTONY BLINKEN'S POWERFUL  MESSAGE IN ISRAEL TODAY. HE WAS VISIBLY SHAKEN,  DESCRIBING MORE HORRIFIC IMAGES  THAT HE WAS JUST SHOWN BY  ISRAELIS. FROM THE BARBARIC HAMAS TERROR  ATTACK ON INNOCENT CIVILIAN  FAMILIES ON OCTOBER 7th. &gt;&gt; I SAW, FOR EXAMPLE, A FAMILY  ON A KIBBUTZ, A FATHER, TWO  YOUNG BOYS, MAYBE 10, 11 YEARS  OLD, GRABBING THEM, PULLING THEM OUT OF THEIR LIVING ROOM, GOING  THROUGH THEIR VERY SMALL  BACKYARD AND INTO A SHELTER,  FOLLOWED SECONDS LATER BY A  TERRORIST WHO THROWS A GRENADE  INTO THAT SMALL SHELTER. AND THEN AS THE FATHER COMES  STAGGERING OUT, SHOOTS HIM DOWN. AND THEN THE BOYS COME OUT AND  THEY RUN INTO -- INTO THEIR  HOUSE, AND THE CAMERA IN THE  HOUSE IS FILMING EVERYTHING, AND THEY'RE CRYING, WHERE IS DADDY,  ONE SAYS, THE OTHER SAYS, THEY  KILLED DADDY. WHERE IS MY MOMMY? AND THEN THE TERRORIST COMES IN  AND CASUALLY OPENS THE  REFRIGERATOR AND STARTS TO EAT  FROM IT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. AND IT IS STRIKING AND IN SOME  WAYS SHOCKING THAT THE BRUTALITY OF THE SLAUGHTER HAS RECEDED TO  QUICKLY IN THE MEMORIES OF SO  MANY. &gt;&gt; BLINKEN ALSO SPOKE OF YOUNG  PALESTINIAN CHILDREN PULLED FROM THE WRECKAGE OF BUILDINGS IN  GAZA. &gt;&gt; WHEN I LOOK INTO THEIR EYES  THROUGH THE TV SCREEN, I SEE MY  OWN CHILDREN. HOW CAN WE NOT? HAMAS DOESN'T CARE ONE SECOND OR ONE IOTA FOR THE WELFARE, FOR  THE WELL BEING OF THE  PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. IT CYNICALLY AND MONSTROUSLY  USING THEM AS HUMAN SHIELDS,  PUTTING COMMANDERS AND WEAPONS  AND AMMUNITION BENEATH  RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS, SCHOOLS,  MOSQUES, HOSPITALS. BUT CIVILIANS SHOULD NOT SUFFER  THE CONSEQUENCES FOR ITS INN  HUMANITARIAN AND ITS BRUTALITY.  &gt;&gt; AS YOU CAN HEAR THE EMOTION  IS PALPABLE, CALLING BLINKEN'S  TASK COMPLICATED IS ALMOST AN  INSULT TO THE DIFFICULTY OF THE  POLICY HURDLES AND TRYING TO  NAVIGATE THE NEAR IMPOSSIBLE  AMIDST A SEA OF ANGER AND  DESPAIR. CNN'S JEREMY DIAMOND IS JOINING  US FROM SDEROT INSIDISEL. JEREMY, THE VISIT IS NOT  STOPPING WHAT IS GOING ON ON THE GROUND THERE. JEREMY, I WANT TO TRY TO BRING  YOU IN NOW, I KNOW THERE IS A  LOT HAPPENING RIGHT WHERE YOU  ARE. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT  ARE LIVE PICTURES.  &gt;&gt; Reporter: CAN YOU HEAR ME,  DANA? &gt;&gt; YES, WE CAN HEAR YOU. TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.  &gt;&gt; Reporter: DANA, WE ARE ON A  STILL OVERLOOKING THE GAZA  STRIP. YOU HAVE A LOT OF MEDIA THAT ARE ACTUALLY SET UP. WE HAD A SIREN GO OFF JUST  MOMENTS AGO AND ACTUALLY THERE  WAS A HIT IT APPEARS ON A  VEHICLE NEARBY. WE ARE STANDING -- AGAIN, THERE  IS A LOT OF MEDIA HERE BECAUSE  THIS IS ONE OF THE OVERLOOK  POINTS TO LOOK INTO THE GAZA  STRIP AND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING --  LET'S JUST GET CLOSER TO SOME OF THE DAMAGE IF WE CAN HERE. YOU SEE THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PRESS, IT'S QUITE A SCRUM  HERE, BUT THIS CAR APPEARS TO  HAVE BEEN BLOWN OUT BY SOME KIND OF A ROCKET PERHAPS OR AN  INTERCEPTION, SHRAPNEL MAY HAVE  TALLER, BUT WHAT WE HEARD WAS A  VERY, VERY LOUD BOOM. IT APPEARED TO BE SOME KIND OF  AN IMPACT FALLING DIRECTLY ON  THIS VEHICLE OR NEAR IT. TRYING TO GET A BETTER LOOK,  DANA, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO  GET THE FACTS WRONG HERE. BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT OBVIOUSLY  THIS VEHICLE THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF DAMAGE TO IT AND WE HEARD A  VERY LOUD IMPACT. LET ME WALK AROUND THIS WAY WITH MY CAMERAMAN IF HE CAN FOLLOW ME HERE. WE HEARD A LOUD BOOM, WE HAVE  NOT SEEN ANY PIECES OF THE WOKT  AT THIS POINT. IT'S POSSIBLE THERE WAS SOME  KIND OF AN INTERCEPTION RIGHT  OVERHEAD AND SHRAPNEL MAY HAVE  FALLEN TO HIT THIS VEHICLE. IT'S VERY HARD TO TELL RIGHT  NOW, BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS ONE  OF THE REALITIES HERE. THE IRON DOME SYSTEM OBVIOUSLY  TAKES OUT THE OVERWE WILL MIPG  MAJORITY OF THOSE ROCKETS, BUT  SOME OF THEM DO GET THROUGH AND  IN SOME CASES YOU ALSO HAVE TO  BE AWARE OF THE SHRAPNEL THAT  MAY FALL DOWN. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS TURNING INTO A BIT OF A CIRCUS HERE SO I'M  GOING TO TAKE US CLOSER THIS  WAY. YOU CAN SEE THERE'S SOME DAMAGE  HERE AS WELL ON THIS VEHICLE,  WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO  SHRAPNEL FALLING. AND SO THIS IS THE REALITY OF  THE SITUATION HERE, DANA.  &gt;&gt; AND, JEREMY, UNDERSTANDING  THAT THIS JUST HAPPENED JUST  BEFORE YOU CAME ON AIR WITH US. I WANT YOU TO GO BACK TO AN  IMPORTANT POINT THAT YOU MADE  WHICH IS THAT YOU ARE IN ISRAEL, YOU ARE NEAR THE BORDER WITH  GAZA AND THE HAMAS -- THE  TERRORISTS IN HAMAS WHO STILL  HAVE THE ABILITY, THE  CAPABILITY, DESPITE THE  CIVILIANS NOT HAVING WATER OR  ELECTRICITY AND WHAT HAVE YOU,  CAPABILITY SOMEHOW TO SHOOT  MISSILES OR WHATEVER KIND OF  ATTACK THAT THEY'VE JUST TRIED  TO LAUNCH INSIDE ISRAEL.  &gt;&gt; Reporter: YEAH.  &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HAPPENED -- WHAT  HAPPENS REGULARLY -- SORRY,  JEREMY. WHAT HAPPENS REGULARLY IS  BECAUSE ISRAEL HAS WHAT'S CALLED THE IRON DOME AND THE ABILITY TO INTERCEPT WHAT COMES IN, IT  KEEPS -- FOR THE MOST PART IT  KEEPS ISRAEL SAFE, BUT IT'S NOT  FOOLPROOF AND THERE IS SHRAPNEL. &gt;&gt; Reporter: UNDERSTANDABLY. AND AS I SAID, WE AREN'T SURE  WHETHER THIS WAS A DIRECT HIT TO THIS VEHICLE. TO ME THIS SEEMS LIKE MOST  LIKELY SOME SHRAPNEL THAT HIT  THIS VEHICLE, JUST GIVEN THE  SCALE OF THE DAMAGE, BUT IT IS  HARD TO TELL. SOME OF THESE ROCKETS ARE  ACTUALLY NOT THAT -- DON'T HAVE  THAT MUCH EXPLOSIVE ON THEM,  SOME OF THESE ROCKETS THAT HAMAS USES, AND SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT  DIFFICULT TO TELL AT TIMES IF  IT'S SHRAPNEL OR A DIRECT HIT,  BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE HAD  SECONDS TO REACT HERE. WE HEARD THAT SIREN MAYBE, YOU  KNOW, THREE TO FIVE SECONDS  LATER WE HEARD A VERY, VERY LOUD BOOM COMING FROM RIGHT WHERE WE  ARE RIGHT NOW AND YOU CAN HEAR  SOME OF THE CAR ALARMS STILL  GOING OFF, BUT I DO WANT TO AS  WE TALK ABOUT THIS AND AS WE  TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE DAMAGE  THAT HAS HAPPENED HERE, WE  SHOULD ALSO KEEP IN MIND THE  DAMAGE THAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE  OF GAZA AS WELL WHERE ISRAELI  STRIKES, BOMBS, MISSILES  TARGETING HAMAS COMMAND CENTERS, MANY UNDERGROUND, BUT ALSO  TARGETING RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS  WHERE ISRAELI FORCES SAY THAT  HAMAS FIGHTERS HAVE EMBEDDED  THEMSELVES. IN GAZA THEY DON'T HAVE AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM, THEY DON'T HAVE  BOMB SHELTERS TO RUSH INTO AS WE WERE ABLE TO DO AND WE HAVE  WATCHED OF COURSE AS THE TOLL OF CASUALTIES IN GAZA HAS MOUNTED  QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THESE  LAST THREE AND A HALF WEEKS OF  WAR. I DO THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE KEEP IN MIND, ESPECIALLY AS  THERE'S QUITE A SCRUM OF MEDIA  HERE AND ONE OF THE REASONS  EVERYONE IS HERE IS BECAUSE,  AGAIN, THESE POSITIONS OVER HERE IS WHERE WE ARE POSTED TO KIND  OF WATCH THE ACTIVITY INSIDE THE GAZA STRIP. &gt;&gt; JEREMY, STAY SAFE, PLEASE. I KNOW YOU DON'T NEED ME TO TELL YOU THAT, BUT ALSO I JUST WANT  TO SAY THAT THIS IS HAPPENING  WHILE, AGAIN, AS I JUST PLAYED  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW,  THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE IS  THERE, IS IN THE
