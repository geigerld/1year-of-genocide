00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.700
Freed.

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.267
You're looking at a

00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:02.569
picture of American Jew

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:03.636
the tyrant on

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:05.071
and her 17 year old daughter

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.140
Natalie Raanan shortly

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.175
after they were released by Hama

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.378
But two from Chicago are in Isra

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.413
after being kidnaped 14 days ago

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.348
The IDF says they were being hel

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.684
in Hamas's network of tunnels

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.452
and according to the secretary o

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.187
Antony Blinken, a team from the 

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.689
embassy is here to meet with the

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:23.590
Now

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.792
for their family has been an uni

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:26.493
two weeks

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:29.529
of anguish and grief and hope an

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.931
The Iranians were visiting relat

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.500
at the kibbutz of Carlos,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.101
which is just a couple of miles

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.069
from Gaza.

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.570
It was attacked by Hamas.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.039
12 people reportedly killed

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.041
during that assault that we know

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:41.841
Earlier this week,

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.777
I spoke to Natalie's brother Ben

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.512
and he told me the terrifying st

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:46.413
of how his sister

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:47.714
and stepmother were taken

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:52.052
She communicated with

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.853
my father in Hebrew

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.423
that she was okay for the moment

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.059
She was locking herself

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:00.660
in the guest house,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.230
I believe, with my stepmother, J

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:06.399
They were hearing guns.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.801
They were hearing explosions,

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.202
and they were going to try and r

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:10.970
as quiet as possible.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.040
From there, once the Israeli arm

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:16.743
was able to take back the city,

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:20.513
there was a broken glass on the 

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.314
of the guest house.

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:24.584
And both Natalie and Judith were

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.485
at that point.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.390
So at that time, Ben told me

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.591
he was holding out hope,

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.258
holding out this

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:32.992
the hope that he would

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.561
again hug his sister.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.462
And that is something

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.630
that he is going to be able to d

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.265
You just have to smile to hear a

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.701
I mean, it is two people out of 

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:44.104
but it is two people alive and f

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:46.172
Natalie will turn 18 in four day

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.941
In just a moment, Ben will join 

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.542
live again.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:50.477
It was President Biden

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:52.745
who spoke with both of the women

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:53.446
Judith and Natalie

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.747
says he's overjoyed at the news.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.416
But of course, we're learning to

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.084
there are still ten Americans

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.519
unaccounted for.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.687
That is in addition

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:03.123
to the 201 people

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.657
being held by Hamas at this hour

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:05.391
According to the numbers,

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.993
the Israeli government has put o

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:07.427
And tonight,

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.962
we're learning more about them,

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.663
according to the Israeli Defense

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:11.998
Over 20 of them were children

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.766
under the age of 18.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:14.701
Want to speak to the father

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:15.969
of two of those later.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.071
Between ten and 20 of them are o

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.339
But the IDF believes

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.907
that the majority of them are al

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:21.741
in Gaza.

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:22.742
One family this morning

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:23.076
told me what

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:23.409
we don't know

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.612
if maturity means just over half

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.113
or almost all.

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.381
But that's the most information

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:29.415
the IDF has given out

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:30.750
is the word majority.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.585
But shortly after the runoff is 

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.120
Hamas released a statement

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.021
claiming they are working

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:35.755
with mediators

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:37.190
in Egypt, Qatar and other,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.791
quote, friendly countries

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.226
in order to release more foreign

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.061
national hostages.

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:42.929
We don't know very much

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:43.930
about their current conditions.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.699
We only know we have that one

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.301
supposed proof of life video.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.169
We don't know when that was

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.537
filmed of Mia Sham.

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:51.971
And we also now have the picture

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.072
of Judith and Natalie.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:55.642
We do know that any hostages in 

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:56.843
right now are being held captive

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.912
in a place facing a humanitarian

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.647
We have a lot to get to tonight.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:01.814
Nic Robertson is live along

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:03.383
the Israel-Gaza border. M.J.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:04.350
Lee is at the White House,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.486
and Clarissa Ward is live in Cai

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:07.587
Egypt tonight.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.289
Oren Liebermann is live at the P

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.491
with breaking news on that battl

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.760
Those missiles fired towards Isr

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:14.894
I want to start with Nic

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.629
Robertson, because, Nic, I know

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.598
there was a lot of activity wher

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:20.600
when the two hostages were relea

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.101
What exactly happened

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.906
Yeah, absolutely fascinating, Er

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.174
because throughout the day,

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:30.376
it had been really exceptionally

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.144
and quieter than it's

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:32.212
been for so many days.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.513
No missiles and rockets

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.582
coming out of Gaza, no missiles 

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.451
and not even any drones in the a

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.452
Really quiet.

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:40.920
And it gave the impression,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.188
just the impression

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.423
that something was happening

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:44.591
in the background today

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.426
that was different. We had no id

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:49.028
But just just as that news was c

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:50.463
that Natalie

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:51.631
and her mother, Judith,

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:52.999
were being released.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.700
Hamas

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.834
or one of the other groups

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:55.935
inside Gaza launched

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.870
a massive salvo of rockets

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.472
right at that time

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:00.974
headed towards central Israel.

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:03.910
The Iron Dome intercepted them

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.844
within an hour.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:05.745
They done it again,

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.313
fired multiple rockets

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:08.881
towards the center of Israel.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.750
They were intercepted again.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.352
And in that intervening hour,

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:13.052
they fired

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:16.489
five salvos into this area and s

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.359
That is way more than they fired

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.060
in an hour period

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.463
that we've seen over the past we

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.331
So kind of a significant

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:28.268
turn in action by by Hamas

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.502
or one of the other groups

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:31.271
right at that moment of release.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.972
Was it a signal that they just w

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:33.673
that they were ready

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:34.874
to continue to fight?

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:35.341
Or was it

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:35.742
a sign

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.610
that they've been able to use th

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.112
when they weren't under fire

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.446
and drone surveillance

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:42.749
and to set up some rockets?

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.450
It's not clear,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.418
but that was such

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:47.020
a dramatic change of events

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.022
right at that moment of release.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:51.357
The Israelis returned with

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:53.059
some artillery strikes,

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.027
so missile strikes.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:55.361
But again, now

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.396
back to that

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:59.232
or of sort of quieter than it ha

00:04:59.465 --> 00:04:59.799
Erin,

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.604
All right, Nic, thank you very m

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:05.471
And I want to go to M.J.

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:06.406
Lee at the White House,

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.074
because, M.J., we were

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:08.641
we were saying

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.176
Biden has spoken now

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:12.245
to both Judith and Natalie.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:12.979
What more

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.681
have you learned from your sourc

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:15.782
about how this happened

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:18.718
from the American side and what'

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:20.053
Yeah, Aaron,

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:22.055
the White House says that Presid

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:23.089
had this message

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.590
to convey to the two women

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.392
when he spoke with them earlier

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:27.293
that the two women

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:28.861
would have the full support

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:29.929
of the US government

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.031
as they recover from what he sai

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:34.033
was this terrible ordeal.

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:34.967
And there's no question

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:36.903
that this is a moment of triumph

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:37.837
for this president,

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.872
who had said that as president

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.941
there was no higher priority for

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:43.209
than securing the release

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.477
of these American hostages.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:45.812
But there is no question

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.013
that the work is not over.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:47.914
Secretary of State

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:49.749
Antony Blinken saying tonight

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:50.683
that there are at least

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:51.751
ten Americans

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:52.985
unaccounted for

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:53.953
and that some of them

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:55.755
are being held hostage.

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:57.190
He couldn't say anything

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.491
about the condition

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.059
of those American hostages.

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:01.828
But Aaron, it is very, very clea

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:02.261
that U.S.

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:03.930
officials worked closely

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.531
with their Israeli counterparts

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.500
to gather any intelligence

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.401
that they could

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:10.036
about these American hostages.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.871
We know that it was the Israelis

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.206
that told us officials

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.207
that some Americans

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.175
were believed to be alive.

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:17.710
We also know that there was clos

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.012
coordination with Qatar,

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.047
both President

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.282
Biden and Secretary Blinken sayi

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:25.852
thank you to their Qatari counte

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:27.954
after the release of these two w

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:28.955
But, Aaron,

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:30.523
it just worth underscoring that

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:32.158
given the sensitivities

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:33.826
and given the ongoing efforts

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.895
to try to try to secure the rele

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.663
of more hostages, U.S.

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.866
officials right now are very loa

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:41.968
to share any detailed informatio

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.336
about how exactly

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:45.638
Judith and Natalie Ronan's

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:47.940
release was able to be secured

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:52.412
All right, M.J., thank you very 

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:53.546
And Natalie's brother, Judy,

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:54.981
his stepson, Ben

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:56.482
Raanan, is OUTFRONT now

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:58.284
and he is speaking for the famil

00:06:58.284 --> 00:06:59.252
tonight.

00:06:59.385 --> 00:06:59.819
So, Ben,

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:00.953
we talked days ago

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:02.622
and you know,

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:03.823
you're talking about your sister

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:04.824
and how she wanted.

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:05.491
She loved art.

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:06.492
And she

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:07.193
you know, she

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:09.996
she wants to be a tattoo artist 

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:10.763
And you were praying

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.732
you have the chance to hug her a

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.000
and wow, what a night.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.601
I mean, how did you find out you

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.904
and your stepmother were freed

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.507
I found out from the news

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.576
this all moved so quickly

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:27.547
that I was getting texts from re

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:29.882
I met with

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:32.785
saying this happened and I belie

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:34.086
because the government

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:35.555
didn't want to call us

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:37.156
before it had been confirmed.

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:41.093
And it was just a surreal thing.

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:44.230
I was taking the first 2 hours o

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.699
before I jumped on all of these 

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.000
that I've been doing for Natalie

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.801
just for myself.

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.069
And I was playing a video game,

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:51.204
and all of a sudden,

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:52.171
I'm getting all these texts

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:54.507
that, you know, they're coming b

00:07:57.677 --> 00:07:58.611
Oh, my gosh.

00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:00.680
That is incredible to find out t

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:01.747
And I think, Ben,

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:03.182
it just makes everyone realize t

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:04.750
they had no idea of what happene

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.218
or just, as you

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:08.421
said, comes together at the last

00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:09.789
When you see the picture

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:11.090
that just the one picture that w

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.591
of Natalie

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:12.091
and Judith

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:12.658
and obviously

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:15.461
you know them better than anyone

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:18.030
What do you see when you look at

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:20.633
To be honest, I'm

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:21.400
super annoyed

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.702
because how does my sister,

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:24.237
after two weeks as a hostage,

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:26.138
still look like a supermodel?

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:27.740
It's exhausting.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.475
And meanwhile, she does, by the 

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:31.410
She does, by the way.

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:33.012
It's absurd.

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:34.080
You know,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.614
my father

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:36.249
got a chance to talk with Natali

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:37.517
and I know Judith's family

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.819
got a chance to talk with Judith

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.320
at least from my father.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.623
Natalie is doing well.

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:46.425
Is composed.

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:47.960
And as I said to you

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.395
a couple of days ago,

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:52.365
we are ready to start this incre

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:52.965
journey

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:56.769
of healing and trauma relief for

00:08:56.769 --> 00:08:58.004
And, you know,

00:08:58.004 --> 00:08:59.672
she has a full support

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:01.007
of friends and family.

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:03.242
And you know what I've realized

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:06.045
is strangers who care about her,

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:09.115
who want her to succeed at whate

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:09.882
she wants to do

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.417
to

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:13.486
you.

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:16.022
Do you have any idea, Ben, at th

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:17.089
I mean, I

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:18.391
I'm sure you don't technically k

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.126
but I mean, do you have any even

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:21.460
or have you thought to yourself

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.428
about why

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:23.195
it is that Natalie

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:25.431
and Judith were released first?

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:27.099
Why them not anyone else yet?

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:27.333
I mean,

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:28.267
do you have any sense

00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:30.369
as to how that's the case?

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:33.673
I don't know.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.576
You know, what I do know is that

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:37.577
you know what I told you

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.311
a couple of days ago,

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.279
that they're not politicians.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:43.716
They're not people with intense 

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:46.319
about Gaza, Palestine,

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:48.821
Israel.

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:49.288
You know,

00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:51.691
they are Israelis and they are l

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:52.892
and they are people lovers.

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:54.760
And so I truly believe

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.762
it was something to do with that

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:59.131
And it's important

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.100
for me to also

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.669
say that that there are people h

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:05.304
who are hostages

00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:07.173
that didn't get the same beautif

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:10.743
that that my family got today.

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:12.378
And there are families

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:15.348
all over in Gaza and in Israel

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.550
that are experiencing a loss tha

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.352
I can't even imagine.

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:22.054
And I just you know, my family j

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.392
No, no, I know

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:27.593
I can only imagine

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:28.561
there's a sense of guilt, too.

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.062
I was talking to a father who's

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:30.663
still missing

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:32.164
his little girls, two and four.

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:34.400
And I asked him how he felt

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.134
about this news.

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:36.268
And he said,

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:38.638
I just miss my children so much.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.406
But of course, I'm so glad for y

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:41.440
Right? I mean. Right.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.842
But there's this

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:43.542
right

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.111
there's a deep sense of grief

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:46.679
still for so many.

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:47.880
Do you know when when you're

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.248
when you'll be able to speak wit

00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:53.719
I we have heard

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:56.922
tentatively she might be coming 

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.526
Chicago sometime early next week

00:11:00.893 --> 00:11:03.996
But that's all dependent, obviou

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:08.968
on what the hospitals say and ma

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:11.437
that their physical well-being a

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:13.139
their mental health

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:13.706
well-being

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:14.273
is at least

00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:18.044
okay for them to come here and s

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:18.911
next stage.
