00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.900
IDF spokesman,

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.736
Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conr

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.771
joins us now from Tel Aviv.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:05.739
Colonel, thanks very much.

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:06.873
I want to ask you about

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.675
what's taking place right now

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.043
with the Al-Shifa Hospital

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.745
What can you tell us about

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.747
what's being done to make sure

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.048
some of these innocent

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.316
civilians can get out of there,

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:17.984
the babies that have been talked

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.052
and so on?

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.420
What is going on there

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.221
with this hospital?

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:22.489
What can you share?

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:24.090
Hi, Jim.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.191
Thank you for having me.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.561
We are on day 36 of the war

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:30.530
and 239

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.898
Israeli hostages are still

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:33.433
being held in Gaza.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.801
Regarding the hospital,

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:38.004
we are in contact with local aut

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.974
in Gaza with the manager and oth

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:42.575
and assisting them

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.477
and then informing them

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.312
where they can go in order

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.381
to evacuate from the area.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.850
And we are also trying to coordi

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.486
the safe removal and transport

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.488
of the remaining patients

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.390
that are still inside the hospit

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.725
I want to emphasize,

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.660
we haven't struck the hospital

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.327
and we are not

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:03.630
surrounding it or

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.765
applying any pressure on it.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.101
We have troops in the vicinity,

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:09.769
but we have not been engaging

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:11.871
with the hospital or any parts o

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.507
And so I guess

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.009
maybe you can help us clear this

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.244
Why is it that the health minist

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.546
claims that the hospital

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.714
is completely surrounded?

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.951
We've also heard from a spokespe

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:25.985
from the Israeli military,

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:26.252
I guess

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.287
one of your counterparts

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.021
at a wing of that

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.189
hospital is still open

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.424
for people to safely evacuate.

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:32.959
Help us sort that out.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.227
What's going on?

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:35.728
Yeah, indeed.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:36.696
That is what we've told

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:37.430
the Palestinians

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.500
as well, that the Eastern wing i

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.837
and that all of the people that 

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.505
there, the displaced persons

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:47.107
that have been seeking shelter,

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.241
as well as others

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:51.010
who are in the compound, can mov

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.245
And we have instructed them,

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.180
even by the names of streets

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.282
and locations where they should 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.684
When we will do

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.853
the next humanitarian window.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.488
As you know, we've been doing th

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.556
for the last five days

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:06.159
in various locations in the Gaza

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.461
where we've been stopping our fi

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.696
calling Palestinians

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.331
and telling them to evacuate.

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:13.600
The main road is

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.135
Salahadin, the main

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.536
thoroughfare of the Gaza Strip,

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.505
but then also Al-Rashid Street,

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:19.606
the coastal road.

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:21.174
We've opened that up as well

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:24.511
during select hours of the day, 

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:25.745
hours,

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:28.181
which allows Palestinians to mov

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.916
and to go to relative safety

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:30.583
in the south.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:33.086
Again, under our commitment

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.754
not to strike civilians

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:36.122
and out of respect

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.590
for the sanctity of human life,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.858
which is much more than

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:41.261
what Hamas is doing at this time

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.629
And so what can you tell us

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.696
about these reports

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:44.731
that we're seeing about tanks

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.965
surrounding the hospital?

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.167
Is that happening?

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.002
And are you conducting an operat

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:49.802
in that area?

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.504
I know you said in the past,

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.606
Colonel, that you don't target h

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:54.574
and that sort of thing.

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:55.942
But you've also said

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:56.609
and others have said

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.410
with the IDF

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.411
that sometimes

00:02:58.411 --> 00:02:59.045
the hospitals

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:01.080
and these kinds of civilian faci

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.417
are used by Hamas for their oper

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:05.818
And so is there an operation?

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:07.487
Is there an IDF operation

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.789
going on in that area to find th

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:12.058
and around that facility, that h

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.762
Yeah, our troops are definitely 

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:16.496
We have

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.231
troops that have approached

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.633
that area from various locations

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:21.701
We have to understand that

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.402
the viewers

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.003
who may not have been following

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.672
are just joining

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.473
that the Shifa

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.576
compound is indeed in hospital,

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.778
but underneath are layers

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:34.581
and layers of Hamas military act

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.182
that they have established

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:37.850
underneath the hospital

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.786
whereby they are using the hospi

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:42.121
for military needs, which is a w

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:43.923
It's against the Geneva Conventi

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:47.694
They are endangering the protect

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:49.596
of the hospital by doing so.

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:50.863
And what we have done,

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:52.065
first and foremost,

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.467
is to inform the Palestinians

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.636
and also the world that we know

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.938
that Hamas is using the hospital

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:00.039
for military purposes.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.873
We know that it is

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:03.309
full of Hamas combatants

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.078
that are seeking shelter

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.413
and trying to hide away from our

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:09.182
underneath the hospital.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:10.750
That is also one of the reasons

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.852
why we are trying to evacuate it

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:14.721
because we don't want Hamas

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.990
to continue to use these people 

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.424
human shields in the future.

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:21.728
I mean, that sounds like

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:22.895
a very difficult

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.297
and complicated operation

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:25.331
that you're trying to undertake.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:25.865
Then

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.635
what happens to the hospital

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:31.304
at the end of all of this is doe

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:33.506
the IDF seek to control it, take

00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:36.376
I mean, if you have to get at Ha

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.078
terrorists who are hiding inside

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:42.815
tunnels underneath the hospital,

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:43.549
one would think

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:44.150
at some point

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.551
you have to take over the hospit

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:46.619
or take over the area

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.654
around that hospital.

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:48.621
Is that something that you're

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:50.189
seeking to do?

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:53.326
Well, I agree with you totally t

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.228
it is a very complex situation

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:56.562
and one that we would rather

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.264
not find ourselves in.

00:04:58.264 --> 00:04:59.399
But ever since October

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.966
the seventh,

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.367
we are in this situation

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:03.503
where we have to fight inside Ga

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.605
and we have to strike Hamas

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:07.173
wherever there are hiding

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.475
underneath civilians in the tunn

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:11.377
and also underneath hospitals.

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:14.947
And our aim is to dismantle all 

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:16.482
military infrastructure

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.884
and Hamas has embedded

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.952
a significant portion

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:21.621
of their military capability,

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:23.890
specifically under Shifa.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.591
And it is our aim to dismantle

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.593
all of their military capabiliti

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:29.762
I cannot go into further details

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:32.098
about what, when and where will 

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:33.766
I can say that it would be best

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.034
for everybody involved,

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:35.868
including those

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.470
who will need the hospital

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.639
the day after the war, for Hamas

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.407
to come out of their hiding

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:42.842
and stop abusing

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:43.976
civilian infrastructure

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.411
for military purposes.

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:46.746
If they don't, of course,

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.848
we will have to respond accordin

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.416
implement our military plans.

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.453
And Colonel, I'm sure you saw th

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.587
that the secretary of state,

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:55.588
Tony Blinken,

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:56.055
of course, he's

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.457
a part of the Biden administrati

00:05:57.457 --> 00:05:59.258
and they've been very supportive

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:00.360
of the Israeli

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.494
government, of the IDF

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:02.261
throughout all of this.

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.263
But the secretary of state did s

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:05.631
in the last day

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.800
or so that there have been too m

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.736
Palestinians killed in the

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:12.205
Israeli operation in Gaza.

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:16.008
What's the response to that?

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:17.844
Well, I agree that there are man

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:18.778
that have been killed,

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:20.213
and I am

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.614
sad about civilians

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:23.750
that have nothing to do with fig

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.151
who are killed

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.186
or wounded or displaced by fight

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.554
That is not our goal.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:30.423
And I think that the Israeli gov

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:31.190
and the military

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.458
has been very

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:33.693
clear and forthcoming

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:34.827
that we are not fighting

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:35.928
against the civilians.

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.830
We try to do everything

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.364
we can

00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:40.166
to get them out of the battlefie

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.468
so that we can focus on fighting

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.837
And I think that the government

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:45.638
and the military

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:46.406
and we are talking,

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.607
you know, at the military level,

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:48.474
we are communicating

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.076
with our military counterparts.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.511
We're not only telling them

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:52.145
what we're doing,

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:54.414
we're showing them what we are d

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.316
and what Hamas is doing, their v

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.218
and how they are using the civil

00:06:59.218 --> 00:06:59.952
as human shields.

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:01.888
And we are showing what we are d

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:04.023
the measures that we are impleme

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:06.659
in order to minimize the damage

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.027
to civilians.

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:10.196
I definitely hope that, you know

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:11.964
these numbers can come down

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:13.199
and what we are

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.600
achieving is basically

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.435
we're emptying

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.171
northern Gaza of civilians tempo

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:19.405
Exactly.

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:21.474
In order to minimize and lower

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.042
the amount of civilian casualtie

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:23.843
that is our aim,

00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:26.579
because we seek that operational

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:28.848
to be able to go after Hamas.

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:31.050
And Hamas is under pressure.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.385
You know, they're under pressure

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:33.152
They're indicating

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:33.986
that they're under pressure.

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:35.521
There have been reports of them

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.423
shooting at evacuees

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:37.790
and all

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.992
kinds of efforts by Hamas

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:43.062
to stop evacuations in various l

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:43.629
We understand

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:44.430
that they're under pressure

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.665
because they want

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.400
these civilian casualties

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.502
occurring to that point

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.337
because of the difficulty

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:52.839
and dealing with

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.040
these humanitarian pauses

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.841
and opening them up

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:57.310
and opening up these corridors a

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.644
The president of the United Stat

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.246
President Biden, did say in

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.380
just the last couple of days

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.148
that he thinks that

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.350
these pauses need to be longer.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.185
Are you open to that longer paus

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:08.321
Yeah.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.156
You know, already on the ground,

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.057
these pauses,

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:13.226
they have an effect on our comba

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:16.062
rhythm and the ability

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:17.163
to conduct our missions

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:17.897
because you know,

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:20.199
when you apply pressure on your 

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.435
you want that pressure to be rel

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:24.370
And the fact that we stopped

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.072
during many hours of the day

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:28.875
has a price for us, a combat pri

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.110
it what we already have done.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.613
Also responding to those request

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:35.781
and statements made by the presi

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:37.650
and others is to add hours

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.585
It started with 4 hours

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:40.753
and now it's five.

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:42.788
Maybe it will be expanded more.

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:45.057
We added another round. Right.

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:46.592
It was only the central route.

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:46.859
And now

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:47.660
we've opened up

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.561
a northern route

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.662
as well along the coast,

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:51.464
Al-Rasheed Street,

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:53.666
in addition to Salahadin.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.268
So we are definitely listening.

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:56.102
We're definitely

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:57.970
trying to find good ways

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.772
of evacuating civilians

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:01.641
to minimize the effect on them

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:04.410
while still doing what we need t

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.311
And this is important.

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:06.646
We're not in Gaza

00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:08.414
for the or the amusement of it.

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:08.981
We are there

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:10.683
because we are fighting Hamas.

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:12.785
They need to be dismantled.

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:14.921
Otherwise we won't be able to li

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:15.922
in southern Israel.

00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:18.758
And we need to get our hostages 

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:20.326
And I understand that.

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:22.862
And but you brought up hostages.

00:09:22.862 --> 00:09:25.164
One of the items that has been d

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:26.566
in all of this is

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:27.099
and you're

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:27.967
probably aware of this,

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:29.101
there are multiple parties

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:30.736
involved in these kinds of talks

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:31.404
that the longer

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.406
the humanitarian pause is potent

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:34.540
that could lead

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.309
to the release of hostages.

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:37.376
There have been negotiations

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:38.778
going on to that end.

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:39.812
Are you open to that

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:42.114
Yeah, I'm

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:43.015
not entirely sure

00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:44.250
that that

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.052
is the correct working assumptio

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:48.187
I think that what Hamas is tryin

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:49.989
both its internal leadership

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:51.123
and its

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:53.225
overseas or external leadership,

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:55.761
they're basically trying to play

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:58.130
and they're trying to force

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.132
Israel through international pre

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:01.701
while using the hostages,

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:02.969
the poor, women,

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:05.071
children, babies and elderly peo

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:06.305
that they've been holding

00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:08.574
for more than 36 days.

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:10.443
They're using them as leverage

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:10.876
in order

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:13.980
to get the IDF to back off and r

00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:15.848
in our military pressure.

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:17.950
And I think that Israel has been

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.453
there won't be any kind of cease

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.555
before we get hostages back.

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:24.190
Talking can be done.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.257
That's all fine.

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:26.826
But there needs to be continuous

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:28.027
pressure on Hamas.

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:30.162
That is the only thing that is e

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:31.230
And by the way,

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.665
maneuvering on the ground,

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:34.634
creating that kind of friction

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:35.835
on the ground between us

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.003
and enemy forces,

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:38.170
creates intelligence

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.639
and creates other opportunities

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:40.473
that hopefully

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.941
we will be able to leverage in

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:43.209
order to get our people home.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.677
Okay.

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:45.511
Lieutenant Colonel

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:46.946
Jonathan Conricus, thank you

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:47.847
once again for your time.

00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:48.781
We appreciate it this evening.

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:50.049
Thank you. Thank you for having
