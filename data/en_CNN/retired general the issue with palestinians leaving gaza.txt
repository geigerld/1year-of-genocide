Hundreds of thousands of reservists are now gathering at the border with Gaza six days after the Hamas terror attacks on Israel. The White House now says 27 Americans were killed. 14 remain unaccounted for. Joining us now to discuss is retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Peter Zwack. General Zwack thank you so much for being with us. The White House has made it clear that recovering Americans being held hostage by Hamas is a key priority. How do you see that playing out? Well, it's it's it's it's extraordinarily complicated because it's likely that that most of those Americans or a percentage of them are also Israeli citizens and they're intermingled with the other hostages from a number of countries. So my instinct is that we need to fall in and support the Israelis while they do the lead effort to work those hostages out. I don't think that it's right for a negotiator. And they can try. But after what Hamas has done, I don't think anybody's in the mood for that. But the problem is, is that what will happen if Hamas, as they've shown extraordinary, ruthless already. They're already so deep into the into this that, you know, they can perpetuate it. What do they do, for example, to start pulling hostages out and shooting them if they're not getting their demands met? And at that point, at what point do you go in with major forces or Israeli special operations or combined special ops? I don't know. It's devilishly complicated. I believe there's a lot of midnight oil being burned in capitals. And but what this does do is it it just continues to show the depravity of Hamas. And I think a key angle is to try to, as much as possible, separate Hamas in Gaza from the Palestinian civilians, that they're caught in the middle of this and are also hostage to this awful situation. I want to expand on that point. General, is there any potential for humanitarian corridors, ways for those civilians to get out of harm's way? What would your advice be? Well, my advice would be and I'm so far away from this, would be you're all you've got. You know, I know we're talking to the Egyptians and other nations all. There would be a hard mission as well, because how do you manage the flow? There will be also a major effort to make sure that that the any any type of outflow. Where do the refugees go? Egypt, I don't think is ready to take on thousands or hundreds of thousands of of displaced persons. This is really hard. And I know in the whole this discussion about sending food and aid up through those corridors makes eminent sense. But do they? But does it get to the Palestinians who desperately needed in in the in the city, or does it go into feed to feed the Hamas and and continue? I'll make one other point about Hamas. How how ruthless and how they purport to be supporting the Palestinian, the fact that even now they're firing rockets out of built up hell out of built up Gaza shows they have no disregard. They have they have total disregard for the for the Palestinian citizens who they are using for cover. And that should be, I don't know, through leaflets or narrative, get out to the populations who to that Palestinian population. That is key in all of this. Million a couple million of them. Brigadier General Peter Zwack, very much appreciate your time, sir. Thanks for joining us. Thank you for having me.
