00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.800
Now we're going to bring

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.302
in the retired major general

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:03.837
and former head of Israeli

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.872
military intelligence, Amos Yadlin.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:08.308
He's also joining us from Tel Aviv.

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.676
Welcome to the program.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.911
You heard what I was asking

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.613
the IDF spokesperson.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:16.583
And obviously it's very, very tough

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.052
to figure out how to avenge this

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.053
mass murder

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.122
while also, as he says,

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.957
respecting the laws of war.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:25.492
And also, as President

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:26.559
Biden has said, that

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.995
that must happen in all your EU and U.N.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.964
supporters as well.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.265
So what do you think

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.734
Amos Yadlin might happen

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.203
in the coming up as this

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.139
massacres are avenged

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.174
When the defense minister, Yoav Gallant,

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.710
says they've removed all restraints

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.245
from their soldiers,

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.982
what what do you think that might mean

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:52.085
And, you know,

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.186
we have to remember

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:57.624
what happened on Saturday, more than 1200

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:02.162
Israeli citizens were killed brutally

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.432
by the terror organization called Hamas.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.634
And, by the way,

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.703
by citizens from Gaza that follows them.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.439
It was a poor dawn.

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:14.741
People were killed

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.977
in families, children, women,

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.014
and women were raped.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.783
People were killed.

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.186
Babies were beheaded.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.320
This is something

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.689
that you should not put behind you.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.659
It's very much like September 11,

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.362
and it's very much like your war on ISIS.

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.332
And when the U.S.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.334
attack Mosul or Vacca,

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.672
is there will some collateral damage.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.806
And this is

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:49.242
what is going to happen to Gaza,

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:52.112
because Israel that helped

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.646
the people of Gaza

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:56.049
by letting them come to work in Israel

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.918
by letting them have the capacity money

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.855
were misled by

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.459
unbelievable brutal

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:08.995
government of Hamas.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:10.563
And this government of Hamas

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:11.931
is going to pay

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:14.801
the way the Nazis paid in Europe.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:16.636
The way I speak to them,

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.838
they're tied up, paid

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:21.474
when they attacked Americans.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.943
So it weakens the rules of the game.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.313
However, we will continue to fight

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:30.016
according to the international law,

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:31.918
as American forces,

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.119
if both according

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.621
to the international law

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.889
and the lesson of law,

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:36.923
we say

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.958
if you want to win the war,

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.994
you have to target your your enemy.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.897
And there is the proportionality

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:46.799
and proportionality principle

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.602
that allow that

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:52.272
some collateral damage will be there

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.673
to achieve

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.743
that objective of winning the war.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:59.145
And we are in war.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:02:59.779
I know that.

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:00.046
And I

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.048
now want to ask you from your perspective

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:02.482
and from what

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.050
you know from your position

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.085
what is the actual objective?

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.755
I don't know whether an actual objective

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.224
has been announced by the prime minister,

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.458
other than,

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:12.992
you know,

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.727
obviously avenging what happened

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:17.730
and also decimating and changing

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.000
the rules of the game, decimating Hamas.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.869
And as one IDF spokesman said today,

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.170
changing the rules of the day.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.072
What exactly does that mean?

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:27.207
Does that mean,

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:28.174
you know, fighting

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:30.643
until there's no longer Hamas in charge

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:34.047
or anywhere able to exert any authority

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:34.647
in Gaza

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:37.383
Yeah.

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.252
Changing the paradigm.

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:42.455
The paradigm was we can live with Hamas.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:45.091
It is a determined organization.

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:46.593
It's a

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:49.495
we may need to have a mini wall

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:51.531
around every four or five years,

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.434
but they will not go to a full scale war.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.270
This paradigm was wrong.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.137
We allowed them

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:01.674
to build up a military that threaten

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:05.612
Israel and destroy a

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:09.048
the whole region of Western the Negev.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.317
This is not going to happen again.

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:15.622
So to your question, there is a objective

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:19.759
is to reduce Hamas, get the ability

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.494
to threaten Israel

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:24.030
to the minimum possible.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.465
And this means

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.567
destroying their military power

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:30.436
and destroying the government's power.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.039
So does that mean I won't. Yadlin.

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.140
Does that mean

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.441
does that mean that Israel.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.843
Then what? Then what happens?

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:38.044
Does Israel is Israel

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:41.748
also counting in the possibility of

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:45.018
of going back in and ruling what happens

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:45.918
when that happens?

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:48.955
We will do

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.324
what is needed at that time.

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:55.928
We are still in the process of cleaning,

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:59.299
which the Negev will Hamas militants

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.870
and restore their defense.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.372
But in the same time,

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:09.008
the Israeli Air Force is conducting

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:12.345
a very aggressive air bombing campaign

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:15.014
against any targets

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:17.183
that belongs to Hamas in Gaza.

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:19.152
And unlike the past,

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.187
we are not giving a specific warning.

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:23.990
In the past, we used to pick the phone

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:27.160
and call the police and send them please

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.163
evacuate your apartment.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.198
Not anymore.

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:34.500
Anything that connected to Hamas,

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.237
a command post intelligence

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:43.142
for logistic production will be targeted

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:47.413
all over Gaza until we will reduce

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.416
the capability to threaten Israel.

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:53.286
Close to zero. Close to zero.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.455
And I must tell you another thing.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:56.823
We are living in the Middle East

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.257
as we.

00:05:58.257 --> 00:05:59.325
So

00:05:59.359 --> 00:05:59.792
when you

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.894
are weak and your enemy taking over.

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.797
It's a full blown

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:07.266
we need to show

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:09.969
to demonstrate to other enemies

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.840
like Hezbollah, like Syria, like Iran,

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.910
that anybody who is dreaming about

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:21.381
a duplicating what Hamas has done

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:23.583
will suffer some things

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.618
that they haven't dream about.

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:27.754
And Gaza is a way

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:30.623
to rebuild our deterrence.

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:35.061
So it's going to be very very aggressive

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:35.962
campaign.

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:38.364
I hear you loud and clear,

00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:38.865
and I guess

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:40.099
everybody will be hearing you.

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.634
So I guess I want to ask you,

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:42.902
you're saying very clearly

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.704
to rebuild the deterrence

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.706
because I'm assuming you agree

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.941
what happened on Saturday knocked

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:53.446
the superiority of Israel on its head.

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.148
I mean, the idea that the military,

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:57.083
the intelligence, everybody was caught

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:00.319
so much by surprise, destroyed the

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.654
the decades

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:04.123
old myth of Israel's superiority.

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:06.592
I assume that's what you're saying.

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:07.994
And you need to regain that.

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:09.662
But how do you imagine

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:10.563
as head of former head

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:11.931
of military intelligence

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.666
that that happened in the first place?

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:18.905
I tell you again,

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:19.439
there will

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.176
be a real campaign against any target

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.711
belong to Hamas in August

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:28.047
and there are thousands of.

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:30.583
And then and then don't rule out

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.520
a military move on the globe.

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:38.524
Because I'm a big believer in airpower.

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:41.093
I'm a fighter pilot in my bedroom.

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:44.130
But there are places and missions

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:46.499
that cannot be done from there.

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:49.068
So I don't rule out the

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:51.537
in a

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.807
ground operation that once again

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:55.541
will go

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:58.978
to every place that we know that Hamas,

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:01.547
especially the leader,

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:04.851
that all the leaders, that all the air

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.018
they attack,

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:07.353
they will not be in Gaza

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:08.554
at the end of the day.

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.790
They will not be in the

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.025
most. Yadlin.

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:15.595
And I want to continue.

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:16.496
I

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:20.733
you to the north,

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:21.901
because what is happening

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.603
in Gaza may affect the north,

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:25.538
but we can speak about it tomorrow.

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:26.005
Yes.

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:27.840
We are keeping an eye on it, by the way.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.942
And we did ask the IDF spokesman and.

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:32.845
And thank you very much indeed for your

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:33.880
for being with us tonight.
