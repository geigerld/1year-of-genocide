WELCOME TO CNN THIS MORNING. IF I'M POPPY HARLOW WITH PHIL HARDING. WE ARE LIVE IN TEL AVIV WHERE A HOSTAGE RELEASED BY HAMAS YESTERDAY IS NOW SPEAKING. SHE'S TELLING HER STORY. THIS MORNING, AT THE HOSPITAL, 85-YEAR-OLD YOCHEVED LIFSHITZ TOLD REPORTERS HOW SHE WAS ABDUCTED AND HELD CAPTIVE UNDERGROUND FOR WEEKS. &gt;&gt; THE GRANDMOTHER SAYS FOUR OF HAMAS FIGHTERS STORMED HER KIBBUTZ DURING THE MASSACRE AND TOOK HER WAY ON A MOTORBIKE AND BEAT HER WITH SIX. SHE SAYS THEY TOOK RENT HAMAS'S UNDERGROUND TUNNEL NETWORK AND HELD HER WITH FOUR OTHER HOSTAGES. THEY HAD GUARDS, A DOCTOR, AND A PARAMEDIC WHO TOOK CARE OF THEM, GAVE THE MEDICINE. SHE SAYS HAMAS HAD A STOCKPILE OF SHAMPOO AND OTHER TOILETRIES FOR HOSTAGES TO USE. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE HUGE NETWORK OF TUNNELS UNDERNEATH. IT LOOKS LIKE A SPIDER WEB. WHEN SHE FIRST ARRIVED, THEY TOLD HIM THAT THERE ARE MUSLIMS, AND THEY ARE NOT GONNA HURT THEM. AND THAT THEY ATE THE SAME FOOD THAT THE HAMAS WAS EATING. &gt;&gt; HAMAS HAS NOW RELEASED FOUR HOSTAGES AS ISRAELI TROOPS GEAR UP TO LAUNCH AN ASSAULT THEY SAY ON GAZA BY GROUND, SEE, AND AIR. ISRAELI MILITARY SIT STRUCK MORE THAN 400 TARGETS ACROSS GAZA IN THE PAST DAY, KILLING HAMAS COMMANDERS AND FIGHTERS. THIS AS MORE THAN 200 HOSTAGES ARE STILL BELIEVED TO BE HELD BY HAMAS INSIDE GAZA, AND WE'VE LEARNED THAT INCLUDES 30 CHILDREN. LET'S GO TO ERIN BURNETT. SHE JOINS US LIVE IN THIS HOUR IN TEL AVIV. AARON, HEARING FROM HER, ALL OF THOSE DETAILS, INCLUDING, BY THE WAY SOME CRITICISM OF THE IDF AND LACK OF PREPAREDNESS, WAS REMARKABLE THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; IT WAS REMARKABLE. SHE DIDN'T HAVE CRITICISM FOR THE IDF, YOU KNOW HOW THEY OBVIOUSLY WERE NOT THERE. YOU KNOW, ALSO, POPPY, SOMETHING STOOD OUT IN THE MUNDANE NECESSITY. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TUNNELS. WE KNOW THESE TUNNELS HAVE VENTILATION. WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE AIR CONDITIONING. THIS IS ALL BEEN REPORTING THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ISRAELIS OVER THE YEARS. BUT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SAYING SHE WAS HELD UNDERGROUND FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS, THAT THERE WAS SHAMPOO, THERE WAS ANTIBIOTICS, THERE WAS A GUARD PER HOSTAGE IN THE EXPERIENCE SHE HAD. THAT THERE WERE MEDICS AND PARAMEDICS AND OBVIOUSLY SHE IS ELDERLY. THE OTHER WOMAN WHO WAS RELEASED ALSO ELDERLY AND HAD MEDICAL NEEDS, AND THEN THEY HAD THE MEDICINE NEEDED, AND IF, NOT SOMETHING SIMILAR TO REPLACE IT. IT IS PRETTY STUNNING. BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO CONTRAST THAT WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING ABOVE THE GROUND, RIGHT, WHERE THERE IS NOT WATER, NEVER MIND SHAMPOO. THEY DON'T HAVE WATER, THEY ARE USING TOILET WATER. THERE IS NO MORPHINE FOR ANY KIND OF AMPUTATIONS, ANTIBIOTICS, NO. BUT HAMAS HAD STOCKPILED ALL OF THAT AND HAS ALL OF THE UNDERGROUND. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE LEARNING FROM HER. &gt;&gt; SO THAT, POINT ERIN, WE WANT TO PLAY THIS OUT FOR ON THIS. BECAUSE IT GETS AT JUST HOW PREPARED THEY WERE FOR TAKING HOSTAGES, INCLUDING AT THE SCALE THAT THEY TOOK. THEM TAKE A LISTEN. &gt;&gt; THEY LOOKED VERY WELL PREPARED. THEY PREPARED IT FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. ALL OF THE NEEDS FOR WOMEN NEED. SHAMPOO, CONDITIONER. ME &gt;&gt; DID THAT SURPRISE YOU? I KNOW EVERYONE WAS SURPRISED BY THE SCALE OF THE ACTUAL TERROR ATTACK ITSELF. BUT THE PREPARATIONS FOR HOSTAGE TAKING ALSO SEEMED TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF THE PLAN. &gt;&gt; YES. WHEN THEY SAY PREPARED FOR WOMEN'S NEEDS, THEY WERE THERE FOR PREPARED, I MEAN, LET'S JUST GO AHEAD. I THINK WE'RE BEING HONEST ABOUT. IT MEANS THEY HAD TAMPONS AND THINGS. THAT IS A LEVEL OF PREPARATION FOR WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO. AND IT SHOWS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE PEOPLE OF ALL DIFFERENT AGES. IT SHOWS A PREPARATION FOR THAT. AND WE SAW THAT IN THE PLANS THAT WE'VE SEEN IT TAKEN FROM THE BODIES OF HAMAS MILITANTS WHO WERE KILLED IN THE TERRORIST ATTACK. YOU KNOW, THAT IT LAYS OUT WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO IN EVERY SINGLE KIBBUTZ, AND THEY ALSO LAID OUT VERY EXPLICITLY THE ONES THAT I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO READ WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO WITH HOSTAGES. TAKE AS MANY AS POSSIBLE. HERE IS THE COMMUNAL EATING AREA IN THIS CABOOSES, WHERE THEY GO, THIS IS HOW YOU GET THERE, HERE IS THE MAP. IT IS CIRCLED. TAKE THE HOSTAGES TH SO THAT WAS VERY MUCH A PART OF THE PRINTED PLAN. AND I SEE THE OTHER END OF IT. THE LEVEL OF PREPARATION THAT WENT INTO IT. AGAIN, IN THE MUNDANE REALITY OF HAVING FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS. SHAMPOO, ANTIBIOTICS. IT IS THOSE VERY SPECIFICS THAT I THINK THAT ARE MOST STRIKING. &gt;&gt; FOR SURE, AND ERIN, I ALSO WONDER ABOUT IF WE WILL LEARN FROM HER OR SOME OF THE OTHER HOSTAGES RELEASED HOW MUCH THEY HAD, WHICH WOULD INDICATE HOW LONG THEY HAD BEEN PLANNING, OR HAD BEEN PLANNING TO HOLD THE SO WE'LL SEE. I ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS STRIKING THAT HER DAUGHTER, SHARON, SPOKE AT THAT NEWS CONFERENCE AS WELL. AND THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT HER DAD, WHO OF COURSE, IS YOU VETS HUSBAND. LISTEN TO THIS. &gt;&gt; MY MOM AND MY DAD WERE SEPARATED AT THE VERY BEGINNING. &gt;&gt; WE DO NOT KNOW, FROM MY MOM'S STORY, WHAT HAPPENED TO MY DAD. WE DO KNOW THAT HE WAS INJURED. &gt;&gt; INJURED, AND VERY LIKELY COULD STILL BE BEING HELD. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. THEY WERE HELD IN SEPARATE PLACES. SO AS MUCH AS HAMAS AGAIN GIVING THIS IMAGE OF HUMANE TREATMENT TO HOSTAGES, YOU MUST REMEMBER AGAIN THAT THEY WERE REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT GET TO BECOME HOSTAGES. DEPLORABLE, INHUMAN METHOD OF THEIR BRUTAL MASSACRE AND SLAUGHTER. BUT THEN, WHEN THEY DO TAKE PEOPLE HOSTAGE, THEY WOULD SEPARATE. SO A HUSBAND AND WIFE NOT BEING TOGETHER, SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE HE IS. AND THAT OF COURSE IS THE OBVIOUS RAISED POINT. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE BEING HELD, AND ARE THERE ANY BEING HELD IN LARGER GROUPS. WE KNOW HAMAS HAS SAID THAT SOME OF THE HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN KILLED IN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES. WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'VE BEEN KILLED, WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WERE KILLED BY ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES OR ANYTHING ELSE. BUT ALL WE KNOW AT THIS POINT IS WHAT HAMAS HAS SAID. THEY'VE INDICATED 22 OF THEM HAVE BEEN KILLED IN STRIKES. WE JUST DON'T KNOW IF IT IS TRUE. THE ISRAELI FORCE IS PREPARING FOR THE GAZA GROUNDED PATIENT GETTING COUNCIL FROM AN AMERICAN MILITARY LATER IN THE ISRAEL MARINE CORPS LIEUTENANT JAMES GLIM WAS HEAD OF THE MARINE FORCES SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND, AND IT IS UNCLEAR THOUGH, WHILE OF COURSE HE HAS THE EXPERIENCE AND THE RESUME FOR SUCH A SITUATION, IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT HIS SPECIFIC ROLE IS HERE. BUT UNOFFICIAL DOES SAY GENERAL GLYNN HAS DECADES OF EXPERIENCE AND CAN ASK, WHAT THEY SAY, ARE THE HARD QUESTIONS, AS UNITED STATES DOES NOT HAVE A CLEAR SENSE OF ISRAEL'S INTENTIONS IN GAZA. THEY SAID THEY ARE GOING TO GET RID OF HAMAS AND ALL RESPECTS. BUT BEYOND, THAT WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS, THEY HAVE NOT PROVIDED ANY SPECIFICS. CNN'S NIC ROBERTSON IS IN SDEROT, ISRAEL, WHERE HE HAS BEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS WAR. AND AS WE HAVE BEEN IN THE MIDST OF WHAT IS NOW 17 DAYS INTO A WAR, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN TERMS OF MILITARY MOVEMENT THIS MORNING, AND THE CONTEXT OF WHAT? MORE THAN 300 STRIKES THAT ISRAEL IS SAYING THEY CONDUCTED IN THE PAST 24 HOURS IN GAZA. &gt;&gt; YEAH. JUST GO BACK TO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING THERE ABOUT THE FORMER MARINE GENERAL. I THINK THE ONLY PIECE OF CONTEXT HERE, OF COURSE, IS THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME MARINE EXPEDITIONARY UNIT OF 2000 WHO HAVE BEEN ON READINESS AND STANDBY TO COME IN AND GIVE LOGISTIC SUPPORT ANOTHER UNSPECIFIED SUPPORT TO THE ISRAELI MILITARY. AT A TIME WHEN THERE ARE AMERICAN HOSTAGES BEING HELD BY HAMAS INSIDE GAZA. SO IT SEEMS, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH GENERAL TO COME AND GIVE WHAT SORT OF ADVICE, YOU ARE ALSO PICKING ONE WHO WOUL VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE SORT OF EXPERTISE, READINESS, OF WHAT THESE MARINES WHO ARE SITTING JUST OFF SHORE HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL. IT SPEAKS TO ME AS A NATION AS WELL. OF COURSE, THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE BEING TOLD, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE READINESS, WE HEARD FROM A PRIME MINISTER TODAY, PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT, EMMANUEL MACRON, WHO HAS GIVEN HIS SUPPORT TO ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO STRIKE BACK AT HAMAS. THE PRIME MINISTER SAID IT COULD BE A LONG WAR. I'M STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT HE SAID IT COULD BE, BECAUSE UNTIL NOW, HE'S BEEN VERY, VERY CLEAR. SAYING HE WILL GO AFTER THEM, AND WE WILL GET THE JOB DONE. WE WILL COMPLETELY GET RID OF HAMAS. BUT I THINK THIS IS ALSO INDICATIVE OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO STEPPING BACK FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF A GROUND INCURSION. WE ARE NOT SEEING ANYTHING ON THE GROUND AT THE MOMENT THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT. WE ARE STILL HEARING HEAVY DETONATIONS COMING FROM WITHIN GAZA, WE'VE HEARD MILITARY HELICOPTERS IN THE AREA THIS MORNING. SO WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE ISRAELI DEFENSE CHIEF YESTERDAY, AND GENERAL STAFF, KIND OF GENERAL STAFF SAYING THAT THEY ARE READY. THAT TROOPS ARE READY, THAT THEY ARE GETTING ADDNAL TRAINING. BUT I THINK THE POSTURE IS SET FOR WHEN THE COMMAND COMES. THAT THE TROOPS ARE READY FOR THAT INCURSION, VERY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE BEING PAUSED. VERY CLEAR THAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH HUMANITARIAN AID, HAS TO DO WITH HOSTAGES, NEEDS THAT. BUT THE FORCES, THEY'RE READY TO GO. I DON'T SEE ANYONE PULLING IT BACK AT THAT MOMENT, ERIN. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, NICK ROBERTSON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALONG WITH THE GAZA BORDER AND SDROT, I WANT TO GO NOW TO THE IDF SPOKESPERSON, LIEUTENANT COLONEL PETER LERNER. LIEUTENANT, I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. I'M GLAD TO SPEAK TO YOU THIS I WANT TO GIVE YOU FIRST CHANCE TO RESPOND TO WHAT WE WERE SAYING WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STOOD UP AS THESE HOSTAGE HAVE SPOKEN OUT. THAT HAMAS WAS PREPARED FOR THIS, FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS, SHAMPOO, ANTIBIOTICS, AND PARAMEDICS, MEDICAL CARE, EATING THE SAME FOOD AS THE HOSTAGES EIGHT. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT? &gt;&gt; WELL, CLEARLY, ERIN. THEY WERE PREPARED FOR THE ATTACK. WE SEE JUST THE MAGNITUDE OF THEIR ATTACKS. THEY HAD A VERY CLEAR PLAN OF ACTION, SO IT SHOULD NOT BE ANY SURPRISE TO US THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY HAD UNDERGROUND AS THEY ABDUCTED OVER 200 PEOPLE INTO GAZA. I REMIND YOU, THEY DID A COORDINATED ATTACK WITH MORE THAN 20 POINTS OF BREACH, OVERGROUND, AT GROUND, AND ETSY. THEY PENETRATED SOME 30 DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PART OF ISRAEL. AND MURDERED AND OVER 1400 PEOPLE. SO WHY SHOULD WE BE SURPRISED?
