00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.533
I guess, first of

00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.301
all, I mean,

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.470
the images of this tunnel are just

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.573
kind of mind here.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.675
What is your take on all this?

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:09.776
What was your reaction to that?

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.077
When you saw that?

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:13.480
Yeah, my my reaction is

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.280
this is what Israel

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.982
has been talking about

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:18.151
since the beginning of this conflict.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:18.785
They knew that

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.520
these kind of tunnels existed.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.821
I mean, we've been showing on

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.890
CNN the single file tunnels

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.759
that you almost have to squeeze through,

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.494
but you can't conduct an operation

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.829
of literally thousands of terrorist

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.565
when you're squeezing them all through.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.900
So you're talking about a tunnel

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.567
in this case

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.770
that's 50 meters, about 200 feet

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.405
or so underground

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.907
that has the capability to hold weapons,

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.143
have large meeting spaces,

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:45.211
travel around and even bring vehicles in.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:46.012
It's just

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:47.280
part of the network

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.549
that subterranean under the Gaza

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.084
Hamas has been

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.919
building for the last several

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:54.988
years, in fact, close to a decade.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.489
And how they have been shifting

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.290
the money away

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.125
from the Palestinian citizens

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.061
to build these kind of things

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:01.728
to to

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.597
to construct their military apparatus.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.966
And it's just it's just mind boggling.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:07.434
It is.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.436
But it also shows the difficulty

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.603
of fighting in this kind

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:11.905
of subterranean environment.

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:14.074
Yeah.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.708
I mean, our Jeremy Diamond was saying

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.043
just a short while ago that,

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:17.644
I mean, this

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.079
this tunnel is almost big enough

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.647
or maybe big enough for vehicles

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:21.247
to move through.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.348
I mean, that

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.751
that that is a different kind of tunnel.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.553
There's no question about it.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:27.787
And General, today

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.055
the IDF announced it's

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:30.356
taking control of parts of Khan

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.591
Younis in southern Gaza.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.459
The Hamas

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:33.293
run health

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.294
ministry also reported

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:38.098
an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.632
What's your sense of things right now?

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:40.033
I mean,

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:43.002
President Biden has been concerned

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:43.336
about what

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:43.937
he's described

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:46.306
as indiscriminate bombing in Gaza,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.110
but what's your sense of where things

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.045
stand right now tonight?

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:55.682
I don't I'm not in concurrence, Jim,

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:59.352
with the the the indiscriminate bombing.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.322
It may be somewhat excessive

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.990
and we could talk about that.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.657
But, you know,

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:06.326
from the very beginning of this conflict,

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.861
starting a weeks ago,

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.162
you and I were talking about

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.798
how they would start in northern Gaza,

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:12.765
in Gaza City,

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.901
and then go to potentially Haim Yunis,

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.402
then to Karbala,

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.538
where and then even down south

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:19.472
into Rafah.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.974
The Israeli government has said

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:21.841
this operation

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.576
will take many more months,

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.645
whereas many of the United States

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.180
administration is saying

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.914
they'd like to see

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:28.948
it ended in terms

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.416
of the kinetic operation

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:31.651
by the end of December.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:32.852
I've said from the beginning,

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.287
I don't think that's going to happen,

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:35.121
given the size

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:36.723
and strength of the Hamas

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:37.423
terrorist groups

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:39.259
that are in these subterranean tunnels.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.995
And we're seeing in each section of Gaza

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.029
that there are more

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.898
and more underground headquarters.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:48.001
And Hamas has been very diligent in terms

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.203
of setting traps for the Israeli forces

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.271
as they go through.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.605
So anyone that says,

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.474
hey, we ought to shift from

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:55.742
using airpower

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:56.576
to ground

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:58.711
and special operations forces,

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.346
that's easy to say on the outside.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.681
But truthfully,

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:02.949
with some of the constructs

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.951
that we've seen, Hamas using

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.153
these underground networks

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:08.254
and some of the

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:10.456
uses of civilian buildings

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:11.691
have to be struck.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.726
I think it will continue on.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.962
Secretary Austin is going to discuss that

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.097
with the Israeli government

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.399
over the next couple of days.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.433
But I think we're going to see

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:21.768
a continuation

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:22.802
of these kind of strikes

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:24.537
until Israel determines

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.406
that Hamas is defeated.

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.440
And I did want to ask you

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.107
about the three

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:29.275
Israeli hostages who were

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.110
mistakenly killed by the IDF.

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:32.946
We've talked

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.247
to a variety of people this week.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:35.715
And so I certainly want to get your

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.317
your take on all of this.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:39.319
When I spoke with the IDF spokesman,

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:41.955
Jonathan Conricus, yesterday,

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:44.090
I mean, he really didn't

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.024
indicate that there's

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.426
going to be a major shift

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.795
in their tactics or rules of engagement.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.164
They're going to remind their soldiers

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:53.032
that they may come across hostages

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:53.733
from time to time

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.201
who have escaped captivity

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.402
and they need to be able

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.371
to recognize that.

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.640
But, I mean, the three men came out

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.808
of a building shirtless,

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:03.243
waving a white flag.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.712
They were shot anyway.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:06.813
The IDF says those troops

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.114
were not following

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.583
the proper rules of engagement.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.919
But Colonel Conricus was saying, look,

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:13.253
you know,

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.053
we have Hamas

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.088
fighters who are

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.789
pretending to be civilians,

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:17.724
who are doing things

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:19.726
to draw in IDF forces to

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.094
entrap them and kill them.

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:23.062
It is such a

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:24.130
messy, chaotic

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.732
battlefield I'm wondering, General,

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:27.900
what's your advice on all this?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.668
Well,

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.236
I don't have any advice, Jim,

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:30.837
but truthfully,

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.905
what I would say is Hamas

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:33.840
and any terrorist

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.209
organization is going to use deception

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:37.677
and trickery.

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:39.112
And you add to that

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.446
the fact of the conditions

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:42.215
of the battlefield, as you just said.

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:44.083
And I would bet that the hostages,

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:44.684
as they came

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:45.385
out of the building,

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:48.121
probably did not look like the Clean-Cut

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:48.621
young men

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:50.456
we see in their photos

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.292
that have been appearing on air.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.194
They've been in captivity for two months.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:56.596
The soldiers,

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:57.797
the Israeli soldiers

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:58.665
who were

00:04:58.665 --> 00:04:59.732
always anxious

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.034
in any kind of firefight

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:02.735
with adrenaline surgeon,

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.137
and especially depending

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.105
on what their level of training

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.273
experience is.

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:09.108
You know, truthfully, Jim, I had

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.412
a fratricide incident in a command

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:13.579
I was in in Iraq.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.748
And it devastates the individuals

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:18.718
who shoot their fellow citizens.

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:19.585
And in this case, I'm

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.321
sure it's not only devastated

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:24.190
whoever engaged those three hostages but

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.725
I would believe that

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:26.693
this is rippled

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:28.828
through the Israeli Defense Forces.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.830
And they are attempting

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.465
to conduct their operations

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.467
according to rules of engagement.

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.102
But truthfully, as you just said,

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:37.203
the conditions on this

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:40.173
battlefield are extremely complex

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.474
and complicated.

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:43.376
You don't know who the enemy is

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:45.244
When people hop out of buildings,

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:46.145
especially buildings,

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:48.281
as the Israelis have been showing,

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:48.781
contain

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:50.383
a vast amount of ammunition

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.385
and they contain ambush sites.

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:54.654
It's very difficult to differentiate.

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.889
But I believe that the

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.157
Israeli Defense Forces

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:00.026
will review their rules of engagement.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.561
And I know their chief of staff

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:02.762
has addressed this issue
