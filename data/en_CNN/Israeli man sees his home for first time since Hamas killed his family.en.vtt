00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.201
Tonight, we are learning new

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:03.803
details about the two Israeli hostages

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:04.804
who were just released

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:06.740
in recent hours by Hamas.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.073
Now, read

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:08.408
Cooper and Heaven

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.909
Leave sheets were abducted

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.044
from their kibbutz

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.312
along with their husbands

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.714
who still remain hostages tonight.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.082
This war is being fought

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.984
not on some remote battlefield,

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.352
but in quiet communities

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.253
where families

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:22.022
previously grew their crops

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.390
and raise their kids.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.758
Just yesterday, an Israeli

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:25.825
soldier was killed

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.527
and three others were injured

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.629
during a raid in the area of Kibbutz

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.831
Safi near the Gaza Strip.

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.401
I was there just 24 hours before.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.602
Or you can see Gaza

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.337
from people's backyards.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:38.571
About ten reporters

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.206
were taken inside this kibbutz

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.208
to see the horrific aftermath

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.411
of the October 7th attack.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.413
I want to show you what we saw.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:47.347
But I do want to warn you

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.381
that some of what you're about

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.218
to see is graphic.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:53.186
Kibbutz Kaisa

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:53.887
Farms is

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.422
less than three miles away

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:56.122
from the Gaza

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:56.956
border,

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.091
a quiet community

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.025
where residents grow

00:00:59.025 --> 00:00:59.959
avocados

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.396
and raise poultry and their families.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.632
But as the sun rose on Saturday,

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:07.200
October 7th,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.334
the kibbutz that around

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.470
300 people called home

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.872
became the site of a massacre

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:13.473
as Hamas

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.341
militants stormed inside

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:15.842
and murdered

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:20.346
14 people, kidnaping four others.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.482
Major Marcus Sheff, a reservist

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.317
in the Israel Defense Forces,

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:25.485
watched from home

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:28.455
as the brutal attack unfolded that day.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.290
Now he's leading a small group

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.125
of foreign press into the kibbutz

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.493
for the first time.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.394
Wanting the world

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:35.361
to bear witness

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.597
to the atrocities firsthand.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:38.965
You know, the shock you feel that

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.934
after two weeks we've seen the damage

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.502
and yet it's still

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:46.106
hard to to absorb the full whole.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.374
The stench of death is thick in the air

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.977
as you walk along the tree lined streets.

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:51.978
But if you didn't look too

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:52.579
closely,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.280
you'd never guess that a slaughter

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.149
took place here.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.518
Then you notice the bullet hole and Jenas

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:00.120
Mia touches door.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.654
The 90 year old grandmother

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.056
who loved gardening

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.157
was in her bathroom

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.558
when Hamas militants

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.460
shot her in the head.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.962
Her blood is still smeared

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:09.963
on the entryway.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.631
Two weeks later,

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.099
if you didn't look over here,

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.901
it just look like a regular home

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.035
on a Saturday morning.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:20.140
Orange juice sells the newspaper or mail

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.041
some cookies.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.376
When you look over here at the kitchen,

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:25.345
you can see people have gone through it.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.881
They opened all the cabinets.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:28.214
There's

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:31.518
still cups in the sink.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.354
Her kettle is still out.

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:35.855
And Gina is one of several

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.491
who was brutally murdered in her kibbutz

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.728
on that Saturday morning.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:42.962
The Zach family lived

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:44.397
just down the street.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:45.532
Parents, Itai,

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.333
Eddie and their 14 year old son,

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:50.336
Soggy were at home when the attack began.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:51.004
Their older

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.007
children, Hadar and Toma, were away.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:57.076
We reach 24 year old Hadar on face time.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:58.077
What's through there?

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:00.079
What's what was through that window?

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.314
This is the first time

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.682
he's able to see the charred

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.351
remains of his family's home.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.320
Experts told me that he opened the moment

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.755
and found my dad

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:10.657
laying on the ground with my dog,

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:11.791
just watching the doors

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.660
so that there was one coming in

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.195
the bodies of his mother

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.095
and little brother

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:17.497
were found hugging each other

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:19.332
in the nearby bomb shelter

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.733
where they asphyxiated

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:24.671
after militants set their home on fire

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:26.639
just days before Soggy was

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.707
dancing his heart out

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:30.710
at a Bruno Mars concert in Tel Aviv.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:33.279
Just I'm 24.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.881
We have ten years between us.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.716
It's hard for me to see my little brother

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.117
because it was my child.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:39.886
Haidar and his sister Tomer

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.387
are now orphans.

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:44.991
His grief and his anger is palpable.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.226
It's kind of absurd to me

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.461
that you guys saw me first

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:50.096
and is someone from Israel,

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:51.030
You know what I mean?

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.198
I love my niece's make.

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:57.270
It was just amazing for the government.

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:59.973
I have more of the support

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.374
just 24 hours later

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:02.942
in the Kissa film area.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:04.711
An IDF soldier is killed

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.112
and three others wounded

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:07.847
during a raid ahead of Israel's

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:10.850
expected ground invasion in Gaza.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.318
An ominous warning shot

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:16.723
of what is yet to come.

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:18.491
It's difficult to watch.

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.492
And I do want to note

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:20.593
that we got permission

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:21.661
from these families

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:22.862
to go into their homes,

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:23.997
something that

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.898
that felt invasive to be there

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:27.533
but was so important to them

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:28.401
and to her daughter to be able

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:30.870
to see his house for the first time.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.672
I want to express our gratitude for them,

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:35.008
for letting us in, to see their pain

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.276
and to tell their stories

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.077
as well as to Major Marcus Scheff

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.912
for taking us inside that kibbutz.
