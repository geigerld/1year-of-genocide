at the music festival and you

00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:40.492
may remember Noa argamani from

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:42.560
this horrific video from the

00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:45.297
October 7 attacks we also heard

00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:46.298
screaming as hamas fighters

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:47.565
drove away with her on a

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.301
motorbike we know her boyfriend

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:50.302
was also kidnapped and it's

00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:53.571
still being held captive.

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:54.439
Israel says this morning's

00:00:54.572 --> 00:00:55.507
rescue mission took place it to

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.976
separate locations in central

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.712
gaza and your refugee camp

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:01.513
Palestinians, they're described

00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:02.847
the raid as hell on Earth is

00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:05.317
heavy shelling and artillery

00:01:05.317 --> 00:01:08.553
fire bombarded that area.

00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:09.354
&gt;&gt; Officials in gaza say at

00:01:09.487 --> 00:01:10.622
least 210 people have been

00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:13.325
killed more than 400 injured,

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:14.526
including women in children.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.861
&gt;&gt; But CNN cannot independently

00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:19.331
verify those numbers. We are

00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:20.332
covering these breaking

00:01:20.332 --> 00:01:21.833
developments from all angles.

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:22.801
Been wheat a man has more on

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:24.936
the casualties inside gaza, but

00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:26.338
first we start with Paula

00:01:26.338 --> 00:01:28.340
hancocks and tel aviv, who has

00:01:28.373 --> 00:01:30.475
more details on the surprise

00:01:30.608 --> 00:01:31.710
rescue mission that brought

00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:33.345
these four hostages home.

00:01:33.378 --> 00:01:35.347
Apala, how are these hostages

00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:38.850
doing well, Jessica, what we've

00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:41.353
been told from the doctor at

00:01:41.353 --> 00:01:42.354
the medical center, they were

00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:45.390
all taken two once they were

00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:47.025
rescued, is that they are all

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.525
stable.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.561
&gt;&gt; They are in good medical

00:01:49.694 --> 00:01:50.729
condition than just outside

00:01:50.862 --> 00:01:52.797
that hospital. We have seen all

00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:55.367
day friends and family coming

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:58.470
to welcome home. There loved

00:01:58.603 --> 00:01:59.471
ones that have been in

00:01:59.604 --> 00:02:02.741
captivity for the past eight

00:02:02.874 --> 00:02:04.943
months. Now, many of them have

00:02:05.377 --> 00:02:07.545
thanked the military for the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:08.380
mission they have thank those

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.384
that a part of this rescue

00:02:12.384 --> 00:02:13.385
operation, but they have also

00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:17.389
said that there are 120 more

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.991
hostages that needs to be

00:02:20.392 --> 00:02:20.692
rescued. Now, we did hear from

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:23.728
the mother of one of the

00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:25.897
hostages and almog, meir, Jan

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.399
and let's listen to what she

00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:31.836
said thank you.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.908
&gt;&gt; So bringing my son to me to

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:43.415
ask I'm so excited hugging

00:02:43.448 --> 00:02:43.815
today.

00:02:43.948 --> 00:02:45.583
&gt;&gt; I couldn't stop hugging

00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:49.053
him. I couldn't stop and

00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:52.424
tomorrow is my birthday. I got

00:02:52.557 --> 00:02:57.429
my presence now, she also said

00:02:57.462 --> 00:03:00.498
that they want a ceasefire deal

00:03:00.632 --> 00:03:01.466
to make sure the rest of the

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.500
hostages can be released.

00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:03.701
&gt;&gt; It's something we've heard

00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:04.436
here tonight in tel aviv where

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.571
the week plea protest that has

00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:09.441
been held, we heard from the

00:03:09.507 --> 00:03:11.509
one of the women speaking her

00:03:11.643 --> 00:03:13.445
cousinone of those who has

00:03:13.478 --> 00:03:14.579
died in captivity. The body

00:03:14.712 --> 00:03:16.648
still being held by hamas,

00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.849
saying, not everything will

00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:19.751
have a holiday he would ending.

00:03:19.884 --> 00:03:21.753
So there's a real push at the

00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:22.921
same time as celebrating the

00:03:23.054 --> 00:03:25.023
rescue of these four hostages.

00:03:25.457 --> 00:03:27.091
A push for a ceasefire and

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.761
hostage deal. Jessica and Paul,

00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:30.462
what more are you learning

00:03:30.562 --> 00:03:31.963
about the rescue? Mission

00:03:32.096 --> 00:03:33.832
itself? This was high-stake

00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:38.470
stuff. How did it come together

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.471
what we're hearing from the

00:03:39.537 --> 00:03:41.473
idf Sayyed is that the

00:03:41.473 --> 00:03:42.474
military, the acuity agency,

00:03:42.474 --> 00:03:44.876
the police, had a joint

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.477
operation.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.078
&gt;&gt; They had been planning this

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.480
for weeks. They say it was

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.615
based on intelligence and it

00:03:50.748 --> 00:03:52.150
was just on Thursday night the

00:03:52.484 --> 00:03:53.485
Israeli prime minister Benjamin

00:03:53.485 --> 00:03:54.552
Netanyahu gave the green light

00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:56.855
to go ahead with this mission.

00:03:56.988 --> 00:03:58.890
They said they effectively

00:03:59.023 --> 00:04:01.025
built to apartment blocks. They

00:04:01.493 --> 00:04:02.760
knew that these civilians

00:04:02.894 --> 00:04:04.496
excuse me, hostages were being

00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:08.500
held in civilian multi-story

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.534
buildings and they built block

00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:11.503
so that they could train in how

00:04:11.503 --> 00:04:12.504
to try and extract them from

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.538
that area. Now they have

00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:14.739
pointed out it wasn't a

00:04:14.873 --> 00:04:17.509
civilian area and that many of

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:18.643
the other hostages would not be

00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:20.778
held in a similar situation

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:21.779
they don't believe that this

00:04:21.913 --> 00:04:24.516
could be necessarily replicated

00:04:24.516 --> 00:04:26.885
after this Jessica, I Apollo

00:04:27.018 --> 00:04:28.086
handcuffs for us.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.853
&gt;&gt; Live in tel aviv. Thank you

00:04:28.987 --> 00:04:29.888
very much. Let's turn now to

00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:32.524
the impact in gaza. Were

00:04:32.624 --> 00:04:33.525
Palestinians are describing

00:04:33.558 --> 00:04:34.526
that special operation as hell

00:04:34.592 --> 00:04:35.560
on Earth. And I do want to warn

00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:36.761
you some of the video we're

00:04:36.895 --> 00:04:38.129
about to show you is graphing

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.565
locals, telling CNN this about

00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:43.001
the aftermath of the attack,

00:04:43.134 --> 00:04:44.536
quote, there are children torn

00:04:44.536 --> 00:04:45.036
apart and scattered in the

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.539
streets. We turn now to been

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:48.540
Wiedemann for more on the

00:04:48.573 --> 00:04:51.042
impact inside gaza and Ben

00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:51.776
hamas officials say they are

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.112
more than 200 people dead,

00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:54.879
hundreds more injured. We were

00:04:55.013 --> 00:04:55.713
just looking at some of that

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.950
video. What more do we know

00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:00.852
this is without a doubt, one of

00:05:00.985 --> 00:05:02.086
the bloodiest is rarely

00:05:02.554 --> 00:05:03.688
assaults in this war.

00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:07.659
&gt;&gt; So far no doctors at the

00:05:07.792 --> 00:05:10.094
aqsa martyrs hospital indebted

00:05:10.562 --> 00:05:11.563
Bella say that the death toll

00:05:11.563 --> 00:05:13.565
at the moment stands at least

00:05:13.698 --> 00:05:15.633
at 400 Jordan ten, with more

00:05:15.767 --> 00:05:19.704
than 400 injured, no CNN has a

00:05:19.837 --> 00:05:22.073
camera man who got into that

00:05:22.206 --> 00:05:23.841
hospital and the scenes are

00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:26.978
utter pen ammonium. Women,

00:05:27.111 --> 00:05:29.581
children, wounded, dead all

00:05:29.714 --> 00:05:31.950
over this hospital. The morgue

00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:32.784
is full. The debtor on the

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:37.188
ground side. There are many

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:39.591
relatives there trying to get

00:05:39.591 --> 00:05:41.593
treatment for their wounded

00:05:41.693 --> 00:05:42.860
loved ones. Others are weeping

00:05:42.994 --> 00:05:46.197
and brain over the dead. Now,

00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:48.132
this assault took place

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.602
mid-morning just before noon,

00:05:50.602 --> 00:05:52.937
actually. And at a time when

00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:53.705
many people are out and about,

00:05:53.838 --> 00:05:55.873
there's the market in the

00:05:56.007 --> 00:05:57.609
nuseirat camp where this

00:05:57.609 --> 00:05:58.142
happened. Lots of people were

00:05:58.276 --> 00:06:00.612
in the street. And what we've

00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:02.947
seen video coming out of that

00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:04.782
place is that he Israelis used

00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:08.086
a lot of heavy firepower in

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:09.854
that area where there were many

00:06:09.988 --> 00:06:13.224
civilians walking around so

00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:17.028
certain this is a success for

00:06:17.161 --> 00:06:19.063
the Israelis, but for the

00:06:19.197 --> 00:06:20.632
Palestinians, it comes at a

00:06:20.632 --> 00:06:22.634
very high price and it's worth

00:06:22.634 --> 00:06:24.636
mentioning that the Israelis

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:26.638
and military operations going

00:06:26.671 --> 00:06:27.772
back to October have managed at

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:30.742
this point to free seven

00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:34.245
hostages. However, 105 hostile

00:06:34.646 --> 00:06:36.648
judges were released during a

00:06:36.648 --> 00:06:38.783
ceasefire back in late

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:39.917
November, in which at one

00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:42.654
Israeli hostages were freed as

00:06:42.654 --> 00:06:45.857
well as 20 for foreign

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.825
nationals. It's clear that

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:48.926
after eight months of war in a

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.664
death toll of over 36,000 in

00:06:52.664 --> 00:06:54.666
gaza. That the best way to get

00:06:54.666 --> 00:06:56.668
people out, the hostages free

00:06:56.668 --> 00:06:58.670
is not through dramatic

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.738
military action, but it's

00:07:00.872 --> 00:07:02.674
through ceasefire Jessica and

00:07:02.774 --> 00:07:04.308
then secretary St. Anthony

00:07:04.676 --> 00:07:05.677
blinken is traveling to the

00:07:05.777 --> 00:07:07.679
Middle East to push for a

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:08.680
ceasefire deal between Israel

00:07:08.713 --> 00:07:12.083
and hamas what is the word at

00:07:12.216 --> 00:07:14.686
this point on how this

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:15.687
potential, how this rescue

00:07:15.687 --> 00:07:16.988
mission may potentially impact

00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:20.958
those discussions well, we've

00:07:21.092 --> 00:07:24.128
seen a statement from spokesman

00:07:24.262 --> 00:07:25.229
for hamas indicating that this

00:07:25.697 --> 00:07:27.699
might make things more

00:07:27.732 --> 00:07:28.700
difficult, but they're already,

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.202
it seems that even though

00:07:31.335 --> 00:07:32.270
president Biden came out onto

00:07:32.704 --> 00:07:35.373
30 of may, come meet with a

00:07:35.707 --> 00:07:36.974
three-point proposal to try to

00:07:37.108 --> 00:07:38.176
end this one for both sides

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:40.712
have been ambiguous.

00:07:40.712 --> 00:07:41.713
&gt;&gt; The Israelis have indicated

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:43.748
sort of a willingness to go

00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:45.083
along with it. But prime

00:07:45.216 --> 00:07:46.951
minister Netanyahu has made it

00:07:47.085 --> 00:07:48.019
clear that his the ultimate

00:07:48.152 --> 00:07:50.321
goal is the destruction of

00:07:50.722 --> 00:07:54.926
hamas. Hamas wants Israel to

00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:56.728
agree to a complete and

00:07:56.728 --> 00:07:58.730
permanent ceasefire, so they

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.399
still seem to be well, a apart.

00:08:01.733 --> 00:08:04.736
The gap is wide between the two

00:08:04.736 --> 00:08:06.337
sides. Now, we know that

00:08:06.738 --> 00:08:07.105
William burns, the head of the

00:08:07.238 --> 00:08:10.074
CIA was in Qatar, and Brett

00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:11.743
Mcgurk, the mideast coordinator

00:08:11.743 --> 00:08:13.277
for the white house, was in

00:08:13.745 --> 00:08:15.880
Cairo. So the efforts are being

00:08:16.013 --> 00:08:16.814
made, but they don't seem to be
