STREETS USING THE SOLAR POWER

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:52.452
WE CAN FIND.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:56.589
WE CRAVE OUR FAVORITE FOODS,

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:57.357
BUT THERE IS NO POWER, NO GAS

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:58.158

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:58.725

PEOPLE TO EVACUATE THE AREA.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.644
MOST PEOPLE FLED.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:22.015

STREETS LIKE CRAZY, NOT KNOWING

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:24.884
WHERE TO GO.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:25.618
THE SITUATION IS TERRIFYING.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:26.619
GOD HAVE MERCY ON US.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.621
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: AS THE WAR

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:33.593
INTENSIFIED IN THE NORTH, AYAT

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:34.094
DID NOT LEAVE.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.061
THE SAFETY THEY WERE TOLD TO

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.796
EVACUATE TO IN THE SOUTH WAS AN

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:37.230
ILLUSION.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.142
ANYONE, NOT FOR ELDERLY, NOT

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.777
THE CHILDREN, NOT THE WOMEN, NO

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:51.111
ONE.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.614

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:54.981
GAZA.

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:58.618
WHERE ARE THE DECISION-MAKERS?

00:01:58.618 --> 00:01:59.185
WHERE'S THE WORLD?

00:01:59.185 --> 00:01:59.886
GAZA IS BEING ANNIHILATED.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:00.520
WE ARE DYING.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.955
SOMEONE DO SOMETHING, ENOUGH.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:07.727

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:10.497

LIKE AYAT, I HAVE NOT STOPPED

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.506
THIS SEEMINGLY ENDLESS

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.275
NIGHTMARE FOR THE PEOPLE OF

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:23.042
GAZA, WHERE BURYING THEIR DEAD

EVERY MOMENT FEELS LIKE IT MAY

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:25.044
BE THEIR LAST.

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:31.184

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:50.570
WE HAD BIG DREAMS.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.404
NOW OUR DREAM IS IF WE ARE

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:52.138
KILLED, WE ARE A BODY IN ONE

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:52.939
PIECE, SO WE CAN BE IDENTIFIED,

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:53.773
BURIED IN A GRAVE, NOT BODY

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:57.443
PARTS IN A BAG.

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:58.111
WHEN WILL THIS WAR END?

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:03.750
WHO WILL REMAIN TO TELL PEOPLE

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.585
WHAT HAPPENED TO US?

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.086
WHAT WE LIVED THROUGH, WHAT WE

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:09.022
WITNESSED.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.390
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: JOMANA KARADSHEH,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.291
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: JOMANA KARADSHEH,

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.693
CNN, LONDON.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.028
&gt;&gt;&gt; HAPPENING NOW, THE TRUCE 

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.729
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS APPEARS

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.531
TO BE HOLDING.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.099
MEANING OTHER PIECES OF THE DEAL

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.602
ARE KICKING INTO GEAR.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.604
CONVOY OF UNITED NATIONS TRUCKS 

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:26.439
PACKED WITH TONS OF HUMANITARIAN

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.242
AID NOW MOVING IN TO GAZA VIA 

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:31.077
THE RAFAH CROSSING.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:32.879
LET'S SPEAK TO ELENI GIOKOS WHO 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.148
IS LIVE FOR US IN CAIRO.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:37.217
SO PLAYING OUT AS YOU EXPECTED.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.851
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:39.953
AID.

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:41.354
NOT QUITE ENOUGH, NOT NEARLY 

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:43.456
ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM 

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:44.524
THERE, BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT 

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:48.228
THAT THOSE TRUCKS ARE GOING IN.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.597
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IT IS SIGNIFICANT.

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.065
AND IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY WAY MORE

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:55.335
THAN WE'VE SEEN SINCE OCTOBER 7.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.003
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT 

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:59.105
BEFORE THE WAR BEGAN, THERE WERE

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:02.408
OVER 445 TRUCKS GOING INTO GAZA 

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.510
ON A DAILY BASIS ON A GOOD DAY.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.614
SO THIS WAS A POPULATION THAT 

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:09.315
ALREADY HEAVILY RELIED ON AID.

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.617
AND THEN YOU SEE THE WAR 

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:12.051
BREAKING OUT AND NOW WE ARE 

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.953
HEARING THAT JUST ABSOLUTE 

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:15.655
CATASTROPHIC SCENARIOS ON THE 

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.890
GROUND AND REI WILL RATED BY THE

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.758
INTERNATIONAL AID ORGANIZATIONS.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.193
BUT I WANT TO TAKE YOU THROUGH 

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.261
WHAT WE'VE SEEN TODAY.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.497
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING 

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.699
ABOUT HOW MANY TRUCKS HAVE BEEN 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:27.634
GATHERING AT THE BORDER OVER THE

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:29.102
LAST FEW DAYS IN ANTICIPATION 

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:32.272
FOR THIS TRUCE TO KICK IN.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.806
BECAUSE THERE IS AN 

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:35.041
UNDERSTANDING OF JUST HOW MANY 

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:36.576
DELAYS OCCUR BECAUSE OF THE 

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:37.844
CHECKPOINTS, BECAUSE THEY NEED 

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:39.912
TO FIGURE OUT THE LOGISTICS.

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.848
NOT ONLY ON THE EGYPTIAN SIDE, 

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:43.383
BUT ALSO ONCE THEY CROSS OVER 

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:44.684
INTO GAZA.

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.619
90 AID TRUCKS HAVE NOW GONE INTO

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.087
THE GAZA SIDE OF THE BORDER, 

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:49.055
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.990
SO THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH THE 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.891
INITIAL CHECKPOINTS, THEY THEN 

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:54.227
GET CHECKED ON THE ISRAELI SIDE 

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:55.261
AS WELL.

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:58.765
AND THEN OFFLOADED AND MOVED 

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.033
STRAIGHT INTO GAZA.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:01.968
SEVEN FUEL TRUCKS AS WELL GOING 

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:02.969
IN.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.972
IDF SAY THAT THE GAS QUOTA THAT 

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.206
HAS GONE IN ALREADY TODAY IS 

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:10.209
SPECIFICALLY FOR COOKING 

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:11.944
PURPOSES FOR HUMANITARIAN NEEDS 

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:12.879
AND HUMANITARIAN INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.047
THEY HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR TO SAY

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:16.182
THAT THIS WAS PART OF THE DEAL.

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:18.518
OVERALL OVER FOUR DAYS, 200 AID 

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:20.987
TRUCKS ARE EXPECTED GO IN, 

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.556
130,000 LITERS OF DIESEL FUEL 

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:24.924
TOGETHER WITH OTHER GAS TRUCKS 

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:26.826
AS WELL EXPECTED TO GO IN.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.227
YOU'VE REITERATED THE POINT IT 

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:31.831
IS A FRACTION OF THE NEEDS EVEN 

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.566
QATARIS SAY THAT YESTERDAY, YOU 

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:36.135
KNOW, THE TESTIMONIES WE'VE 

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:37.537
HEARD FROM PEOPLE INSIDE OF 

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:38.604
GAZA, THAT THEY WERE SCRAMBLING 

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:40.473
FOR JUST PIECES OF BREAD, 

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:42.275
RUNNING OUT OF WATER, DRINKING 

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:44.377
DIRTY WATER AND OF COURSE 

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:46.646
DISEASES PLAYING OUT RIGHT NOW 

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:48.147
WHICH HAS CREATED ANOTHER LAYER 

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:50.249
OF THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:56.456
WE ALSO HAVE HEARD

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.790
EGYPTIANS THAT PALESTINIANS 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.459
STRANDED IN EGYPT, IF THEY WISH 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.427
TO RETURN TO GAZA, THEY ARE ABLE

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:03.629
TO DO SO THROUGH RAFAH.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.932
THAT IS QUITE IMPORTANT TO 

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:06.299
REMEMBER.

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:07.400
WE'VE HEARD SOME MOVEMENT ON 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.102
THAT THAT IT COULD BE OCCURRING 

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:09.469
TODAY.

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.403
INJURED PALESTINIANS ARE COMING 

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:14.340
THROUGH THE RAFAH BORDER, SO TOO

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.408
ARE FOREIGN NATIONALS AND DUAL 

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:16.609
PASSPORT HOLDERS.

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:18.010
JUST TODAY SEEING SOME OF THE 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.212
IMAGES GOING THROUGH, THERE WERE

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.513
ACTUALLY BANNERS ON SOME OF 

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:22.715
THESE TRUCKS THAT READ TOGETHER 

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.150
FOR HUMANITY AND THEN ALSO FOR 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.453
OUR BROTHERS IN GAZA.

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:30.123
SO EVERYONE TRYING TO TAKE AN 

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:31.224
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WINDOW THAT 

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.826
HAS OPENED UP, BUT THE 

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.695
LOGISTICAL SIDE WE SHOULD NOT 

00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:37.830
FORGET WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.066
AID DISTRIBUTED IN THE SOUTH OF 

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.667
GAZA IN THE VERY LEAST.

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.469
&gt;&gt; AND SPEAKING TO OXFAM 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:46.339
EARLIER, THEY WERE DESCRIBING 

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.373
HOW THEY HAVE THIS HUGE 

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:48.107
CHALLENGE BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:50.643
OF AID AGENCIES THAT WERE USING 

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:51.744
CROSSINGS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND 

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:53.379
GAZA IN THE PAST, AND THEY HAVE 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.014
HAD TO MOVE ALL OF THEIR 

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:56.249
LOGISTICS, ALL OF THEIR 

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.717
OPERATIONS INTO EGYPT, WHICH HAS

00:06:57.717 --> 00:07:00.753
BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE.

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:01.888
SO THIS HASN'T BEEN EASY GETTING

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:06.859
THOSE TRUCKS THERE FOR A START.

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:07.960
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YEAH, EXACTLY.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.362
AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS 

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:11.197
THAT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IS 

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:15.968
JUST CAN WE GET MORE AID INTO 

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:16.402
GAZA.

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:18.538
BUT IT IS THE WAREHOUSING AND 

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:25.411
LOGISTICAL SIDE OF  CHAINS THAT 

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:26.612
THINK OF.

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.080
AND THEY HAVE TO BE OFFLOADED 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.116
INTO TRUCKS BY THE RED CRESCENT.

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.118
SO THERE IS SO MANY ELEMENTS TO 

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.053
THIS AND IT IS ALSO THE 

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:36.289
CHECKPOINTS THAT REALLY SLOW 

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:36.823
THINGS DOWN.

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:43.029
U.N. FAR IT INMARTIN GRIFFITH S 

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:45.398
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN A PART OF 

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:47.967
THE DEAL IN TERMS OF THE FUEL 

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:48.901
QUESTION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT 

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.703
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STICKING POINT

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:52.138
BECAUSE IT COULD END UP IN THE 

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.506
HANDS OF HAMAS.

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:54.540
&gt;&gt; ELENI GIOKOS, THANK YOU.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.275
WE'LL BE WITH YOU WITHOUT THE 

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:58.311
DAY AS THE AID TRICKLES IN.
