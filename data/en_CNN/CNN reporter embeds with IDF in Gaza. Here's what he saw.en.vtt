00:00:06.782 --> 00:00:08.918
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tonight, CNN is getting a

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:10.886
closer look at military

00:00:11.287 --> 00:00:13.689
operations in gaza.

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:16.292
We reported under an escort at

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:17.826
all times.

00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:21.297
At a condition, media outlets

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.799
must submit footage filmed in

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.303
gaza to the military for review.

00:00:27.303 --> 00:00:28.537
CNN did not submit its script to

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:30.706
the idf and had editorial

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.641
control over the final report.

00:00:32.808 --> 00:00:36.312
Let's bring in Oren Liebermann.

00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:42.318
Tell us what you saw.

00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:44.720
&gt;&gt; Reporter: Wolf, first, it's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.488
nearly impossible to get into

00:00:46.622 --> 00:00:48.324
gaza, so the chance to see what

00:00:48.324 --> 00:00:50.326
was happening was given to us by

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:53.929
the idf who took us in with a

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.731
tank about a mile in.

00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:58.334
Not only the progress they say

00:00:58.334 --> 00:01:00.636
they're making, but the

00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:02.338
challenges they face in a war

00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:03.372
that's very much hot.

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:05.941
Through the breach, we entered

00:01:06.342 --> 00:01:08.344
northern gaza at the border

00:01:08.477 --> 00:01:08.777
crossing.

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:10.779
The land once fertile farmland

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:11.847
is baron.

00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:13.649
The trees that might have

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:14.917
provided enemy cover is

00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:16.352
destroyed the in the distance,

00:01:16.418 --> 00:01:18.520
smoke from an Israeli air strike

00:01:18.654 --> 00:01:21.357
is a stark reminder these day 34

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:23.359
of a war that may stretch much

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.559
longer.

00:01:23.692 --> 00:01:26.362
On Thursday, the idf chief of

00:01:26.362 --> 00:01:27.796
staff and head of internal

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:29.365
security service entered gaza

00:01:29.398 --> 00:01:29.965
and promised strength through

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:35.904
coop.

00:01:36.038 --> 00:01:37.439
Cooperation everyone is doing

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.010
Everly just so you can be as

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:44.380
strong as possible, the general

00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:44.613
said.

00:01:44.713 --> 00:01:49.451
Along our path, the signs of

00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:52.388
civilian life have given to the

00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:54.757
constant hum of drones.

00:01:54.857 --> 00:01:55.557
Our time at the coordination

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:58.394
base for the border cross, first

00:01:58.527 --> 00:02:00.529
international media to visit the

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:04.500
site, the terror attack was hit hard here, the scars of machine

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:07.403
gun fire and rpgs still visible.

00:02:07.436 --> 00:02:10.005
The base was mostly empty on the

00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:12.474
holiday, but not entirely.

00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:14.043
Nine soldiers were killed here,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.544
and three kidnapped.

00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:19.615
It took 12 hours for Israel to

00:02:19.748 --> 00:02:21.417
gain control of the base.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.420
A Monday into the war, more than

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.421
10,000 Palestinians have been

00:02:25.421 --> 00:02:28.624
killed in Israeli attacks on

00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:31.627
gaza, according to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.428
hamas-controlled health ministry

00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:34.430
there.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.432
The idf says 35 soldiers have

00:02:36.432 --> 00:02:37.499
been killed in the strip since

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:39.435
the start of the incursion.

00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:41.437
The October 7th attack killed

00:02:41.437 --> 00:02:41.870
more than 1400 people, mostly

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.775
civilians.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:51.447
We stop at an overlook near the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.451
town of jabaliya.

00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:57.086
There's a meeting point of three

00:02:57.453 --> 00:02:57.686
different tunnels.

00:02:57.853 --> 00:03:00.456
That's one, two, three.

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.925
They came together here and it

00:03:03.092 --> 00:03:05.828
let hamas move underground

00:03:05.994 --> 00:03:08.630
quickly below the feet and out

00:03:08.797 --> 00:03:10.032
of sight.

00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:14.470
Colonel tal says there were many

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.505
explosive, many trencheses we

00:03:16.672 --> 00:03:21.610
found a storage site with many

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.010
explosives.

00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:24.480
Even from a distance, the scale

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.714
of destruction is stunning.

00:03:25.848 --> 00:03:32.554
Homes, neighborhoods decimated.

00:03:32.654 --> 00:03:35.757
Colonel tal says the area is

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.926
nearly evacuated.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.761
We see sometimes terrorists, but

00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:42.498
the majority of civilians

00:03:42.498 --> 00:03:43.799
haven't been here for a while.

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:46.068
As we talk, we hear rocket fire

00:03:46.502 --> 00:03:49.505
and see the trails of the

00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:51.707
launches triggering red alerts.

00:03:51.874 --> 00:03:54.510
About 90 minutes inside northern

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.513
gaza, we hug the border wall for

00:03:57.513 --> 00:03:57.546
safety.

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:59.181
Even here so close to the exit,

00:03:59.515 --> 00:04:01.150
we stop briefly to make sure the

00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:02.518
way ahead is safe.

00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:03.519
In the distance once again, the

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.856
smoke from another strike.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.092
The idf spokesperson said the

00:04:10.526 --> 00:04:12.895
ground operation in gaza will

00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:15.097
only deepen as Israel has said

00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:18.534
it's largely encircled the city,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.702
and wolf, I also spoke with the

00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:22.538
commander about the humanitarian

00:04:22.538 --> 00:04:24.106
corridor we talked about so much

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.973
earlier today.

00:04:25.107 --> 00:04:27.676
He said they're aware of the

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:28.710
humanitarian corridor.

00:04:28.877 --> 00:04:30.546
He knows when it is and where it

00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:30.612
is.

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:32.614
Even in the middle of the war,

00:04:32.714 --> 00:04:34.550
he knows you don't shoot in that

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.552
direction, even as the war wages

00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:38.153
around them in other parts.

00:04:38.554 --> 00:04:42.224
&gt;&gt; Oren, thanks for that report.

00:04:42.558 --> 00:04:43.959
&gt;&gt;&gt; Joining me now to discuss

00:04:44.126 --> 00:04:46.161
all the news out of the middle

00:04:46.562 --> 00:04:46.862
East, the national security

00:04:46.962 --> 00:04:48.564
council coordinator for

00:04:48.564 --> 00:04:50.766
strategic communication, retired

00:04:50.933 --> 00:04:52.568
admiral John Kirby.

00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:54.837
Thanks for joining us.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.572
First, I said to get to the

00:04:56.572 --> 00:04:58.574
daily four-hour pauses now being

00:04:58.574 --> 00:05:00.776
reported in northern gaza to

00:05:00.943 --> 00:05:02.978
allow civilians to flee south.

00:05:03.078 --> 00:05:04.580
How will the pauses work?

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.582
And have the Israelis fully

00:05:06.582 --> 00:05:07.850
committed to them?

00:05:07.983 --> 00:05:09.585
&gt;&gt; They have fully committed to

00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:09.885
them.

00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:11.587
The way it would work, about

00:05:11.587 --> 00:05:12.888
three hours before the pauses

00:05:12.988 --> 00:05:15.591
will begin, the Israelis will

00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:19.595
notify, through a variety of

00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:20.863
means, civilization, the pause

00:05:20.996 --> 00:05:23.599
will start, here is when, and

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.767
advice on the safest passage

00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:26.068
out.

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.604
They have added a second safe

00:05:28.604 --> 00:05:30.772
passage corridor, humanitarian

00:05:30.906 --> 00:05:32.207
corridor, they call it, out of

00:05:32.608 --> 00:05:34.610
northern gaza along the coast

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.110
road.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.678
That's one more than they had

00:05:36.812 --> 00:05:38.614
before, in just the last few

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.814
days.

00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:40.616
This is a step in the right

00:05:40.616 --> 00:05:40.883
direction.

00:05:41.016 --> 00:05:43.118
This could help reduivil

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:46.822
usage casualties by giving

00:05:46.922 --> 00:05:48.090
people the confidence and time

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:54.897
to move out of harm's way.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.632
&gt;&gt; John, is there really

00:05:56.632 --> 00:05:59.635
anywhere in gaza that's safe for

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:01.036
Palestinian civilians?

00:06:01.203 --> 00:06:03.038
We're told almost half of them

00:06:03.138 --> 00:06:03.705
are children.

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:05.841
&gt;&gt; Well, hamas is placing those

00:06:05.941 --> 00:06:08.210
children and those families in

00:06:08.644 --> 00:06:09.945
harm's way by tunnelling under

00:06:10.112 --> 00:06:12.848
their apartment complexes, using

00:06:13.015 --> 00:06:14.650
their hospitals and schools as

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.118
command bunkers.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.819
They place them directly in

00:06:17.953 --> 00:06:20.656
harm's way between the idf and

00:06:20.656 --> 00:06:20.756
hamas.

00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:23.659
These safe corridors, and they

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:24.860
pauses, this breathing space in

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.829
time for people to get out

00:06:27.963 --> 00:06:29.665
should help alleviate some of

00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:31.266
the anxiety and the worry that
