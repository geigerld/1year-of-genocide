00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.900
US military now

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.370
what it calls the heart of Gaza City.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.903
They said today

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:05.972
it destroyed more tunnels used by Hamas.

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:06.973
According to the IDF,

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:08.208
these tunnels were located near

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.777
a school sponsored by the UN.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:11.945
The IDF also announced

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:12.679
they had destroyed

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.247
at least 130 tunnel shafts

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.782
since the start of the war.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:16.683
Prime Minister Benjamin

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.084
Netanyahu said earlier this week

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:18.518
that Israel

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.719
would maintain security

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:20.820
over the Gaza Strip for,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.722
quote, an indefinite period.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:23.890
For Germany, Diamond has more,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.058
including new footage of what

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:29.429
that urban combat looks like.

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:30.563
An Israeli armored

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:31.765
vehicle advances

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.768
through the Al-Shati refugee camp,

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.804
but an ambush awaits.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.739
Moments earlier, the same video

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.107
shows a Hamas fighter

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.576
armed with a rocket propelled grenade

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:46.913
moving slowly from behind the rubble.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.314
These are Hamas

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:49.582
propaganda videos

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.018
from the perspective of its fighters

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:53.353
showing Hamas militants

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.788
peering around buildings

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.089
and through the rubble

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.659
before striking armored vehicles.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:00.560
CNN has

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.828
geolocated several

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.663
videos released in recent days

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:04.931
to northern Gaza

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.166
in Beit Hanoun,

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.135
a Tatra and the Shati refugee camp

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.970
indicating Hamas is likely

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.239
still mounting attacks in areas.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.009
Israeli forces entered over a week ago.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.143
The videos provide

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.045
a limited window into the group's

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.380
guerrilla tactics

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.115
and the threats Israeli forces

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.751
face as they move deeper into Gaza.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:25.418
As we are moving

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.486
in, we're

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:29.155
fighting more and more close combat urban

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:32.158
combat type engagements.

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.626
The Israeli military says

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.161
its forces have encircled

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.329
and are now operating

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.431
in the heart of Gaza City,

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.032
where they face

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:41.935
the dangers of dense urban combat

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.803
and a vast network of tunnels

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:46.406
Hamas fighters are using to sneak up

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.907
on Israeli forces.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.609
The nature of urban warfare is that,

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.009
you know,

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.010
they go down a tunnel

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.078
and come up somewhere else.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.313
And that is exactly why

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:54.080
we are moving slowly.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.981
We're not advancing.

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.349
We're not rushing into this.

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:59.119
We're taking strategic positions.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.086
Israeli forces

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:00.887
say they've destroyed

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:02.589
130 Hamas tunnels,

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.390
shafts like this one

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.392
since launching their ground offensive.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.260
We're just scratching

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.428
the surface of that.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:12.265
But many more still remain.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:13.433
German Dymond joins us now.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.734
What's the latest on evacuation

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:18.438
options for civilians in Gaza?

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.306
Well, Anderson, in recent days, tens

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.075
of thousands of Palestinian

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.344
civilians have use those evacuation

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:25.411
corridors established

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.946
by the Israeli military

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.915
over the last several days to flee south.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.049
In fact, just today,

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.584
according to the United Nations.

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.553
50,000 people took advantage

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:34.821
of a five hour window

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:35.522
to evacuate

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.323
south using Salahadin Road,

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.791
one of the main arteries

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.927
going north south in the Gaza Strip.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.495
And all of this, Anderson, comes

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.463
not only as the Israeli

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:44.531
military is ramping up

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.533
its military operations in northern Gaza,

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:47.367
but also,

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.269
of course, as the humanitarian situation

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.703
there has grown worse.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.172
Access to clean water

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.339
is extremely limited.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.474
Hospitals are running

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:55.608
out of medical supplies,

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:56.910
running out of fuel

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.511
to carry out even basic

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.914
operational matters.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:02.282
And Israeli officials are,

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:02.649
of course,

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:03.950
ramping up their ground

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.452
offensive in northern Gaza.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:07.353
Israeli officials

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:08.788
now saying that Israeli

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:09.923
troops are operating

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.791
in the heart of Gaza City,

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.426
pressing forward with this advance

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:15.228
as the Israeli prime minister vows

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:16.362
no cease fire

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.531
unless hostages are released Anderson.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.799
Jeremy Diamond, thanks so much.

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.167
Many Palestinian Americans

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:22.168
who made it out of Gaza

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.870
are just now getting home,

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.572
facing a very particular heartache.

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.173
The relief obviously, to be safe,

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:28.141
but worried every moment

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.342
about their friends and family

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.810
who are not.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.212
My next guests are Americans who,

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.246
along with their almost two year

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.315
old son, were in Gaza on October seven,

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:36.149
visiting family.

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.450
They just got back to their home,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.818
Massachusetts, rather.

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:40.653
Earlier this week,

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:43.489
Abood Okal and Wafaa

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.660
Abouzeid to join us now.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.394
Welcome home.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.797
First of all, how do you feel?

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.732
Are you exhausted?

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.500
We feel

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.503
I had a mixed feeling, to be honest.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:04:01.074
I feel I'm happy because we're safe here.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.342
We're back.

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.410
But our

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.347
thinking

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.949
minds

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:10.950
in Gaza,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.186
because I still have my parents

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:14.988
over there, Abu Experience.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.991
I'm still over there.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.661
We take them every every minute

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:25.098
to make sure they're okay.

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:28.601
We made it here just because of Yousef.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.670
I want to make sure he's. He's okay.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.871
He is of his. Your.

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.140
Your baby. Yousef is my baby. He's.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.709
He's going to turn two years next.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:38.111
Next month.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.812
You got home in time for his birthday?

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.247
Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.148
What was.

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:44.617
You had gone there both to visit family,

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:45.618
and you had spent

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:46.386
a couple of weeks there.

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.453
Obviously, you had no idea

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:50.456
this all was about to happen.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.425
When did you realize?

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:53.926
Was it on the morning of October 7th

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:56.129
that you realized something has happened?

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.330
Exactly. Yeah.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.998
I think that October 7th, we

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:02.402
it was 6:00 in the morning local time.

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:06.205
And I think I remember hearing

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:07.740
sounds of rockets launching.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.309
And I woke up

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.012
Wafa and I said, I think that is

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:14.380
the sound of rockets.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.848
And we checked out the windows

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:17.483
and indeed it was.

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:18.584
And then a few minutes later,

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.687
we were trying to look at news and

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:23.256
and then it was unclear at the beginning.

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:24.857
But then in a couple of hours

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:26.259
as news rolled out of of

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.161
what was happening that day,

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.531
we realized that we are we are in trouble

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:34.600
and that this is this is a

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.102
this is going to be a big event.

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:37.570
What was that going south?

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.371
Was it difficult?

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:39.972
And once you actually got together

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:42.241
and headed down there, it was chaotic.

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.443
I think

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.344
early that day

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.945
when we heard the announcement

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:47.380
by the IDF to head south,

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.282
there was no timeline given.

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:50.650
There were no specific instructions

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.454
other than just go to South of Wadi Reza,

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.621
which is basically Gaza

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:58.057
Valley, a landmark.

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:01.060
So everyone scrambled at this point.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.694
I mean, did

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.930
you think the border might still be open?

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.130
Because I

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.565
mean, there was so much misinformation,

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:06.299
so much

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:06.766
I mean, people

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:07.867
didn't know what was going on,

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.302
but that Rafah border

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:10.937
has been shut this whole time.

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.672
So did you think you could

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:14.540
get out at that point or just thought,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.342
get south and we'll figure it out?

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:17.877
Yeah, we tried a couple of times

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.612
going to Rafah border,

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:21.280
but every time we wait

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.149
for a couple of hours

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:25.718
and the gate, it's not opening,

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:27.553
so I'll leave.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:28.154
And you were

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:28.821
you were a house

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:30.790
staying with dozens of other people.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.125
Yeah. 40 people.

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.559
40 people. 40 people.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.793
Yeah.

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:35.128
We used to share everything

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:36.429
with 40 people

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:38.264
and getting supplies and things.

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:39.766
What was that like?

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.300
It was so difficult.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.101
It was.

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.937
You had a Your baby needs milk.

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:45.338
Oh, yeah.

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:47.340
Even that is even that.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.275
Yeah. We.

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:52.445
We used to wake up every morning

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:53.880
thinking about, like, how

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.950
we're going to get water, bread, food

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.019
a boy would use to go with his brother,

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:04.357
waiting on the line, getting water and

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.993
and bread and come back

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:09.996
after seven, 6 hours

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:13.566
with one gallon of water for 40 people

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:18.237
and then like pieces of bread,

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:20.072
it's not enough for 40 people.

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:21.474
So we used to share

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.810
with what with the child's.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.977
I mean, I think about it.

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:29.682
I mean, obviously all those kids,

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:31.951
which was he was really scared.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:32.151
I mean,

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:36.489
what was his sense of what was going on?

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:39.158
I don't myself, I have to be

00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:40.493
relaxed

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:42.261
when I when I hear all the sounds.

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:44.764
So I started to teach him, okay,

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.532
this is what you hear.

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:47.700
This is a fireworks.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.335
Remember the 4th of July?

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:52.805
It's the same thing.

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:53.239
I don't

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:56.242
know if I don't think he trusted me.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.510
I don't think he believed

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.812
that this is a fireworks.

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:00.513
And there's some point.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:02.215
The middle ground.

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:02.782
At some point.

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:04.016
The milk did run out. Yeah.

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:04.350
Yeah.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.986
The we are now in the beginning

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.622
because I knew it's

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:11.924
we're going to run out at some point.

00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:15.695
So I started to reduce has his bottle

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:16.829
like from

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:20.366
pole model to half bottle giving him.

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:23.536
So the last five days or a week

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:28.841
so we run completely out of milk.

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.677
I used to give him water instead of milk.

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:34.080
It's got to be this

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.182
strange feeling of being relieved

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:36.782
that you're out.

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:38.317
And yet

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:39.819
your family's there.

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.521
We're still processing

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.456
what we experienced.

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.490
I can't believe.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.425
I can't believe our short trip

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:48.694
just turned to the nightmare.

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:51.130
And even though we're physically out,

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.532
I think mentally we're still there.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.234
I think at some points

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:56.435
it cannot be a worse

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:57.503
to be on the outside.

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:58.371
Nothing is worse

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:01.040
than being inside of Gaza right now.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.742
Whether if you're not dying

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:04.043
from from the airstrikes

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:06.012
or shelling, you're you're

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:07.246
you're at higher risk of dying

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:09.582
because of dehydrate and lack of food.

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:10.483
And and

00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:12.251
despite that little aid that's coming

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:14.587
in, it's it's not really making.

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:16.722
It's not moving the needle.

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:17.557
Well, thank you so much.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.859
I'm so glad your your your back. And I'm.

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:21.427
But I understand that

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:21.994
that tug

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:24.530
and that feel of family left behind.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.098
I'm sorry that.

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:27.233
That you have that.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.569
Thanks for having us. Yeah, Thank you.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.269
Thank you, Anderson.
