00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.534
British surgeon doctor Nick

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:03.203
Maynard is just back from Gaza,

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:04.738
where he saw the collapsing health

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.639
care system with his own eyes.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:07.507
He left Rafah

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.809
just before Israel's offensive began,

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:10.944
and he's joining me here

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:11.845
now in the studio.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.747
Doctor Maynard, welcome to the program.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:14.981
Thank you very much for asking me.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.951
I'm you left and I'm just going to

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:19.452
read what you said

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.020
because you left

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.489
just as the Israeli incursion began.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.290
You told Reuters that you heard bombs

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.392
and gunfire all over

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.760
driving through Rafah.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.661
The tension was palpable with people

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.664
evacuating as rapidly as they could.

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:32.999
You saw some of that attempt

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.068
to evacuate in Jeremy's package.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.069
There.

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.070
What did you see?

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.772
And what is the status of people

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.373
who just want to get out of the way?

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.741
So they issued

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.543
the initial evacuation orders

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.377
about two hours

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.612
before we left for the crossing,

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:49.015
and we saw hundreds of people

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:51.451
rushing out of their

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.519
I was going to say houses.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.153
They're not houses.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:53.453
Of course,

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.587
these people have been displaced

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:55.188
many times.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:57.891
So they were leaving their very temporary

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.259
shelters, their

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:02.796
makeshift tents, their tarps in shelters,

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.798
gathering their belongings

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:06.166
together, going in cars,

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.133
some of them walking,

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.601
some of them going on a cart

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.570
with donkeys and rushing out. And it was

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.106
very distressing to see them

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.507
leaving so urgently

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.142
because that this for some of them,

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.078
this is the fifth, sixth or seventh time

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.580
they've done that in the last six months.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.581
You were leaving as well.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.583
What was it like for you? Is it?

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:23.883
I mean,

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.618
did you get you obviously out safely,

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:26.319
but was it

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.754
dangerous as you were trying to get out?

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:28.488
So we

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:29.022
we didn't

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:30.056
think we were going to get that.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:31.458
We were initially turned away.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.726
So we went back to the temple.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.428
What we were advised to leave.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:36.696
So there was ongoing

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:38.164
discussions between

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.232
the the medical aid,

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.834
the Palestinian ground staff

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:43.837
and CogAT, the liaison part of the IDF.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.271
And so they initially decided

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.206
for security reasons,

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:48.341
we should go back to the house.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.443
But then we left again late morning,

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:51.744
got to the crossing

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:54.581
as the bombings were intensifying.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.150
So we were surrounded by bombs

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.385
going off really virtually nonstop.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:02.689
And there was very difficult decisions

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:03.223
to be made

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:06.192
about whether we should carry on with our

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.961
planned departure

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.095
or whether we should turn around,

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:10.463
because it was getting too dangerous.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.865
But we did stay

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.099
and we managed to get out.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:14.501
you were

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:15.835
warned in March, actually,

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:17.270
before the Rafah operation

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.404
started, certainly before,

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:18.771
you know that

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.607
if a ground invasion happened,

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.842
a ground incursion of some sort,

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.711
it would be apocalyptic.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.012
And Gaza's health ministry

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.514
said in a statement

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:30.517
now, particularly after the Sunday

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.686
attack, there is no hospital in Rafah

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:34.888
with enough capacity

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:35.822
to take this number

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.056
of killed and injured,

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.491
causing confusion amongst

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:39.626
ambulance teams

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:42.629
on where to transfer them.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.398
Give us a layout of what

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:46.666
hospitals remain,

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.836
what don't anywhere near by these places

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.639
that are, you know, under IDF attack.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.607
So? So Rafah is a small town.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.609
It has a population of 1

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.777
to 200,000 people,

00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:58.678
normally as

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.313
it has two hospitals, one government

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.948
hospital, another hospital

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:03.483
which normally has a capacity

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.018
of about 60 beds,

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.386
and a small hospital

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:07.587
called the Shetty Hospital,

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:08.555
which has been in the news

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.123
a lot in the last few days,

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.291
which has a capacity

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.060
normally of 15 one five beds.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.929
So they have very limited beds.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.564
They've got a bigger hospital

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.266
between Rafah and Hand, Unesco,

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.534
the European Gaza Hospital,

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:22.235
which I've worked

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.836
in a lot over the years,

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.171
which is surrounded

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.739
by the Israeli ground forces,

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.574
as very difficult

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:29.042
for patients to get that.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.643
So effectively,

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:33.980
there are no hospitals for these patients

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.414
to go to.

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:35.582
There are some field

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:36.683
hospitals have been set up,

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.085
but the number of acute beds

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:41.621
available to take these patients is very,

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:42.522
very few.

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:43.723
And have you been in touch

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.825
with any colleagues

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.126
in the medical profession

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.194
or anybody in Rafah

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:49.095
since you've left,

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:50.964
particularly in the last few days? Yeah.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:51.264
I mean,

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.465
I spoke yesterday

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:53.700
to a dear friend of mine

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.902
who's an operating theater nurse

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:58.571
who almost to the day a year ago,

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.473
I was operating within the theaters

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:02.175
in European Gaza Hospital.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.376
She stayed in Rafah.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:04.944
She and her husband are living there.

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.012
They don't want to leave.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.247
And she said to me yesterday

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.414
she would rather die,

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.950
and she expects to die in her home.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.552
And she's not going to leave.

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:13.219
I haven't been able to

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.254
get hold of her today

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.955
and she hasn't answered any message,

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:17.991
so I don't know what's happened to her.

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.726
Half a family has been killed

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:21.494
in the last few months.

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:22.495
I've got a close friend

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:23.796
who's a doctor who's out there,

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.365
and I've been speaking to them regularly.

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:28.701
But the the the words we used a few weeks

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.837
ago of this being apocalyptic,

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.171
it absolutely is.

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:33.973
There are many people being killed.

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:36.442
There are those that have been evacuated,

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.778
have been forced to go to Al Malaki,

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.913
which is an area I know well.

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.715
There are already hundreds

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:44.250
of thousands of people there.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.451
They've had to accommodate

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:48.021
nearly a million extra people.

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:49.088
And there is nothing.

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:52.392
There almost is a thin stretch of sand

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.428
and wasteland divided by a

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.463
road with no facilities at all.

00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:00.733
So the idea that you can accommodate it

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.903
in any sort of safe way, another million

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:05.772
people, is, is fanciful.

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.573
You're a doctor, you're a surgeon,

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:09.275
and you've worked in Gaza for

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:10.176
for some ten years.

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:11.778
You've been going back and forth

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:14.080
through other wars, presumably.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.114
I want to ask you this

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:15.748
because you saw

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:16.416
in Jeremy

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:17.150
Diamond's report

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.485
that they saw the weapons,

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:22.488
they were described as slightly less,

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.091
huge and powerful,

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.826
perhaps to try to mitigate

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.227
civilian damage.

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:31.130
These are American made weapons.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.131
but from a doctor's

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:33.733
point of view, particularly as he said,

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:36.703
Jeremy, in a in a densely populated zone,

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:38.971
a light weapon, a light bomb,

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.273
a heavy bomb is going to create

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.809
a huge amount of civilian destruction.

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:43.876
What would you

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:46.112
what can you say about the weapons

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:46.813
that are used to

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:49.716
Gaza has got a population of 2.2 million.

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:50.917
It is the most densely

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:53.653
populated place in the world.

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:56.289
I was there last May operating.

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.390
I'm a cancer surgeon.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.991
I was operating on cancer patients,

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:00.560
part of the Map program,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.696
and it was the last big bombardment

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:06.366
before October the 7th beginning of May.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.867
And I was stuck there.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.035
They closed the borders

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.237
and we had to be evacuated eventually.

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:12.939
But I witnessed for four days

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.274
this nonstop bombardment,

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:19.312
and it was an incredible demonstration

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.980
of how precise

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.882
the bombing can be

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.417
when the Israeli Defense Force

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:25.418
want to do that.

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:26.452
They were targeting

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:27.954
specific rooms

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:30.223
and building specific floors,

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.958
and there was collateral damage

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.659
but minimal collateral damage

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:34.193
at that time.

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:35.194
So I've witnessed

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:38.331
firsthand how precise their targeting

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.432
can be.

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:41.934
Move forward to post October the 7th.

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:44.103
I was there over Christmas and New Year,

00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:45.338
and I witnessed

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:46.839
I watched

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.674
the indiscriminate bombing

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:49.842
of large

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:52.011
populations in the surrounding camps

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:53.212
in Daryl Balad,

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:54.981
where I was staying for two weeks.

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.784
So I've witnessed two extremes.

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:59.552
I've seen how precision,

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:01.821
how precise their targeting can be,

00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:02.488
and I've seen

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:03.689
how indiscriminate it's going to be.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.358
And there's no doubt in my mind

00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:07.193
that what we've seen since October

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:09.595
the 7th is indiscriminate

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:12.598
killing of large populations, civilian

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:14.133
large populations.

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:15.768
You know, they deny that every time.

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:17.303
And they say over and over again

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:18.538
that we are doing our best

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:19.372
to minimize civilian.

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:22.475
And they say, what do you expect if

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:24.844
the Hamas terrorist

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:25.912
organization, as they say

00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:26.913
they're fighting,

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:28.915
is using human shields,

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.516
is using Gazans to

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:31.684
to shield themselves

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:34.620
from any kind of retaliation or action?

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.688
What do you say about that?

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:38.691
Well, I've I've not witnessed that.

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:41.861
I think if it's difficult for me

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:42.562
to understand

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:43.930
how anyone can claim that

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.667
killing 35 civilians is a proportionate

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:50.670
response to, to, to to events earlier,

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.806
but you mean 35,000 35,000 people?

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:55.842
I've not witnessed

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:57.109
what they've describing.

00:07:57.109 --> 00:07:59.111
And perhaps more importantly than that,

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:00.313
my friends and colleagues

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:03.349
who I have spoken to daily

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:03.850
since October

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.184
the 7th, have lived out there

00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:06.385
with them for several weeks

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:08.287
and then do not

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:11.290
provide any evidence to support that.

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.259
They would say that they're there.

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.393
They live in these,

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:15.728
whatever the underground

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.096
or in buildings or whatever.

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:17.997
That's what they would say.

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.031
But it's interesting

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:20.600
what you said about witnessing

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.101
very targeted

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:23.236
and witnessing something

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:24.670
that's much less targeted.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:25.972
I want to ask you specific

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:27.907
specifically in your,

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:29.141
you know, your your domain

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:31.244
about the health, system.

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:32.778
I mean, I can just read you

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:34.013
and you'll tell me much more.

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:37.016
I mean, Kamel at one hospital, you know,

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.284
dozens of medical staff

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:40.086
is taken to an undisclosed location.

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:42.455
Location? That was in December last year.

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:43.422
The IDF says takes

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.824
all feasible precautions

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.559
to mitigate harm, etc..

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.328
Nasser Hospital, February of this year.

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:50.596
70 health care workers

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:52.031
in the medical complex arrested

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:53.399
by Israeli forces,

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:55.001
80 patients transferred out.

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:56.802
They said they had apprehended

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:58.204
hundreds of Hamas militants.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.171
Al-Shifa hospital.

00:08:59.171 --> 00:08:59.906
We know what's happened.

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:01.974
There is completely, a ruin.

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.209
They said they were going after

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.244
Hamas targets underneath and tunnels.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.648
did you ever come across

00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:09.515
anything suspicious?

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:11.417
Did you ever ask any of your

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:13.419
actually the directors of the hospitals,

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:14.620
the people who would be there

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.821
when you're not there,

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:18.791
whether there was any threat from,

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.026
you know, a militant group

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.794
using their premises?

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:22.495
I did,

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:24.463
and I can only really vouch

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:25.631
for what I have witnessed.

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:27.633
And what close friends and colleagues

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:28.234
have said.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.502
I've been in these hospitals

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:31.537
on many occasions,

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:33.739
before October the 7th, but also since

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.374
then I have never witnessed.

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:37.577
I've never seen any evidence of Hamas

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.878
militants in these hospitals.

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:41.247
And my close friends and colleagues,

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.281
some of whom I've known

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:43.816
for nearly 15 years,

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.051
I've asked them repeatedly,

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:46.619
and they've never witnessed any of this.

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:47.186
Now, clearly,

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:48.421
I cannot

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.356
provide any evidence of what goes on in

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:51.958
any tunnels underneath.

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:52.692
I've never seen them.

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:54.560
But if you take Shifa Hospital

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.563
as an example, which I know very well, I.

00:09:57.563 --> 00:09:58.864
I've been to every square

00:09:58.864 --> 00:09:59.865
inch that hospital.

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:00.800
I've never seen

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.803
any restricted access at all

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:05.137
to any parts of the hospitals.

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:06.939
So I've seen no evidence

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:07.840
of what they describe.
