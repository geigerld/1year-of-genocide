00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.468
We have a powerful interview

00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:02.569
to share with you now.

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.437
I first spoke with Gully Dunne

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.806
when I was in Israel last November.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.041
Her 18 year old daughter,

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.976
Mayan, was murdered by Hamas

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:12.612
on October 7th in front of her family.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:14.314
Hamas then held the dozens

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.783
at gunpoint on the floor of their kitchen

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:17.650
for hours,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.618
live streaming

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:20.587
the whole thing on Facebook.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.255
The ordeal ended with Hamas

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:23.223
kidnaping gullies.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:26.226
Husband Zaki Gali and I spoke again

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.161
in northern Israel this week.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.896
We talked at length about the pain

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:30.930
she's endured.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.165
Her plea for officials

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.700
to reach a hostage deal,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.300
and her hope

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.235
that she will see her

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.238
husband alive again.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.307
Thank you very much for talking to us.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.742
It's been almost a year

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:45.278
since we last had this conversation.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.546
First of all, how are you doing?

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:51.384
Good question.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.586
in my worst nightmares,

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.589
I wouldn't believe that we are meeting

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.293
in this situation where nothing changed.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:02.228
Actually.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.763
Charlie's feeling the Hamas.

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.432
Charlie Dunne, your husband?

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:06.766
Yeah. 50 years old.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.469
He was kidnaped by Hamas.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:10.070
And your daughter?

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.638
My young, 18 years old.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.573
She was murdered that day. Yeah.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.275
And you've been living with that?

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.610
Both of those enormous,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.346
enormous tragedies all this time?

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:20.880
Yes.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.983
It's been 313

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.986
days of hell.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:30.223
we are out of breath.

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:32.759
Just like them in captivity

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.963
and being hostage by by Hamas,

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:40.767
which are terrorists and murderers.

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:44.237
He was kidnaped and taken to Gaza.

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:45.371
What's the latest

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:48.007
you've heard about his condition?

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.010
The latest was, it's,

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.680
end of November,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.582
when,

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:58.585
the release of, the hostages last release

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:00.620
of hostages from Gaza.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.390
I had an eyewitness say that

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.861
she was with him for for a few

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:12.932
for a day or two, and she talked to him,

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:17.137
and he was really emotionally

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:20.440
down, and,

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.342
thinking about my son

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:25.712
and what happened, and, that he misses.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:29.215
I don't know if he knows if we are okay.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.218
And it was a really long time ago

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:35.221
that that day that she told me that

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.289
she saw him.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.324
It's unimaginable

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:41.094
that we are sitting right now after this

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:44.097
time, and nothing changed.

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.331
He's not back.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.366
They're not back.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.668
They're not all back.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:49.102
It's.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.671
It's unthinkable.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.773
It's unthinkable and unbearable.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.275
And we live in this.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:58.278
In this,

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.046
In this audacity.

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:03.049
Every day, every hour,

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.351
thinking about our loved ones

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:08.354
in in hostage conditions.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:09.289
Do you have any hope

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.690
that these negotiations,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.758
which are taking place

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:13.960
and are about to resume,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.563
will result in a ceasefire

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.665
and be the release of the hostages,

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.233
including your husband?

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.869
Most definitely. Yes. Yes.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:27.507
the only way that Charlie and 114

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:30.510
other hostages can come back.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.979
Some alive, some dead for

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.214
a proper burial,

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:36.849
is the

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.852
only way is in in, in a deal.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:42.188
The only way is in a deal.

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.990
You cannot make.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.827
and and and army and,

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:53.032
you know, a mission to to save them all.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.300
You cannot do that.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.635
Well, further complicating

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:56.603
this whole situation

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.171
now is the possibility

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:01.007
that Iran might attack Israel. Yes.

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.042
And that could happen within days. Yes.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.211
And presumably that would undermine

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.579
whatever negotiations

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.747
might be taking place

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.450
for a cease fire and a hostage release.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.453
Yes, I know, it's like,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.856
it's it's I'm trying not to be.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:19.425
I'm trying to filter

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:22.328
the ongoing threats from all over

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:25.231
and keep my eye on the hostages and

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:28.234
on sacking my husband, my loved one,

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:31.871
my better half.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:34.641
the threat is here,

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:38.511
and I think it's been ongoing for,

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.213
few months.

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:41.547
It's not a new thing.

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:46.219
I think they need to close this deal.

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.222
So all the, all the,

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:52.091
the Middle East can be

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.327
relaxed from this situation

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:57.330
because the situation is is burning.

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:01.200
And if the Middle East will become

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.602
a battle zone,

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:05.605
it won't be a third World War.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:08.374
I don't see it.

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:11.377
It will take all the allies

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:14.213
into the situation.

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:16.215
It's horrific.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:19.218
What do you miss most about your husband?

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:23.389
I miss his voice.

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:26.192
And,

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:28.494
I miss his hugs.

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.396
And I miss the,

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:32.165
the time that we have together.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.168
And I miss him.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:37.470
joking with the kids

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.473
and laughing.

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:43.309
And making dinner with him

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:44.644
and watching a movie.

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:47.647
Taking a walk.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.917
I miss every little thing.

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:52.852
It's been too long.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.954
It's been too long.

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:56.522
It's unbearable.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:59.525
We have no air anymore.

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:00.960
They have to come back.

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:05.164
It's part of us.

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:05.932
And your daughter?

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:06.899
My son.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.101
She was killed.

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:10.236
Murdered that day? Yes.

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:11.637
You miss her? Obviously.

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.773
Every day too.

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:16.743
Oh, just something.

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:18.177
I feel

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:21.180
is something that, is.

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:23.549
I cannot

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:26.552
grieve about my.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.922
Because I'm in an ongoing war

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.959
to save my husband.

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:35.962
I didn't went to see her grave.

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:39.332
I could, and it's going to be a year,

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:42.802
and I need to go and see her,

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:45.071
and I can't.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.074
I need to be here and

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:49.876
we need to do it together.

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:52.011
He needs to see her grave.

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:54.347
He needs to grieve with me.

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:57.450
We need to hold each other through this.

00:06:59.018 --> 00:06:59.585
And.

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:02.588
And as all of us know, October 7th.

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:03.423
It's almost.

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:06.426
The year was the worst day

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:08.227
of Jews being murdered

00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:10.463
since the Holocaust. Yes.

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:12.532
It's interesting that you are saying,

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:15.301
because today I thought that

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:16.736
I think the mark,

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:19.739
the horrific marks of Jewish

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:23.443
is the Holocaust and the 7th of October.

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:25.077
You're so right.

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:28.014
This is

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:31.017
I think it will be a stain

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.454
in Israeli history.

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:37.723
And it will be worse

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:39.459
if the hostages will not come back.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.193
Come back

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:43.196
and I, I will not I will not allow them

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:46.432
to sacrifice my husband

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:48.301
for the sake of war.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.903
How are your other children dealing

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:53.906
with all this now?

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:55.875
Our young kids,

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:59.111
the very young Sean is, 16.

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:01.514
She turned 16

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.115
while,

00:08:03.115 --> 00:08:04.584
this year has passed.

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:06.252
And,

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:07.954
Yael is, 12,

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:10.957
and she is ten.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.892
there are some good days

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:15.461
and some bad days.

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.430
we are all talking about my.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.433
And all the time.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.368
they have some times

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:23.703
that they are breaking down

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:26.939
and crying and missing their sister and.

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:27.840
Yeah.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.010
And a few days ago, Sean came to my room

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.512
crying in the middle of the night

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.046
and said, I want my daddy,

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:36.516
I want daddy.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.519
I miss my girl and I want that he.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.088
And it's.

00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:43.623
And you need to.

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:44.757
And you need to hug her.

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:47.760
And just what can I say to her?

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:49.595
What can I say to her?

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:52.365
What answer is there?

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.833
I can't bring her.

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:54.667
Her dad.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:56.669
I wish I could.

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:59.672
I would have in any means.

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:02.375
I need the government

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.810
and everybody that are

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.513
in the doing of this deal

00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:10.583
to bring home alive.

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.451
Like he was taken.

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:15.321
He was taken a line.

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:18.324
He needs to come back alive.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:19.992
I hope he does.

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.427
I hope he comes back soon.

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:22.295
And when he does,

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:23.429
I hope to come and meet him.

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:26.465
I promise you that when he comes back,

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:30.002
we'll do a recap. Good.

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:31.704
I'd like to talk to him,

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:34.040
and I'm keeping the hope.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.541
That's what we said the last time.

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:37.009
We need to know.

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:40.012
And we are 330 days after.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:40.413
Yeah,

00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:42.582
it's a long time.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:43.382
It's a long time.

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:44.483
It's unbearable.

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:47.486
Wolf, we need to breathe again.

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:49.021
And to breathe.

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.723
We need them back.

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:52.892
All of them back.

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:54.393
Let's hope the next time we meet.

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:54.927
Thank you.

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.262
Sorry is back.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.164
Oh, it's going to be amazing.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:01.300
I have this picture that is coming back,

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:01.667
and I'm

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:03.469
meeting in the hospital

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:05.771
with the kids running

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:08.774
toward him and Jane running toward him.

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:10.977
And

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:12.912
it's going to be a strong reunion.

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:16.949
And, we need this circle to be closed.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:17.650
And so.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.251
But that was,

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:21.554
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:22.188
As we say.

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:24.290
Let's hope, let's hope.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.991
Bring them back.

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:26.759
Please. Please, please.
