00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.750
In his almost

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.876
four decade long

00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:03.503
military career, retired General

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:04.546
David Petraeus faced

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:06.131
plenty of insurgencies,

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:08.383
mainly Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:09.884
What do his insights

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:10.844
from an extraordinary

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.013
career tell us about this new war

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.806
between Israel and Hamas?

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:16.266
David Petraeus joins me now

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.019
alongside the historian Andrew Roberts.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.270
The two are coauthors

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.980
of the new book Conflict

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.648
The Evolution of Warfare

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:26.109
from 1945 to Ukraine.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.610
Andrew is, of course, now

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.696
Baron Roberts of Belgrade.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.449
You have been elevated to the peerage.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.951
Dave, let me start with you.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.328
This issue of destroying Hamas.

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:39.247
Is that a realistic goal?

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:41.166
I think it is a realistic goal,

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.000
but it's going to be

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.626
exceedingly difficult.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.378
We've seen how long it takes

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:46.671
to clear cities roughly

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.256
the size of Gaza City.

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:48.923
Nine months

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:50.508
for the Iraqi security forces

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:53.136
to clear the Islamic State out of Mosul.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.721
As an example, with our assistance,

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.307
IDF much better, much more capable.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:58.725
But still, it's going to be very,

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.101
very tough in how they do

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:01.811
it is very important.

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.646
Again, we had a question on the wall

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:04.981
always, Will this operation

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.941
take more bad guys off the street

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:08.735
than it creates by its conduct

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:09.694
and you've got to be careful

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.196
that the answer to that

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.405
is going to be yes.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.532
And there has to also be a vision

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:15.867
for the future.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.619
They can accomplish this mission.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.661
But then keep in mind

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:21.122
that the definition of destroy

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:21.706
in military

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:22.999
doctrinal terms is render

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.416
the enemy

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.710
incapable of accomplishing his mission

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.545
without reconstitution.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:28.296
So whatever it is

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:30.632
that follows has to ensure

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.383
that this cannot be reconstituted.

00:01:32.383 --> 00:01:34.010
Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.804
Jihad will try to come back

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:36.721
so that whatever it is

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:38.473
that takes over from the Israelis

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:40.600
and they have to determine that urgently.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.603
Ehud Barak was absolutely right on that.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.188
But they're not going to just do

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.356
humanitarian assistance

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:47.190
or reconstruction.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.525
They're going to have to conduct

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:49.818
a counterinsurgency campaign

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.736
to keep Hamas in the Islamic

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:53.321
Jihad from coming back.

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:54.656
When you did the surge,

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:55.365
one of the things

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.034
that seemed to be so successful in that

00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:00.537
postwar operation was you brokered

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:03.164
a reconciliation between the Sunnis

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.999
and the Shias politically. Yes.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.792
So, I mean,

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.751
do you need some kind

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:08.878
of political vision? Very much so.

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.088
There has to be a vision

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:12.340
for the people in Gaza,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.842
for the Palestinians,

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:15.385
that distinguishes very clearly

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:16.553
the war is not on them.

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:18.638
It's actually to make their lives better.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.473
If they will reject Hamas,

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.183
their life will be better.

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:22.642
By the way,

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.644
the same for those in the West Bank.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:25.436
There has to be that.

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:25.770
And again,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.981
what we did is we said to the Sunnis,

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.232
if you'll break with Al Qaida

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:30.817
in Iraq, support us first

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.861
and then the government and then later.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.113
The same with the Iranian supported

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.614
Shia militia. Let's strip you away.

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:37.615
And of course, we defeated

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:39.409
then the other elements,

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.118
the militia

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.787
that remained, and also al Qaeda in Iraq

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.414
and the Sunni insurgent groups.

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:47.375
So that that vision is crucial.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:47.917
And again,

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.043
I think Ehud Barak had

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:50.420
that exactly right as well.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.422
A quick thought on

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:54.507
Hezbollah before I go to you.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.675
Do you think Hezbollah will

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.595
launch a serious attack from the north?

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.805
I don't think they want to do that.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:02.140
But the pressure will grow

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.558
as the damage and destruction.

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:04.184
Inevitably,

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.101
there are going to be

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:05.977
civilian casualties.

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:08.563
Urban combat is fiendishly difficult.

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:09.939
And I can't imagine

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.065
a context

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:12.817
that is more difficult than this one.

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:14.903
Hundreds of miles of tunnels,

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.905
suicide bombers, an enemy

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.698
that doesn't wear uniforms,

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.408
uses human shields,

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:21.284
civilians, and,

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:22.911
of course, the over 200 hostages

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.412
that are still there.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:25.538
So that's going to be very,

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.832
very challenging for them.

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:30.585
And again, you have to have this vision

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:31.294
that's going to try

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.130
to separate the people from Hamas.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.841
Again, also in the West Bank as well.

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:38.051
Hezbollah, though,

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.135
got hammered

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:42.013
in 2006, much worse than we realized

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:42.555
at the time.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.557
We reassessed at several occasions.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:46.476
They'll do the occasional attacks

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:47.685
and all the rest of that.

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:49.229
I don't think they want to launch

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.855
all 150,000 rockets,

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.815
which would be devastating for Israel,

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.525
but then would be even more devastating

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:56.653
for Hezbollah. And they know that.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.738
And just operationally,

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:01.157
of course, it's also very good for Israel

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:01.658
to be able

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:02.200
to promise

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.284
the Palestinian Arabs

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:04.327
that they will be able

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:05.578
to go back to Gaza,

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:06.371
because then you could

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:07.956
physically also separate them

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:09.540
from the Hamas

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.376
that you're trying to fight in Gaza.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:14.128
Lots in history that bears that out.

00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:15.338
Historically, historically.

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:15.922
You talk about

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:16.756
militia has been

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.174
one of the great successes

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:19.634
of counterinsurgency.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:20.593
What do you draw

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:21.678
as the key lesson

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.596
to succeeding in a counterinsurgency?

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:23.805
Well,

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.306
the way that Malaysia worked

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.557
is that they were able to offer

00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:27.976
the people independence.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.645
Malaysia became independence in 1957,

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:32.855
and that was immensely important

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:33.439
in winning

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.565
what was said at the time

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:36.401
to be the hearts and minds.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.278
That was coined the phrase.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:38.861
Yes, exactly.

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:39.153
And that.

00:04:39.153 --> 00:04:41.114
Meant they matter and no matter here as.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:41.364
Well.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.366
And so Gerald Templer

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.910
coined that phrase and and it worked.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.412
And it wasn't just in Malaysia.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.163
It also worked in the Oman campaign

00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:50.915
where they were able to offer

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.293
progress sexual, physical,

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.628
educational, agricultural,

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:56.963
medical progress.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.965
And that's also something that obviously

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.050
could be an important part to play here.
