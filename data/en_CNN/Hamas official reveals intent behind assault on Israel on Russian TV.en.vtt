00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.067
I really like you.

00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.003
A brazen political move.

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.538
Hamas demands that the US negotiate

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.841
the release of American hostages

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.776
on Russian TV.

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.011
In the end, for long,

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.812
there are also prisoners in the U.S..

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.347
We want them, of course.

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.248
There are Hamas members

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:16.916
sentenced to life in the U.S..

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:17.951
We demand that the U.S.

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:20.053
freeze our sons from their prisons.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.688
The U.S. conducts prisoner swaps.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.523
Only recently it did one with Iran.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:26.159
Why wouldn't it conduct one with us?

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.261
Confirmation of part of the intent

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.630
behind the Hamas assaults in Israel.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.399
They were enabled by a failure

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.835
of Israeli intelligence,

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:38.671
but plotted by a shadowy Hamas officer.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.608
They call Aldin death the guest.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:42.675
Only two photographs

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:43.676
exist of Mohammed

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.746
Dhiab, Ibrahim al-Masri, who's nearly 60.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.014
He's known as LDA

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:48.848
because he billets

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.550
as a guest in a different location

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.951
every night.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.920
He's the mastermind or monster

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.255
behind the murder of more

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.090
than a thousand in Israel

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.093
and the kidnaping of about 150 hostages.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.295
At the beginning,

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:05.265
he was very much interested in fighting

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:08.568
before the occupation in the mid 1990s.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.136
He was believed to be behind a

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.739
wave of atrocities in Israel.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.641
And in 2014, he's believed to

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.242
have lost an arm and a leg

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.978
in an Israeli airstrike aimed at him

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:22.549
that killed his wife and daughter.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:23.950
For the last two years, though,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.820
Hamas has pretended to focus on welfare,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.021
not warfare.

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.622
All the while under the table,

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.425
Hamas was preparing this big attack.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.794
Israel, meanwhile, invested in automation

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.763
and sensors, a high technology

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.831
iron wall around

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.800
Gaza, and focus forces on the West Bank.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.235
Under Deif, Hamas

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:46.106
encouraged Israeli complacency.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:49.175
Then last weekend, it hit hard,

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.177
attacking communication towers

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.546
and automated machine guns, with drones

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:57.417
overrunning command and control centers,

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.552
killing senior officers, among them

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.488
three colonels.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.322
But the

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:04.057
and unleashing terror

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.326
on thousands of civilians.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.694
The Israel Defense Forces

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:09.362
found Hamas anti-tank mines

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:11.197
and other heavy weapons, a sign

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:15.802
they may have planned for a longer stay.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.704
The shock infantry attack was either

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.772
deliberately brutal from the start

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:22.175
or degenerated into a massacre.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:25.745
As Israeli defenses collapsed,

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:28.915
it shifted attention and power to Hamas.

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.151
He has become

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.519
like a god

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.554
to some, to some of the Palestinians

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:37.724
because of what he has done.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.592
Many Palestinians are dismayed

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.327
by the massacre and the bloodshed

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.795
that's followed.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.564
But with the lives of hostages

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:45.999
in his hands,

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.601
the guest now has an unwelcome place

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.370
in America's mind.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.938
