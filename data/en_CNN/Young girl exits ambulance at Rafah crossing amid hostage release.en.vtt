00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.102
The number of ambulances there shows you.

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:05.205
Obviously, the concern for the well-being

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.141
of each of these individual hostages

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:11.277
being released right now There's Rafa.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:12.612
Hang on.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.814
There's a little girl

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:23.857
These are live pictures.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:24.691
This is the first time

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:25.792
we're seeing that right now.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:26.659
And for the first time,

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.361
we just saw a little girl

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.463
getting out of one of those ambulances

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.298
and walking into a building.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.266
There

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.467
could have been that

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.202
that was one of the Israeli

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.805
hostages, the young children released

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.508
not long ago as part of this deal.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:42.375
Yeah, John,

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.310
as we're
watching all of this play out

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.478
and waiting

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.348
for the identities of these hostages

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:49.849
to be confirmed by Israel,

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:50.717
which they says.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:51.484
They say that they'll do

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:52.952
once they're safely back in Israel,

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:53.420
though,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.021
we're watching several of them

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.057
get out of these emergency vehicles.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:57.724
We're also learning

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.292
more about who they are.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.528
And I'm told by an Israeli source

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.630
that most of these hostages,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.564
not all of them,

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:05.799
we don't know that exactly,

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.834
but a majority of the hostages

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:08.768
that have been released

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:10.403
just now by Hamas

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.373
from Gaza are from Kibbutz near Oz.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.774
And on October 7th,

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:15.642
that was a kibbutz

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.977
that saw a lot of devastation

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.813
in the October 7th attack.

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:22.148
I believe it was estimated that a quarter

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:23.616
of the population

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:25.351
of the several hundred people who lived

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.153
there were either murdered

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:29.355
or kidnaped into Gaza.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.523
And they saw I mean,

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:31.558
it was the kibbutz

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.093
where they burned

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.395
basically the kindergarten to the ground.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.429
They went into homes.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.264
You heard the testimony from the people

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.933
who did survived that attack.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.267
About just how devastating

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:41.901
it was that day

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.870
and how it's all some of the worst

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.305
violence on October 7th.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:46.906
John, we're

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.074
now seeing, as

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:49.442
we're hearing that they are from Kibbutz

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.110
near Oz.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.711
The majority of these hostages right now.

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.347
We are watching a line of people

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:55.081
now boarding.

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.583
They'd gone inside after getting out, now

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:57.951
getting onto a bus.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.185
You can see an elderly woman

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.320
she is stepping

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.688
into that white bus

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.157
with assistance right here.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.226
And you see a line of people behind her,

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.861
some men.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.963
Another woman

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.435
we believe we saw a child

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:16.703
at the beginning of the line.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:17.237
It's unclear

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.905
if it was the same child

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:20.039
that we saw earlier.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.141
We know that we

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.575
have heard from Egyptian sources

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.210
that several of

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.979
the hostages

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:26.813
who are being released today,

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.214
not just those 13 Israeli

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.349
hostages also several

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.817
Thai nationals as well,

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.653
who were kidnaped by Hamas on that day.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.156
And they appear to be boarding this bus

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.724
right in front of us John.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:38.424
Yeah.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:39.025
So again,

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.361
the question is, what's next is.

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.462
Yes.
13 Israeli

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.363
hostages, ten

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.899
Thai hostages, one Filipino hostage.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.667
We saw a number of them,

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:48.501
but by no means

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:49.969
all boarding that bus right there.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.437
Presumably, some are also receiving

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:51.871
medical care,

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.007
might be in the ambulances there.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.275
We are told that the young girl

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:55.808
that we had seen

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.510
earlier was at the front of the line.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.411
We're going to try to get a look

00:02:58.411 --> 00:02:59.145
at that again.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:01.614
But boarding that bus, we did clearly see

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.717
one child, some older women

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.120
and and then men.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.188
Okay.
Let's see if we can see those

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:08.755
pictures again.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:10.423
Let's take a look at

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:12.025
those pictures again.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.901
At the front of the line there,

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:24.671
you saw a younger girl, an older woman.

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.973
Here's a different vantage point there.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:29.642
A couple older women there

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:30.643
and now what appear to be

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:32.745
a number of the Thai hostages there.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.583
Ten Thai hostages and one Filipino

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:39.686
hostage, perhaps boarding this bus.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.754
That is the Rafah crossing.

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:44.090
We can't be sure where that bus will go,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.893
but it's possible it will head not far.

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:48.261
You're talking about a mere number

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:50.396
of a small handful of kilometers

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.999
south to the Kerem Shalom crossing.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:54.167
And from there,

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:56.169
it would enter Israel here in Egypt

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.437
right now.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:58.972
This group of hostages there,

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:01.507
apparently the Thai men

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.176
and also perhaps

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:06.012
one Filipino hostage boarding that bus.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.280
Caitlin, were earlier

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.282
we did see the first person to get on

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:12.185
was that girl, that young girl

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:13.886
that we saw.

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:16.889
Now free after 48 days

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.727
in captivity, what's next for this bus?

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.328
We are not sure.

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:23.930
But within the next several hours,

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:25.798
all of those

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:26.232
people, we

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:28.368
presume will be back inside Israel

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.639
Yeah, we believe the next stop for

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.108
that bus is going to be here in Israel

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:35.908
where

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.543
there is a number of hospitals

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:39.579
that are preparing to receive them.

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:40.246
I mean, they are

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:41.914
this reintegration process

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:43.016
that these hostages

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:44.717
are going to have to go through

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:45.485
isn't just

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.220
about their physical well-being,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.354
these medical checkups,

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:49.589
but also

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:53.192
a meeting with a therapist and officials

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:53.926
here to

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:54.460
to talk

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.927
about what

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:56.596
they've seen, what they've experienced

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.364
in these 48 days

00:04:58.364 --> 00:04:59.499
that they have been held.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.401
These people have not known freedom

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:02.702
since October the seventh,

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:03.670
since they were kidnaped

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.739
by Hamas into Gaza, where we know from

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:08.041
at least two of the hostages

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.876
who were previously released.

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:11.311
They were in a complex

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.879
tunnel system underground.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.281
And they had been underground for so long

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:17.317
that when they were released, John,

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.751
Light, natural light

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.953
sunlight shocked them because they just

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:22.755
hadn't seen it in so long.

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:24.824
And so that's the kind of mindset

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:25.725
that so many of these

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:27.093
these people that you're seeing now

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:28.828
have gone through where

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.063
I mean, there are major questions

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:30.697
about what else

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:31.831
those conditions looked like.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:32.999
But we do know what we've heard

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.600
from other hostages

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.269
who have been released.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:38.604
One thing that we were told is as soon as

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.140
these hostages, the Israeli hostages

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.208
at least made it to the border,

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.476
they were going to try to facilitate

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.611
a phone call with their family members.

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:46.979
They weren't able to immediately

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:47.947
be reunited with them,

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:49.315
but they at least wanted them

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:50.416
to have that moment,

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.685
to have that first conversation

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:53.453
with a loved one

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.320
that they have not been able

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.055
to have for so long.

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.924
And it just

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:58.925
a huge sigh of relief

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.226
for so many

00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:00.993
of these families

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:03.629
to see this actually unfolding

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:04.397
and obviously still

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:04.997
waiting for them

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:07.467
to actually get here into Israel.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.902
One of the places that we do

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:12.572
expect the hostages to go soon.

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:13.439
And that's the

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.540
that's a Reem Airbase

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.142
you can see inside Israel.

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:18.077
So Rafah here

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:19.078
and then presumably

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:20.613
they'll move somewhere back

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:21.514
into Israel,

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:23.015
either crossing here or here,

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:24.117
and then travel to the hot

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:25.284
Syrian air base.

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:27.286
That's where our Matthew Chance is

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:28.755
with the latest on what you're seeing.

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:29.255
Matthew,

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:32.925
That's right, John.

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:33.226
Here at

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.293
the Syrian air

00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:35.228
base, preparations

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.996
have been underway for some time

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:39.031
to cater for this arrival,

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.401
this first stop in the arrival

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.503
of these 13 Israeli hostages,

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:44.971
perhaps the nationals

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:45.505
from Thailand,

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:46.539
in the Philippines as well,

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:47.740
although it's unclear

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.574
whether they will be coming

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.143
directly here as well.

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:51.844
We're trying to get clarification

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:53.045
on that.

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:54.280
But, yes, it's

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.648
going to be a sensitive operation.

00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:56.783
You saw those people

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:57.884
heading towards

00:06:57.884 --> 00:06:58.818
the bus in the

00:06:58.818 --> 00:06:59.652
in the live video

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:01.254
that we've been watching.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.522
And our understanding,

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:04.590
according to Israeli military officials

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.526
on the ground here at the airbase

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.294
that have been speaking to us,

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:09.195
saying that

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.563
the the plan at the moment

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:12.665
is for these hostages to be driven,

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.301
these freed hostages to be driven by road

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:19.138
in those both in busses to this airbase.

00:07:19.138 --> 00:07:20.940
The reason they're doing that, they said,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.074
is because

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:24.544
helicopter flights can be scary

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:27.246
and they don't want to further traumatize

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:28.080
anybody who hasn't been

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.948
on a helicopter before.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:29.582
That's the reason

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:31.317
they said they're going to

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:32.685
drive them by road.

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:34.520
And so we'll see how that develops.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.823
Obviously,
this is a fast changing

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:37.957
situation on the ground.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.625
And that plan could change.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.828
But whether they come here by bus

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:42.662
or whether they're flown here

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:44.130
in helicopters,

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.399
this is the place where we understand

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.367
they will be received by

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:51.571
you know, get initial checkups.

00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:52.972
They'll be able to make phone calls

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:54.540
to their family members.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.842
They'll be properly looked

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:56.542
at medically

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.211
and psychologically to assess

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.246
what their immediate needs are given food

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.380
and drinks,

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.348
a change of clothes,

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:03.516
if that's necessary as well.

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:04.484
It's not clear

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:05.685
whether they're

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:06.519
sitting in the same clothes,

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:07.553
for instance, that they were in

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:08.988
when they're abducted

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.123
so violently back on October the seventh.

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:12.625
So they're going to be looked at here.

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:13.226
There are also shower

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.727
facilities, things like that.

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:16.262
After that,

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:17.163
they're going to be loaded

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.832
onto helicopters and taken to various

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:21.701
hospitals around the country,

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:22.635
particularly close

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:23.536
to Tel Aviv,

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:24.403
depending on

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.439
what their exact medical needs

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:29.141
are now in terms of the timing on that.

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:32.144
Once the

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:32.979
the hostages,

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:34.080
if they come by road, once

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.580
they once

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.215
they get to the border of Israel,

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:37.316
it's going to take about an hour

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.351
because about 30 miles

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.753
away, a bit longer than that, perhaps

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:41.521
to the border,

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.823
getting a
where they come across to this base

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:45.858
and then they're going to be processed

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:48.294
for between half an hour and 2 hours

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:51.230
depending on their specific needs.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.966
And so, you know where where they're

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:56.269
bracing ourselves for several hours now

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:57.803
before these people

00:08:57.803 --> 00:08:59.438
sort of arrive here are processed,

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:00.373
and then

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.574
finally board

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:02.775
those helicopters

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:04.610
that are waiting for them here

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.546
and choppered to there

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:07.380
to the hospitals

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.081
elsewhere in the country.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:09.782
But again,

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:12.485
a very sensitive, delicate and anxious

00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:14.887
period underway right now.
