00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
More than

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.801
40,000 Palestinians

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.303
have now been killed in Gaza,

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:05.238
a majority of whom are civilians,

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:06.639
and these numbers are from the Palestine

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:07.340
Ministry of Health.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.441
But they are backed up

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.275
by the United States,

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.244
by international organizations.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:12.846
Humanitarian conditions in Gaza

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:13.913
have degraded so much

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.949
that diseases like polio

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.184
and hepatitis A are now spreading.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.452
We have seen countless

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.121
children be orphaned.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.022
We have seen countless

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.690
mothers lose their children.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.458
How much is too much, sir?

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.261
At what point is it time to end this war?

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.229
Well, we'll end the war

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.763
when we

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:30.497
achieve our

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:30.930
world goals

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.332
of the making sure that Hamas

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.334
can't repeat such atrocities.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.102
But we're fighting this war

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.104
in a just war with just means.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:38.638
In fact,

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:40.540
with means that no other army

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.110
has as over form, no other army has done,

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:44.978
has taken

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.981
the precautions that Israel has taken,

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.783
sometimes at great risk,

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.451
to make sure that we minimize

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.585
the number of casualties.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.553
You talked about polio.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.656
We enable now

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:59.893
massive vaccination of polio.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:00.226
We want

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.229
90% of the Gaza and the people of Gaza,

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:07.600
vaccinated, I think 200, 200,000.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.202
200,000.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.471
I think we're vaccinated today.

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:12.605
We've put in a million

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:13.406
tons of food,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.741
a million tons of aid,

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.677
700,000 tons of food. That's unheard of.

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.479
We've taken,

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.580
because we think that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.816
every civilian death is a tragedy

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:23.349
for Hamas.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.951
Every civilian death is a strategy

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:25.351
for us.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.986
It's a tragedy

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:28.154
that 1.4 million

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:28.922
people in Gaza,

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.925
they moved from the north to the south.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.260
You're going to have thousands,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.230
20,000 killed.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.332
You're going to have a catastrophe,

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.633
a humanitarian catastrophe.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:43.303
There have no place to go,

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:46.306
no food to eat.

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:48.842
Now, report honestly,

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:51.511
because here's what happened.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.279
They all left.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.881
They went to the humanitarian zone,

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.583
which was two miles away. Let's.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.486
On the beach.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:00.220
They have tents.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.922
We supplied tents for 150,000 people.

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:04.390
The agency supplied the rest,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.891
and some of them

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:06.726
carried over into that place.

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:08.928
We supplied water lines,

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:11.297
sewage lines, food.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.599
There's more to be done.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.535
Medical.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.103
So now we know how many people

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:18.204
were killed.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:18.905
How many terrorists?

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.174
Because we counted them.

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:24.444
And we just passed 2000 terrorists.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:27.147
Body count of terrorists.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.982
The people left.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.150
How many civilians died?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.153
I asked the commander,

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:36.222
the commander of the, of the division

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.590
that did the Rafah operation

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.226
and the Philadelphia border.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.562
He said,

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.430
Prime Minister,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.266
there are hardly any civilian deaths

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.834
because everybody left.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.969
They heeded our warnings.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.771
But he said

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:54.674
there were probably two dozen,

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:57.677
and most of them occurred two dozen.

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.312
And most of them occurred

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.648
when one of our bombs hit,

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.316
Hamas ammunition depot

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:04.751
that was planted inside

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.486
a residential area.

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:07.320
40 people died.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.421
About 20 were terrorists,

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:09.622
but 20 were civilians.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.625
And he said, that's most of the deaths.

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.727
That's the lowest ratio

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.665
of noncombatants to combatants

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.668
in the history of urban warfare.

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:23.970
That's it.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.072
Now, report honestly,

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:27.540
because you accused us of something

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.741
that is outrageous

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:31.211
and in fact, the accusations against us

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.214
outrageously false humanitarian aid,

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:35.882
a million

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.851
trucks of aid, a million tons of aid,

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:42.255
700,000 tons of food,

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.157
a deliberate starvation policy.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:45.625
You can say anything

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.093
that doesn't make it true.

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:47.961
You repeat a lie

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:49.562
over and over and over again.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:50.730
It assumes the cachet

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.433
of self-evident truth. But it's false.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:54.601
Israel is doing

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:57.570
and the Israeli army is doing

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.405
something that no other army

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.607
has done in history.

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:01.741
And we'll continue to do that.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.476
I'm not going to change my policies,

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:04.611
humanitarian policies,

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:07.614
vaccination policies,

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:09.315
combat policies to minimize

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.450
civilian casualties.
