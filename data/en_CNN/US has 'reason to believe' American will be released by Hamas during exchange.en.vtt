00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.417
Here with me

00:00:00.417 --> 00:00:02.335
now is White House National Security

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:03.712
adviser Jake Sullivan.

00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:05.046
Thank you so much for being here

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:06.256
this morning.

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:08.174
An Israeli official told CNN

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:09.050
that at least one

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.176
American citizen

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.053
is expected to be part of today's

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.722
release of hostages.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.306
Can you confirm

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:17.308
how many Americans are on that list?

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:21.688
And do you know who they are yet?

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.857
Well, just taking a step back then,

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.401
the 50 hostages that were part of this

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.694
initial four day deal,

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.529
those were women and children.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.197
And there are three Americans

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.615
who fall into that category,

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.743
two women and one child.

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:37.078
Now, we know those three were missing.

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:38.079
We cannot

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.164
say for certain

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:40.540
whether all three of them

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.000
are still alive.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.334
But we do know this.

00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:46.087
We have reason to believe that today

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:48.381
one American will be released.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.884
And I say reason to believe

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.053
because I want to be cautious

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.388
about making any firm statements

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:58.099
until we actually see that individual

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:00.101
crossed the border to safety

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:01.603
and ultimately be reunited

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:02.771
with their family.

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.647
We're dealing with Hamas.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.859
We are in a don't trust but verify

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:09.444
situation here.

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.155
And so we have reason to believe

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:12.697
that there will be

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.532
an American released today.

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:15.784
We have been in close touch

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:17.410
with the Israelis, with the Qataris,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.787
with the Egyptians

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:19.996
over the last 24 hours.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:20.705
President Biden

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:21.998
has been personally engaged

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:24.125
with the emir of Qatar on this issue.

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:27.128
And so today should be a good day,

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.630
a joyful day.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.798
But until we actually see

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:30.799
it happen,

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:31.966
understanding to remain

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.593
really at the edge of our seats. Yeah.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.595
And that's completely understandable.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:36.930
Having said that,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.473
do you have reason to believe

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:40.809
that the American you're talking about is

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:45.730
four year old Abigail Dunn?

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.732
Here's what I'll say.

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:50.527
We are now hopeful that Abigail

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:52.654
will be released,

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.697
reunited with her family.

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:56.741
She turned four just two days ago.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.535
She has been through hell.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:01:59.077
She had her

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:01.746
parents killed right in front of her

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.123
and has been held

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.126
hostage for the last several weeks.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.919
We are hopeful that she will be released.

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.421
I'm not going to confirm that it's today,

00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:11.381
but I am going to say

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:12.882
that we have

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.301
growing optimism about Abigail

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.177
and we will now

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:18.972
watch and see what happens.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.473
Jake, later in the show, I'm

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.975
going to talk to the parents

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.310
of a 22 year old IDF soldier

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.771
who is an American citizen.

00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:28.148
Do you have any information

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.357
on his condition

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:31.025
and that of other Americans

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:32.819
still in captivity?

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.487
And is there any progress

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:38.741
towards bringing them home?

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.870
Ten of which of the IDF soldiers?

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:44.122
Are you referring to his.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:49.544
His name is Omar Neutra.

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:50.879
I actually had the opportunity

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.672
to meet his parents at the White House,

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.549
along with the family members

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.761
of other American hostages and I know

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.055
just listening to them

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:02.515
that they are going through incredible

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.392
pain and uncertainty and difficulty.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:05.560
And I can't even imagine

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.770
what that could possibly feel like.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.105
I told them directly

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.481
and and we've been candid

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.232
about what we know

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:11.983
and don't know that

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.484
we do not know

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:14.819
the specific whereabouts

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.531
or condition of Omar or other Americans,

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:22.076
because until the end of this deal,

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:24.162
until the end of tomorrow,

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.164
we will not have from the Red Cross

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.750
proof of life or other information

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.543
related to their ability

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.586
to visit hostages.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.463
So as we learn that information,

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.422
we will absolutely

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.423
share it with the parents.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.926
But no, I do not sitting here today.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.093
I'm not in a position

00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:40.303
to confirm the precise

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.472
condition or whereabouts of Omar

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.975
or other American hostages.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.393
You said that

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.812
you hope that you will get information

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:51.064
from the Red Cross, though,

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:55.235
after this initial deal is complete.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.987
Prime Minister Netanyahu said that

00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.447
that also said

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:00.490
that the Red Cross

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.784
would be allowed to visit hostages

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.661
still being held by Hamas

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.080
to ascertain their status.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.956
But Israeli officials

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.124
say it hasn't happened.

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:12.460
Did Hamas, in fact, agree to that?

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.128
And do you have confidence

00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:15.088
that it will happen?

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:18.091
If so.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.300
That is part of the deal.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.427
We expect it will happen.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.012
I'm not going to characterize myself

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:25.098
as confident in anything right now

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.308
because, again, we're in a don't trust

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:29.143
but verify circumstance.

00:04:29.143 --> 00:04:32.397
But we do believe that Hamas is obliged

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:35.400
to maintain its part of the commitment

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.403
on Red Cross visitation of the hostages.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.446
And we expect Qatar in Egypt

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:41.948
and other countries

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.866
to hold Hamas accountable

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:45.368
to fulfill that commitment

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:46.536
by the end of tomorrow.

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.162
Israeli officials are signaling

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:51.207
that they plan to resume their offensive,

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:52.458
the military offensive,

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.460
as soon as this pause expires.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.044
The defense

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:57.547
minister, Yoav Gallant,

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.048
said yesterday, quote,

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:01.092
Any further negotiations will be

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.885
held under fire.

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.346
Is Israel rejecting calls from the U.S.

00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:07.932
to hold off on its offensive

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:13.688
in order to try to continue negotiations?

00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:15.189
Well, first, Stan,

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.481
just to

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.275
be clear about the terms of this deal,

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.277
Israel has already agreed

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.486
that it will continue

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.655
to pause fighting day by day

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.365
after the end of the four days

00:05:24.365 --> 00:05:25.575
as long as Hamas

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.744
keeps releasing hostages.

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:30.163
So the ball is really in Hamas's court.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.081
If Hamas wants to see in it

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.459
an extension of the pause in fighting,

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.502
it can continue to release hostages.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:39.088
If it chooses not to release hostages,

00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:40.465
then the end of the pause is

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:41.632
its responsibility,

00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:42.550
not Israel's,

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.886
because it is holding these hostages

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.554
completely illegitimately

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:49.766
and against all bounds of human decency.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.100
So just to be clear, though.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.394
Really, we will see what Hamas ends up

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:54.562
choosing to do. Yeah.

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:58.107
So to be clear, if Hamas, after this

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.276
four day pause is over,

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:01.277
says, okay, here's

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:03.279
the next list of hostages

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.572
that we will release,

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:08.284
Israel will continue its military pause.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.286
No question.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.496
That is correct.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.664
Ten hostages per day

00:06:13.664 --> 00:06:15.750
for as many days as Hamas releases

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.626
ten hostages.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.002
Israel will continue the pause

00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:18.544
in the fighting.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:20.004
That's part of the terms of the deal

00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:21.547
that Israel agreed to.

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.174
That's a commitment Israel has made.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.384
And now, as I said before,

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.843
the ball is in Hamas's court.

00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:27.512
Have any of the hostages

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:28.930
who have been freed

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.557
provided any insight or intelligence

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:32.683
to Israel and U.S.

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:34.769
officials that could help locate

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:38.773
those still in Gaza?

00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:40.900
We are just at the beginning

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.818
of learning

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.945
about the debriefings of those hostages.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:46.697
So I will withhold comment until

00:06:46.697 --> 00:06:47.657
there can be more time

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.033
for that to take place.

00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:49.826
We're just talking about

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:50.827
the last couple of days

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.078
that hostages have been released

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:52.912
in the early hours

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.163
have really been much more

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:57.083
about caring for their trauma,

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.709
their pain, and also getting them

00:06:58.709 --> 00:06:59.919
reunited with their families.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.379
So it's going to take a little while

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.838
for us

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.464
to get that information,

00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:05.007
for Israel to get that information.

00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:06.509
But you can be sure that Israel

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.636
is focused on learning anything

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:10.096
it can about whereabouts,

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.306
locations and other information

00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:13.558
based on conversations

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.309
they have with the released hostages

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:16.185
in the days ahead.

00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:16.978
Another major

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:18.438
aspect of this deal

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.106
is that it is allowing

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.108
for significant amounts

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.234
of desperately needed

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.402
humanitarian aid,

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.237
fuel, medicine, water,

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.364
food to enter Gaza.

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:29.407
President Biden said

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.242
there are mechanisms in place

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.535
to ensure those supplies

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.537
go to civilians and not Hamas.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:35.872
What are those

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.291
mechanisms and do you have any indication

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.959
that they have been in place

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.962
or has Hamas actually benefited

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:47.633
from this pause?

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:48.468
Well, first, Dan,

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.595
there's the inspection mechanism.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:51.971
The Israelis at a

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.140
crossing called Nitzan to

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.601
check all of the trucks before they go

00:07:56.601 --> 00:08:00.313
in through the Rafah crossing into Gaza.

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:02.106
And they checked to make sure that it is,

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:03.649
in fact, humanitarian supplies

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:05.568
and not goods that could help Hamas

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.069
in its military campaign.

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.614
Second, those trucks go to U.N.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:10.698
depots

00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:13.117
and to other humanitarian organizations

00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:15.620
that are vetted and trusted partners.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.497
And once they are in the hands

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:18.581
of the United Nations

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.416
and humanitarian organizations,

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:21.250
they are distributed

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.169
directly to the people.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.004
And we have seen this work

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.964
over the course of the last

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:27.840
several weeks

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.760
as humanitarian assistance has ramped up.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.511
We've seen it work

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:32.803
that it's actually getting to people

00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:34.514
and that it's not being diverted

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.723
into the hands of Hamas.

00:08:35.723 --> 00:08:36.390
But that's something

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.558
that we have to continue

00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:39.936
to focus on, on an ongoing basis.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.479
President Biden stays in close

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:42.688
touch with the Israeli

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.649
leadership on this, with the U.N.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:45.733
leadership and with others

00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:47.235
to make sure, in fact,

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:48.861
the aid is getting to where it belongs,

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.029
which is the innocent people

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:50.947
who are suffering.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.074
I want to look ahead a little bit

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:55.535
and ask about Prime Minister Netanyahu,

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:56.827
because he is,

00:08:56.827 --> 00:08:57.537
as you well know,

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.288
in a precarious domestic

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:00.581
political situation.

00:09:00.581 --> 00:09:01.123
He knows that

00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:02.416
as soon as this war

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:03.709
with Hamas is over, he's

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:05.211
going to face questions

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.337
that he's been putting off

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:07.838
about the failure to prevent

00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:10.550
the October seven attacks.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:11.592
Questions about his

00:09:11.592 --> 00:09:13.177
tenure as prime minister.

00:09:13.177 --> 00:09:14.387
Is there any concern

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.806
inside the Biden administration

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.349
that Netanyahu doesn't

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:19.141
necessarily

00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:22.144
see it as being in his interest

00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:27.817
to end this war as quickly as possible?

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.150
Look,

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.235
I'm not going to

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.195
speculate on Israeli politics.

00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:31.946
What we're going to do

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.990
is just stay focused on

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.241
who's sitting in the chair

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.284
of Prime minister,

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.451
and that is Prime Minister

00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:39.370
Netanyahu, and deal with him

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.913
straight up

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:41.956
on the issues

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.291
that we are confronting today.

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.793
And President Biden has been able,

00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:48.129
through his direct diplomacy

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:48.796
with Prime Minister

00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.756
Netanyahu, as well as his diplomacy

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:51.924
with Arab leaders

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.509
to generate the introduction

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:55.177
of humanitarian assistance,

00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:57.013
the safe departure of foreign nationals,

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.764
including Americans from Gaza.

00:09:58.764 --> 00:09:59.682
The first pause

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:01.475
in the fighting in 50 days

00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:03.144
since this conflict began.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.062
And hostage releases.

00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:06.731
So President Biden

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.024
believes that his engagement

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:08.649
with Prime Minister

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:10.484
Netanyahu has paid dividends.

00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:11.986
He's going to continue

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:13.362
to focus on that high level,

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:15.573
direct leader to leader diplomacy

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:18.367
and leave others to determine

00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:19.035
the politics,

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.828
the political considerations.

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:22.496
We'll stay focused on the task at hand.
