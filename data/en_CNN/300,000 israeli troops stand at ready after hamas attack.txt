&gt;&gt;&gt; WE ARE BACK WITH OUR  BREAKING NEWS COVERAGE. YOU ARE LOOKING AT VIDEO FROM  EARLIER TODAY OF ISRAELI TANKS  AND TROOPS GATHERING IN SOUTHERN ISRAEL. MORE THAN 300,000 ISRAELI  RESERVISTS HAVE BEEN CALLED UP,  AS THE COUNTRY PREPARES FOR A  POSSIBLE GROUND OPERATION IN  RESPONSE TO THE SURPRISE  TERRORIST ATTACK BY HAMAS ON  SATURDAY. REMEMBER, ISRAEL HAS  CONSCRIPTION. CNN'S JEREMY DIAMOND IS ON THE  GROUND THERE, AND HAS THIS  REPORT ON ONE OF THE LARGEST  MOBILIZATIONS THIS THE HISTORY  OF ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AT A MILITARY BASE  IN SOUTHERN ISRAEL, COLUMNS OF  ISRAELI TANKS STAND AT THE  READY, AWAITING ORDERS FOR AN  INVASION OF GAZA THAT EVERYONE  EXPECTS, BUT NO ONE HAS YET  COMMANDED. THIS IS A COUNTRY ON A WAR  FOOTING. THE ISRAELI MILITARY HAS CALLED  UP MORE THAN 300,000 RESERVISTS, ONE OF THE LARGEST MOBILIZATION  EFFORTS THIS THIS COUNTRY'S  HISTORY. THIS BEHIND ME IS THAT  MOBILITIZATION EFFORTS IN  ACTION. YOU ARE WITNESSING THOUSANDS OF  RESERVISTS. ISRAELIS FROM ALL ACROSS THE  COUNTRY, COMING TO THIS MILITARY BASE IN SOUTHERN ISRAEL TO BEGIN TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS MILITARY CAMPAIGN. BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE SCALE THAT MAKES THIS MOBILIZATION  DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN IN OTHER CAMPAIGNS  IN THE LAST 30 YEARS. NEVER SOMETHING LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: FOR THE SOLDIERS  CONVERGING ON THIS BASE, THE  SHOCKING BRUTALITY OF HAMAS'  SURPRISE TERRORIST ATTACKS IS  STILL REVERBERATING. &gt;&gt; EVERY PERSON HERE LOST  SOMEONE. EVERY PERSON. WE WERE IN AMSTERDAM TILL  WEDNESDAY MORNING. TILL MONDAY MORNING, I CAME HERE TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY TO FIGHT  THOSE GUYS. &gt;&gt; VERY EMOTIONAL MOMENT. &gt;&gt; YES. CHILDREN DIE AND KIDNAPPING. IT'S LIKE OUR ENEMY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: DRIVING DOWN ROADS  EAST OF THE GAZA STRIP,  REPARATIONS FOR THE NEXT PHASE  OF THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN ARE  EVERYWHERE. TRUCKS LOADED WITH AMMUNITION. ARMORED VEHICLES, THOUSANDS OF  ISRAELI SOLDIERS MOBILIZING. AND JUST SEVEN MILES FROM THE  GAZA BORDER, THIS FORMATION OF  ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS. WE ARE ABOUT A DOZEN KILOMETERS  FROM THE GAZA BORDER, ABOUT SIX, SEVEN MILES. THIS IS THE PREPARATION FOR WHAT MANY PEOPLE IN ISRAEL BELIEVE IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, THAT IS  THE POSSIBILITY OF A GROUND  INVASION. YOU CAN SEE HERE, ARMORED  PERSONNEL CARRIERS, PERHAPS  NEARLY TWO DOZEN OF THOSE, AS  WELL AS TRUCKS AND YOU SEE  SOLDIERS ALL HERE PREPARING FOR  THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS WAR. BUT AMID THE PREPARATIONS FOR  TOMORROW'S BATTLE, TODAY'S IS  STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE. AND JAKE, JUST TO PUT THAT  NUMBER OF 300,000 RESERVISTS  BEING CALLED UP INTO CONTEXT,  THAT IS 4% OF ISRAEL'S  POPULATION. BUT PERHAPS WHAT IS MORE  STARTLING, THAT NUMBER IS EQUAL  TO THE NUMBER OF TOTAL FORCES IN THE U.S.' MILITARY RESERVES. THAT NUMBER IS 331,000. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT  THE U.S. POPULATION IS 34 TIMES  LARGER, IT HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND  THE SCALE OF THIS MOBILIZATION  EFFORT HERE IN ISRAEL. NOW, THE QUESTION IS WHAT  HAPPENS NEXT? WE SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW YET. BUT ALL OF THE SOLDIERS WE SPOKE TO TODAY, ALL OF THOSE  RESERVISTS ALL SEEM TO BELIEVE  THAT THEY CAN LIKELY GOING
