CNN'S JEREMY DIAMOND IS JOINING US FROM TEL AVIV. JEREMY, THIS IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT VISIT FOR THE SENATOR THERIOT STATES. &gt;&gt; IT CERTAINLY IS WOLFE. THERE IS SO MUCH ON THE AGENDA WHETHER IT IS THE NEXT PHASES OF THIS WAR IN GAZA, WHAT COMES AFTER THE WAR IN TERMS OF GAZA RECONSTRUCTION, OR THE CURRENT HUMANITARIAN SITUATION. PERHAPS WHAT IS LOOMING LARGEST ARE THESE MAJOR TENSIONS AT THE ISRAEL LEBANESE BORDER. ISRAELI OFFICIALS IN RECENT DAYS HAVE BEEN WARNING TTHE DIPLOMATIC WINDOW TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE SITUATION IS CLOSING. THE SITUATION OF THE NORTH IS UNTENABLE. THAT'S WHY THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS HAD ALL OF THESE VISITS IN THE REGION, BUT TOMORROW PERHAPS WILL BE AMONG HIS MOST CRITICAL MEETINGS OF TO TRYING TO DEFUSE THOSE REGIONAL TENSIONS. &gt;&gt; JEREMY, I UNDERSTAND YOU JUST RETURNED FROM REPORTING INSIDE OF GAZA UNDER AN IDF ESCORT. THE ENTIRE TIME CLEARLY. WHAT DID YOU SEE? SHARE WITH OUR VIEWERS. &gt;&gt; WELL WOLF, LIKE SO MANY OTHER PARTS OF GAZA, CENTRAL GAZA IS -- THAT HAS BEEN ROCKED BY THIS THREE MONTH WAR NOW. OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS, ISRAELI MILITARY TROOPS HAVE ALSO MOVED DEEPER INTO CENTRAL GAZA, AN AREA WHERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE FLEE THE FIGHTING IN THE NORTH. NOW WE DID AS A CONDITION TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS -- WE WERE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT FOOTAGE TO THE ISRAELI MILITARY FOR A SECURITY REVIEW, BUT WE DID NOT SUMMIT OUR FINAL REPORT. WE MAINTAIN FULL EDITORIAL CONTROL OVER THIS REPORTING. &gt;&gt; AFTER THREE MONTHS OF WAR, THIS IS A GLIMPSE OF CENTRAL GAZA. &gt;&gt; BUILDINGS FLATTENED OR PARTIALLY COLLAPSED, OTHERS RIDDLED WITH BULLETS OR SCARRED BY SMOKE. CIVILIANS ARE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. &gt;&gt; THE OUTSKIRTS OF -- ARE NOW UNDER ISRAELI MILITARY CONTROL. &gt;&gt; THE ISRAELI MILITARY HAS NOW BEEN FIGHTING ON THE GROUND HERE IN CENTRAL GAZA OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

INVITING CNN INTO CENTRAL GAZA FOR THE FIRST TIME TO SHOW WHAT THEY ARE UNCOVERING. &gt;&gt; ALONGSIDE NOW BULLDOZED FARMLANDS INSIDE A NONDESCRIPT BUILDING, THE OPENING TO A TUNNEL SYSTEM. &gt;&gt; WE ARE STANDING IN OF THE MAIN ENTRANCES TO MANUFACTURING TERROR CENTER. &gt;&gt; THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS HAMAS USED TO MANUFACTURE IN TRANSPORT WEAPONS. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE ENTRANCE TO A TITLE THAT THE ISRAELI MILITARY FOUND IN CENTRAL GAZA. YOU CAN WALK THROUGH HERE, AND THEY SAY THAT IF YOU FIND THIS TUNNEL ALL THE WAY DOWN, YOU GET A VENTRALLY TO WHAT IS A WEAPONS MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT HAMAS HAS BEEN USING THROUGHOUT THE WAR. &gt;&gt; INSIDE THAT FACILITY ISRAELI COMMANDERS SAY HAMAS BUILDS ROCKETS AND MORTAR SHELLS LIKE THESE, AND THEN FILLED THEM WITH EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL LIKE FERTILIZER BELOW GROUND.
