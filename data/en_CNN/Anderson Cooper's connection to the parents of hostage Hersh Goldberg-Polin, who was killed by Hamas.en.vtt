00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:01.334
Our breaking news this

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:02.535
weekend that IDF forces

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.537
recovered the bodies of six hostages,

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:05.905
including 23 year old

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.540
Israeli American Hirsh Goldberg.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.475
Pulling it all

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.710
been murdered in a tunnel in Gaza.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.245
His story became one of the most

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:13.279
well known, in part

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.581
because of the tireless efforts

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.515
of his two parents,

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.250
Rachel Goldberg and John Poland,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.085
to advocate for their son, Hirsh,

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.854
and all the other hostages.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:21.321
We warn you,

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.022
some of the video

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:25.025
you're about to see is graphic.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.727
Five days after the October 7th massacre

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:28.561
at the Nova music

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.562
Festival site,

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.163
an Israeli

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.732
soldier showed me a disturbing video

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.100
of a young Israeli man

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.969
with his left hand blown off,

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:36.970
being kidnaped,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.938
loaded into a pickup truck.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.840
I didn't know who he was,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.176
but four days later, by coincidence,

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.677
I interviewed John Poland

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:45.945
and Rachel Goldberg

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.981
for the first time on CNN.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.549
When I turned on my phone,

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:50.483
which I don't normally

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.885
use on the Jewish Sabbath,

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.055
that's when I saw

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:55.889
two texts

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.624
pop up at eight, ten,

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.392
eight, 11 in the morning.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:02.362
The first one said, I love you.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.365
And the second one said, I'm sorry.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.301
And immediately I knew something

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.837
horrible must have been happening

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:13.840
or was about to happen.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.075
I didn't know they were

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.476
the parents of the young man

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:17.977
I'd seen in that video,

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:19.045
until John said

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.780
this during our interview.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.948
And we know from three

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:24.184
eyewitness accounts of survivors

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:26.453
that basically,

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.021
there were at least 11 grenades

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.989
thrown into the bomb shelter.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.324
Our son, by all accounts,

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:32.959
officer of the witnesses,

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.028
had his left arm blown off

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.763
at some point during the attack.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.864
That's when I realized

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.332
I'd seen their son.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.433
And they had no idea

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.568
the video of him

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:44.370
being taken hostage existed.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.004
I waited till

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.407
the interview was over and called them

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.843
and then sent them the video I had.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.578
I met with them a week later.

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.113
First of all, it's it's

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.614
a crazy sequence of events

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:57.050
that we talked to you

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.585
through a computer screen

00:01:58.585 --> 00:01:59.319
and then get a phone

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.187
call from you saying,

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.789
I have a video of your son.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.757
I didn't want to say on live television,

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.259
which is so appreciated.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:06.893
Of course,

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:09.095
the way everything has unfolded,

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:11.464
the gentleness that you used.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.233
Because at the end of the day,

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:16.002
you're a journalist and journalists

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.337
want a story.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.172
And that could have been

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:20.807
dealt with in many other ways

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.942
that were not kind and gentle.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:25.378
Seeing that video in general

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:26.880
gave us a dose of optimism.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.548
How were you able to

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:29.916
get through each day?

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.218
I personally feel like

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:34.154
we have to keep running

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.956
to the end of the earth to save him,

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:39.192
and we have to try to

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:42.395
go believing that somehow

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:46.299
he got treatment and he's there.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.935
They showed me Hirsch's room,

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:50.170
which Rachel would visit

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.471
to feel close to him.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:54.107
We have reports that face himself,

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.441
and I went out Friday night

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.444
and it was like screaming to him

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:02.048
and hoping him just because Friday night,

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:02.348
you know,

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:03.516
we bless our children

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.485
traditionally in Jewish homes.

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.787
You bless your children on Friday night.

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:09.088
So I was screaming.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:11.958
It's a traditional blessing for us.

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.394
The Bible, what is the blessing today?

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:17.530
It says, May God bless you and keep you.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:18.831
May God

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.466
may God's face shine upon

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.035
you and be gracious to you.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:25.104
May God's countenance countenance be lift

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:27.207
up to lifted up towards you,

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.541
and give you peace.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.043
In the weeks after Rachel

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.611
and John worked tirelessly

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.346
to raise awareness about Hirsch

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:36.349
and the other hostages, Richard would.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:37.183
You're wearing,

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.886
a tag that says 26.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.889
Don't tell people what that is.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.625
Well, this morning I realized,

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.192
you know what?

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:47.527
It's day 26,

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:47.994
and I

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:51.397
don't know if anyone is really counting.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:54.901
I don't know how many people really care

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:55.935
every single day

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.837
until these people come home.

00:03:57.837 --> 00:04:00.139
I'm going to be where and what day it is.

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.142
So this is my new.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.312
Fashion statement.

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:08.514
The weeks turned into months.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:10.216
This was them in April.

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:11.751
We're living on another planet,

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:15.355
so I don't know that we comprehend time

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:16.456
the way that you do.

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:19.158
Or normal people.

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:22.161
We feel that everybody has failed

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:23.329
our leaders.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:26.766
All of them have failed to make

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.136
this suffering on all sides.

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:33.039
Stop.

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.242
we feel that we as parents have failed

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:40.146
because as a parent, your job is to

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.382
keep your children safe.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:44.050
It feels good.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.184
But then suddenly,

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:46.085
a few weeks later,

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:46.919
Hamas released

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.355
this hostage video of Hirsch.

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.557
It was the first proof his parents had.

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:52.625
He was alive.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:57.664
We were sobbing, tears and emotional,

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:01.401
overwhelmed feelings were just

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:03.870
abounding.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.338
we weren't even listening

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:06.539
to what he was saying.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.508
Just hearing his voice

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:11.344
and seeing him moving

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.446
and that he was alive.

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:14.781
Then in late June,

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:15.682
another video

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:17.216
was released by the hostages

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:19.018
and missing families, for

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:21.254
this one taken on October 7th.

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:22.922
Moments after the first video

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.624
I'd sent them ended.

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:27.393
You had so much concern about,

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:27.627
you know,

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.362
whether Hirsch had made it out

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.864
just from his injury alone.

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:32.965
you see a tourniquet

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:36.569
being put on at later on in the video?

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.404
That.

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:38.705
I mean,

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:39.205
do you think

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:40.873
that probably saved his life?

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:42.709
Well, I'm happy that

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:46.679
for whatever reasons, that

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:49.349
he was obviously treated because,

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.117
as we all know,

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:52.985
on day 201,

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:56.289
we had a video released that shows Hirsch

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.391
with a stump

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:00.860
where that jagged bone had been.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.097
But we know from day 201,

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:08.368
thank God that he is alive.

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:10.536
129 days later,

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.905
that hope became heartbreak.

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:16.275
On day 330, Hirsch Goldberg Poland's

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:19.278
body was found with five other hostages.

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:21.280
Alexander Loeb in off

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.283
Carmel, got Almog Suruchi,

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:27.687
Adin Yerushalmi, and Ori Danilo.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.223
Israel says they were executed

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.924
in a tunnel in Gaza,

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:34.894
shot to death at close range.

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:36.295
According to the Israeli

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:37.263
prime Minister's office,

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:39.832
there believed to be about 101 hostages

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:41.467
still remaining in Gaza,

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:43.836
35 are believed to be dead.

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:44.637
Short time ago,

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:46.873
I spoke with Orna and Ronen Neutra,

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:48.875
whose son Omer is another

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.042
Israeli American still

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:50.877
being held captive.

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:54.280
Orna Ronen, thank you for

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.715
talking with me today.

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.450
I know you consider John

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.451
Poland and Rachel

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.254
Goldberg, Poland family.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.257
How are you dealing with what's happened?

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:08.394
We are completely devastated, Anderson.

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:10.863
This shouldn't have happened.

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:12.598
Hirsch was supposed to come out

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.700
in the first phase of a deal

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.669
that's been on the table for a long time

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:19.772
now, and it's just completely outrageous

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:20.873
and devastating

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:22.942
that this is what happened.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:24.143
Hirsch managed

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:27.547
to survive in the 11 most terrible months

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:29.115
with the monsters

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:31.884
of, of of Hamas in Gaza,

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:33.786
and yet was murdered

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:36.088
and executed a couple of days ago

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:37.323
in a most brutal way.

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:39.525
It just heartbreaking.

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:42.528
Rachel, yesterday, at the funeral said,

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:44.397
that that she hopes

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:46.532
that that Hirsch's death will be

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:47.900
what she called a turning point

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.402
in this horrible situation.

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:52.405
And, and John said maybe, just maybe,

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:53.573
your death, meaning

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.475
Hirsch's death is the stone,

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.009
the fuel that will bring home

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:59.712
the remaining 101 hostages.

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:00.913
Do you think that's possible?

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:01.747
Do you feel like

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:02.915
something may be different

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:05.284
now for for Omer and the others?

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:08.387
You know, it's it's not a clear path.

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:10.823
we're seeing still many challenges,

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:13.125
in the region.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.795
We're seeing a prime minister,

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:18.331
that is not willing to make

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.165
the compromises

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.399
needed to reach a deal

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.400
to bring our son

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.536
and the other hostages back.

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:26.005
We sure see, the Israeli

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:27.940
public pouring in big numbers

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.442
into the streets

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:32.778
and telling the Israeli government that

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:36.549
this event of the six hostages

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.884
that were murdered

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:39.151
few days back,

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:40.720
it just unacceptable

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.321
that this will continue.

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:45.057
And we just hoping that this

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:48.060
outpour outrage that,

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.596
we see in Israel is going to affect

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:51.697
the government

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:54.700
and Bibi Netanyahu himself to,

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:57.904
to reach that so desired deal

00:08:58.104 --> 00:08:59.138
and get the hostages

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:01.407
back, as we know, this is urgent.

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:04.410
And among them are 22 year old son,

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:08.080
who, by the way, turns 23 on October 14th

00:09:08.347 --> 00:09:10.516
and this will be his second birthday,

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:11.617
being held hostage.

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:15.354
A very true, true.

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:16.822
It's hard to think about that.

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:18.658
No, we can't think that far.

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:23.229
And we really hope that that, a deal,

00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:26.265
that the US government is working

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:26.966
so hard

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:28.734
with the partners in the region

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:31.270
will be caught between Israel and Hamas

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.405
and the two leaders,

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.975
Hamas leader and Israeli, government

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:37.777
must reach that deal,

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:38.244
or else we

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:39.845
won't see our deal once coming back.

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.781
Do you have faith on unthinkable

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:44.183
in in the prime minister, in Netanyahu,

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.318
he asked for forgiveness

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:46.619
that the six murdered hostages

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:47.653
weren't brought back alive.

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:48.220
He also said

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.556
Hamas will pay a heavy price for this.

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:53.526
Do you think he has the hostages

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:56.529
front and center in his priorities?

00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:59.832
Well, we don't, unfortunately not.

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:02.301
we met him in the white House

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:03.936
with President Biden.

00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:05.571
We looked him in the eyes

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:06.606
and unfortunately,

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:07.840
our feeling

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.843
is that he has his own political future

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:12.244
ahead of him

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:14.914
rather than the safety of our son.

00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:16.215
It's not just our son.

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:18.250
I don't believe that he has the interest

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.885
of the Israeli people,

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:23.522
as his top priority.

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:26.225
anyone you know that's looking at

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:27.627
this can see that

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.862
Israelis need the hostages

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:30.563
to come home

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:33.299
for them to be able to recover from this,

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.567
to move forward.

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:35.601
But the first step

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:38.404
would be to bring the hostages back to

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:39.405
to make the families

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:41.140
whole, to,

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.309
bring back some sense of security. Right.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.677
This was a breach

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:46.445
between the Israeli

00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:47.847
government and its people,
