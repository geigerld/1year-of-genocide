00:00:02.322 --> 00:00:03.056
Jeremy diamond.

00:00:03.223 --> 00:00:07.961
Give us the latest, Jeremy.

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:11.965
&gt;&gt; Reporter: Today we set out to

00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:13.132
do a story of the hundreds of

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:14.534
thousands of military reservists

00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:16.002
and this massive military

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:17.036
buildup that Israel is preparing

00:00:17.203 --> 00:00:18.972
for.

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:20.306
As we set out to do this story

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.975
along the gaza border and

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:23.142
Israeli communities here, one

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:24.978
thing became clear that this is

00:00:24.978 --> 00:00:27.547
a very volatile, very unstable

00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:28.982
situation even before the next

00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:30.516
phase of Israel's military

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.151
campaign, whatever it may be,

00:00:32.318 --> 00:00:33.253
reveals itself.

00:00:33.353 --> 00:00:34.988
Whether it was rockets flying

00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:40.059
overhead as we were in the city

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.997
of sderot, or a firefight we

00:00:43.997 --> 00:00:44.564
caught, this is a very unstable,

00:00:44.998 --> 00:00:49.102
uncertain situation.

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:51.004
Three days after hundreds of

00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:53.439
hamas militants infiltrated

00:00:53.573 --> 00:00:55.008
Israel, Israeli forces are still

00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:55.642
fighting to eliminate the

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.545
threat.

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.016
We are outside the Israeli town

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:05.018
of mythalseem where we have been

00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:08.488
hearing repeated exchanges of

00:01:08.588 --> 00:01:09.255
gunfire the last ten minutes or

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.489
so.

00:01:09.656 --> 00:01:11.090
We haven't seen exactly who they

00:01:11.257 --> 00:01:13.092
are between, but we know Israeli

00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:15.094
forces have been continuing to

00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:16.562
try and clear some of these

00:01:16.696 --> 00:01:19.299
Israeli towns around the gaza

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.401
strip from those hamas

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:22.035
militants.

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:24.370
The idf later confirming they

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.239
killed two hamas terrorists in

00:01:26.372 --> 00:01:27.106
the battle.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.042
Minutes after it ended, Israeli

00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:30.343
defense forces rushing a

00:01:30.443 --> 00:01:37.116
casualty into an ambulance.

00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:40.520
The south track to life in most

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.621
Israeli communities around the

00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:42.388
gaza strip today wasn't gunfire,

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:45.491
but rockets.

00:01:45.658 --> 00:01:48.394
In sderot, the booms punctuate

00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:49.495
the stillness of the day.

00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:53.066
&gt;&gt; Just coming to a shelter here

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:54.267
where we can take cover from

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.601
iron dome interceptions.

00:01:55.702 --> 00:01:57.070
They're intercepting active

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.073
rockets coming in from gaza.

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:01.474
The booms are very loud, they're

00:02:01.574 --> 00:02:02.241
directly overhead.

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:04.611
20 minutes later, another

00:02:05.078 --> 00:02:06.179
barrage of rockets headed for

00:02:06.312 --> 00:02:08.414
the city of ashkelon.

00:02:08.514 --> 00:02:11.217
We're in the city of sderot

00:02:11.317 --> 00:02:12.318
where we can see that barrage

00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:14.621
that hamas promised at 5:00 P.M.

00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:16.222
Appearing to head over in the

00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:18.391
direction of ashkelon.

00:02:18.524 --> 00:02:20.093
That is exactly where hamas

00:02:20.193 --> 00:02:22.362
officials said about an hour ago

00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:25.098
that they would fire rockets in

00:02:25.098 --> 00:02:25.665
that direction.

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.667
But there is also another sound

00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:31.738
in towns like sderot.

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:34.107
Israeli troops and reservists

00:02:34.107 --> 00:02:36.776
mobilizing to the gaza front.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.578
Part of a massive call-up of

00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:42.382
more than 300,000 reserve

00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:43.116
troops, preparations for a

00:02:43.182 --> 00:02:44.417
potential ground invasion of

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.717
gaza.

00:02:45.118 --> 00:02:46.152
For some, this moment feels

00:02:46.252 --> 00:02:47.353
different.

00:02:47.453 --> 00:02:52.258
&gt;&gt; Then we came in with a

00:02:52.425 --> 00:02:53.126
concept of full control.

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.127
This one started with obviously

00:02:54.227 --> 00:02:56.763
more confusion and the playing

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.802
field is different.

00:03:03.136 --> 00:03:04.270
But I think in the last two

00:03:04.404 --> 00:03:06.205
days, the momentum has shifted.

00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:08.274
&gt;&gt; Reporter: An entire country

00:03:08.408 --> 00:03:09.709
springing into action with those

00:03:10.143 --> 00:03:11.310
T of uniform bringing food and

00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:14.147
supplies to troops.

00:03:14.147 --> 00:03:17.150
After days of tragedy, also a

00:03:17.283 --> 00:03:19.285
sense of resilience.

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.421
"I'm not afraid at all," she

00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:21.788
said.

00:03:22.155 --> 00:03:22.622
"When it will be my time, it

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:26.592
will be my time."

00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:28.161
Wolf, late Tuesday evening, the

00:03:28.161 --> 00:03:30.329
Israel defense forces also now

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.431
confirming that the first

00:03:31.597 --> 00:03:33.533
shipments of advanced U.S.

00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:35.234
Weaponry provided by the united

00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:38.171
States in the wake of hamas'

00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:40.173
attack this past weekend has now

00:03:40.173 --> 00:03:41.174
arrived in Israel.

00:03:41.207 --> 00:03:44.544
It arrived at the nevatim air

00:03:44.644 --> 00:03:45.645
base in southern Israel.

00:03:45.745 --> 00:03:47.714
The idf did not say what kind of

00:03:47.847 --> 00:03:49.182
weaponry was being provided,

00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:50.450
simply that it is, quote,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.185
designed to facilitate

00:03:52.218 --> 00:03:54.187
significant military operations

00:03:54.253 --> 00:03:55.655
and increase preparedness for
