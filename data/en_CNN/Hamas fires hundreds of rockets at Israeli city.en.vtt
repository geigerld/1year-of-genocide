00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:01.968
Okay.

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:04.771
This is video from moments ago.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:08.274
You can see rockets being fired from Gaza

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:12.245
Our reporter

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:13.279
Nic Robertson

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.181
is just over the border from Gaza

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.684
in Israel. Inside the road.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.651
Nic, why don't you tell us

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:19.953
what you're seeing

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:23.189
Yeah,

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.992
we are seeing a massive barrage of

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.661
Iron Dome intercepts in the sky.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:29.229
Here.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.398
You can just make out the tiny

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.767
puffs of white smoke in the sky.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.402
Each one of those puffs

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.371
is an intercept of an Iron Dome defensive

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:42.175
missile system taking down Hamas rockets.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:44.377
And you can see over my shoulder

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.011
that some of the

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:47.380
traces of the rockets themselves

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.015
that have been fired through the sky,

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.850
it looks as if those

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.420
those iron domes were stopping

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.622
the rockets going to the two

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.524
big Israeli towns along the coast.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:58.058
There

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:02.228
Ashkelon with the power station and ash.

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.931
Ashdod further up the coast there

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:07.700
you could see the missiles coming out

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:08.968
from the Iron Dome

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.003
and intercepting

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.604
with the rockets in the sky.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.440
So literally in the last

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.874
in less than an hour

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:15.742
from here,

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.377
there's been attacks,

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.344
missile attacks,

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:19.012
Hamas missile

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:22.082
attacks on on this town start.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:22.849
There's been

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.819
missile attacks on Tel Aviv as well.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.221
We saw those rockets going out

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.623
and there have been these rocket missile

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:33.760
attacks on Ashkelon and Ashdod,

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:34.761
it appears.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.130
So at this moment.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.666
This afternoon, Hamas is clearly showing

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.434
it's got firepower left.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.203
It's got the longer-range

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:43.703
weapons

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:44.904
that it was always difficult

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:46.139
for it to produce.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.675
They can reach as far as central Israel.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.076
It's got the shorter range ones

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:51.277
that can come in here

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.445
and the mid-range ones

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.747
that can reach up along the coast.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:55.982
So Hamas is showing that

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:58.118
despite all the strikes on it so far,

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.820
it has the capability

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.124
and the reserves of rockets to continue

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:04.891
firing out.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.228
Nic Robertson, stand by if you can.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.028
And it is safe.

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:10.230
I just want to give people a sense

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.264
of where you are.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:13.266
You can see in red here is Gaza.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.701
If we can put it back up there.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.202
This is enrolled right here.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.537
This is where Nic Robertson is

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:20.173
just over the border from Gaza.

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:22.709
He could hear Iron Dome,

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.010
that is Israeli air

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.944
defense missiles

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.179
being shot up into the sky.

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.846
To get rockets

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.481
that were being fired from Gaza.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.150
And as Nic was explaining here,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.151
some of the targets

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.685
of these rocket attacks

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.921
from Gaza appear to be Ashkelon

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:35.922
and Ashdod.

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.557
Here, Israeli cities

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.926
right on the Mediterranean coast.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.362
Nic Robertson, again, back to you.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.831
How constant is this

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.466
and do you feel like

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:47.767
you're hearing more outgoing?

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:48.568
Can you distinguish

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.570
between the outgoing from Gaza

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.772
and the air intercepts from Israel?

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.745
Yes, the outgoing from

00:02:58.745 --> 00:02:59.712
Gaza, you see,

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:01.214
because there's the

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:03.283
the white trailers behind the rockets.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.450
So you see them

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.252
particularly the longer-range ones.

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:06.719
At night,

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.954
you see them outgoing

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.722
because of sort of the orange burn,

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:11.424
a trail on the back of the rocket

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:13.860
and the intercepts start out as well.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.328
But you can actually I can

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:15.795
I can

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:16.729
I have a rough idea

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.031
of their firing positions now

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.832
because you see them come up,

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:20.934
you see a little red

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.602
dot flying through the sky

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.437
and then it explodes

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:25.872
into a puff of white smoke.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.407
You hear the percussion from it

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:29.042
when it intercepts with that rocket.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:32.111
So the dynamics of how this works.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:35.882
We have a very good vantage point here.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.917
All right, Nic Robertson, stand by.

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:39.319
You're in Surratt.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.887
Let's go over to Clarissa Ward.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.088
We can see her shot up right now.

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:43.223
Clarissa, if you can hear us.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.925
You're in Ashkelon, Also, rockets firing.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:46.893
What are you experiencing

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:50.296
Yes.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:50.663
Okay.

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:51.364
We had

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.065
seen on

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.433
the Hamas Telegram channel

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:55.268
that they were warning

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:56.035
that there was going to be

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:57.437
some kind of a threat

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:58.938
that they told people to leave.

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:00.540
By 5 p.m.,

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.875
we got here literally it's 5 minutes

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.411
to five. Air raid sirens start.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:06.012
I was there.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:06.512
I should just say

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:08.848
sirens started going off

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:09.582
We were immediately

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:10.883
dragged into the bunker

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:13.720
by another person here and massive

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.888
amount of missiles

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:17.757
just slamming in all around.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.692
We also heard hi, Fred.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:20.460
We also heard there's

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.527
other journalists here as well.

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:21.928
Obviously,

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.963
we also heard the Iron Dome intercepting

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:24.664
some of them.

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:24.998
You can

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.766
actually smell

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.968
the smell of the explosives

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:29.902
coming from

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:32.438
some of the balconies out there.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.140
So unclear at the moment

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.142
how many of these rockets

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.577
may have made impact

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:37.944
or what

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:38.945
the damage may be,

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.647
what the casualty rate may be.

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:42.815
But certainly

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.018
a lot of rockets were fired.

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:46.052
The hotel was

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.789
a relatively secure location.

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:50.056
Okay.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.191
We're hearing more sirens coming again.

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.793
So I'm just going to move

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:56.029
away from the window

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:58.765
and

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.335
the other

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:03.569
shelters over there.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.505
Do we want to go towards the shelter?

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:06.806
Well, let's just say sorry.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.942
So the bunker the bunker is this way

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:14.247
we've moved this place

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.321
just moving into this bunker here.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.755
This is actually where we were

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:25.024
when the last barrage came in as well.

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:28.094
Every floor of the hotel has a bunker

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:31.397
like this. Yeah.

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:34.067
You can hear some activity out there.

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:37.103
It's not anything like it was

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:38.671
on that previous round.

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:38.938
I don't know

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:42.241
if you're picking up on that.

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:45.211
That sounds like maybe interceptions.

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.145
It's difficult to know,

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:48.681
but that's what it sounds like.

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:50.783
But it's a bit quieter now.

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:52.952
We're trying also

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:53.553
to send in

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:55.388
some video that we

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:56.723
captured from inside the bunker

00:05:56.723 --> 00:06:00.993
when the first round of rockets went off.

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:02.929
And

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:04.997
but yeah,

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:08.101
just waiting to see and get some clarity.

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:08.768
Yeah.

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:10.236
Clarissa, what we're showing,

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:11.237
I want to give viewers

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:13.106
some point of reference here.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.173
You're in Ashkelon.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.075
You've got incoming.

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:17.276
You guys are in a bunker right now.

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:18.344
Stay there with me, if you will.

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:19.112
Clarissa, on the other

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:19.746
side of your screen,

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:20.446
everyone, what you're

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:21.547
where you can also see

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:22.482
is to rot

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:24.650
where there is incoming as well.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.085
John's over at the wall

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:28.454
and he can show in relation

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.223
to what these two areas

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.524
that we're talking about.

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:32.024
As we go

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:33.359
back, Clarissa, stick with me

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:35.128
as we go back to Nic Robertson.

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.296
Nic, you're seeing incoming as well.

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:37.997
Talk us through it.

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:42.001
So the

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:42.802
vantage point that

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:43.669
we have here,

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.071
we can see the rockets

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:45.938
coming out of Gaza.

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:48.441
I can see those rockets coming up.

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:49.776
Then there were the intercepts

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:50.109
and that's

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:51.544
when Clarissa was getting the warning

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:52.445
to go to the bunker.

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.147
The sirens were picking it up.

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:57.016
Clarissa is over there in Ashkelon, close

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:58.951
to those power station chimneys.

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:00.019
The three big chimneys

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.387
you see on the horizon.

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:02.488
That's where she is.

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:04.857
And I'm just sort of going to duck down,

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:05.925
I suppose,

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:06.826
here to see that

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.594
so that John can get a better view.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:09.829
So you see the rockets

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:10.630
come up

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.064
where John's pointing the camera

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:13.633
now out of Gaza,

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:16.302
and then they're flying up into the sky

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:19.071
and being picked up by the Iron Dome

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:20.940
as I was flying towards

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.075
Ashkelon, where where Clarissa is.

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:24.544
And then the Iron Dome

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:26.879
kicks off and starts intercepting them.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:27.280
And that's the

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.415
what was the white puffs of smoke?

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:31.551
So what Clarissa has experienced

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.219
at the end of those missiles,

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:34.921
we have a position

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:37.356
where we can see the missiles going out

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:38.891
and being intercepted

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:40.660
some of them being intercepted

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.695
on their way to where she is.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:45.064
And just before those missiles took off.

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:46.065
There were fighter

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.400
jets in the air as well.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.435
And a couple of explosions from Gaza.

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.170
So it kind of gave the impression

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.305
that the fighters had gone

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:52.939
up, the fighter

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.575
jets had gone up to try to target

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:57.543
Hamas, firing those rockets out of here.

00:07:57.543 --> 00:07:57.977
Another

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:01.714
fighter jet in the in the sky just now.

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:02.748
I can't see it.

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:05.251
But typically when when Hamas comes out

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:06.519
to fire their rockets,

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:08.754
typically the jets come on station here

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:10.490
and we'll look for targets.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.859
Look for those Hamas

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:14.794
Hamas militants with their rockets.

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:16.128
They're firing positions

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:18.798
to take them out. This is a

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:21.367
this is a very this view from here

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:23.569
gives you a very strong understanding

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:26.038
of the dynamic of this battle.
