00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:00.533
A special

00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.468
investigation

00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:02.302
here at CNN

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.504
looking at the deadly weapons arsenal

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:05.672
that Hamas had, that

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.507
they used to unleash terror

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.108
and to slaughter

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:09.609
all those innocent people.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:11.911
What weapons did they use

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:14.714
and where did they get them?

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:18.551
Oren Liebermann is OUTFRONT.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:22.055
An entire arsenal on display.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.823
Weapons fashioned in Hamas's

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:27.260
homegrown facilities, but no less deadly.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.561
CNN analyzed

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.629
dozens of photos

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.131
and videos of Hamas militants

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.732
during the surprise assault

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:33.333
to identify

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.601
the weapons used to kill

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.770
at least 1200 people in Israel.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.937
The most important character

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.439
risk of the military equipment

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:40.874
they have, it's that it's

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.208
easily interchangeable.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.644
It's reliable, dependable,

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:46.646
and you can get parts for it.

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.181
Many, like the Soviet built

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.783
50 caliber machine gun,

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:50.850
appear to be Russian

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.118
or Chinese firearms

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.887
relics from previous wars

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:54.788
that made their way

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.456
into the hands of Hamas,

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.224
ubiquitous among many of the photos

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.092
and videos.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:02.095
The aftermath Kalashnikov, the AK 47,

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.097
the preferred weapon for militant groups

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:06.199
capable of spewing automatic fire

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:09.769
with horrific results.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:10.370
The assault

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.304
rifles, along

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:12.172
with the grenades

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.674
carried by Hamas militants,

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:16.142
made them deadly when they reached

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.711
Israeli towns and villages near Gaza.

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:19.679
All they're trying to do

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.314
is provide the shock effects,

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:22.682
provide dependability.

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:24.317
Their weapons have to work.

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:25.785
So they're very rudimentary.

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:27.387
But based on their training

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.456
best in how they operate them,

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:33.026
they are successful with them.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.661
Hamas, his main weapon, has long

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.162
been their supply of rockets

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.131
from short range to long range.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.466
The terror attack on Saturday

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.166
morning began

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.470
with a barrage of rocket fire,

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.972
a smokescreen for the imminent attack.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.173
Thousands of rockets

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.008
overwhelmed Israel's Iron Dome air

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.076
defense system,

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:51.111
a tactic Hamas

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.812
has refined over the years.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:53.880
That's the capability

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.316
for the enemy, for Hamas,

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.319
just to fire them up against

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.787
potentially commercial aircraft.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:01.621
And that,

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:02.155
I think, is

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.723
one of the major issues

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:05.158
of these terrorist groups.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.392
And if they have those kinds of weapons

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.193
in their hands.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.761
Hamas used paragliders

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.330
to cross the Gaza border.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.631
The recreational vehicles

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:12.832
are barely maneuverable

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:14.834
and easy to target in the air.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.569
But in the chaos of the moment,

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.171
the plan worked.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.172
Some of the weapons

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:19.772
and equipment

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.975
were decidedly more low tech.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.243
Israel built a complex

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:24.978
underground barrier to stop tunnels

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.613
from crossing the Gaza border.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.381
So Hamas used a bulldozer

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.617
to tear down the aboveground fence.

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:33.419
They are just looking to create chaos

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.587
with the kind of equipment they have.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:38.691
And the equipment has got to be reliable.

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:39.859
Worth noting that these are

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.161
only the videos and the weapons

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.862
we saw in the videos and the

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:45.031
and the photos from from the attack.

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:45.665
We've seen them use

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:46.766
other weapons in the past

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:47.967
like anti-tank

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.802
anti-armor rockets or missiles.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:50.503
And, Erin, that's

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.906
what makes a ground incursion by Israel

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:56.943
such a difficult proposition.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.212
All right, Oren, thank you very much.

00:02:59.212 --> 00:02:59.812
With all of that

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:00.813
reporting on the weapons,

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:01.681
I want to go now

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:02.715
to Lieutenant Colonel

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:03.750
Jonathan Conricus,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.251
the international spokesperson

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.686
for the Israeli Defense Forces.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.620
And,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.122
Colonel, obviously,

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.757
welcome back to the program.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.792
You heard Oren's report.

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:15.695
Do you feel right now that

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.264
that the IDF knows

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:20.900
what sort of an arsenal Hamas

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.601
has right now,

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:22.669
whether it be rockets

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.404
and other sorts of weaponry?

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:26.072
Do you know the extent

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:28.441
of the arsenal right now?

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:29.943
I don't.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:30.510
Hi, Aaron.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.811
Thank you for having me again.

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:34.647
I think that the story you just aired

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:37.650
is very comprehensive, Interesting.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.652
And, well done one.

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:40.587
And I think that

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:42.989
the short answer to your question is, no,

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:43.756
we don't.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:44.023
And I

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:44.958
think that we have

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.962
to be extremely cautious and very humble

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.330
in our approach

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.098
for the next stage of operations,

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:55.868
because clearly our enemy has shown

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.303
that they have had the ability

00:03:57.303 --> 00:04:01.241
to acquire and train and use weapons

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.675
that they haven't done before,

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.110
and they field to them,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.712
unfortunately, successfully

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:06.613
on the battlefield.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.114
So we have to be very,

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:12.151
very humble and strong focused

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:13.886
and I would say aggressive

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:17.857
in our approach against them.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.792
So you talk about being aggressive

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.561
in the next stages,

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.630
even as you say, you need to be humble.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.430
You know, Israel

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.165
obviously issued that evacuation

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:27.367
order for northern Gaza.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:28.368
The United Nations said

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:30.937
it was a 24 hour deadline.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.639
Where are we in this?

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.506
Are you able to give

00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:35.842
any sort of a sense of

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:41.080
when Israel may move?

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:44.150
Yeah, it's about 2:30 a.m.

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:45.018
local time.

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:46.786
So it's dark and it's,

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:47.153
of course,

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:49.022
very difficult to

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:49.822
see exactly

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:51.257
what's happening in the Gaza Strip.

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:52.825
But we've been following

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:53.559
throughout the day

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.461
and we've been monitoring the movement,

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:56.496
the mass movement

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.931
of Palestinian civilians, who,

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.200
I'm happy to say many, many.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.734
I don't know

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:03.036
exactly how many, but many,

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.771
many have listened to the warnings

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.773
and have indeed moved

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:08.608
evacuated themselves to the south.

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:10.476
And that is very good for them

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.178
and their families.

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:14.714
I'm not going to put a time line on

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:16.382
our time schedule, sorry,

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:18.651
on our activities.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.786
I can only say that

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:22.789
we are trying to do the right thing here.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:23.523
We're trying to get

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:25.358
the civilians out of the way

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:27.660
because we are going to intensify

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.396
the operations in and around Gaza City

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:31.731
whenever we will feel

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:33.900
that the situation is

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.135
tenable for military operations.

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:37.303
I assume that that is when

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:41.441
the operations will continue.

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.343
And you also you

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:44.610
did have some operations today.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.079
Obviously, those were more special forces

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.813
back in there.

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:49.449
Can you tell us anything about

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.850
whether they were successful

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.620
or what was accomplished?

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:56.422
Yeah, they were successful

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:57.957
in the sense that they were able

00:05:57.957 --> 00:05:59.926
to find new intelligence

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:02.929
and perhaps shed a little bit more light

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:04.964
on the very complex task

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:07.500
we have of understanding

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.304
who was taken hostage and who wasn't.

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:13.406
Who is dead and who might be missing.

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:15.475
And then trying to piece together

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:18.010
other sources of intelligence

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.147
and building a more cohesive picture

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:24.417
of where they are and who they are.

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.919
And then, of course, supporting a plan on

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.020
how to get them out.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.889
So, yes, it was successful.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.891
We found intelligence that

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.092
the support staff

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:35.294
and of course, that is a very high

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:38.431
I would say number one priority for us is

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:40.366
to find those people,

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:43.936
get them back home to Israel.

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:45.104
And Hamas claims that

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:48.207
13 of them, 13 Israeli hostages in Gaza,

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:49.142
they say were killed,

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:50.009
they say were actually killed

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.279
by IDF air strikes in the past 24 hours.

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:54.147
I know that

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:55.214
one of your colleagues had said

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:56.315
that Israeli intelligence

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.251
was looking into it.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.218
Is there any truth to

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:02.955
what Hamas is claiming?

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:03.523
Well,

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:05.658
the Hamas is a lying,

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:07.360
cowardly terrorist organization

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.060
that I don't think

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.564
that any of their statements are true.

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:13.166
It is all propaganda.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.401
And they also said,

00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:16.969
I think it was on the second

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.838
or third day of the war,

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:20.373
you'll forgive me for not keeping

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:21.641
count of the days. Totally.

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:23.676
But on the second on the third day,

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:25.445
they also said that they would start

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:28.247
they would start executing hostages

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:29.449
and filming it.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.050
If Israel doesn't stop

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.852
targeting their facilities

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:35.588
and so who it's it's

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:37.523
impossible to trust what they're saying

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:39.425
and will have to believe

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:39.959
believe it

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.127
only when we see it

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.962
and when we have our intelligence

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.630
that will prove it.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.532
But at the end of the day,

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:48.134
Hamas is responsible

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:53.139
and Hamas will pay a price.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.207
Colonel, thank you very much.

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:55.575
I appreciate your time again.

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:58.311
Thank you. Thank you.
