, ARE FOLLOWING SOME BREAKING  NEWS OUT OF GAZA. WE WANTED TO  BRING TO YOU I WITNESSES AND  THE HAMAS-RUN PALESTINIAN  MINISTRY OF HEALTH SAY THAT  MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE WERE   KILLED IN WHAT IS BEING  DESCRIBED AS A CHAOTIC  INCIDENT, AS IDF SOLDIERS   OPENED FIRE AS PEOPLE WERE  TRYING TO GET FOOD FROM AID   TRUCKS. CNN'S JEREMY DIAMOND IS GATHERING NEW DETAILS. HE'S  BEEN PICKING UP SOME NEW  REPORTING. JEREMY, BRING US UP  TO SPEED HERE   &gt;&gt; WELL FIRST OF ALL, KATE, I  THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE  THAT THE AID SITUATION, THE  HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN  NORTHERN GAZA, IS JUST SO, SO  DESPERATE AND THAT SEEMS TO BE  PART OF WHAT LED TO THIS SCENE. HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE SURROUNDING SOME OF  THESE AID TRUCKS THAT WERE ABLE TO ENTER NORTHERN GAZA. SOME OF THE VERY FEW AID TRUCKS THAT  HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT IN THERE. AND YOU CAN SEE IN THIS VIDEO BY THE ISRAELI, FROM THE ISRAELI MILITARY, THE  CROWDS OF PEOPLE AROUND THESE  TRUCKS. BUT WHAT APPEARS TO  HAVE HAPPENED IS THAT THE   ISRAELI MILITARY OPEN FIRE ON  SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE   SURROUNDING THESE TRUCKS AND  ISRAELI MILITARY OFFICIAL  TELLING US THAT THE CROWD  APPROACHED THE FORCES IN A  MANNER THAT POST WAS A THREAT  TO THE TROOPS. AND THEY SAY  THAT THOSE TROOPS THEN  RESPONDED WITH LIVE FIRE. NOW,  EYEWITNESSES ON THE SCENE HAVE  TOLD US THAT ISRAELI TANKS AS  WELL AS DRONES OPENED FIRE ON  THIS CROWD   &gt;&gt; AND THAT   &gt;&gt; FOLLOWING THAT, THERE WAS A  CHAOTIC SCENE. IT'S SOME OF  THE DRIVERS OF THESE AID TRUCKS APPARENTLY TRIED TO GET AWAY   AMID THIS GUNFIRE AND KILLED  SEVERAL ADDITIONAL PEOPLE, WERE TOLD THAT 104 PEOPLE WERE   KILLED IN THIS INCIDENT, 760  PEOPLE INJURED ACCORDING TO THE PALESTINIAN MINISTRY OF HEALTH, IT'S NOT CLEAR YET HOW MANY OF THOSE WERE KILLED BY ISRAELI  GUNFIRE VERSUS BUY HE'S TRUCKS AND THE ENSUING CHAOS BUT ARE  EYEWITNESSES ON THE GROUND   INDICATE THAT IT WAS THE  ISRAELI GUNFIRE THAT PROMPTED   SOME OF THOSE TRUCKS TO FLEE  THE SCENE. AND IN THE PROCESS,  RUN OVER SOME OF THESE   INDIVIDUALS. BUT WE ARE STILL  WORKING TOGETHER ADDITIONAL  DETAILS. THE ISRAELI MILITARY   SAYS FOR ITS PART THAT THE  INCIDENT IS UNDER REVIEW AND  THEY ARE ALSO SAYING IN A   STATEMENT THAT GAZAN RESIDENTS  SURROUNDED THE TRUCKS, LOADED  THE SUPPLIES BEING DELIVERED,   AND THAT DURING THE INCIDENT,  DOZENS OF GAZANS, THEY SAY WERE INJURED AS A RESULT OF PUSHING  AND TRAMPLING. THIS WAS CLEARLY MORE THAN JUST PUSHING AND   TRAMPLING. AND WE HAVE   EYEWITNESSES MAKING VERY CLEAR  THAT THE ISRAELI MILITARY DID  INDEED OPEN FIRE HAIR ON THESE  INDIVIDUALS AS WELL. NOW, WE  SHOULD NOTE THAT THIS IS ONLY  HAPPENING BECAUSE OF HOW  DESPERATE THE HUMANITARIAN  SITUATION IS IN NORTHERN GAZA.  VERY FEW AID TRUCKS HAVE  ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT  IN THERE. THE WORLD FOOD  PROGRAM RECENTLY SUSPENDED AID  DELIVERIES TO NORTHERN GAZA,   SAYING THAT IT WAS TOO UNSAFE.  PART OF THAT HAS TO DO DO WITH  A LACK OF COORDINATION WITH THE ISRAELI MILITARY TO GET THOSE  TRUCKS INTO A WARZONE SAFELY IN A WAY THAT THEY ARE NOT  TARGETED. AND IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THE ISRAELI  MILITARY IN THE PAST HAS   TARGETED POLICE OFFICERS WHO  HAVE BEEN AROUND THOSE AID  CONVOYS. AND SO THERE'S VERY  LITTLE SECURITY FOR THESE. YOU  COMBINE THAT LACK OF SIX   PURITY. YOU COMBINE THAT WITH  THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE ON THE BRINK OF FAMINE IN NORTHERN
