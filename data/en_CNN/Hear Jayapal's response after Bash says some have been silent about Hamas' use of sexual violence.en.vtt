00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.200
With the

00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.935
collapse of the temporary truce

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.670
between Israel and Hamas

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.537
here in the US,

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:05.705
democratic divisions

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.540
over the direction of the war

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.542
and Biden's support for Israel

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.478
are once again on full display.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:11.945
Here with me

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.613
now is House Progressive Caucus

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:15.015
Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:15.815
Thank you for coming.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:18.151
It's nice to see you in person.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.020
Let's start with where we are right now

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.454
with with the war.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.023
The White House says very clearly

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.392
that Hamas is to blame for the collapse

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.926
of this temporary truce

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:27.894
for a few reasons.

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:29.529
One is that they refuse

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.399
to release the remaining women,

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:33.767
some of whom

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:34.267
sounds like

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:36.736
most of whom are 20 to 30 year old women

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.105
there hostage inside Gaza.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.841
They also renewed the military attacks

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:42.942
against Israel.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.377
You have repeatedly called

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.012
for Israel to implement

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:47.514
an indefinite cease fire.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.115
But given what we have

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.284
just seen with what I just described.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.386
Is that realistic?

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:53.820
Well, it's

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.021
what has to happen

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:56.356
and I do think it's realistic.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:58.458
I think what we saw is after

00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.359
you know, many weeks

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.160
of saying we couldn't

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.194
get to a cease fire,

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:02.495
that was not going to happen.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.064
We did have a temporary cease fire.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:04.831
And what happened,

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.066
we were able to see

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.068
a significant number of hostages

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:08.601
released.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:09.769
We were able to get

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:11.905
humanitarian aid into Gaza.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:15.041
And I think the long term plan for

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.310
what happens is incredibly important.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.878
Now, you've seen Vice President

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.180
Harris made a very strong

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.381
statement yesterday.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.285
Secretary Defense Secretary

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.854
Lloyd Austin also was very clear

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.190
that if you engage in urban warfare

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.125
in the way that Israel did

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.493
in northern Gaza,

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.695
what you will do is perhaps win

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.230
a temporary victory

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.198
or a reprieve

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.666
but you're not going to win the long term

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.733
strategic war.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.969
So the only way, Dana, to get through

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.271
this is to make sure that we,

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:45.972
first of all,

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:48.875
do not have the kinds of casualties

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.777
that we saw in northern Gaza.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.145
There's no way to do that

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.580
with the kind of war that Israel

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.715
is waging right now on Gaza.

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:56.983
A couple of things.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.652
One is you said it worked. Yes.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.821
There were hostages who were released,

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:04.924
but it wasn't even an actual hard

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:06.025
cease fire.

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.927
They were just trying to get another day

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.662
and Hamas wouldn't comply.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.931
So what makes you think that

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:14.100
Hamas would comply with a longer term

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:14.868
cease fire?

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:15.034
Well,

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:16.703
I think this is all about negotiation.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.439
Qatar has been incredibly helpful here.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.975
It's not clear to me from the reporting

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.544
who is to blame for

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:25.111
you don't believe

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:25.645
the US,

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.347
the Biden administration, that Hamas

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.182
Well, I just think it's very complex,

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:29.883
young women.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.552
I think it's very, very complicated.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:33.553
It's it's not

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:35.188
we don't have all the information

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:35.855
in front of us.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.891
We obviously can,

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:39.559
you know, can rely on some statements

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:40.026
that are made.

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:42.595
But I think that in these negotiations,

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.130
everybody wants something.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.865
And I think Qatar has said

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:47.267
that Hamas is still at the table

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.935
Israel should still be at the table.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:49.302
In fact,

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:51.704
some of the hostages are the Israeli

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.139
hostages are saying

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.807
that Israel should still be at the table

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.410
because this is complex.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.512
Negotiation, and it doesn't happen

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:03.016
unless both sides are willing to come

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.083
to some kind of an agreement.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.119
That's how we got the first seven days.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.686
That's

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.221
that's a really important point

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:08.988
about both sides

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:10.723
being willing to come to an agreement,

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:14.394
because regardless of what has happened

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.562
the last week

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:16.329
and let's just say

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.531
there is a more permanent cease fire,

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.634
you are hearing from Hamas leaders

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:22.735
over and over again

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:26.105
that the brutal massacre of the 1200

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.075
Israeli civilians was just the beginning,

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.443
just a rehearsal

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.912
and that they want to continue to do it

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.013
over and over again.

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:35.682
So a cease fire would keep

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:36.816
that brutal

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.219
terrorist regime in place and in Gaza.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.320
I don't think that's true.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.955
I think that what is true

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.890
is that Hamas needs to be taken out.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.992
It is a terrorist. I want to do that.

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:47.760
But I think the way to do that,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.163
as many terrorism experts have said,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.498
is to create a durable

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.968
and strong coalition of allies

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:55.902
within the Middle East.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.237
With the United States,

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.404
with Israel,

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.340
to make sure that we have a long

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.941
term political solution,

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:04.277
that there is an alternative to Hamas

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.812
to lead

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:06.613
in Gaza

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:07.747
and to establish

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.349
a state for Palestinians.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.950
This is I mean, we cannot

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.118
we have to condemn

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:14.220
what Hamas did on October 7th.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.022
We cannot allow now

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:19.359
for 15,000 Palestinians to date

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:20.760
to have been killed,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.095
three quarters of whom

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.763
are women and children,

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.898
and say that that is going to help us.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:26.966
And we can't listen

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:28.601
morally, Donna, morally,

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.471
but also strategically for Israel.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.905
The only way through

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.875
this is to create a situation

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.777
where there is a political solution

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.412
that involves a Palestinian state

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:40.446
and an Israeli.

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:42.548
I think ideally what you're talking about

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:44.317
could make sense.

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:45.418
It's just unclear

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:47.086
how you get from here to there.

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:49.055
Who's going to get rid of Hamas?

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:51.124
If, if, if, if

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:55.395
if there's no continued war?

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:58.197
And I think what you're relying on is

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.933
the pressure from Arab states

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:02.268
and they haven't been willing.

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:03.136
It's not just that.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.237
Well, part of the reason

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:05.438
they haven't been willing to do that

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:09.042
is because we have been allowing Israel

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:12.345
to literally indiscriminately bomb

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:13.913
hospitals, violate

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:15.848
international humanitarian law.

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:18.151
And so we are creating an October,

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:19.619
even pre October 7th.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:20.253
Can I just ask you

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.188
one more thing about that?

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:25.191
You have seen the information,

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:27.360
intelligence that Hamas

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.529
has used, its own civilians,

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:30.830
the death of civilians.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.832
Ah, it's horrendous.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.534
But Hamas has used its own civilians

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:35.401
as human shields.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:36.302
Those hospitals

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:40.106
and so forth are places where Hamas keeps

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:43.576
weapons and keeps its

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:45.278
civilians.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:46.946
It's Hamas leadership

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:48.548
that they had their headquarters there.

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:51.150
Diana, international humanitarian law

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:54.554
says that you cannot attack a hospital

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:56.723
unless there is

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:58.091
there are some circumstances

00:05:58.091 --> 00:05:59.659
if if rockets are fired

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.728
from that hospital, that is one thing.

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:03.963
But hospitals are protected.

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:06.199
We have had refugee camps that are bombed

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:07.734
right now.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:08.468
There are

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:10.002
even the only pediatric

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:12.739
hospital in Gaza is not operating.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.908
If we want to defeat terrorists,

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:16.976
we have to

00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:18.878
abide by international humanitarian law.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.880
That is just my fundamental beliefs

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.982
and that at the end of the day,

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:25.785
what we need is a lasting coalition

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:27.954
that is not going to be formed

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.155
if Israel continues

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:30.356
to do what they are doing

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:31.657
and the United States

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:34.460
cannot be back out of this

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.262
kind of indiscriminate bombing.

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:37.864
And that is my firm belief.

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:39.932
We should have conditions on military aid

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:41.501
in the same way that we do

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:43.302
to for every other country.

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:47.039
To ask you about sexual violence and

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:49.675
the it's kind

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:51.544
of remarkable that this issue hasn't

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:55.181
gotten enough attention globally.

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.717
Widespread use of rape,

00:06:58.818 --> 00:06:59.552
brutal rape,

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:00.553
sexual violence

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:02.555
against Israeli women by Hamas.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.392
I've seen a lot of progressive women,

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:07.827
generally speaking, there,

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.762
quick to defend women's rights

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:12.598
and speak out against using rape as a

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.167
as a weapon of war,

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:17.670
but downright silent on what we saw

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.704
on October 7th

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:21.507
and what might be happening inside Gaza.

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.843
Right now to these hostages. Why is that?

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:25.645
I mean, I don't

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:26.946
I don't know that that's true.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.748
I think we always talk about

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:31.184
the impact of war on women in particular.

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:32.718
Fact, I remember 20 years ago,

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:34.754
I did a petition around the war in Iraq.

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:36.322
You said saying they talked about it.

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:37.290
Oh, absolutely.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.392
And I've condemned what Hamas has done.

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:40.426
I've condemned severely

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:41.561
all of the actions.

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:42.395
Absolutely.

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:44.797
The rape, the of course.

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:47.934
But I think we have to remember that

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:50.403
Israel is a democracy

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:51.671
that is why they are a strong

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:52.772
ally of ours.

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:54.674
And if they do not comply

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:56.709
with international humanitarian law,

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.744
they are bringing themselves to a place

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:00.379
that makes it much more difficult

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:02.248
strategically for them

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:04.283
to be able to build the kinds of allies

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:05.985
to keep public opinion with them.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.186
And frankly,

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:09.856
morally, I think we cannot say that one

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.190
war crime deserves another.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.158
That is not

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.327
what international humanitarian law says.

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:15.528
With respect,

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:17.897
I was just asking about the the women

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:20.366
and you turned it back to Israel

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.368
I'm asking you about Hamas, in fact.

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:24.136
I already answered your question, Dan.

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.905
I said it's horrific.

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.773
And I think that rape is horrific.

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:29.242
Sexual assault is horrific.

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:30.676
I think that it happens

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:32.612
in war situations.

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.647
Terrorist organizations like Hamas

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:37.116
obviously are using these as tools.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.017
However,

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:41.287
I think we have to be balanced about

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.156
bringing in the outrages

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:45.391
against Palestinians.

00:08:45.391 --> 00:08:49.529
15,000 Palestinians have been killed

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.097
in Israeli airstrikes

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:53.533
three quarters of whom are women.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.667
And it's horrible.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:56.269
But you don't see Israeli

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:58.137
soldiers raping.

00:08:58.137 --> 00:08:58.771
Well, Danny,

00:08:58.771 --> 00:08:59.405
I think

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:00.439
we're not we're not

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:01.607
I don't want this to be

00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:03.209
the hierarchy of oppression.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:03.543
I think.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.778
15,000 shouldn't have been killed.

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:07.547
Should. Which is horrible.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:11.751
2.2 million Palestinians live in 140

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:13.252
square mile area,

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:15.288
which is about the size of Las Vegas,

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:17.657
with a population that is four times

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.292
that of Las Vegas.

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:21.928
And and 1.8 million Palestinians

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:24.230
right now are displaced.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.598
They are living in shelters.

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:27.033
They are being told to move

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:27.900
to south Gaza.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.769
Then south Gaza is being bombed.

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:32.004
They're being told to move to north Gaza.

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:33.406
There are no homes left.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.575
The vast majority of infrastructure

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:36.676
has been destroyed.

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.444
This is not the way

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:40.413
that we are going to beat terrorism.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.248
Whether it's Hamas or some,

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.950
I'm not sure iteration of Hamas.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.450
On that note,

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.151
I want to talk about

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:47.219
what this means domestically

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:48.254
for President Biden.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.322
You've warned

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:50.222
that the way

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.190
that the

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.124
Biden administration,

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:52.992
the president himself

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:54.727
is handling this war jeopardizes

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.495
his support among progressives

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:58.431
and Muslim American voters

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.333
and that they could actually stay home.

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:03.836
Do you think that that is how.

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:06.572
How big of a threat, political threat

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:08.641
is that to President Biden

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:09.375
in particular,

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:11.644
when it's possible

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:12.812
at this point, probable

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:14.513
that Donald Trump would be his opponent

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:16.716
and he's not exactly

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:20.252
warm when it comes to Muslims?

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:23.322
Yeah, that's an understatement.

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:24.590
Look, I am a supporter

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:25.291
of President Biden.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.326
I have been out there for the president

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.662
and I will continue to be,

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:31.964
even though I think that the way

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:33.299
that this

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.868
the handling of this war started was

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:40.339
unfortunately such that it has alienated

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:41.173
huge communities.

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:43.242
We have to be realistic about that.

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:45.444
And we have to do work right now

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.346
to address that.

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:49.115
Not just with outreach here,

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:51.183
but actually looking at the situation

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:51.884
in the Middle East

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:54.086
and recognizing that Palestinians

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:55.588
deserve the same respect.

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:56.789
Innocent Palestinians

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:58.024
deserve the same respect

00:10:58.024 --> 00:10:59.458
as innocent Israelis.
