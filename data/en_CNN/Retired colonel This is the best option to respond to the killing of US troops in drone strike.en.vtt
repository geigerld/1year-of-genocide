00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.967
We continue to follow the

00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.569
breaking news out of the Middle 

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:03.036
The U.S.

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:04.237
is working to identify

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:05.438
exactly which

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:06.072
militia group

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:07.707
carried out a deadly drone attac

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:08.508
on a small U.S.

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.610
outpost in Jordan that killed th

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.213
troops and injured more than 30 

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:14.381
This happening near the border

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.482
with Syria and Iraq.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.217
And joining me now to talk about

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.319
CNN military analyst and retired

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.653
Air Force Colonel

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:21.821
Cedric Leighton and former Middl

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:22.889
East negotiator for the State

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.891
Department, Aaron David Miller.

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.693
Colonel, I guess let me go to yo

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:27.460
Your reaction

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.996
to this deadly attack on U.S. tr

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.798
There have been

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:32.832
these moments

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:33.299
that we've seen

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.334
over the last several weeks

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:37.037
where these Iran backed militias

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:40.040
have been wreaking havoc, been a

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.542
to U.S. forces in the region.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:43.443
Obviously, this time

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.578
it's much more serious and it ma

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:48.948
bring about a U.S. response.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.583
Yeah, I think it certainly will,

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.718
And good to be with you again.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.521
This is a really serious escalat

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:55.255
at this point

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.023
and what it has done

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:57.957
because of the deaths

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:58.792
of at least three

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.026
American service members

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:04.631
and the injuries of 30 more 30 p

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:07.634
soldiers, it is clearly

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:08.868
raising the ante here.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.670
And the group that did this,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.572
whichever one it was,

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:16.376
is clearly asking for a response

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:17.177
from the U.S.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:18.978
And what that, of course, means.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.246
It remains to be seen.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:23.216
But one of the key suspects here

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:24.584
is probably Kataeb

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.820
Hezbollah, the group in Iraq.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.921
That is an Iranian main

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.355
Iranian proxy there.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.657
I could be one of the other

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.624
Iranian proxies,

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.393
but it clearly points

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.527
to a possible

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.163
escalation in that direction.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.565
And before we go to Aaron,

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:39.566
Colonel, just a quick follow up.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.700
Can you tell us more about this

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.237
outpost known as Tower 22 in Jor

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:45.905
and the military

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.807
installations that are located

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.342
in that general area?

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:52.679
This sounds a bit of a remote ou

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.514
and I wonder if it raises the qu

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:55.415
about security

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.117
at some of these installations w

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.418
forces may be vulnerable

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:00.987
to this sort of thing.

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.355
Yeah, it certainly does raise

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.690
a lot of security questions

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.257
and, of course,

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.692
force protection,

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:06.392
as we call

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:06.960
security in

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.328
the military, is a key

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:12.432
and dominant mission requirement

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.633
forces there.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.268
But this base, Tower 22,

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.704
is right near the base of our co

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:18.705
Which is in Syria.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:19.606
So it's

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.275
tower 22 is right on the Jordan

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:23.176
Syria border,

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.544
but it's also close to the

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:25.879
what they call the tri point

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.747
where three countries come toget

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:30.583
in this case Syria, Iraq and Jor

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:31.718
And because of that,

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.586
it's in a unique position

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.321
where it can oversee

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.523
a lot of the smuggling routes

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:39.526
that have in there for thousands

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.427
between all of the different are

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:43.796
within Syria and Jordan and Iraq

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.231
And it is at a very strategic

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.399
location, has provided

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.135
a lot of supplies to Al-Tanf,

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:50.904
which is the primary base

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:52.772
in this part of Syria

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:55.775
that has been used against the

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:57.110
ISIS forces

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.244
that we fought against

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.513
over the last few years.

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:01.247
And, Aaron,

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:01.881
President Biden

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.283
has been briefed on the attack.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.484
He's released a statement vowing

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.687
to hold those responsible accoun

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.689
We're already seeing calls

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.057
from Republican lawmakers

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:12.725
for a strike inside Iran.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:13.393
As a matter of fact,

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.294
we talked to

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.195
Congressman Adam Smith

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.129
at the top of the hour

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.729
and he said that

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.097
perhaps some

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.065
sites in Iran

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:20.266
should be considered

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.902
for some sort of proportionate r

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:25.038
What might that do to the situat

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:25.838
that obviously

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:26.873
has been simmering

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.041
with a lot of tensions

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.842
over the last several weeks?

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:30.476
I mean, obviously,

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.211
things could

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.445
get way more escalated

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.681
if something like that happens.

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:36.115
You know, whether we're on the c

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:37.016
Thanks for having insurance.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.519
Great, Joe Crowley.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.720
Whether we're on the cusp

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.255
of a regional war or not, I don'

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:42.622
We're

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.524
almost five months in February 7

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:46.392
will be the fifth month of this 

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.427
And and you're

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.195
looking at controlled escalation

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:50.263
to a large degree

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:52.065
across the Israeli-Lebanese bord

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.300
And even these these attacks

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.669
against American bases and

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.005
and troops in Iraq and Syria.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.608
I think the administration on th

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.277
has options that run from bad to

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.145
And I think there were only two 

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.647
They're going to respond.

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:08.114
Question

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:09.148
is, are they going to respond

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:10.783
against Iranian Revolutionary

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:13.353
Guard Corps actual

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:16.356
forces in Iraq and or Syria or,

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:18.458
as Adam Smith suggested,

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.826
are they going to risk something

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.427
that this administration,

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.463
none of its predecessors have do

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.732
and that is to strike Iranian as

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:26.933
in Iran proper,

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:27.433
which for

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:28.801
the Iranians is a

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:30.803
self-proclaimed red line.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:31.371
Whether or not

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:32.639
that proves to be the case,

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.674
we may actually begin to find ou

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:35.441
The other option,

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:35.775
of course,

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:36.909
is to strike

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.812
fast boats and Iranian naval ass

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:40.313
in the Gulf.

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:42.215
But the administration, understa

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:44.851
given the regional hotspots

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:48.187
that the Israeli-Hamas war has g

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:49.956
has a certain amount of risk ave

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.124
in their own response.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.659
I mean, they've responded

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.496
actually to what, 100 and 6070 a

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.364
since October,

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:01.067
maybe a 10th of those we've resp

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:03.436
I think on this one, however,

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:04.437
you're going to see some

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:05.738
you're going to see some firewor

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:08.775
And I think I still think we're 

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:10.310
this is not going to trip

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.144
the US and Iran

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.879
into a major confrontation.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.581
But it certainly raises the stak

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.482
Colonel, what do you think?

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.283
Can the U.S.

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:17.784
hit Iran

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:19.585
without hitting inside

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:20.953
Iranian territory

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:23.956
as as Aaron is suggesting, and p

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:26.025
strike a balance that sends a me

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:29.996
without getting things out of co

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:31.764
I think it's imperative that the

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:32.665
does that, Jim.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:33.199
And, you know,

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.434
as Aaron was pointing out,

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:35.702
this is you know,

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.003
there are several options here.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.172
Most of them are very bad.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.541
But the best option of

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.242
of a bad series of choices

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:45.078
is going to be to hit something

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:47.280
that is very important to the Ir

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.581
But it is not

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.982
something that is strikes

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:51.584
at the poor of the regime

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:52.785
or at the core of

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:53.986
some of their capabilities.

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:55.955
But it would serve as a warning 

00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:56.656
and to something

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:58.958
like attacking naval outfits

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.761
in the Persian Gulf, something l

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.030
And it kind of goes up to the li

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.964
But, you know,

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:05.765
they could do that

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:07.233
or they could stick

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:09.168
with hitting the proxies

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:10.737
in either Iraq or Syria.

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:13.339
But if there is a hand that is h

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.541
that is revealed for, let's say,

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.442
the contact

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:17.443
from Tehran,

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:20.246
that that perhaps directed this 

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:21.714
then they have to consider

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:23.249
going all that way

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:26.152
to send a message to the Iranian

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:27.353
And, Aaron,

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:29.856
while all of this is unfolding,

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:31.424
the president had sent

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.126
the CIA director to Europe in th

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:35.027
of reviving these hostage negoti

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:35.962
to get some kind of deal

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.897
going between Israel and Hamas,

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.899
to simmer things down.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:40.867
I wonder,

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:41.901
do you think the Iranians

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.270
were trying to blow this up?

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:44.637
They were

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:45.304
trying to

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:47.907
have an impact on on this proces

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:48.841
What do you think?

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:51.677
And could this

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:52.879
could this get worse

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.082
if we don't see a deal reached?

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.284
Well, it's definitely going to g

00:06:58.284 --> 00:06:59.185
It's going to get worse

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:00.920
before it gets worse, I suspect.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.854
But I you know,

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:03.156
I usually am pretty

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:05.258
knowingly negative on these matt

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.193
Bill Burns has a very close rela

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:09.729
with Mossad director David Barne

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:10.763
The Israelis actually,

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.865
I think, are under an enormous a

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:13.499
of pressure,

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:14.634
rising pressure

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:16.202
from the hostage families,

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:17.370
growing casualties.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.572
The IDF is understanding that

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.507
they may well have reached the l

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:24.377
of the most intense kinetic phas

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:26.846
and a pause two months,

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:29.348
which the Israelis could resume

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:32.051
against the Hamas leadership,

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:34.387
would, in fact, to do a couple o

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:36.355
It would allow a surge,

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:38.257
not a dribble of humanitarian as

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.359
which is badly needed in the Gaz

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:41.527
It would free

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:44.130
the hundred plus hostages that r

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.765
and the return of the 20

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:47.667
or 30 that the Israelis believe

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.335
are no longer living either.

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:50.636
Killed on October 7th,

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:51.871
their bodies taken to Gaza

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:53.806
to trade for Palestinian prisone

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:55.141
or died in captivity.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:59.645
I think it would offer some resp

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:01.280
badly needed.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.851
Will, what's happening in in

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:07.453
with respect to this attack in t

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:09.188
derail that? I don't think so.

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:11.657
I think if Hamas and the Israeli

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.327
both want a pause, then the U.S.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.728
is well-positioned,

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.530
I think, right now to try to del

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.464
But remember,

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:18.898
Middle East

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:20.766
negotiations only have two speed

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:22.768
Jim, is slow and slower.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:25.171
So this may take some time.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:25.571
All right,

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:26.772
Colonel Leighton, Aaron David Mi

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:28.174
thanks so much to both of you.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.842
Really appreciate the insights

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:30.776
on an important night.

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:31.978
A lot of

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:32.879
critical things happening,

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.213
I think, in the next couple of d

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:36.015
ahead. We'll stay on top of it.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.683
Really appreciate that. Thanks s
