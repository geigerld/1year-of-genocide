00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:08.040
5-year-old Shams eyes are a portal&nbsp;
to the Past she cannot forget there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.920
are the streets and homes scarred by War&nbsp;
this building where she recited her final&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.920
prayers and then there is the indelible sight&nbsp;
of her father and sister shot dead before her

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:30.160
eyes sh's mother saah who suffered&nbsp;
Burns as a child will never forget that

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:44.640
day but there's more to their story than&nbsp;
tragedy and loss in war Tor Gaza sham and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.720
sa's story is unlike any other we have come&nbsp;
across in 10 months of War that's because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.960
saah doesn't just accuse Israeli troops&nbsp;
of killing her husband acram and daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:05.480
Yasmin an Israeli soldier may also have saved&nbsp;
her life on November 24th the week-long truce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.960
between Israel and Hamas begins thousands of&nbsp;
people begin heading back to their homes in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.560
Northern Gaza sa and her family are among them&nbsp;
but as they approach the salatin neighborhood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:29.920
where they lived they find themselves&nbsp;
walking alone and then shots ring out

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.040
her husband soon decides to crawl away&nbsp;
to try to find help but moments later he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:59.840
is shot again fatally sah lies on the ground&nbsp;
bleeding cradling her eldest daughter yasine

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:09.260
[Music]

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:18.680
[Music]

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:29.840
as a mother I mean you must have felt&nbsp;
absolutely helpless in that moment

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.280
yasine soon died in her mother's arms&nbsp;
for hours sah lies here with Sham&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.240
unable to move until she finally&nbsp;
finds the strength to crawl down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.040
the street and into this nearby home&nbsp;
we obtained footage from that house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.720
after our first interview with sah this&nbsp;
is the first time she and Sha are seeing

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.320
it and Sham begins to tell my&nbsp;
colleague air Salman what happened to

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:29.960
her an explosion then rocks the&nbsp;
bathroom Israeli soldiers enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.800
the house and call out in Arabic what happens&nbsp;
next is captured on muted body camera footage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:59.720
provided by the Israeli military Two&nbsp;
Soldiers treating sana's gunshot wounds

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.080
the medic soon realizes her condition&nbsp;
is serious she needs to get to a

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:25.240
hospital Israeli soldiers carry saana&nbsp;
out of the building on a stretcher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.920
her hands clutching sham nothing&nbsp;
about this footage should be be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.680
extraordinary militaries must protect&nbsp;
and care for wounded civilians when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.320
possible under international law but&nbsp;
in this war this site is exceedingly

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.840
rare for eight months sa and Sham have lived&nbsp;
in this Jerusalem Hospital their Journey here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.920
was no less traumatic interrogation and&nbsp;
strip searches came before treatment at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.640
an Israeli Hospital Israeli authorities are now&nbsp;
planning to send them back to Gaza next month&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.200
unless another country takes them in the Israeli&nbsp;
military for its part told CNN in a statement that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.760
sa and her family were caught in the crossfire&nbsp;
the IDF says its soldiers issued verbal warnings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.240
after the family stumbled upon a concealed&nbsp;
military position drawing a militant attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.760
the four people who entered in the area were&nbsp;
caught in the intense exchange of fire between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.040
the terrorists and our troops the troops did not&nbsp;
open fire at the four people nor did they aim at

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:59.640
them I wonder what would you say to that&nbsp;
one soldier if if you could see him again

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.680
sana's pain is as raw as ever and seeing her home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.240
again in footage film this&nbsp;
spring brings a flood of

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:29.560
emotion mundane objects&nbsp;
are transformed into relics

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:40.320
and saana is taken back in time to&nbsp;
the life she will never get back and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.640
Jeremy's joining us now from Tel Aviv&nbsp;
Jeremy very very powerful story I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.960
to know whether there's any update to&nbsp;
the fact that you report the IDF says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.600
they're going to send her back with&nbsp;
her daughter is that is that really

00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:01.360
possible as of now Israeli authorities are&nbsp;
planning to send s and Sham back to Gaza at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.440
some point early next month but as I understand&nbsp;
it if a third country comes in and says that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.720
will take them in then there is an option here&nbsp;
for them to not go back to Gaza and I do want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.240
to stress what that could mean if they were&nbsp;
sent back to Gaza I spoke with Sham actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.040
just in the last sorry I spoke with Sana in&nbsp;
just the last hour and she told me that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.680
is terrified of going back to Gaza terrified&nbsp;
of what life would be like if she were living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.840
with her family who are currently living in&nbsp;
makeshift shelters they've been displaced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.320
four times in Gaza already so far during this&nbsp;
war but most of all she is terrified about what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:43.160
going back to Gaza could mean for her daughter&nbsp;
sham uh you know I first met sham five months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.160
ago and and the girl that she is now is very&nbsp;
different from the girl she was 5 months ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.640
she has opened up so much more and her mother is&nbsp;
terrified that should they go back to Gaza all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:59.800
of the progress that she has made since then uh&nbsp;
could effectively be erased in an instant it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.720
incredible how resilient children can be given&nbsp;
half the chance but I want to know what about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.200
the bigger picture in terms of a ceasefire&nbsp;
for everybody's sake uh transfer of hostages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:17.080
and prisoners um there's all sorts of leaking as&nbsp;
you know and Reporting um of blaming and finger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:23.280
pointing at the Netanyahu government for for&nbsp;
not pushing these ahead even within the Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.760
establishment there are criticisms for the way&nbsp;
this is going and even Egypt has been leaking that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.400
they don't think the Israelis want a a&nbsp;
ceasefire what do you think is going on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.760
H how much do you how much store do you set&nbsp;
by what the Americans are saying that it's so

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:48.200
close it is so hard to know who or what&nbsp;
information to believe at this stage and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.760
I think we have to just kind of keep an open mind&nbsp;
about various different possibilities there's no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.600
question though that it very much seems like the&nbsp;
Americans are the most kind of optimistic the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.680
gung-ho about this current negotiating process and&nbsp;
at times it really does feel like they are almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:08.440
trying to will this uh ceasefire agreement&nbsp;
into existence you know yesterday we heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.480
the Secretary of State Anthony blinkin saying&nbsp;
that Israel has accepted this bridging proposal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.400
which is intended to bridge the gaps between the&nbsp;
Israeli position and the Hamas position but at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.120
the same time we are still hearing doubts in the&nbsp;
Israeli government about Israel's full commitment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.600
uh to the current version of the ceasefire&nbsp;
proposal and in addition to that Hamas is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.240
saying that they believe this bridging proposal&nbsp;
is effectively caving to a series of Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:40.520
demands which they view as total non-starters so&nbsp;
right now it's it seems difficult to imagine how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.520
a deal could come together this week uh which is&nbsp;
what the United States has said their goal is um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.600
but it is clear that at least negotiations&nbsp;
are continuing and we expect the Secretary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.240
of State Anthony blinkin as he arrives in Doha&nbsp;
cutter to get a better sense from the cutteries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.760
who are the key interlocutors with Hamas about&nbsp;
exactly where their head is at behind the scenes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.560
so these negotiations certainly continuing&nbsp;
very hard to see where they go from here
