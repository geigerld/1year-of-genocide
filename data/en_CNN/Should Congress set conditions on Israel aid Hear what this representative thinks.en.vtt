00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:02.168
Well, the truth is over.

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:03.461
The fighting between Israel

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:04.671
and Hamas is back,

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.297
and so is the nightmare

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:07.757
for innocent civilians.

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:09.509
Israel says that it's using.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.094
Q R codes now

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:12.470
and interactive maps

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.055
to tell Gazans where to go.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:15.223
Remember, self-service

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.308
and electricity are sparse there.

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:19.102
National Security Council spokesperson

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.603
John Kirby was asked on Friday

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:22.230
about the number of civilians

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.148
who have already died

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.567
since bombing resumed in Gaza,

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:26.943
and he would not say

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:28.319
if the Biden administration

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.863
has seen more deliberately

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.656
targeting from Israel.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:32.490
Secretary of State

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.742
Antony Blinken had said that

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.410
he wanted to see Israeli plans

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.661
to protect civilians

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.580
before fighting resumed.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.958
This is his latest comment.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.543
I have seen that information

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.669
start to get out.

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:48.089
I saw the plans that Israel has in

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.300
a multiplicity of ways

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.634
to do everything possible

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.970
to protect civilians, including

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.471
making sure

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.264
that they have the information they need

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:57.515
and that there are ways

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.434
to accommodate them.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:00.852
And this is going to be very important

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:01.394
going forward.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:01.853
And it's something

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:02.687
we're going to be

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:08.485
looking at very closely.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:08.818
All right.

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.779
Now the US is watching,

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.781
but is there anything more

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.949
that the US could be doing?

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:17.327
One option is adding conditions

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.037
to any aid in that

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.830
the US provides to Israel.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.874
Some Democratic senators support it.

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.667
House Republicans do not.

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:27.170
Now plenty of House Democrats

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.755
oppose it, too,

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.173
including Congresswoman Debbie

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.716
Wasserman Schultz of Florida.

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.009
She is on the House

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.177
Appropriations Committee

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:35.053
and she joins me now.

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:37.222
It's been a while since we have talked,

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:38.223
so it's good to have you on

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:41.810
the show, Congresswoman.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:42.519
Thank you very.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:43.394
Much. Want to join you.

00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:43.812
Thank you.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:47.023
So let's start with why you oppose

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.525
putting some conditions

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.277
on the multi-billion dollar package

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:55.031
that Israel will most certainly get.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:55.865
Well,

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:56.699
I think it's important

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:59.285
that we understand here that we are

00:01:59.285 --> 00:01:59.953
this is

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.037
this is not a situation

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:02.413
where we don't have the ability

00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:04.582
to communicate with Israel.

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:07.544
They are a close ally among our closest.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.088
Our intelligence and military

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:11.464
leadership are sitting together

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.842
with Israel side by side every day.

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:14.634
That communication

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.177
is ongoing at the highest levels,

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:17.804
all the way up to President Biden.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.848
And we are working with them

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:20.473
to make sure,

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.349
as they are already

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.725
prioritizing, minimizing

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:24.060
civilian casualties.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.395
It's Hamas

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:28.356
that is putting civilians in harm's way,

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:29.899
embedding themselves

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.651
and their headquarters underneath

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.403
hospitals and U.N.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.445
facilities.

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:36.030
And I mean, that's

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.657
where the accountability should lie

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.576
and making sure that Israel

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.286
can bring their hostages home.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:42.912
And Hamas released them

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.039
and make sure that they can eradicate

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.582
the terrorists.

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:46.916
That is what the priority is.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.210
Conditioning aid is not something you do

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.672
in an emergency situation with an ally.

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:54.924
So you are right that the

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.926
the civilians in Gaza

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.636
would not be in this position.

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:01.514
The estimated more than 14,000

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.142
who have been killed since October 7th

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:05.268
would not be dead

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.021
if not for the October 7th attack.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.564
But if the point that you're making

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.441
is that the U.S.

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.653
has been sitting side by side with Israel

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.488
since the start of this

00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:19.908
well, since October 7th,

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:21.159
I understand that.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.785
But since the start of this,

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:25.788
there have been those 14,000 plus killed.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:26.581
There have been,

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.874
according to UNICEF,

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.543
5300 children killed.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.962
So if it did not inflow,

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:34.505
which their decision of targeting

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:35.840
before the truce.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.091
Why are you confident

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:37.634
that there will be

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:38.760
anything different now

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.471
as they move into the south.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.348
That there is real?

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:44.182
First of all, Israel

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:46.601
is held to a much, much higher standard

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.144
when when at war

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.938
than any other country on earth.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.315
And they have specifically,

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.026
nearly exclusively in a war time,

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.487
made sure to notify and communicate

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.656
in advance with civilians,

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:00.823
particularly in this

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:03.284
very urbanized environment

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.328
that they should get out of harm's way.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:07.497
Hamas, the terrorist organization

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.332
that puts them in harm's way,

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.709
prevents them from getting to safety.

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.463
And this is a very dense, urbanized area

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:18.258
in which Hamas is not actually

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.134
spent the funds that they have

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:21.886
to protect their civilians.

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:24.597
They have said publicly in interviews

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:25.974
that they spend their money

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.100
on their tunnel systems

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.726
so they can protect themselves.

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.144
So Hamas is to blame

00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:30.603
for the harm

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.771
that is coming to their civilians.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:32.522
But go where

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:35.024
when you say that the IDF is warning

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:36.609
the civilians to get out of the way.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:37.610
And I should say that

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.487
the leaflets have been dropped

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:42.615
over the cities in southern Gaza

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.492
that they are focusing on now,

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.411
but they're using QR codes.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:47.537
We have reported that

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.539
how unreliable cell phone

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.374
services, the electricity,

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.959
the Internet as well.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.044
So I don't know what a QR code does.

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:56.170
Anybody who doesn't have

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.046
cell phone service

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:58.965
and doesn't have access to the Internet.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.133
But if the IDF has

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.592
told them to move south,

00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:05.305
where are they supposed to go now?

00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:07.140
What should happen here

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.517
is that Hamas should release

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:10.643
the hostages.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.228
They should cease their attacks.

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:15.148
A cease fire that they yet again broke

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.525
just yesterday, even before

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:18.359
it was determined

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:21.237
that the truce was not going to continue.

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:22.989
This is on Hamas.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.283
That's where this conflict was started.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.285
They have killed 1400

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.536
civilians in

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.997
an unprecedented attack in Israel.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.623
It took 248

00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:33.583
women, children

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.835
and elderly people hostage,

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:36.502
most of whom

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.713
they are still holding on to.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:39.756
Where are the.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:40.048
Victor,

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.632
I wish you were asking me questions

00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:45.553
about how Hamas is being held to account.

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:46.512
That is,

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:49.015
Gaza needs to be freed from Hamas

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.516
and we already have the ability,

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.018
thanks to President Biden.

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.644
We are already communicating.

00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:56.105
We've gotten dozens and dozens,

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:56.939
actually hundreds

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:00.068
of aid trucks into Israel, into Gaza.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:01.569
And Hamas

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:02.737
skims off the top

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:03.696
to make sure that they

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:05.823
can reach, fortify,

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:06.824
be struck.

00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:08.534
Those trucks are getting in.

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.827
Those trucks are getting in

00:06:09.827 --> 00:06:11.329
after a nearly month

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:16.626
long blockade on food and fuel and water

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:17.502
and the fuel

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:18.378
obviously

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.671
challenging the desalination plant.

00:06:20.671 --> 00:06:21.964
But let me ask you about

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:23.383
you say that this is on Hamas.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.967
Yes.

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:27.261
Humanitarian aid for themselves.

00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:28.096
I understand.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.014
That. And again.

00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:31.140
But here's the question.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.350
You say this is Hamas.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.559
I understand that the

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.353
the Israeli government has said

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.814
that ending Hamas is the goal.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.649
I think most states across the world,

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.234
most countries, can understand that

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.069
after what happened on October 7th,

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.113
that is is the goal.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.615
But if the goal is to go after Hamas

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:48.825
and there are innocent

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.451
civilians between them,

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:51.994
what pressure do you think,

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:54.247
if at all, is required

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.250
or is appropriate on on Israel

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.960
to prevent the numbers

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.336
that we saw in the first

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:03.172
45 days of this war?

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.215
We are

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.134
with with Israel

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:09.011
effectively communicating that

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:11.681
it is essential that they minimize

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.015
civilian casualties,

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:14.225
the Palestinian civilians

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.518
that have been killed

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:18.146
as a result of Hamas's brutality

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:19.814
it has is devastating

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:21.524
and it shouldn't be done.

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:22.567
If they don't, then

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.026
if there's no consequence

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:24.652
and Congress

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:25.403
is not going to put

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.863
any conditions on the aid.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:27.947
And this is not advocacy,

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:28.865
I'm just saying.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:32.326
What then is the consequence for Israel?

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.078
What do you mean by if they don't?

00:07:34.078 --> 00:07:35.705
I mean, we're already in a situation

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:39.375
where worldwide, including the U.N.,

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:39.834
U.N.

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:40.793
women and others,

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:42.670
have not even condemned Hamas

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.838
for their attacks,

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.089
and they haven't condemned them

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:47.175
for the brutal sexual violence.

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:47.633
I mean,

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:49.177
Israel is under a situation

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:52.180
where it's me, too, unless you're a Jew.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.556
And the higher standard

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:56.184
that Israel is held to in wartime

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:57.643
when they have suffered

00:07:57.643 --> 00:07:59.937
a incredibly brutal attack, is

00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:01.105
why are they inappropriate

00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:02.231
in an emergency

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:05.485
And this disproportionate accountability

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.986
that is that Israel is being held

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.405
to when Hamas completely controls

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:10.990
the ability to cease

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.700
to cease the war

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.535
and releasing the hostages

00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:16.954
and ending their commitment

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:19.665
to eradicating Israel and killing Jews.

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.876
All right, Congresswoman Debbie, what.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:22.960
In their report?

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.879
Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz,

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.214
thank you so much for being with me.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.423
Good to see you again. Thanks.
