00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.234
Can you tell us

00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:03.803
the details as you understand it,

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.438
inside the Israeli government

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:08.808
of this extended truce?

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:10.643
So I think we we

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.779
we have to say the following.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.748
Before we talk about extending the deal,

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.516
we have to implement the current deal.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.818
And we're waiting for the last batch

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.421
of hostages of women and children

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.088
who are supposed

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:23.890
to be released this evening.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.159
And until they are safely on Israeli

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:27.227
soil,

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:29.295
we can say that the four day agreement

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.132
for the 50 hostages has been implemented.

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.200
Having said that,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.968
my prime minister

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.470
spoke publicly last night and he was

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.539
His remarks were reported on CNN.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.842
He said that we are open to the extension

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.612
of this humanitarian pause

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.981
and for as your reporter

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.382
said quite correctly,

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.151
for every ten hostages

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:51.718
released,

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.318
we are willing

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.754
to give an extension of another day.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.190
And if Hamas will release

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.092
Israeli hostages as agreed,

00:00:59.092 --> 00:00:59.959
we will extend.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:01.161
That's that's the bottom line.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.230
So that means if it's going

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.932
to be extended for two more days

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:06.966
and I understand

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:07.534
what you're saying

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:08.802
about what's going to happen today,

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.537
and I'll get to that in a minute.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.505
But just staying on this deal

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.941
that was just announced inside

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.543
Qatar in the White

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.078
House, is also confirming

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.412
if it is

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.448
one day, one more day of a truce

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.817
for every ten hostages, if it's two days.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.186
Presumably that means Hamas has agreed

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:29.055
to 20 additional hostages after today.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:31.825
That's correct.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.427
Once again, the parameters were set

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.262
and these were negotiated

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.730
with the help of President Biden.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.532
And we thank him for being

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:40.333
putting his effort

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.034
and his office

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.736
behind behind these arrangements.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:44.437
We wouldn't have

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.171
I don't think we would have

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.040
reached the deal without his input.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.975
And yes, it was agreed.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.376
Every extra day

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.578
we get ten hostages

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.012
and we will stand by that.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.049
Were they so far?

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.650
They have only been women and children.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.618
And that was the.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:01:59.085
And those are

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.321
the parameters of this initial deal.

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.522
What about the extension?

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.391
Will men be included there?

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.128
My understanding is that there's still

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.931
enough women and children in Gaza held

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:12.966
by Hamas

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:16.336
that can fill that for the next 20 years.

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.471
Hamas is responsible

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.173
for all the hostages.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.741
They are, unfortunately,

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:22.809
but they are the government

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:23.543
there in Gaza.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.745
They control the situation on the ground.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.381
The cessation of fighting

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.083
has given them the opportunity

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:33.386
to to get defined every last hostage.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.788
And we're expecting tonight

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.457
to see the final group

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:38.892
of women and children.

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:41.394
And hopefully in the coming days,

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:42.529
we'll see more

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:47.634
Can you just expand on what you just said

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.335
and how you started

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.336
in this interview

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.772
talking about the current situation?

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.507
What is the holdup?

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.742
You said that there is a holdup.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.277
What is the sticking point

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.646
when it comes to the group of women

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:01.047
and children expected to be

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:02.048
released today?

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.652
As you know, this is the fourth

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.287
and final

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:07.887
release

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:11.090
in the framework of the four days.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.192
But as you know,

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.560
I think it was only last night

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.395
that they actually got out on time

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:16.229
on the first day

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.931
and the second day, there were delays,

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:19.399
there were last minute crises.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.433
There were all sorts of problems.

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:21.901
And the truth is,

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:22.769
we have to remember

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.570
who we're dealing with.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.871
We're dealing with a ruthless,

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.340
fanatical terrorist organization, Hamas.

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:30.109
And it's always like pulling teeth.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.880
I mean, it's difficult It's never easy.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:35.815
And that's why I urge let's

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:37.717
wait to see what happens tonight

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.619
that we see our people,

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.521
the released hostages

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:43.623
safely on Israeli soil.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.091
I mean, last night

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.893
we had 13 Israeli

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:47.860
women and children released.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.395
The youngest was that four year old

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:52.532
American Israeli Abigail Dunn.

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.166
Right.

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.835
She was kidnaped when she was three.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.270
So you have to ask,

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.839
what sort of people kidnap 33 year olds?

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:00.106
Right.

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:01.741
And I think that tells you everything

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.943
you need to know about Hamas and explains

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:05.745
why it's so difficult.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.880
These people are ruthless.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.450
And if they think there's an advantage

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.317
in them

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.785
for for perpetuating

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:14.587
the suffering of these innocent civilians

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.256
and their families in Israel,

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:16.756
they will do

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.258
so if they think it's in their interest.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.425
Well, she was three

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.995
and her parents were also according

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:22.862
to President Biden,

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.531
murdered brutally right in front of movie

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:26.966
on October 7th.

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.702
So I completely take your point.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.271
Having said that, the

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:34.440
they are the organization

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.875
that you have to deal with

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.076
because they are the ones

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:39.379
who have these women and children.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.915
So given that reality by that unfortunate

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:44.917
reality that you are dealing with,

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:48.021
what is the status as far as you know,

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:49.289
of those

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.357
who are supposed to come out today?

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.928
So, once again, we have received

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.330
some some good signals,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.465
but until they are on Israeli soil,

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.734
it's not done

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.403
We can't celebrate.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:04.904
And it's the same for the families

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:06.372
who've been waiting for these people

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:08.641
for over 50 days now.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:09.876
And once again,

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:11.778
once they are on Israeli soil,

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:14.113
we can say it has been done.

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:14.714
But we're all

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:16.416
we've got to be cautious with Hamas.

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:17.684
You've got to be cautious.

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:18.651
You need

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.053
nerves of steel

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:20.653
when you're dealing

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.221
with these sort of people.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:22.522
Marc,

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:23.790
I want to ask about

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.024
one of the sticking points

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:27.560
over the weekend, which was that

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:31.497
there was a child released without

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.666
her mother, the Rotem family,

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:35.702
HeLa was

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:38.738
released, and her mother was not Raya.

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:41.674
What is your understanding at this point

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.876
of why that is, particularly now,

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:45.144
since you have been able

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:46.546
to officials in your government

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:47.980
have been able to speak

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.682
with the daughter

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:52.318
about the last time she saw her mother?

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.454
Can you give any more information

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.955
about that?

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:59.559
I can only say the following, Donna.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:04.197
And to release a young child

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:06.366
without a parent,

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.768
that is the most inhumane thing

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:09.902
to release a daughter

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:12.271
and for the mother to stay in captivity.

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:13.773
Once again,

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:16.609
that is a nother manifestation of what

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:17.210
we're dealing with,

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.745
that these people

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:21.714
are heartless, these people are depraved.

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:24.650
These people lack any sense

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.785
of common decency.

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:27.420
And that is our enemy.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.921
And when the fight against

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:30.890
Hamas is resumed,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.792
I want people to remember

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:36.229
that Israel is fighting a ruthless

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:38.798
and despicable terrorist organization.

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:40.800
And when we defeat them, as we will,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.202
that won't just be good for Israel.

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:46.005
Our people deserve to live in safety.

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:46.806
And in security.

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:47.974
And it's not to fear of

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:49.208
terrorists crossing the border

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:49.942
in the middle of the night

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:51.677
and butchering their children.

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:52.845
But the people of Gaza

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:54.380
also deserve better.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.716
Hamas has been ruling Gaza for six years.

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:57.450
And what have they brought?

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.851
The people of Gaza

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:01.287
just suffering and pain and poverty.

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:03.990
And everyone in this region

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.359
will be better off without Hamas

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:08.428
Just, if I may.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.463
You described the

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:15.034
the unfortunate human situation here.

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:17.737
Terrible human, barbaric human situation.

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.338
But what about the

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:22.708
why are you concerned that her mother

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:23.309
and others

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:25.611
have been separated from Hamas

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:29.015
and are now in captivity by other groups

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:31.050
inside Gaza?

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.053
Look, from Israel's perspective,

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:35.955
Hamas can't subcontract out

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.890
any responsibility.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.525
They are responsible.

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:41.027
And the reason for the pause

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:43.129
was not to give any excuses because,

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:44.397
you know, if they were

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:45.932
if Israel continued attacking,

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:46.899
they could say, well, we couldn't

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:47.767
get out of our bunker

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.035
to find the hostages.

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:51.771
They've had now four days of pause.

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:53.773
They're the guys that control the Gaza

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:54.173
Strip.

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:56.008
Unfortunately, I wish it wasn't the case.

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:57.343
It soon won't be the case.

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:58.945
But at the moment, they're in charge

00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:01.080
and they are responsible

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.715
for all the hostages.

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:04.383
Mark Regev, thank you for your time.

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:05.051
Appreciate it.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:07.920
Thanks for having me.

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:09.856
And, Wolf,

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:12.191
I want to bring you back in now.

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.826
Your reaction

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.728
knowing not only Mark Regev,

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.129
but knowing the situation

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:19.832
as well as you do to the news there.

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:20.933
I mean, I will say, obviously,

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:22.635
he confirmed this deal,

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:23.603
but at the end,

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:24.604
he talked about

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:27.340
when the military operation resumes,

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.642
not if when

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:32.812
Well, the Israeli Defense Ministry,

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:34.247
the Israeli the IDF,

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:35.581
the Israeli political leadership,

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:36.616
the war cabinet,

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:38.684
they are all basically on the same page

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.186
saying that

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.754
after they obviously

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:43.623
want to get all the Israeli hostages,

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:44.657
all the hostages

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:47.560
out of Gaza and back to Israel, that's

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:49.996
obviously a top priority,

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:51.631
if not the top priority.

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:52.899
But they're also saying that

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:54.267
even after that,

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:55.601
they're going to continue

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:57.103
their struggle against Hamas.

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.771
They don't want Hamas to be in charge

00:08:58.771 --> 00:08:59.605
of Gaza

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:00.740
because they fear that

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.375
what happened on October 7th

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.242
could happen again.

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:04.477
So they're going to continue

00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:06.812
to go after Hamas and resume

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:07.947
their military activity

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:10.116
whether air strikes or ground assault.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.118
They're making it abundantly clear

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:13.286
that is not going to stop

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:13.986
it stopping

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:16.322
as long as this temporary truce

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.658
and they call it a truce a pause.

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:20.393
They're not calling it a cease fire

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.994
as long as this is going on.

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:22.828
They're going to pause

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:24.363
in the Israeli

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:26.499
military action against Hamas.

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:29.468
But they are making it abundantly clear

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:31.337
that is not going to pause forever.

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:32.838
They're going to go after Hamas.

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:34.273
And that's going to be very significant.
