00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.042
Israel's military launched a

00:00:01.042 --> 00:00:02.335
new wave of airstrikes

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.295
on the region Thursday morning.

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:05.130
The Palestinian health

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.923
ministry says more than 1200

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:07.799
people have been killed

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:08.925
and at least 6000

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:10.927
wounded by Israeli bombardment.

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:12.178
The health ministry says

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.972
it expects hospitals to run out of fuel

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:15.849
for generators today,

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.891
leading to what it calls

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:18.935
catastrophic conditions.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.938
Joining us now is no shower, Oxfam

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:23.106
regional country

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.109
relations manager in Gaza City.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:26.609
Najla,

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.153
thank you so much for sparing this time

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:29.696
to speak to us.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:30.905
I know that yesterday

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:31.698
or certainly earlier

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.949
this week, Oxfam was

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.451
warning that what's happening in

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:35.285
Gaza would lead to

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:36.745
a humanitarian catastrophe.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:40.999
Would you say that's already begun?

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:41.624
Yes. Hi.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:43.752
Thanks for having me, first of all.

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:45.253
Yeah.

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:46.087
It's very obvious

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:49.090
that the crisis is increasing rapidly

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.385
and there is a severe,

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.720
severe impact on

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.096
on the population of Gaza.

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:57.057
The entire population of Gaza.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.768
The numbers of of displaced

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.561
people has been increasing,

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.730
reaching to around 200

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.024
plus thousand people

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:09.444
within the Gaza Strip and some are

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:12.405
are in and under U.N.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.783
administered schools

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.117
trying to take shelters there.

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:18.828
We are extremely worried

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:20.663
because of the tightening

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:21.956
of the Israeli siege.

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:23.083
We have to be aware

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.667
that the Israeli siege

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:27.128
has been there for more than 15 years.

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:29.506
And so when you ask me about electricity,

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:30.548
we never had

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:31.966
a full day of electricity

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.385
since more than 15, 16 years.

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:37.305
And now we have zero electricity before.

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:38.807
At the best times we had to wait.

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.725
And that's just an example at 8 hours.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:41.559
I mean,

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:42.519
and currently

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:43.603
we are extremely worried

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.563
about the infrastructure

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:48.775
that is responsible for delivering basic

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:51.945
services such as water.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.279
So electricity affects

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:57.117
water directly in the Gaza Strip.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.785
There is no ability to pump

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.161
water to the networks.

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:01.913
That's also in addition

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.373
to that, severe damages.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:05.959
That is not yet clear.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.419
The the extent of the extent of it,

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.422
that's apparently is going to be a very,

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:12.674
very grave.

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:15.385
And I think what is also

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:16.719
most important to know

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.305
that Gaza is already

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.975
suffering before October 2nd,

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.393
before October 7th,

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:25.478
you will have half of the population

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:26.855
under poverty.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.898
You are living in a situation

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:31.067
when there is no economic

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:33.778
viability of any activity.

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:36.614
Israel has full control about on export

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:37.657
and import.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.075
Israel conducts

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:42.036
regular attacks and that affects

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:44.956
livelihood groups within the Gaza Strip.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:45.373
Yeah.

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.082
So just

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:48.168
in terms of your immediate concerns,

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.252
obviously,

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:50.003
Secretary Blinken

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.337
is trying to organize

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.173
a humanitarian corridor

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.132
that's going to be very difficult

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:55.133
to negotiate right now,

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:56.176
isn't it, with the Israelis,

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.427
because they're talking

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.721
about a complete siege.

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.723
But what is the most important thing

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:03.099
that you need right now

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.561
just to get through the next few days?

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.646
What is really needed immediately

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:12.775
is to have a ceasefire to

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:16.070
to to allow people of Gaza to

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:19.240
to receive support and basic services, to

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:23.244
at least for the paramedics to be able to

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.914
to have have some work around it,

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:28.917
that hospitals hospitals are packed with

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.251
with injuries.

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.170
There are still injuries that

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.088
are are everywhere.

00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:37.884
There is no accessibility to

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.469
organizations on the ground

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.179
to to deliver support.

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:45.058
There's no ability for our population

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:49.979
to move and get get what we need or,

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.731
you know, get the water that we need

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:52.815
or the food that we need.

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:55.276
We need immediate,

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:58.404
immediate ceasefire so that we are able

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:03.034
also to support those who are under

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:04.327
under these very,

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:04.911
very harsh

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.746
circumstances, especially

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.249
who are taking shelter at the schools

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.542
and who are being hosted

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:13.586
in just very random places

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:14.504
and public places

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.214
around the Gaza Strip, I,

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.465
I only want everyone

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:18.007
I know

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:19.133
person really

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:20.635
is not living in their home.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.679
Everyone I know is

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.223
is moving from one place to another,

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:26.349
from a public place

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.851
to another, at home to a relative, etc..

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.728
This must it must be stopped.

00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:31.437
And I think

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:32.814
it's going to be very worrying

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:35.692
in terms of supplies, food supplies,

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:38.486
entry of medical supplies

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.531
and all of these essential items.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.449
I mean, by the hour, that is.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.661
And severe, severe suffering in addition

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.498
to the actual death in the

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:52.542
in the hospitals themselves

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.335
that are overloaded

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:56.504
with with injuries and casualties

00:04:56.504 --> 00:05:02.635
from some of the bombings just.

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.178
Please don't continue this interview.

00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:04.762
If you feel that

00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:05.305
you need to

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.807
go somewhere else for your safety.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.851
Do you do you need to leave?

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.769
It's fine.

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:13.062
No, I'm good.

00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:16.065
It's not what it's like all the time.

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:19.277
Yeah, I mean, exactly.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.153
Just this morning,

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.612
there was a massive airstrike

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:23.114
at Al-Shati camp,

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:26.159
and it's it's extremely shocking

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.993
the images.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.953
And I hope these images will make

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:32.415
will make news out at your

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:35.877
your channel, for example, where

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.462
it seems there's a huge massacre.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.756
It's a densely populated area

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.799
where just bodies are on the job.

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:43.176
And I mean,

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.260
I think the situation

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.970
is extremely critical

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.390
and negotiating safe passage.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.100
I'm not sure if this is

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.851
going to be

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.854
just to evacuate foreigners or that

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:55.480
or who

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.730
I mean,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.815
this does not really respond to what

00:05:57.815 --> 00:05:59.233
what would what people would need.

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:02.278
Of course, it's an interesting

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:02.987
you know, I just.

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.447
Wanted to offer on your back,

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:05.865
you know, you've just had that, you know,

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.658
it was also a very close explosion

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:08.618
and you just sat there

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:11.287
and carried on with the interview.

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:13.039
Whereas, you know what?

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.165
You know,

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:14.624
a lot of people

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:15.708
watching would assume

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:16.542
you would run off

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:18.795
and go to some safe space.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:19.212
But is it

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.004
because you just haven't

00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:20.797
got anywhere to go

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:23.091
and you're just so used to it?

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.175
Well, absolutely.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.468
Thank you.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.469
Thank you for raising this.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.638
I mean, in the entire Gaza Strip,

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:29.847
I mean, we don't have shelters.

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:30.556
I mean

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.683
I mean, the best circumstances

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:35.645
is that you go to I would love you know,

00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:36.729
I'm very lucky.

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.439
I have a basement

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:38.898
where that's

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:39.690
why I'm receiving

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.817
more than 12 people

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.735
in addition to my family

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:45.696
who are all now I'm hosting at my place.

00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:47.031
And so they are unable

00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:48.157
to go back to their homes

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:49.867
because they are severely damaged.

00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:54.455
And my area that was wiped and

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.290
we're managing to live together.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.625
So whenever that is

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.168
something, you know,

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:00.044
kind of close

00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:01.712
or big like this, we just,

00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:02.505
you know,

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:03.965
walk around in the corridors

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.049
and then slowly, slowly

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:06.968
go to the lower level, etc..

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.719
And we we stick around each other.

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:10.304
And that's what happened at 5 a.m.

00:07:10.304 --> 00:07:11.389
this morning, for example,

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.392
when massive airstrikes were happening in

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.310
the Gaza port

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.562
and and the west,

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:20.273
the western side of the city,

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.275
just across across the street from me,

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.527
that was the building that was

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:25.611
totally destroyed.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.863
We had to evacuate.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:30.783
We we left running basically with

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.369
in the middle of the night after 1 a.m.

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:34.537
two nights ago.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.415
And all of us, we were 20, stopped

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:40.710
at my house, 20, 20, 22 people

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:43.838
who who fled their region came to us.

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:47.049
Then we moved all of us to two different.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.136
We we split into two different places.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:50.636
I mean,

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:51.554
we're talking about the

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.514
mad situation here,

00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:57.268
a totally mad situation.

00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:57.685
And I

00:07:57.685 --> 00:07:58.394
should thank you

00:07:58.394 --> 00:08:00.396
so much for joining us this morning.

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:02.815
Obviously, your priority is to help

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:04.358
these people and these civilians.

00:08:04.358 --> 00:08:05.860
But this is obviously

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.361
this is your life as well.

00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:09.280
And we've seen that

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.365
expressed so obviously today.

00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:12.700
Best of luck with what you're doing

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.370
and thank you for making the time.

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:16.996
Thank you.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:17.914
Thank you for having me.
