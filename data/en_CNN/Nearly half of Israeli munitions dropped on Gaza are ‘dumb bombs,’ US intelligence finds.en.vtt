00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.167
President Biden's national

00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:03.003
security adviser is in Tel Aviv

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:03.570
right now

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.005
for discussions, meeting

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.606
with Israel's Prime Minister

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:07.741
Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:08.975
its defense minister as well.

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:11.044
Other members of the war cabinet.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:11.511
The White House

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.013
said a major directive for Jake

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.181
Sullivan is to pressure Israeli leaders

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.583
to be more surgical

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.718
and precise in their pursuit of Hamas

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:20.553
in order to reduce harm to civilians.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:21.454
But CNN is learning

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.089
that thousands of the air to ground

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.957
military weapons

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:24.691
used in Gaza

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.092
since the Hamas terror attack

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.694
have been unguided.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.429
CNN national security reporter

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.930
Natasha Bertrand is here

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.499
with the details.

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.167
This is illuminating reporting,

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.136
especially in the wake of President

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.371
Biden saying that Israel is engaged

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.140
in indiscriminate bombing.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.307
What more are your U.S.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.075
intelligence sources

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.810
telling you about this? Natasha?

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:45.345
Yeah, Pamela,

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.446
what we learned is that the U.S.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.281
intelligence community assesses

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:50.417
that of the roughly 29,000

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.684
air to ground munitions

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:52.786
that Israel has dropped

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.155
on Gaza over the last two plus months.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.324
About 40 to 45% of those munitions

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.359
have been unguided

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.927
and also known as dumb bombs.

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:02.162
Now, that stands in contrast,

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:04.697
of course, to precision guided munitions,

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:05.865
which are sometimes laser

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.300
guided, GPS guided,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.868
typically are more accurate

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.870
and precise than on guided munitions,

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:13.273
which experts told us really pose

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.641
an elevated risk

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.544
to civilians and can be less precise.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:18.244
And when you're talking

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.612
about such a densely

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:22.015
populated area like Gaza is,

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:23.283
you know, the difference

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:24.317
between a target

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:26.820
reaching a munition, reaching its target

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.720
within a few feet

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.555
can mean

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.190
a matter of life and death

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.459
in such a densely populated area.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.327
And so the question is now,

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.896
why is Israel using these dumb bombs?

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:39.065
And we
really don't have a great explanation

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.000
at this point.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.367
US.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.602
The US has provided

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.404
Israel with the kinds of bomb kits

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:45.572
that they can use

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.574
to transform their munitions

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:48.775
that they have in their stockpile

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.043
into smart munitions,

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:51.511
smart bombs that are,

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.712
you know,
GPS or laser

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:53.847
guided or other forms

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:56.216
of precision guided munitions.

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.952
But the Israelis are still choosing

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.420
to use in a very large

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.589
proportion of the time

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.357
these unguided munitions.

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:04.891
And that really,

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:05.792
according to the experts

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.292
that we spoke

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:07.260
to, undercuts

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.895
the repeated Israeli argument

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:10.463
that they are doing everything

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.632
that they possibly can to minimize

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:13.800
civilian casualties.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.235
Now, we did get a statement

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.669
after we published this story

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.872
from an IDF spokesperson

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:19.405
who said that

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.674
the type of munitions used in each

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:22.775
strike is determined

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.644
according to the characteristics

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:25.578
of the target.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:27.447
And they said that they do take steps

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:29.349
to mitigate the harm to civilians.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.750
But really,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.086
the the sheer scale

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.288
of the use of these dumb bombs

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:36.589
has raised a lot of questions

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.391
among experts

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.193
about why Israel is using them,

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:41.361
whether it's necessary.

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.397
And, of course, if it's true, then why

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:45.765
they're saying that

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:47.066
they're taking all of these steps to

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:49.369
to mitigate harm to civilians

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.404
when these actually can pose

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:53.139
a greater threat to them in the long run.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:53.473
Yeah.

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:54.174
And we should note, it's

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.141
not just Israeli officials

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:56.509
saying they're doing everything they can

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.610
to limit civilian

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.145
casualties, the US, too.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.213
John Kirby,

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.548
a spokesperson for the National Security

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:02.882
Council, just said Wednesday

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:03.750
that Israel is doing

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.617
everything they can

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:05.952
to reduce civilian casualties.

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:07.854
And yet this reporting is coming out

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.489
really raising a lot of questions

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:09.822
about that.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.724
Natasha Bertrand, thank you so much.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.059
In a short time ago.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.593
The White House

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.195
revealed more of what happened

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.262
during Jake Sullivan's

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:17.630
trip to Tel Aviv today.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.199
Yeah.
National Security Council official

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.832
John Kirby

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:20.433
said that Sullivan

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:21.701
talked to Israeli leaders

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.602
about transitioning

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:23.303
from, quote,

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.038
high intensity operations

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.873
to lower intensity operations.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.241
In the near future.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.442
Let's take you now to Israel

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:30.476
with CNN correspondent

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.177
Jeremy Diamond,

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.879
who's live for us in Sderot.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.681
Jeremy, what are you learning about

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:35.415
the meetings

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.650
between the national security adviser

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.585
and Israeli officials?

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:42.355
Well, these meetings

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.756
really come at a critical point

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:44.257
in Israel's

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:46.292
war effort against Hamas in Gaza.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:47.427
It comes as not only

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.295
the civilian death toll is mounting,

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:50.730
but also as growing

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.864
international

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.367
pressure is also mounting on Israel

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:55.935
and being acknowledged

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:56.970
by the United States,

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.137
including by President Biden

00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:58.805
just days ago,

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.473
talking about Israel's indiscriminate

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:01.908
bombing of Gaza.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:02.976
And so enter

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:03.509
the picture,

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:04.310
Jake Sullivan

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.878
meeting with top Israeli officials,

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.614
including the Israeli prime minister,

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:08.214
to discuss

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:10.083
not only that mounting civilian death

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:10.617
toll, the ways

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:11.317
in which

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.685
the United States wants Israel

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.787
to be more targeted in its operations,

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.022
but also beginning to think

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:16.990
about a timetable

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.458
for transitioning

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.592
the high intensity

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.194
fighting and bombing of Gaza

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:22.795
that we are seeing from Israeli forces

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:25.098
right now to a lower intensity phase.

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:26.766
That's according to John Kirby,

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.835
the National Security Council spokesman

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:29.836
There is an acknowledgment

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:30.770
from the Israelis

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.972
that that is part of the discussion here.

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.674
But for now, the Israelis seem

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:36.009
committed to maintaining

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:36.542
this current

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:38.678
tempo of the war effort for weeks

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:40.346
if not months to come.

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:41.147
You have gallons.

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.515
The defense minister,

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:42.949
we're told,

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.584
told Jake Sullivan that this war

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.719
could last more than several months.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:47.520
And the Israeli prime

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.454
minister for his part,

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.857
he said that the fighting will continue

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:52.659
until the complete destruction

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.794
of Hamas, until victory.

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:56.162
And so there is a question here about

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:57.096
whether the message

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:58.431
from American officials

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.233
is being received by the Israelis.

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:01.501
We know that another key question

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:02.568
that's being discussed

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:04.937
is also the fate of Gaza

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:06.539
after Hamas is destroyed.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.374
If indeed that goal is achieved

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:09.642
But also at the moment

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.844
right now, the fate of those hostages,

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:12.645
including at least

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.447
eight Americans who are believed

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:16.716
to be held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:18.918
John Kirby also addressed that point.

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:19.652
Moments ago

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:23.356
we're still working by the hour

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.425
to try to get a pause back in place

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.327
so that hostages can get released.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.061
I'll let the Israelis

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.063
speak to their negotiators

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:31.230
and where where they are

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.899
and what they're going to focus on.

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:34.133
I can tell you one of the things

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:35.134
Jake's doing in the region,

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:36.769
I mean, if you need proof

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.371
that we still want to see a pause,

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:39.105
just look at where

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:42.342
the national security adviser is today.

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:44.977
And we know

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:46.846
that there is an active effort by U.S.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.448
officials to try and restart

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:49.382
those negotiations

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:50.983
between Israel and Hamas.

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:52.652
Mediated by the Kothari government.

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:53.086
For now,

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:54.721
those talks have really broken down

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:55.822
since that week

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:56.622
long truce

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.524
between Israel and Hamas ended.

00:05:58.524 --> 00:05:59.592
And now there is an effort

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:00.760
by the United States

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.295
to discuss ideas with Israel,

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.830
to bring those to the Qataris,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.132
to have them bring those ideas to Hamas.

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:07.166
But for now, it appears

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:09.001
that those negotiations

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:10.236
are really going nowhere.

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:10.903
The Israeli prime

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:12.305
minister, though, after his meeting

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:13.406
with Jake Sullivan,

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:16.376
he did say that a main goal of this war

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.711
effort is to secure the

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.147
return and the release of those hostages.

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:22.882
So we will see if there's any traction

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.550
after Jake Sullivan's visit

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.518
to the region.

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:26.519
Yeah, definitely

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.187
a thread to keep an eye on there.

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:29.522
Jeremy Diamond, thank you so much.
