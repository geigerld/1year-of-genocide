00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.267
Israel ramping up

00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:03.069
its bombardment of Gaza

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.138
and tonight acknowledging

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:06.673
it was behind a deadly blast

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:07.841
outside the al-Shifa

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.609
hospital in Gaza City.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:10.310
Now, we want to warn you,

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.745
the images we're going to show you,

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:12.645
they are graphic

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:13.546
as they've been coming in,

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.981
according to multiple videos

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.150
that CNN has Geolocated.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.452
We you can see through here.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.253
Bloodied bodies

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:21.654
just strewn across the ground

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:22.856
near an ambulance.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.391
A spokesman for the Hamas

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.159
run health ministry claims

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.594
authorities had organized

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.662
a medical convoy from the hospital

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.231
to the Rafah crossing.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.432
That spokesperson says

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:33.666
that the ambulances

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.167
as the

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.235
when the ambulances

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.804
started to move south, they were hit.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.106
And a director of the hospital

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.207
tells Al Jazeera

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.942
this medical teams

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.045
and paramedics lost their lives.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:45.912
Regrettably,

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:48.915
some of the wounded lost their lives.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.316
Tonight, the International Committee

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.551
of the Red Cross confirms

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.753
it was aware of a convoy

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:55.155
that would be carrying patients

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:57.090
from northern Gaza to the south.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.592
But according to the Israeli military,

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:00.960
it struck an ambulance

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.563
that was being used by Hamas.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.231
Here's the quote from the IDF.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.033
An IDF aircraft struck

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:07.667
an ambulance

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:08.535
that was identified

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.203
by forces as being used

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:10.804
by a Hamas

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:11.838
terrorist cell

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.139
in close proximity

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.874
to their position in the battle zone.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.976
A number of Hamas terrorist operatives

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.479
were killed in the strike.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:20.246
However, it

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.181
also appears

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.017
civilians were also killed and injured.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.252
And that is why today, Secretary of State

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.954
Tony Blinken on his third

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:28.755
trip to Israel

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:29.856
since the October 7th

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:30.390
Hamas terror

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.792
attack, pressed Israel's leaders

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:33.493
to do more

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.161
to protect civilians in Gaza

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.330
and allow more humanitarian aid

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.300
to enter the 25 mile long strip.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.701
That public request

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.535
was rebuffed

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:43.503
by Israel's Prime

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.138
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:46.506
saying Israel objects

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.208
to any temporary cease fire

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:54.047
unless Hamas frees all 241 hostages.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.316
So that means more strikes in Gaza.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:56.883
And tonight,

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.318
we have another dispatch

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:00.687
from an aid worker, Mahmoud Shalaby.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:02.055
He's been sending updates

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.656
to OUTFRONT from northern Gaza.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.526
The focus on the Israeli

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:09.062
offensive tonight, Shalaby describes

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.163
what he witnessed

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:13.700
after a blast near his home.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.835
Many fathers

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:16.936
carrying their daughters

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.371
and their children

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.473
and crying like babies.

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.710
And I saw one child. One child

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:26.179
who's who's about 12 years old,

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.849
who was saying, I did nothing.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:30.884
I did nothing.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.486
Civilians saying the very same thing

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:34.921
on both sides

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:37.390
of the Israel-Hamas war now.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.558
Jeremy Diamond is OUTFRONT

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:40.560
live along the Israel-Gaza border for us.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.595
Melissa Bell is in Cairo, Egypt.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:43.596
I want to start with Jeremy.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:43.897
Jeremy,

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:46.232
what more are you hearing about this

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:46.866
strike on the

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:47.800
in an ambulance

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.704
on an ambulance in Gaza City?

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:52.572
Well, first of all,

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:52.772
I mean,

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:53.239
you saw

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.440
those images, scenes

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.075
of absolute devastation

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:57.210
outside al-Shifa

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.412
hospital where this convoy of ambulances

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:01.381
was apparently heading south.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.149
Palestinian health authorities

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.717
say that this convoy of ambulances

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:05.485
was carrying

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:06.686
wounded individuals

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.588
who were heading to the Rafah crossing

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:09.289
with Egypt

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.191
in order to get those wounded

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.525
individuals evacuated.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:13.259
As we have seen

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.260
over the last several days,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.895
some wounded have been allowed

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:17.130
to leave into Egypt.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.031
But Israel paints

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.200
a very different picture here Kate.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.467
They say that

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:22.769
these ambulances

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.171
were being used by Hamas operatives

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.806
and that it targeted those ambulances

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:28.074
for that reason,

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:29.275
saying that it killed

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:32.011
several Hamas militants in this strike.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.513
Israel also points out

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:34.113
that it believes

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.882
that Hamas has used ambulances

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.083
in the past to transport

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.251
not only Hamas militants,

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:40.620
but also some of its weaponry.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.621
CNN cannot, of course,

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:42.822
independently verify

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:43.890
those claims in Israel

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.158
so far has not provided

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.426
any evidence for that.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.327
But what we do know,

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.896
Kate, is the toll of casualties

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.297
here, according to the Hamas

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.132
run Palestinian Ministry of Health.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:55.201
15 people were killed in this strike,

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:57.570
50 others were wounded.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.639
The Palestinian Ministry of Health, again

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.640
says that injured people

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.009
were being carried in these ambulances.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.645
It also says that it requested

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.046
the International Red Cross

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.615
to accompany the convoy.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:09.749
The Red Cross confirming

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:10.917
that it received that request,

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.885
but says that it did not take part

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.220
in this convoy.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.721
Nonetheless,

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.122
this is raising more questions

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.224
about Israel's tactics in this war.

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:19.158
Following the strikes

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:19.993
earlier this week

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:21.461
in the densely populated

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.229
Jabaliya refugee camp.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.264
Meanwhile, Kate, Hamas

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.999
is continuing to target Israeli

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.066
towns and cities

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:27.767
targeting

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.770
population centers, civilians, targets

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.071
in Israel.

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:33.406
Earlier today, Kate,

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:34.974
our team was very close

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:36.242
to one of those strikes.

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:38.745
A rocket came in about 100 meters away

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:40.446
from where a number of journalists,

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:41.814
including my team,

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.584
was positioned in their roads.

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.886
And I want to show you this video shot

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:48.121
by my photojournalist, Mathias.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.223
Some you can hear the power of that

00:04:50.223 --> 00:05:03.670
rocket coming in. Listen.

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:06.539
And Kate, following that strike,

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.341
we were actually able to see the crater

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:09.842
where that rocket made impact

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:11.077
and damage several vehicles

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:12.211
that actually landed.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:12.478
At least

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:13.613
one of those two rockets

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:15.048
landed in the courtyard

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:16.516
of a kindergarten.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:17.383
There were no children,

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:18.551
of course, there at the time.

00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:20.687
School is has been closed

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:22.789
since theroad for the time being.

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.023
But obviously, as you

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.258
know, Kate, the Iron Dome missile

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.193
defense system takes out the overwhelming

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:28.628
majority of these rockets,

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:30.697
but it does not take them all out.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:32.699
Kate. Jeremy, thank you so much.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.500
Jeremy Diamond in Israel for us.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.234
OUTFRONT with me

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:36.302
now, Lieutenant Colonel

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.603
Jonathan Conricus.

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:38.805
He's the International spokesman

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:40.473
for the IDF.

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:42.008
Thank you so much for coming on.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.276
What more can you tell us

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:45.445
about the strikes on the ambulance?

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:49.148
Why did you strike so near a hospital?

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:49.549
Hi.

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.484
Thank you for having me.

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:52.952
There's fighting ongoing.

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:54.620
We are at war against Hamas

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.522
in northern Gaza and all over Gaza.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:57.657
But the focusing

00:05:57.657 --> 00:05:59.525
on the northern Gaza Strip.

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.661
Our forces saw terrorists

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:03.262
using ambulances

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:05.865
as a vehicle to move around.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:08.568
They perceived a threat and accordingly,

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:10.336
we struck that ambulance.

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:12.505
I must say that this is not the first

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:14.107
and not the hundredth time

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:15.541
that Hamas operatives,

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.043
including senior leaders,

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.678
make use illegal use

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:20.646
of ambulances on the battlefield.

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.281
They use them as their taxis

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:23.583
in order to get from one place

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.451
to another, specifically seniors.

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:27.153
And it is not the first time

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.721
they did it in 2014.

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:30.156
They are doing it again.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:32.759
And we are well within our legal rights

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.394
according to the laws of armed conflict.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.428
Once they use it

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:38.898
and we perceive it as a threat to attack,

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:40.833
who in that strike?

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:41.701
Who can you.

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:42.635
Who was taken out?

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:45.238
I mean, were they high level

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.706
operatives within Hamas?

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:47.039
Do you have

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.708
the names of who was taken out

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:51.310
or who was being targeted?

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.279
No, this wasn't a targeted

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.147
killing of someone.

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:55.415
This was during combat.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.315
Our troops saw

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.651
that they were using the ambulance

00:06:58.651 --> 00:06:59.852
and trying to

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:02.455
either escape or attack using that.

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:04.223
And that is why they were struck.

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:05.691
Hopefully, we'll be able to provide

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.393
intelligence and more footage

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:09.028
and information about it.

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:11.497
But we have other information

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:11.998
which were

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:12.799
also able to show

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:15.802
and have shared with CNN and others

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:19.272
of how ambulances have been seen.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.007
And we have caught it on camera.

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:22.809
Ambulances have been seen in

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.745
Hamas locations, Hamas camps

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:26.412
where they are

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:28.047
next to the locations

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:29.582
of their headquarters.

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:30.616
And they are used

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.485
not to transport wounded,

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.420
but in order to get senior

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.688
and other commanders

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:37.089
from one place to another

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.459
without the risk of being followed

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.060
or attacked by the IDF.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.595
The numbers from the Hamas

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:44.797
run Ministry of Health coming out

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:45.998
are 15 killed,

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.501
and I think it was 50 wounded.

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.435
There's no distinction

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:50.236
in those numbers

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:53.639
of who was civilian and who was,

00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:56.075
you know, connected with Hamas.

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:58.611
Do you know a combatant or a terrorist?

00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:01.180
Yes. It's okay to say those words.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.416
Do you know?

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:04.650
I know I see a lot of

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.452
pictures of young men.

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:07.487
I do not see weapons.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.722
Maybe there were conveniently

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:12.925
hidden before TV crews came there to

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.627
for this whole orchestrated event.

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:16.028
But the bottom line,

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:17.430
we know that there were Hamas

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.631
operatives there.

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:20.233
I don't have the finite number,

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.535
but I am certain that there were Hamas

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:23.469
activist terrorists

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:25.404
there who were trying to use an ambulance

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:27.607
in order to facilitate their movement

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:29.709
while fighting was ongoing.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.211
Colonel, today earlier today,

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:34.313
I spoke with an American politician

00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:37.116
who supports Israel and supports Israel's

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:38.618
right to defend itself.

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:39.118
He's also on

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:40.353
the Armed Services Committee,

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:43.489
and he says that the bombing of innocent

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:45.258
civilians needs to stop

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:46.792
and the way he said it is today.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:47.927
And here's what he said to me.

00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:48.461
He said,

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:49.495
I don't think if you're

00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:51.497
using hundreds of civilians

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:53.399
as a human shield,

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.467
meaning Hamas,

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:57.036
and you have one terrorist,

00:08:57.036 --> 00:09:00.606
that that justifies a bombing,

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:01.574
why not go about

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:05.244
this in a more surgical way?

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.313
Yeah, I don't think that that is ever,

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:10.149
ever the case. One for one.

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:13.719
That doesn't seem logical for me at all.

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:15.254
And that doesn't at all

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.390
compute with the calculations

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.525
that I am aware of that the IDF does.

00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:21.827
It would have to be Yassin

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:24.630
while and Mohammed together

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.197
to warrant

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:27.633
that kind of collateral damage.

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:28.968
That is not the case.

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:30.002
The sad reality

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:31.704
is that we have asked civilians

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:33.439
to evacuate, including in the pictures

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:34.440
that you're showing

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.209
from different areas in Gaza.

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:38.678
We have asked them to evacuate

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:40.212
because we know that Hamas

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:41.314
is trying to use them

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:42.381
as their human shields.

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:44.050
We know that it will be dangerous.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.051
And we have told them

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:47.753
this isn't a safe place to be. Go south.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.055
Those that have stayed

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:51.691
have done it at their own agency,

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:52.858
which is regrettable.

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:54.460
I'm sure that some have been forced

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.896
to stay by Hamas, which is appalling,

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:58.130
and a war crime

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.900
preventing civilians to flee to safety

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.235
by Hamas is an active war crime,

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:04.670
which they should be criticized

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.205
and called out for doing.

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:07.073
And I don't think

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.274
that the focus should be on

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.342
what Israel is doing

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:10.643
in order to defend ourselves.

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:10.676
And please let me say that this started
