00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.735
We welcome the release.

00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:03.770
We share in the relief

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.071
that their families,

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.474
friends and loved ones are feeli

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.175
But there are still ten

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.143
additional Americans

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.312
who remain unaccounted for

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.880
in this conflict.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.681
We know that

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.016
some of them are being held

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.217
hostage by Hamas,

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.852
along with an estimated 200

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.487
other hostages

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.455
held in Gaza.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.292
They include men, women,

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.862
young boys, young girls,

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.463
elderly people

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:33.333
from many nations.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.135
Every single one of them

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.770
should be released

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:38.471
since the early,

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.340
early start of this crisis.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.441
The president has made clear

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.010
that he will do everything possi

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.613
to secure the release of every h

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:47.614
During my own recent travel

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:48.548
to the region,

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:49.816
I emphasized the urgency

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:50.984
and importance of this

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:52.986
to the United States

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:54.054
and pressed our partners

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.722
to do everything they can

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.390
to help us secure the release.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:00:59.492
Since that time, we

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:00.093
continue to work

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.761
relentlessly with partners

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.329
to do just that.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.297
I can't speak publicly

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:06.232
about the details of these effor

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.368
and I know you understand that.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.237
But the urgent work to free

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.605
every single American, to free

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.974
all other hostages continues,

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:15.708
as does our work

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.877
to secure the safe passage out o

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.046
for the Americans who are trappe

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.781
In this particular instance,

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.850
I want to thank the government o

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.986
for their very important assista

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:28.721
When I was in Israel last week,

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.290
I met with the families of U.S.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.959
citizens that Hamas has taken ho

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:33.660
President Biden,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.527
too, had the opportunity

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.697
to hear directly from the famili

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:38.698
Its impossible

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:40.800
to adequately put into words the

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:42.435
their feeling

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:43.636
of not knowing

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:44.737
the fate of their loved ones,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.941
wearing relentlessly

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.008
about them

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.776
for their safety,

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.911
for their security, for their we

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.147
No family anywhere

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.650
should have to experience this t

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.319
What I share with the families,

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.553
as the president did as well,

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:01.154
is that

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.355
the entire United States

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:04.424
government will work every minut

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:07.494
of every day to secure their rel

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:10.497
to bring their loved ones home.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:11.998
They have my solemn pledge

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.566
those who continue to have loved

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.401
held hostage by Hamas

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.470
that will continue to do that.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.538
Working.

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:21.007
As though these family members

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.108
were our own.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.910
With that and having a few quest

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.744
Mr. Secretary.

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:27.313
So thanks for coming down, Mr.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.616
Smith. Mr. Secretary,

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:30.583
I'm just.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:31.351
You said you wouldn't

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.453
talk about specific details,

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:33.987
but I'm wondering,

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.588
you did thank the government of 

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.557
and I'm wondering, since you wer

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.593
and they

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:41.361
have an

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.063
office, they host the Hamas offi

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.232
If you could elaborate a little 

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.700
on what their role was

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.502
and if you continue to think tha

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.137
that channel

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:54.073
there, them having an office the

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:55.575
is worthwhile.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.277
And then secondly,

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.279
a lot has been made by you,

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.146
by the president,

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:02.215
by other officials about

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:06.386
how it is important for Israel o

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.655
if and when it begins a ground i

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.758
into Gaza for it

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:13.626
to respect the

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.395
rules of war internationally.

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.598
And I'm curious if you think tha

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:19.532
even before

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.968
that ground incursion has starte

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:24.771
if Israel is respecting those

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.006
rules and laws.

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:27.674
Thank you.

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.442
Matt, thanks for the questions.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:31.811
You'll understand that

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:33.213
because this is an ongoing effor

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.815
an ongoing effort to get

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.585
Americans who are hostage in thi

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.353
in Gaza

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:41.521
out to secure their release,

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:42.689
to get them back with their fami

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.525
I really can't go into any detai

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.661
what we're doing, how we're doin

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:49.362
And all

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:50.563
I can say with regard to Qatar

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.732
is in this instance,

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.934
we very much appreciate their as

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.736
Beyond that, I really can't

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.537
I really can't say

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:58.471
because, again,

00:03:58.471 --> 00:03:59.639
we want to focus on making sure

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.740
that we're getting those

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.010
who remain hostage back home

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.944
and with their loved ones.

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.946
That's the single most important

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.783
with regard to

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:12.719
how Israel is conducting its ope

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:13.653
I think you've heard the preside

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.221
speak to this very clearly.

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:15.688
You've heard me

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.790
speak to this very clearly.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.060
We've said

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.262
we believe strongly

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.930
that Israel has not only the rig

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.764
but the obligation

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:27.800
to defend itself against what it

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.969
it's very hard to put in the wor

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.072
the nature, the barbarity of the

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:35.408
And they really do have the obli

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:36.342
to defend themselves

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:36.743
against it,

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:37.543
to do whatever

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:38.578
they can to try to make sure

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:39.746
that this doesn't happen again.

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:42.015
But we've been very clear as wel

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.683
that the way Israel does this ma

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:45.184
And in particular,

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:45.885
it's important

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.287
that operations be conducted

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.388
in accordance

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:50.390
with international law, humanita

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:53.293
the law of war as applicable,

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.395
and that everything be done

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:58.398
to minimize the loss of civilian

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.801
And we continue to focus on that

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:04.003
just as we're also focusing

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:04.804
on getting assistance

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:08.041
into people in Gaza who who need

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:10.310
There will be

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.511
plenty of time to make assessmen

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:12.712
about how

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:14.414
these operations were conducted.

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:15.515
But I can just say for

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:16.816
the part of the United States

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.318
that this continues to be

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.519
important to us.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.154
And again, it's what

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.356
distinguishes us, distinguishes 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.359
from terrorist groups like Hamas

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.795
which not only have

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:30.630
absolutely no concern for

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.798
for innocent human life.

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:33.466
They intentionally use

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.002
innocent human lives to hide beh

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.838
to use as quite literally

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.142
as human shields, knowing that c

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.578
invariably are going to suffer i

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.447
in conflict.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.249
Thank you, Secretary.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.885
Just following up on that, a Ham

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.020
has issued a statement

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.255
through Abu Zubaydah.

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.091
And I know with the huge caveat

00:05:58.091 --> 00:05:59.392
that it's a terror group

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:01.728
and one is not attach

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:03.062
credibility to that.

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:04.564
But they have said

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.567
that all the hostages, the civil

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:07.900
hostage,

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:11.337
which include the Americans,

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:12.038
could be released,

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:12.605
that this could be

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:14.640
the start of something bigger

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.442
if there are no airstrikes.

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:18.778
Would this be a moment where

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:21.814
if it's under Israel's

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.549
discretion, obviously

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:25.785
it would be wise to pause,

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:26.853
to give it more time

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:28.921
to see if this is a moment

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:31.124
since the ground invasion is not

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:33.226
Should even the airstrikes be st

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.428
To see if you could get more peo

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:37.130
And it was notable,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.798
without going into details

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:39.999
that in the president's statemen

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.900
he said

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:43.770
he expressed his thanks to Israe

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:45.538
to Qatar, rather,

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:47.940
in partnership with Israel.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.577
A notable connection there.

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:52.478
The obvious inference

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:53.746
is that they were working

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.381
together on this.

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:57.884
Does this give you hope that

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.319
despite everything that's happen

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.254
that there could still be

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.122
a broader relationship

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:05.892
and avoid a wider war?

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:08.261
Thanks, Andrea.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.696
So two things there.

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:11.531
First,

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.666
it's very simple.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:15.968
Hostages should be released imme

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:17.503
and unconditionally.

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:19.405
That's been our position from da

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:20.973
It remains our position.

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:22.975
And to your point,

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:26.145
I would not take anything

00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:28.514
that Hamas says at face value.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.819
I'm not sure anyone in this room

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.987
would take at face value or repo

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:37.924
something that ISIS had said.

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:40.993
Same applies to to Hamas.

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:42.695
Our position is clear.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.664
Every hostage needs to be releas

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:45.932
and needs to be released.

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:46.632
Now,

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:52.638
there is no doubt

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.475
from my own my own travels in th

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:59.745
that one of the important things

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.481
throughout this

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.916
this very difficult period

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.284
and since the attack,

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:07.453
the unconscionable attack by Ham

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:09.822
is

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:10.957
to continue

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:11.557
to find ways

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:14.293
for countries to cooperate, coor

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.363
when it's in their interests to 

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.765
And we'll continue to look to th

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:22.201
Any cooperation that that we can

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:25.004
that facilitates the release of 

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:27.273
any cooperation that we can elic

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:28.541
That secures the provision

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.142
of humanitarian assistance

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:32.612
to the men, women and children i

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.747
who would so desperately need it

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.050
We work on that every day.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.019
And I think

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:40.586
we can say that

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:41.921
we've seen some of that cooperat

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:42.688
The broader question,

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.490
though, I think, is

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:45.358
usually important,

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:48.327
because what's abundantly clear 

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:52.331
the vast majority of countries,

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:55.368
the vast majority of people

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.703
want the same thing

00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:58.638
They want a region

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.439
where countries are working toge

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:02.441
where relations are normalized,

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:04.610
where there's greater integratio

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.345
where people are

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.113
working together,

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:07.914
studying together,

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:10.683
traveling, doing business.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:11.584
Overwhelming

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:13.119
majority of people want that.

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:15.588
And we want to see as well

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:16.956
the rights and aspirations

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:17.924
of the Palestinian people

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:20.459
fulfilled in the context of that

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:21.327
of region.

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:23.462
And that's one vision.

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:25.131
And it remains very much

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.867
alive in every conversation. Tha

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:30.202
The alternative is equally clear

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:31.103
and it's very stark.

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:32.972
It's Hamas.

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.173
It's Hezbollah.

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:35.441
It's Iran.

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:37.543
It's destruction.

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:38.611
It's death.

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:41.113
It's terrorism. It's darkness.

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:43.449
So the more we are able to make 

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:47.153
that first vision

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:49.255
the more I'm convinced that

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.790
that's the vision that everyone

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.925
or virtually everyone will subsc

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:55.595
So even as we are

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:57.263
working through this challenge,

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:58.531
this crisis, it's important

00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.632
to keep that vision alive,

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:01.801
because it's important that peop

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:03.869
that there is an alternative

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:05.838
and that everything that they ho

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:07.573
and that they aspire to

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:09.475
is going to be best addressed

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:11.510
through what I've just described

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.712
that first vision.

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:14.213
We'll continue to do that.

00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:15.615
Jennifer, Mr.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:16.349
Secretary,

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:16.983
what can you tell us

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:17.817
about the condition

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:18.784
of these two Americans

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:19.752
who have been released?

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:21.454
What is their their health statu

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.355
And do you have any details

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:23.556
on the condition of the American

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:24.924
who are being held hostage

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:26.926
Have you seen any proof of life 

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:28.327
And then on the Rafah crossing,

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:29.362
what is the holdup

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:30.963
in operationalizing this deal?

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:32.698
And will we see it open this wee

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:34.500
I can't speak

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.802
to the condition of the two host

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.371
who were just released.

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:40.840
First, out of respect for their 

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.240
Second,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.942
because we haven't had a chance 

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:44.677
Maybe it's happening as we speak

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:46.612
To get our own team in there to

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:47.880
to see them, to

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.149
to evaluate them and most import

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.885
to reunite them with their loved

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:54.253
So I'm sure that will

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:55.688
that that'll come out in the

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:57.390
in the hours, certainly days ahe

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.424
But I don't have anything for yo

00:10:58.424 --> 00:10:59.325
on that now,

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.594
nor do I have anything for you o

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:05.431
the status of or condition of Am

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:08.467
who continue to be held by by Ha

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:11.337
with regard to the to the Rafah 

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.039
As you know, when

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.473
some of us were traveling togeth

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:15.808
in the region over the past week

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.412
getting assistance moving

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:21.881
was among my top priorities.

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:23.082
And we worked very hard

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:25.618
with the government of Israel,

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:28.187
the government of Egypt to do ju

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:31.223
And we secured an understanding 

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:33.559
we would develop a plan

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:35.294
to move assistance.

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:37.596
That understanding was cemented

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:38.431
by President Biden

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:39.799
when he was in Israel

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:41.767
and also speaking to President

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:43.369
el-Sisi of Egypt.

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.871
In the time since we've been wor

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.640
relentlessly with Ambassador Dav

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.941
Satterfield on the ground,

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:50.342
working with the United Nations,

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:51.844
with Egypt, with Israel

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.979
to put that into motion.

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:55.748
And my expectation

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:57.149
is that you'll see that moving s
