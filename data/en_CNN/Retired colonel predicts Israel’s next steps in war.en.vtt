00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
Joining me now is CNN military analyst colonel&nbsp;
Cedric Leighton. Colonel, thank you for your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.080
time this morning. First off, I want to get your&nbsp;
reaction to secretary of state Antony blinken in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.280
ramallah. He with was just there meeting with&nbsp;
Mahmoud abbas, the Palestinian authorities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.640
president. What does that tell you, especially&nbsp;
that he is engaging once again in shuttle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.680
diplomacy. Weighs at the summit Saturday meeting&nbsp;
with the foreign ministers of Egypt and Qatar and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.800
Jordan. What do you make of of this?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, good morning, Amara. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.080
I think what secretary blinken is doing&nbsp;
is trying to shore up support among the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.720
Palestinian authority as well as the Arab&nbsp;
nations for a two-state solution. He would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.720
like the Palestinian authority also to take over&nbsp;
the administration of gaza once Israel achieves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.400
its goals of destroying hamas. Whether or not&nbsp;
Israel can achieve the goals is, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.548
another matter. I think the goal of&nbsp;
the secretary of state is very much

00:00:54.548 --> 00:00:54.560
[6:10:46 AM]

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.960
secretary of state is very much to get&nbsp;
the Palestinian authority represented by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.060
Mahmoud abbas in on his side and make that&nbsp;
work for him from a political standpoint.&nbsp;

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.640
&gt;&gt; What are your thoughts on this four-hour window&nbsp;
for this safe corridor? That window is about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.160
close at 2:00 P.M. Local time. It's a little after&nbsp;
1:00 there. And Elia brought up these issues. How&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.320
do you get the messages to the civilians dealing&nbsp;
with power outages and internet outages in gaza,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.360
and let's say they do get the message.&nbsp;
Of course, resources is a huge problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.960
right, because no fuel, as we heard from the U.S.&nbsp;
Special envoy, David Satterfield, no new fuel has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:49.400
gone into gaza since the war began. How helpful do&nbsp;
you think this safe corridor that idf is opening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.680
will be for the civilians to move south?
&gt;&gt; I think it's too short a time period.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.880
[6:11:47 AM]

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.640
period. Four hours is not enough time to get&nbsp;
people out, especially those that have special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.600
needs or are in, you know, in a place where&nbsp;
they can't really get transportation. So far,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.160
to my knowledge at least, we have not seen&nbsp;
a stream of refugees on foot marching down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.920
you know, the highway there. So Elliot is right.&nbsp;
If you don't have any internet connectivity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.920
if you don't have power, there is a risk that you&nbsp;
might not get that message. The Israelis have in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.400
the past distributed flyers. They air dropped&nbsp;
flyers into the Palestinian areas to get them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.200
that kind of a message. Whether or not they&nbsp;
did that in this case, I'm not sure. But they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.480
are definitely -- the Israelis are definitely&nbsp;
trying several ways to get the message to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.720
Thoblem that they have is it's not coordinated&nbsp;
with other aspects of their military operation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.880
or doesn't seem to be, at least.
&gt;&gt; You know, there is a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.908
aid still at the border that needs to get in.

00:02:56.908 --> 00:02:56.920
[6:12:47 AM]

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.560
needs to get in. Of course, we are still&nbsp;
talking about hostages that the U.S. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.880
Israel are quite involved in trying to get&nbsp;
released. But there is also what seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.640
be a public split that's forming between the&nbsp;
U.S. And Israel. That how you see it? Because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.400
you have Netanyahu who is saying there will&nbsp;
not be any kind of ceasefire or a pause until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.520
all hostages are released. But then you also&nbsp;
have the secretary of state blinken publicly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:34.280
stating there needs to be a humanitarian pause.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the secretary of state is trying to very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.280
much bridge the gap between the dezur for&nbsp;
a complete ceasefire and Israel's public&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.760
stance at least on the issue of either a&nbsp;
ceasefire or humanitarian pause. In fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.800
they are doing some humanitarian pauses&nbsp;
like the one that's in existence right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.665
but the fact of the matter is that Israel has&nbsp;
its war aims and it believes it can't be seen to

00:03:59.665 --> 00:03:59.677
[6:13:49 AM]

00:03:59.677 --> 00:04:03.960
it believes it can't be seen to be deviating from&nbsp;
them, and they think this kind of a humanitarian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.280
pause may be a slight deviation or a large&nbsp;
deviation in their minds, perhaps R from their war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.760
aims. So the secretary has a bit of a problem here&nbsp;
in the effort to kind of bridge that that gap.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.880
It's a difficult needle to thread in this case.
&gt;&gt; What is your sense of what is happening on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.000
the ground? Last we heard Friday is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.080
Israel encircled gaza city. What happens next?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm not sure that the encirclement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:41.720
has been completed but may have been by this time.&nbsp;
You know, the encirclement is designed to besiege&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.000
or starve out the hamas fighters. When they do&nbsp;
that and we see the map of gaza right there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.440
gaza city in particular, that's in the center of&nbsp;
the gaza strip. And the idea there is not only to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.748
encircle that area, but also to make it possible&nbsp;
for Israeli ground forces to enter a certain

00:04:59.748 --> 00:04:59.760
[6:14:52 AM]

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.480
ground forces to enter a certain zone within&nbsp;
that city and then be able to go in and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.600
in essence, clear that zone. That's going&nbsp;
to be difficult for the Israelis to do. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.280
think that might be the next step,&nbsp;
but they have to watch the tunnels,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.040
they are going to have to make sure that they&nbsp;
don't get ambushed and, you know, also watch for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.540
improvised explosive devices. So those are the&nbsp;
kinds of challenges that they have right now.&nbsp;

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of risks&nbsp;
going in there on the ground.
