00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.583
We have breaking

00:00:00.583 --> 00:00:02.085
news tonight out of the Middle East

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:03.169
where Israeli officials

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.504
are vowing to respond

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:05.839
after a deadly strike

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.971
in the Golan Heights.

00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:15.181
When when

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.642
they responded saying at least 11

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:18.476
people were killed,

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:19.728
including children

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.563
when rockets fired from Lebanon

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:23.148
hit a football field.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.733
We spoke with former Israeli Prime

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.359
minister Naftali Bennett last hour.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.402
He said both Hezbollah

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:28.486
and Lebanon

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.156
have effectively declared war on Israel

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:35.410
and Israel must now respond accordingly.

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:36.578
The state of Lebanon

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:40.457
essentially shot a rocket made in Iran.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.043
We know the name of the guy who shot it.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:46.379
His name is Ali Mahmoud Yesha.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.339
These rockets were made in Iran.

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.594
Iranian rockets, 50 kilograms of warhead.

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:56.181
And it's time that we hit back.

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:58.600
Jeremy Diamond is on the ground for us

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.018
where this strike hit.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.562
Jeremy, we see it behind you there.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:06.566
What are you hearing about all of this?

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:07.150
You know,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.069
Jessica, we arrived on the scene

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.945
and the mood is very, very heavy here.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:12.155
The Israeli military now

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.324
says that 12 people were killed

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.241
and these are all

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.659
children and young adults

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.079
between the ages of ten and 20.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.581
Several dozen more were injured,

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:22.207
some of them

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:24.042
in very serious condition

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.044
at local hospitals.

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:28.963
But this is the deadliest incident

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:31.966
since October 7th on civilians

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:34.427
since the beginning of this conflict,

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.221
according to the Israeli military.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.223
And there are now very real concerns

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:39.849
that this could trigger

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.519
a broader escalation in this conflict.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:43.645
But before we get to that,

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:45.522
I do want to bring in Timor here,

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.817
who actually lives right across

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.527
from this soccer field

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:52.987
where this strike actually happened.

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:53.530
Timor.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.323
You were nearby.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:55.657
You.

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:57.158
You heard the sirens

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:59.661
and you actually saw this rocket

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:01.871
hit right here? Yeah, I did.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.581
I live about 50 meters across

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:05.083
from the playground on the first floor,

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:05.917
so I have a direct

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.128
view of what happened here.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.587
I was just sitting on my desk.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:12.215
I got my notification

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.259
and like, 2 seconds later, maybe less.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.218
I heard the sirens.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.720
I just rushed to the window.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.806
Not even 45 seconds.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:20.598
I opened the window.

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:21.808
I was just looking straight.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.309
I saw it hit.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.227
I thought I saw the kids

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:26.062
panicking, running around.

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:29.315
And that happened around 6:18 p.m.,

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.608
something like that.

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:32.485
And I just ran straight here.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.779
I got here, like, 10 minutes later.

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.489
And that's when I arrived to the scene.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.658
And I had, like, a clear

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:39.742
vision of the impact

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:40.785
and of the crater zone.

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:42.829
So that's what I saw.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.039
And so you heard the warning

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.832
sirens telling you

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.000
that rockets were coming in.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.835
But but it was just seconds.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:49.836
No, there's not enough time.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:50.420
That's impossible.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.546
If someone tells you otherwise

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.131
that it's impossible, even.

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.592
Possible to get to. What, 4 to 5 seconds?

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:56.718
What can you do in 45 seconds?

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.344
You can do nothing.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:02:59.846
It's like you said,

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.557
if I'm saying 5 seconds, maybe I'm just.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:03.224
It's too long.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:05.476
I think it's 4 seconds, maybe less.

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:06.895
Like the sirens were still going on.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.021
That's when we heard.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:08.771
I heard them back then.

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:09.856
I saw it

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:10.940
and I saw the kids

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.649
like you know, you're

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.735
talking about kids and children also.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.111
They have a reaction time.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:15.862
They're panicking.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.322
They're going to stress

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.865
they need much more time than that.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.200
Even if you have 5 seconds

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.700
and you're

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.452
completely aware of the situation,

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.453
you wouldn't have enough time

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:24.787
to react to this.

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:27.916
And so so once you saw that rocket

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.167
actually hit,

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.878
you came here, you came to the scene.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:32.503
I did.

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:34.797
And what what what did you see?

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:37.217
Well, at first I saw the injured

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.801
and your children running around.

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:39.969
I saw blood.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.221
They didn't respond to us.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.847
They were panicking.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:44.766
I saw a lot of guys gathering here.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.059
Most of them didn't go down.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.019
I went down here

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.896
and I saw a lot of things

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.648
that are way too gruesome to mention

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.858
out of respect for the families.

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:56.736
And we tried to help, but it was beyond

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.113
our help. There is nothing we can do.

00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:00.490
There were injuries that you saw

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.658
that were

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.159
too gruesome, too critical

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.452
for any medical attention.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:05.828
So there's nothing you can do?

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:06.496
No, I'm not.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:07.538
I will not go into details,

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:09.707
but there's nothing you can do.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:10.708
And this

00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:12.627
this area around 6 p.m.,

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:13.962
you know, it's summer.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:14.921
Yeah, it must be.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:15.838
It's summer.

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:16.631
Kids are playing.

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:18.091
And we kind of got used to the situation

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.926
because it's been going on for a while.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:20.677
We hear the sirens

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.387
all the time and we just.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:23.429
We just got used to it.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.598
Nothing like this ever happened before.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.517
And tell me about this. This community.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:28.935
I mean, when we came out here,

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.019
everyone is around.

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:30.812
Everyone is still up.

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:31.604
It's very late at night.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.772
It's two in the morning,

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.065
but everyone is still up.

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.733
Everybody must feel very impacted.

00:04:35.733 --> 00:04:37.277
It's a very close knit community,

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:37.652
of course.

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:37.819
I mean,

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:38.528
if you look around,

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:39.487
everybody is helping,

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.739
trying to prepare for the ceremony

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.241
for the funerals tomorrow.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.076
And because everybody knows everybody

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.619
and everybody is related to someone

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.328
and we know the kids,

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:48.496
we know the children,

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:50.039
all the families is well connected.

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.750
And so we stand together

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.835
in good or in bad.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.378
And this is what's happening right now.

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:56.713
It's a dark day for our town.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.631
It's a tragedy that hit us all.

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.466
And this day will be remembered

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:01.634
for generations to come.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:04.095
And and it will go down in history

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.263
as this is a must

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.848
and not just in our town,

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:07.765
in the whole of the country.

00:05:07.765 --> 00:05:09.642
As you said, it's the deadliest attack

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.144
since the 7th of October.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.603
And it's happened in the

00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:13.563
in our small village.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:14.647
So what is

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.149
what is the feeling around here?

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.525
Obviously, there's sadness.

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.360
Is there anger as well with that?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.862
And and where is

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:23.489
that anger being directed?

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:24.741
I don't know what the answer is.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:24.991
I mean,

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.701
this anger is directed at the war

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.119
in general, because, you know, in war

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.537
there is no one is winning.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:30.788
We're all losing.

00:05:30.788 --> 00:05:31.914
And the longer it goes

00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:33.541
on, the more we're going to lose

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.917
and we're helpless.

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:35.376
There is nothing

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:36.586
not much that we can do,

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.004
but I think that should be a response

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.881
for what's happened here today.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.424
And we will not go quiet

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:42.342
until we get a response

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.051
for what's happened here,

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.260
because these are our children.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.887
These are our children, you know,

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:46.971
and what's happened

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:48.139
here is unforgettable.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.724
Like, just look at it.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.225
They're just kids playing

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:53.019
soccer, playing football here.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.687
And they didn't even look at the shelter.

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:56.356
It's only like a few meters away,

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.106
but I'm quite sure

00:05:57.106 --> 00:05:58.024
they didn't have enough time

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:00.109
to get there, even if they were there.

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:01.277
Acted like instantly

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:03.154
there was not enough time. Yeah.

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:03.738
Thank you so much.

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:04.947
Teamwork, Jessica. I do.

00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:06.032
I do want to bring you closer

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.576
to the scene here because

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.703
this is where you can see this crater.

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.372
Right here is where that rocket

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.289
actually struck.

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.291
The Israeli military says that this was

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:16.250
an Iranian made

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.251
rocket that they say

00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:19.420
is only in Hezbollah's arsenal.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.340
Hezbollah has denied responsibility

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.466
for this attack,

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.134
but the Israeli military says

00:06:25.134 --> 00:06:26.010
that they are clear

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.178
that this was Hezbollah

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.805
that carried out this attack.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.348
They say that the rocket

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.141
was fired from a village

00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:33.726
in southern Lebanon.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:34.477
And you can

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:37.146
they say that this was an Iranian war,

00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:38.106
miss a rocket.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.190
Forgive me,

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.110
that had a 50 kilo warhead

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.403
attached to it.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.946
You can also see behind here

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:47.115
there are bicycles.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:47.949
This scene is

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.242
is effectively frozen

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.827
in time from the moment

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.703
when this strike happens.

00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:55.331
And just to bring you over to the side,

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:57.708
I have my cameraman offset pan around.

00:06:57.708 --> 00:06:59.585
You can see how close this is.

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.838
That cinderblock building right

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.589
there is a safe space.

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.258
That is where you rush to

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.510
when you hear those sirens.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.637
And so just so devastating

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:09.971
to see

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:10.805
how close

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.266
these children were to that shelter.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:14.142
But obviously,

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.060
with just a few seconds to be able

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.396
to try and rush into there once

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:18.813
they heard

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.315
those sirens was simply simply

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:22.400
not enough.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.693
And the results now

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:24.735
12 people,

00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:26.195
according to the Israeli military

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:26.737
who are dead

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:28.906
between the ages of ten and 20

00:07:28.906 --> 00:07:30.825
and an entire community here

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.618
that is absolutely devastated.

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:34.328
Just it is truly,

00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:35.621
truly devastating news,

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:38.749
Jeremy, And clearly just so heartbreaking

00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:39.750
for that whole community

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.376
and these children

00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:42.295
who are just playing soccer

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.255
to be targeted in that way.

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.590
We know that Prime Minister

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.549
Prime Minister Benjamin

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.551
Netanyahu was still in the U.S.

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:49.218
when this happened.

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:50.136
He cut his trip short.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.471
He's now headed back.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:51.929
We're told

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:52.972
he'll be convening

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.725
with his war cabinet upon his arrival.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.518
What are you hearing about

00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:58.728
how the government

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:02.440
might be responding to this?

00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:03.274
Well, there was a

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:04.442
very swift response

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.444
from a number of government officials,

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:08.070
all of them making very clear

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.739
that there will be a response

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.366
for this attack, a very serious response,

00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:13.576
and that the Israeli prime

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:14.577
minister himself said,

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.037
I can say that the state of Israel

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.747
will not be silence about this.

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:20.500
We will not put this off the agenda.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.375
Benny Gantz,

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:23.127
a former member of the war cabinet,

00:08:23.127 --> 00:08:24.587
a member of the opposition.

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.756
Now, he came to Majdal Shams

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:27.340
this evening

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.008
to meet with community leaders,

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:31.093
and he was also making very clear

00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:33.012
that not only will there be a response,

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:34.514
but that the Israeli government

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.265
will have his support

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:37.934
as a member of the opposition

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:40.436
for a decisive response in Lebanon,

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:43.439
and that really is now the big question.

00:08:43.564 --> 00:08:44.857
There have been fears

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:47.318
not only in Israel but also in the U.S.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.486
government that an incident

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:51.155
like this one with so many casualties,

00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:52.990
notably civilian casualties,

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.408
and in this case,

00:08:54.408 --> 00:08:55.117
many of them

00:08:55.117 --> 00:08:56.285
being children,

00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:56.953
that an incident

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:57.370
like this

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.621
could potentially set off

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.624
a very dangerous escalation,

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.501
potentially lead to war.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:05.294
And that is certainly the question

00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:06.837
now, is whether or not

00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:07.797
the escalation,

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.215
the response from Israel

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.716
will be so severe

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.218
that it could lead to that

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.177
all out conflict

00:09:13.177 --> 00:09:13.928
with Hezbollah,

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.471
that all out war with Hezbollah

00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:16.973
that so many have feared.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:17.682
At this hour,

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.267
it is too premature to say

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.185
whether or not that will happen.

00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:21.978
What is clear

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:22.895
is that we've been hearing

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.064
the sounds of jets buzzing above us.

00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:26.399
We are very close

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.942
to the Lebanese border here.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.902
It is clear that the Israeli military

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:31.404
will respond to this attack,

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.989
which they say was carried out

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:33.823
by Hezbollah.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:36.367
How severe that response will be

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:37.660
will determine

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.161
the course of things, will determine

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:41.080
what the counter reaction from Hezbollah

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.706
will be

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:42.707
and will determine

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:44.166
whether or not we are headed

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:45.042
for a very,

00:09:45.042 --> 00:09:48.379
very dangerous and deadly path Jessica.

00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:50.590
Jeremy Diamond, live from Golan Heights,

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.966
the new reporting there.

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.259
Thank you so much for that.
