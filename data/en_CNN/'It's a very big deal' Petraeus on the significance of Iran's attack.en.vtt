00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.501
Former CIA director

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.035
and retired

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.536
four star General David Petraeus,

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:04.771
who also served as commander of U.S.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:05.338
Central Command,

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:07.507
which includes part of the Middle East.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.809
Director Petraeus, thanks for joining us.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.145
What's your assessment of the attack

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:12.746
by Iran?

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.647
Was this a genuine attempt

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:15.515
to retaliate,

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.449
to overwhelm Israel's

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.685
defenses, to cause mass damage,

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.354
or was this a show of force or Iran

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.255
by indicating

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:23.123
that they don't want

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:25.592
actually to escalate further?

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.060
Well, I don't believe so.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.727
I think it was probably

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:30.230
a bit more of the latter than the former.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.265
Clearly, it was unprecedented.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:33.867
There never has been an attack

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.402
that came from Iranian soil.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:36.002
And, of course,

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.437
these attacks also included

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.039
some of the proxies

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.508
in Iraq and Syria and southern Lebanon.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.143
There's never been something

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:44.677
like this in the past,

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.413
but it seemed a little bit

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:49.115
less than what they might have thrown

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:50.517
if they were really serious.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.952
In fact, it was probably a good bit less

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.120
than if they really wanted

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.755
to cause massive damage.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:57.123
It struck me as a little bit

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.625
like that attack

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.527
the Iranians did after the U.S.

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.429
killed cousin Soleimani in Baghdad.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.329
That time,

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.665
they telegraphed it well in advance

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:08.168
and again, no casualties out of that one

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.170
in this case at most.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.705
It appears that there was one

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.541
Arab-Israeli girl

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.875
who was seriously injured

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.243
and may have died.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.212
So there's a tiny bit of this Goldilocks

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:20.146
aspect to this,

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.147
I think, although, again,

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.083
a very significant attack.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:23.783
Iran and Israel

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:25.318
been fighting this shadow war

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:27.120
in the Middle East for decades now.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.321
This is the first time

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.990
that Iran has directly attacked Israel

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:32.258
from inside

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.326
Iranian territory,

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:35.929
not using proxies like Hamas or Hezbollah

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.697
or the Houthis.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:39.032
Just how significant

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:40.733
a moment is this for the Middle East?

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:44.070
Well, it is significant.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.705
It's a very big deal.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:46.106
And I think

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.006
Israel will have to

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.275
take some action in response.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.644
I think it's very clear that the U.S.

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:51.978
would like

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:53.313
to see that be as limited

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:54.013
as this possible.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.282
Keep in mind that the real issue here,

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:57.884
in addition to Israel's

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:58.785
security, of course,

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.253
which is first and foremost,

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.055
but it's also about freedom of navigation

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:02.655
from the Gulf

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.224
for the oil and gas

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:05.592
that come from the Gulf and fuel

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.260
much of the global economy.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.195
That's the biggest issue here.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:09.996
And Iran,

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:10.530
I don't think,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.532
wants to have that disrupted either

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:13.366
because they export

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.300
about 1.6

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.603
or 1.7 million barrels a day themselves.

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:18.705
So keep your eye on that.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:19.906
Brant crude is already

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:21.207
above $90 a barrel,

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:22.609
and it would really spike

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.210
if there was something that interfered

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.078
with freedom of navigation.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:25.345
In fact,

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.580
we need to figure out what's going on.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.416
Iran did take a ship the other day

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:32.652
that they claimed was in some way

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:33.920
dealing with Israel.

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:36.122
But this

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.891
is another step up

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.360
the rung of escalation.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.427
I think it's in the interests

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:41.961
of everyone

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:44.964
to stop the increasing escalation.

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:46.633
But we'll have to see

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.902
what Israel decides to do in this case.

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:49.502
President Biden

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.237
told Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.138
that the United States

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:53.072
will not participate

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:55.275
in any offensive strikes

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.544
by Israel against Iran.

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:58.711
How would you advise Israel

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.013
to respond to this?

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:00.880
How worried are you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.981
that any responsible

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:04.651
only throws fuel on the fire

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:06.719
Well, that has to be a concern,

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.153
and I'm sure

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:08.488
they're conscious of that, Jake.

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.089
There's a whole

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.925
menu of actions that they can take,

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:14.027
not all of which are necessarily overt.

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.896
They can pursue covert, they can pursue

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.631
asymmetric attacks,

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:19.699
cyberspace and so forth.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.100
And keep in mind that, of course,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.702
Washington is meeting

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.804
with the other G7 countries to determine

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:25.838
what kind of diplomatic

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:27.640
and economic responses

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.642
should follow in a coordinated effort

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:30.510
as well.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.346
Can't really take your eye off

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:33.913
Gaza, though.

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:34.914
At the end of the day,

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:36.716
Got to get those hostages back.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:37.850
And I believe

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.886
still do need to destroy Hamas.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.321
You don't send the

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.423
the fire department to extinguish.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:44.857
80% of the fire

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.593
They still have work to do there.

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:46.859
All right.

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.228
General Petraeus, always good to see you.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.495
Thank you so much for your insights.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:50.163
Joining us now,

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:50.530
the former

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.832
director of national intelligence

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.834
under President Obama, a retired General,

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.704
James Clapper.

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.406
So, first of all, just the size

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.174
and scope of this,

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.543
we've never seen anything quite like this

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.612
in terms of Iran directly

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:08.014
launching attack on Israel.

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.716
So it does seem to mark

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:10.950
a change, an inflection

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.485
point of some sort. Yes.

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:14.320
Oh, no question, Jake. That

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:16.856
a Rubicon was

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:19.025
has been crossed here with

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.728
Iran directly attacking from Iranian

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.797
Iran proper to Israel proper.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:26.933
That said, though,

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.434
the size of the attack,

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.903
I think was very measured.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:31.838
It did not.

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:32.572
I think

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.340
the Iranians had to know

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.442
that it would not overwhelm

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:39.979
the coalition air defense system.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:43.149
And then at the end of it, they declared

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:45.551
it was done without having

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:48.588
accomplished much in the way of damage.

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:51.257
So I think there was a messaging here.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.560
But I still believe despite this

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.064
very profound event, that the Iranians

00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:59.732
don't want a wider war,

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.868
as strange as that may seem.

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:04.404
But so explain to people at home

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:05.772
who think General

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.307
or they're saying, General Clapper,

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:07.774
how can you say

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:09.542
they don't want a wider war?

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:13.279
They just fired 300 attack drones.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.114
And missiles at Israel.

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.582
But you think that the way they did

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.318
it is significant?

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.886
Well, I do, because first

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.387
they telegraphed it.

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:24.223
They sent slow moving drones out first,

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:27.193
which you had hours to to prepare for.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.630
And the Iranians have a lot of missiles,

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.266
ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:34.867
So if they had wanted to,

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.903
I believe they could have overwhelmed

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.938
the Israeli air defense system

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:40.673
and out of the coalition,

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:41.674
which was very important

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:43.443
you know, I guess

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:46.079
20% or so of the projectiles were

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:49.849
neutralized by U.S.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.251
or other coalition elements.

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.786
So the whole way they went about this,

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.922
I think, was very deliberate,

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:56.823
very measured.

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.524
I don't think

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.193
they want a wider war.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.094
Of course, now

00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:03.062
it's all up to the Israelis

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:04.230
So the United States

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.099
does not have an embassy in Iran.

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.233
Iran doesn't have an embassy

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:09.235
in the United States.

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.105
You think that this information

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:13.172
about a week ago

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:15.208
maybe or maybe a little bit less,

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.476
the Biden administration

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:17.910
started announcing

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.313
or leaking to newspapers.

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:21.280
There's intelligence

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.282
that Iran is going to attack Israel.

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:25.952
You think it's possible

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:28.588
that Iran leaked that intentionally?

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:31.591
I think it's quite possible.

00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:33.226
They may have conveyed it to us.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.193
I think

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.629
they probably weren't all that careful

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.431
about masking their preparation.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:40.800
The fact that

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.434
President Biden

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:43.536
came back from Delaware early,

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.639
convene the national security team.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:47.673
All these things

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:50.309
tell me that we had good insight

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.212
into what the Iranians were going to do.

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.581
And so why do it?

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:56.849
So why would they do it?

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.985
Well, I think the Israelis have

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.587
the Iranians have their own domestic

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:03.556
political pressures.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:03.990
They have

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.224
they have some very

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:08.694
there are some very hard liners now

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.998
surrounding the supreme leader

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:12.932
So I think

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:14.300
they have that

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.702
that constituency to placate.

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:18.871
And the fact that they showed the

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:21.841
parade or, if you will, of

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.378
solitary the parade in Tehran

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:28.548
of the joyful Iranians,

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:30.249
so happy about the attack.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.150
And I think that's

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.786
what was important to the Iranians.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.555
And I still believe

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:37.156
they don't want a wider war,

00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:39.659
as incongruous as that may sound.

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:43.396
But their proxy is are doing things that

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:45.565
are not meant to be

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.366
eliminated.

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:50.169
Their proxies Hamas slaughtering

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:52.371
you know 1200 Israelis.

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:53.840
Hezbollah firing rockets

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.708
into the north of Israel.

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:57.677
So as you know,

00:07:57.677 --> 00:07:59.045
tens of thousands of Israelis

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.580
can't even live in their homes.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.349
The Houthis shutting down

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:06.219
coastal passages, I mean, ocean passages.

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:10.656
So that seems incongruous to it does.

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:11.824
And I think that

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:12.758
raises the question

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:15.761
of just how much control

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.697
Iran actually has over the over

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:18.664
the proxies there.

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:21.167
I think they have their own objectives

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.235
and

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.003
and they're going to try to fulfill them.

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:25.771
And in the case of particularly

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:27.340
in the case of Hezbollah.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.741
Well, this is a great opportunity

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:29.742
for them

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:33.713
to weigh in and increase the attacks

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.147
from southern Lebanon

00:08:35.147 --> 00:08:37.083
and into northern Israel.

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.084
So,

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:39.352
you know,

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:40.686
this is not a rosy picture

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.722
for Iran either. I'll put it that way.

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:43.356
All right.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.190
Retired General

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.024
James Clapper, former

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.025
director of national intelligence,

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:46.893
thanks so much for being here.

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:47.393
Appreciate it.
