&gt;&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW I WANT TO BRING IN RETIRED AIR FORCE COLONEL CEDRIC LEIGHTON. COLONEL, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  JOINING US. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT HAMAS TO DO  DURING THIS BRIEF PAUSE IN  FIGHTING? &gt;&gt; WOLF, I THINK WHAT THEY'RE  GOING TO DO IS THEY'RE GOING TO  MOVE THEIR FORCES AROUND. THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO AVOID  DETECTION BY THE ISRAELIS AND  THAT SPEAKS TO THE CESSATION OF  DRONE FLIGHTS. HAMAS IS GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE  SURVEILLANCE PICTURE -- THAT  PART OF THE SURVEILLANCE PICTURE WILL BE LACKING FOR THE  ISRAELIS. SO HAMAS IS GOING TO TAKE  ADVANTAGE OF THAT. THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO DEPLOY  THEIR FORCES IN A WAY THAT WILL  ALLOW THEM TO POTENTIALLY AMBUSH ISRAELI FORCES. NOW, THERE WERE SOME SERIOUS  CHALLENGES ON THE HAMAS SIDE. BECAUSE ISRAEL IS SENDING A LOT  OF AIR STRIKES THEIR WAY AND A  LOT OF ARTILLERY STRIKES AS  WELL, AND WHAT THAT'S DOING IS  IT'S FORCING HAMAS BACK FROM THE NORTHERN AREA OF GAZA. WITH ALL OF THAT IN MIND, WHAT  YOU'RE SEEING IS A CONSOLIDATION OF FORCES ON BOTH SIDES WITH THE PREPONDERANCE OF ISRAELI FORCE  CONCENTRATED IN THE NORTH OF  GAZA AND THEN POTENTIALLY MOVING INTO THE CENTRAL PART FOR A PUSH ONCE MORE INTO GAZA CITY. HAMAS IS GOING TO TRY TO KEEP AS MUCH OF GAZA CITY AS THEY CAN  AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THEIR TUNNELS ACTIVE AS WELL. &gt;&gt; COLONEL, ISRAEL'S DEFENSE  MINISTER SAYS HE EXPECTS THE  FIGHTING AGAINST HAMAS TO  LAST -- IN HIS WORDS, AT LEAST  ANOTHER TWO MONTHS. DO YOU SEE THAT AS BEING ENOUGH  TIME FOR ISRAEL TO ACCOMPLISH  ITS OBJECTIVE OF COMPLETELY  DESTROYING HAMAS? &gt;&gt; NOT REALLY. BECAUSE DESTROYING HAMAS WOULD  REQUIRE NOT ONLY A MILITARY  VICTORY, BUT ALSO A  PSYCHOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL  VICTORY. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T  SEE HAPPENING BECAUSE AT THIS .  POINT IN TIME, YOU HAVE TWO VERY HOSTILE POPULATIONS PITTED  AGAINST EACH OTHER AND HAMAS IS  VERY DETERMINED TO KEEP ITS  POWER BASE IN GAZA AS LONG AS IT CAN. AND THE ISRAELIS, OF COURSE, ARE DETERMINED TO UPROOT THEM. BUT HAMAS HAS THE UPPER HAND  WHEN IT COMES TO THE HEARTS AND  MINDS OF THE GAZAEN PEOPLE. ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE HAD BASICALLY LESS THAN MAJORITY SUPPORT,  RIGHT NOW I THINK THEIR SUPPORT  HAS INCREASED AND THAT IS GOING  TO ALSO IMPACT THE WAY IN WHICH  ISRAEL HAS TO CONDUCT THIS WAR. IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN TWO MONTHS IF THEY WANT TO COMPLETE  THAT GOAL OF DESTROYING HAMAS. &gt;&gt; RETIRED COLONEL CEDRIC  LAYTON, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  JOINING US.  &gt;&gt;&gt; IN JUST A FEW HOURS FROM  NOW, THE FIRST HOSTAGES BEING  HELD BY HAMAS COULD BE ON THEIR  WAY HOME. SO, WHAT WILL THAT TRANSFER  PROCESS ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE? OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE COMPLICATED. BUT WHERE DO THESE WOMEN AND  CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPECTED TO BE  THE FIRST ONES OUT OF GAZA, OUT  OF HAMAS' CAPTIVITY, WHERE DO  THEY GO? JOINING ME NOW IS THE FORMER FBI AGENT, ROBERT DeMECO, WHO HAS  WORKED ON HOSTAGE CASES OVERSEAS IN HIS CAREER. ROB, LET'S JUST START WITH HOW  MUCH OF A TEST DO YOU THINK THAT THE FIRST DAY HERE IS GOING TO  BE FOR FUTURE SWAPS? &gt;&gt; OH, IT'S HUGE. AS THIS -- I CALL THIS A MOMENT  OF TRUST. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE TRUST ON  EITHER SIDE OF IT. BUT DURING THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE,  YOU HAVE TO TRUST EACH OTHER  QUITE A BIT. IT'S COMPLEX. THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT  COULD GO WRONG. EVEN WITHOUT ANY ILL EFFECT ON  EITHER SIDE, IF YOU HAVE A  FACTION NOT WANTING TO HAPPEN. WE TRIED TO DO HOSTAGE EXCHANGES AND EVEN COULDN'T FIND THEM WITH THE HELICOPTER AND TRYING TO  NARROW IT DOWN BEFORE WEATHER  CAME IN. BUT THIS ONE'S GOING TO TAKE A  LOT OF TRUST TO MOVE THAT MANY  PEOPLE THROUGH AN AREA THAT'S,  YOU KNOW, A PART OF WAR. HAMAS ISN'T GOING TO WANT THEM  TO BE TRACKED WHERE THEY CAME  FROM. I'M SURE THEY'LL COME TO A CENTRAL POINT WHERE THEY'VE  GATHERED THEM AND MOVE THEM TO A POINT AGREED ON. SAME THING WITH THE ISRAELI  PRISONERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE  COMING OUT. IT IS A TREMENDOUS TASK, AND THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO BE  EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. A LOT OF HEIGHTENED TENSION ON  EITHER SIDE. IT WILL GO DOWN A BIT WITH EACH  ONE. BUT EVEN AS SMALL AS AIR BETWEEN THEM CAN HAVE THAT SPIN OUT OF  CONTROL AS FAR AS LOSING TRUST. &gt;&gt; HOW MUCH DOES IT HURT IT THAT IT'S NOT A DIRECT LINE OF  COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS? I MEAN, THIS IS ALL BEING  MEDIATED THROUGH THE QATARIS. &gt;&gt; SO, I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF  THESE. ONE ACTUALLY, I ENDED UP  HAVING -- I WAS GOING THROUGH A  SENIOR QATARI THAT WE WERE  MOVING MILITARY FOLKS TO RECOVER A PRISONER HELD BY THE TALIBAN. AND IT GOT SO COMPLICATED THAT  THE QATARI HAD TO FLIP HIS CELL  PHONE SO I WAS TALKING STRAIGHT  TO THE COMMANDER BECAUSE WE  COULDN'T FIND HIM. WE HAD TO LOWER THE PREDATOR TO  LOOK FOR THEM, AND THEY THOUGHT  WE WERE GOING TO SHOOT THEM. THEY HAD MACHINE GUNS, SO THEY  GOODNESS WE HAD SOME  COMMUNICATION TO TALK EACH OTHER DOWN. THE SECOND ONE, ALMOST FOUR YEARS AGO TODAY, NOVEMBER 2019,  WE EXCHANGED PROFESSOR KING AND  WEEKS, TWO PROFESSORS KIDNAPPED  IN KABUL FOR THE -- THREE. THAT WAS A BIT DIFFERENT. WE HAD TO GIVE OUR SIDE UP, T THEIR THREE FIRST, BEFORE THEY  RELEASED THEIRS. WE HAD TO PULL THEM BACK AT THE  LAST SECOND BECAUSE SOMETHING  FELL THROUGH. IT DIDN'T HURT. WE DID IT THE NEXT DAY, BUT IT  WAS STILL A COMPLEX SCENARIO. THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED  TO GET WORD BACK AND FORTH. BUT THAT WAS THROUGH THE QATARIS TOO. SO, AGAIN, THE TRUST FACTOR, QATARIS TALKING TO HAMAS, US  TALKING TO QATARIS, SINCE WE'VE  DONE IT WITH THEM BEFORE, I  THINK THAT HELPS A BIT. &gt;&gt; SO, WHAT IS -- IF YOU'RE A  HOSTAGE AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE  FIRST ONES WHO'S BEING RELEASED, WHAT DOES THAT REINTEGRATION  PERIOD LOOK LIKE? OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO NEED  MEDICAL EXAMS. THEY WANT TO BE REUNITED WITH  THEIR FAMILIES. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN  DEEPLY TRAUMATIZED FOR 47 DAYS  NOW. WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S -- THE  REINTEGRATION, WE CALL IT  BRINGING THEM BACK IN. THE FIRST THING IS MEDICAL. I'M SURE WITH THIS MANY AT THIS  ONE TIME THAT THEY'RE GOING TO  HAVE SOMETHING SET UP WHERE THEY COME IN AND THERE'S GOING TO BE  A MEDICAL TEAM FOR EACH PERSON. I THINK THE FIRST ARE GOING TO  BE 13 PEOPLE. DON'T KNOW WHO, DON'T KNOW AGES  AND STUFF. BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE A  MEDICAL TEAM PROBABLY FOR EACH  PE PERSON. ALONG WITH THAT MEDICAL TEAM IS  GOING TO BE HOPEFULLY A  PSYCHOLOGIST. THE FBI HAS A PSYCHOLOGIST UNDER THE VICTIMS ASSISTANCE FOLKS  THAT USUALLY COMES FORWARD AT  LEAST TO A MIDDLE GROUND. WELD USUALLY MOVE THEM TO  GERMANY, WHERE THERE'S A WHOLE  TEAM SET UP AT THE MILITARY BASE THERE, IN ORDER TO REINTEGRATE  THEM. AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST STARTS  ACTUALLY DICTATING WHAT'S  ALLOWED. WE'D EVEN HAVE AGENTS WHO ARE  INTEL FOLKS TALKING TO THEM  WITHOUT THE PSYCHOLOGIST THERE  BECAUSE OF ALL THE STRESS THAT  THEY'RE GOING THROUGH. WE WANT TO GET INFORMATION FROM  THEM TO HELP WITH OTHER HOSTAGES AND OTHER THINGS, BUT THEIR  PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IS  MORE IMPORTANT. AND THAT PSYCHOLOGIST THAT'S  ASSIGNED TO THEM IS THE ONE  REALLY DICTATING. I'VE SEEN SOME PRISONERS -- I  DEBRIEFED -- HE WAS ACTUALLY  PAKISTANI. AND HE HAD BEEN HELD FIVE YEARS  BY THE TALIBAN. I DEBRIEFED HIM FOR ABOUT FIVE  HOURS BEFORE WE SENT HIM BACK,  AND HE HAD ME LAUGHING. I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH  SENSE OF HUMOR HE REMAINED AFTER FIVE YEARS. HE HAD A GREAT OUTLOOK. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; HE WAS MAKING JOKES AND  REALLY COMING AROUND. THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. &gt;&gt; THAT IS REMARKABLE. I MEAN, YOUR INSIGHT ON THIS IS  SO FASCINATING. AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE THINKING OF  ALL OF THESE WHO ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED. ROBERT D'AMICO, THANK YOU FOR  HAPPY THANKSGIVING.
