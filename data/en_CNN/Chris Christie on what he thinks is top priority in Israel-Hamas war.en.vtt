00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.533
Met with

00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.669
Israeli President Isaac Herzog t

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.170
What can you tell us about your 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.940
and what was discussed

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:07.874
Well,

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:08.441
we discussed

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.976
the current state of the war.

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:12.212
We discussed American involvemen

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.613
and support.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.949
We discussed the situation

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.551
with the hostages that are being

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:21.388
And we talked about the atrociti

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.857
that I've been able to see first

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.759
during my visit here today.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.127
And you've also been meeting wit

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.862
as I understand, some survivors

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.630
and family of those affected

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.698
as well, right?

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.969
Yeah, I met with I met with two 

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:39.572
one young woman, 23 years old,

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:42.242
shot in the bomb shelter who sur

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.243
only because she was

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.578
covered by other dead bodies.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:46.246
Yeah,

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:49.382
I met with two families of hosta

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:50.250
today.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.986
I have this dog tag for that 19 

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:54.421
old young man

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.222
who this family I met with tonig

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.926
His his father has

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.227
spent time in New Jersey,

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.296
lived in New Jersey for a long t

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:06.866
And, you know, those folks are s

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.169
There was suffering there for 37

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.803
not knowing

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.072
if their loved ones are alive or

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.507
not knowing if they're being car

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.709
It's a it's an extra ordinary si

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.143
Yeah.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:17.410
We just

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.846
we just spoke to a brother of so

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.047
or someone who has a brother

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.882
that is currently being held hos

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.117
And he talked about

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:24.918
how difficult

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.120
it has been up to this point.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.854
Now, look,

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:29.756
we are in the middle of this con

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:30.924
and the fighting right now.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.158
But today on CNN,

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:32.725
Israeli Prime

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.961
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:35.962
as far as solutions

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:36.563
for post

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:37.263
fighting, push

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:38.364
back on the idea

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.533
of the Palestinian Authority run

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:41.835
and said any solution,

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.036
we need to have an overriding

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:44.304
and overreaching Israeli

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:45.705
military envelope.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:46.439
Do you agree

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.141
with Prime Minister Netanyahu's

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:48.741
assessment there?

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:49.142
I mean, what

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.043
what do you propose

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:51.511
or think is going to happen here

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.080
I think it's too

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.549
early to make that determination

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.651
I understand that the prime mini

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:01.588
is focused exclusively now on th

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.389
on degrading Hamas's ability

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.191
to ever do this again,

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.694
protecting the territorial integ

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:09.329
and the safety and security

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.364
of the people of Israel.

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:11.931
But, look,

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.500
I don't see any long line of fol

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.969
looking to volunteer to take ove

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.036
from Hamas.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:17.403
This is,

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.138
I think, going to be

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.205
a diplomatic solution

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.541
that's going to need to be come 

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.743
by all the interested parties

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:24.377
at a time

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:26.379
when the war is finally conclude

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.248
But first and foremost,

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:29.682
you have to protect the safety

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.718
and security of the people of Is

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.086
And you have to degrade Hamas

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:34.888
because Hamas and believe me,

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:37.590
I spent today spending 40 minute

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.392
watching a video

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.829
of the atrocities that were comm

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.032
by Hamas that day.

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:46.833
And I will tell you what

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.434
struck me the most, Omar.

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:50.937
It wasn't just the inhumanity

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:52.672
of what they were doing

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.508
Chopping off heads, burning peop

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.578
But it was the joy they took in 

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.747
They have video of one terrorist

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.816
calling his mother

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.719
saying your your son killed ten 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.054
with his own hands.

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:10.290
Your son's a hero.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.392
As long as there are folks like 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:16.262
in Hamas who are focused on wipi

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:17.564
Israel off the map

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.699
and killing the Jewish people.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.968
Discussion of what happens in Ga

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:23.403
after the war

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.438
has to take a backseat at the mo

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.473
to eliminating Hamas's ability

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.342
to threaten the lives

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.510
of the people of Israel.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.512
Again, And so,

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:33.213
you know, the prime

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.280
minister will have a lot of time

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.615
to think about

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.850
the postwar period when it comes

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:39.986
But I think right now,

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.722
task one is making sure that Ham

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.424
has capabilities degraded

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:45.458
and protecting the safety

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:46.993
and security of the Israeli peop

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:47.560
And that's among

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.795
one of the multiple dynamics

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.729
going on right now.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:50.129
Of course,

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.998
there's a military campaign to

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:53.433
to weed out and eliminate

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:55.668
Hamas on the side of the IDF,

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:56.736
but also

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.272
trying to rescue some of these h

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:00.940
I want to go back to a little bi

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.075
After October 7th,

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:02.909
you said

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.077
less a little less than two week

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.712
after the October 7th attack.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:07.680
You said providing aid to civili

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.916
in Gaza was a very, very low pri

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:10.950
and that the focus

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.752
at that point needed to be on mi

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:15.021
and financially helping Israel.

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:15.521
Obviously,

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:16.322
since then, we've seen

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:17.323
a level of civilians

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:19.525
killed by the thousands up to th

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:20.893
Do you still believe

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.795
humanitarian aid is a low priori

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:23.863
in comparison to

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:25.231
the Israeli military's needs?

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:28.935
I still believe that, yes.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.770
I think if you're prioritizing

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.005
those things, Omar,

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:32.972
the most important thing

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.407
is for us to provide

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:35.642
financial assistance

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:36.976
and military

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:38.745
hardware to the Israelis

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:39.579
so they can

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:41.681
do what they need to do in Gaza

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:42.782
regarding the terrorists

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:43.383
who attacked them

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:45.852
and killed over 1200 of their ci

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:48.921
Now, no one likes civilian

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:50.790
deaths of anyone,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.925
whether it's Israeli or Palestin

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:54.494
But let's remember this.

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:55.194
Two things.

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:55.928
First,

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.030
there was a cease fire

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.765
on October 6th, Omar,

00:04:58.765 --> 00:04:59.565
and it was Hamas

00:04:59.565 --> 00:04:59.999
that broke

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.100
that cease fire

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.503
with their attacks on October 7t

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.305
And secondly,

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.372
Israel has done

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:09.575
much to try to get Palestinians 

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:10.843
from the area

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:11.477
where the battle

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:11.978
is going to be

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.846
to the southern part of Gaza.

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.281
It is Hamas

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.649
that is refusing

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:17.950
to let many of those people

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.652
go to the southern part of Gaza

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:20.586
because they want to use them

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:22.388
as human shields.

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:25.124
I believe that the that Hamas ca

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:27.560
about Palestinian civilian life

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.995
than Israel does.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:29.896
And so,

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:30.196
you know,

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:32.398
Hamas has to take responsibility

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:32.799
for this.

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:33.533
They could be helping

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:34.567
their civilians significantly.

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:37.270
And we saw a report just today

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.572
that Israel said fuel

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:41.941
to run the Al-Shifa hospital

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:43.943
and that Hamas refused to accept

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:45.411
You can't

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:46.245
complain about not

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.047
being able to run the incubators

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:48.514
and the life

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:50.283
support systems at a hospital

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:52.018
and then turn down fuel

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.153
that's being sent by the Israeli

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.455
to be able to work

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.523
those those pieces of equipment.

00:05:57.957 --> 00:06:00.293
So Hamas is the hypocrite here.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.160
And that's why

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.861
I think

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:04.030
the top priority has to be aidin

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.465
so that we can put an end to thi

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:06.666
as quickly as possible.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:09.268
And this this topic was posed to

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:10.103
Minister Benjamin

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.671
Netanyahu when he was on our air

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:12.839
a little bit earlier

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:13.873
today on the topic

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.408
of whether they've been doing en

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:16.809
to protect

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:17.677
some of the civilians

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:18.411
that have been killed

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:19.312
or at least minimize

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.313
the civilians that were killed.

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:22.081
Take a listen to what he told Da

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.984
We're trying

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:27.086
to minimize civilian casualties

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:28.521
as a result of our ground action

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:30.590
I think the number of civilian c

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:31.991
is actually being reduced

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:34.260
because people are heeding our c

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.561
to leave the area

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:36.362
and defying

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:38.664
Hamas's attempt to keep them the

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:40.066
And we'll do everything in our p

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.033
to do that.

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:42.935
Now, even with that, Secretary o

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:44.036
Antony Blinken

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:45.104
has said far too

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:47.173
many Palestinians have been kill

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:48.207
Do you agree

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:50.543
with the secretary of state ther

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.446
Well, I think that any loss of c

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.681
life is tragic

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:57.884
and should be avoided at all cos

00:06:58.017 --> 00:07:00.987
But, Omar, we need to make sure

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.023
that Hamas cannot use these civi

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.358
as a shield

00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:06.726
to prevent them

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:08.161
from having their military

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:09.729
capability degraded.

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.531
They've shown on October 7th,

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:12.899
in the days afterwards

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:14.801
that they will use missiles.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:17.437
They will come by air, sea and l

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:21.974
in an attempt to kill Israeli ci

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:23.509
And we can't permit that

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:24.477
to continue to happen.

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:25.478
Omar, so,

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:26.612
you know, this is

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.815
this is always very, very diffic

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.416
But I do believe that Israel

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:31.350
is trying to do everything

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.118
it can

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.954
to avoid the loss of civilian li

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:37.990
both in Gaza and in Israel.

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.293
Now, here in the U.S.,

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.527
obviously, there's a budget figh

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:42.695
that's it's really just beginnin

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.197
as we head towards a government 

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:46.032
But as far as the plan that was 

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:47.700
the bills don't provide

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.602
any funding for Israel or Ukrain

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:51.504
Which you've also visited

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.339
over the course of this past yea

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.441
What message do you believe, aga

00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:56.909
not the final version, but still

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.578
what message do you believe

00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:01.380
that these initial versions send

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.315
our foreign allies

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.251
Not a good one.

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:05.751
Omar.

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.920
And I think that candidly,

00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:10.022
we have to continue to play the 

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.357
the world we've always played,

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:12.892
because if we don't,

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:13.993
the evil forces

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:17.063
will fill in our vacuum that we 

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:19.232
And I mean China, Russia,

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:20.733
Iran and North Korea.

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:21.234
And let me tell you,

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:22.702
when I went to a military instal

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:24.804
today, installation here today,

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.574
I saw weapons that were from Nor

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:29.475
Korea,

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:31.844
weapons that were from Iran and 

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:33.212
that were from Russia.

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:35.548
If leaders in Congress

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:37.250
don't understand

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.418
that all of these things are con

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:43.456
and that American dismissed

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:46.526
all of our role in any of these 

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.694
occur encourages more of them,

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.162
not fewer of them.

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:51.998
We need to send a very clear mes

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:54.267
by supporting Israel

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:56.035
and supporting Ukraine.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:56.836
And believe me,

00:08:57.803 --> 00:08:59.372
Vladimir Putin is happy

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.741
about what's going on here in Is

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.075
and in Gaza.

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:05.077
Because he hopes that it will di

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:07.580
certain American leaders who bel

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:08.881
filling the moat

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:09.448
and pulling up

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:10.483
the drawbridge

00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:11.884
is the way that America

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:13.319
should conduct itself.

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:15.688
I believe exactly the opposite.

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:16.722
We have to be able

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:18.291
to lead the free world.

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.092
It is the price we pay

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:22.194
for being the richest and freest

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:23.763
The world has ever known.

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:25.798
And if we want to remain the ric

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:26.532
and freest country

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:27.633
the world's ever known,

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:29.302
we have to engage with our allie

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:30.236
around the world.

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.037
That is always been

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:31.938
the formula

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.239
for American success,

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.241
both at home and abroad.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.076
And any suggestion to the contra

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:39.211
made by anyone in Congress

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:41.447
or anywhere else in our politica

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:42.682
is damaging America's

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:44.083
standing in the world

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:46.018
and damaging our future for succ
