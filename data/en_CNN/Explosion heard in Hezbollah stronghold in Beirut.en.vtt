00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:00.767
We're following more

00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.002
breaking news in to CNN.

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:03.236
This out of the Middle East.

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:06.039
According to a Hezbollah run TV agency,

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.240
a loud explosion

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.841
has been heard

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.510
in the southern suburbs of Beirut.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.211
Let's take you there

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.146
live with CNN's Ben Wedeman.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.914
Ben, what more are you learning

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.917
about this explosion?

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:20.020
Of course,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.955
we know that within the last a half hour,

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.490
there was a large explosion

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.725
in what's known as the Heart break

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.494
neighborhood of southern Beirut.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:28.928
That's an area

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.331
where many of the leaders of

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.801
Hezbollah have been known to operate.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.537
Now, we don't have a lot of details.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:38.872
We know that

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.874
some local channels are saying

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.909
that the one of the building

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.513
hit was a residential building.

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:48.948
We don't know about casualties

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:49.749
at this point.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.251
It still seems to be

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.319
a fairly chaotic scene.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.589
We have seen pictures of smoke rising

00:00:56.823 --> 00:01:00.360
from that part of the city,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.261
but certainly

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:05.131
that is what we know at this point.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.300
It is the first time

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.902
the southern suburbs of Beirut

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:09.869
have been hit

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.571
since early January,

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.840
when the Israelis had killed

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.676
a senior Hamas leader who was in

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:17.710
that area.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.912
But as I said,

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.281
this is the first strike since then.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.483
And Hezbollah has made it very clear

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:27.287
all along that if Beirut is struck,

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:29.522
they will answer accordingly.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:30.490
They have said

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.992
that they will meet escalation

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.394
with escalation

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:35.261
in the aftermath

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:39.032
of last Saturday's attack on the Golan

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:39.933
in the

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.801
Israeli occupied Syrian Golan

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:44.804
Heights, that left 12 children dead.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.507
So perhaps this is the first major

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:50.410
Israeli response to that attack.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.877
Doris

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:53.513
and Ben, just to be

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:54.114
clear,

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.648
when this you're saying

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.350
this happened in the Beirut suburbs.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.652
Can you give us some specificity

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:02.655
on what Hezbollah might see

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:06.192
as, an attack, maybe Beirut proper

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.327
versus in the suburbs?

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:10.330
Will this matter?

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:12.565
Well, we call it

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.167
it's called the Beirut suburb.

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.002
It's the El Dia in Arabic,

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.137
but it really is

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.539
part of the city of Beirut.

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.341
It's between where I am,

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.209
down by the port,

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.578
and the and the airport.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:29.349
So it really is Beirut proper, despite

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.617
what we call it.

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:33.286
And of course, that has been made clear

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:36.122
time and time again, by Hezbollah there.

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.223
That's a red line.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.858
Now, just the other day,

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:40.326
I spoke with the foreign

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.761
minister of Lebanon,

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:42.862
who told me that

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:44.297
through diplomatic channels

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.565
they had received

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:48.968
assurances from, their friends.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:49.969
He called them,

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.771
that Beirut,

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.373
that the Israeli response

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:54.474
would be limited.

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.576
And the Lebanese government interpreted

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:57.744
that as meaning,

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.445
that Beirut,

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.281
the southern suburbs of Beirut,

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:04.117
and the airport would not be targeted.

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:07.720
That perhaps was not a very correct

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.789
interpretation of those

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.991
so-called assurances. Brianna.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.428
Ben, please stand by for us in Beirut.

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:16.296
We want to bring in CNN

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.497
military analyst, former

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:18.565
general Mark curling,

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:20.166
who is joining us now live.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:20.567
general,

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:22.268
thank you so much for being with us.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:23.970
Walk us through the significance

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.038
of these explosions

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.740
happening in Beirut, and specifically,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.943
what would give you evidence

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.111
or what would, suggest to you

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:33.313
that this was, in fact,

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:36.316
an IDF led attack?

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.519
We have nothing that leads to that

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.086
just yet,

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.188
but it's the possibility

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.690
of an IDF attack.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.024
Usually it's not done

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.926
this early, even in the evening

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:48.161
after sunset.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.529
The IDF usually waits

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.264
until the later, hours

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.498
of the of the evening,

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.434
where they can assure that there's no,

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.869
collateral damage on civilian casualties

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.204
when they conduct a strike.

00:03:58.204 --> 00:04:00.106
But when you're talking about explosions,

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:01.407
you don't really know where they come

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:01.841
from.

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:02.342
And again,

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.377
I would suggest, because this is,

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:06.646
Lebanon, this is Beirut,

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.281
that there is the potential

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:09.682
for other types of explosion

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:10.483
in this area.

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:13.486
So you can't conclude anything just yet.

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:14.854
I do, general,

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:15.788
I do want to stop you there

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:16.990
because Israel is now

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.092
Israel is now claiming responsibility

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.693
for this strike in southern Beirut.

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.362
So obviously that's,

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.197
important information and changes.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:25.765
your calculus of how you're seeing

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.267
this explain the significance.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.102
Now that we know that we just literally

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.203
got that in the Israeli

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:32.038
military, saying that it carried out

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:34.040
a targeted strike in southern Beirut.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.210
Well, Brianna, thanks for

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.611
being the scout on the screen line

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:38.978
right there.

00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:40.179
As soon as you've confirmed it,

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.180
then you can talk about it

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.515
a whole lot differently.

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:44.150
The thing that I was about to say,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.085
Ben's reporting about,

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:48.388
you know, promises of not striking

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:50.023
or having limited strikes

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:51.491
doesn't necessarily mean

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.059
they're not going to strike in Beirut.

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.527
There are areas there.

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:56.663
we're in and around the capital

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:59.732
where Hezbollah has centers.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:00.800
Let's just call on that.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.035
Anything from cells

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.303
to intelligence centers

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.204
to military command structures

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:06.739
in and around the area of Beirut,

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:08.141
they've always had that.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.342
So when you're talking

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:11.577
about the potential to limit that

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:13.780
and not go near the capital area

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.081
or near the airport,

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:18.584
I just find that a little bit, and not,

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:20.320
it's a little bit of hyperbole

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.121
from the standpoint of someone

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.289
hoping for the best

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.557
that this wouldn't happen.

00:05:24.557 --> 00:05:27.226
So if it is, and I'll say one more thing,

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:28.494
if it's just us,

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.129
a couple of explosions

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.597
has been has been reported.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:32.832
Two explosions.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:36.636
That is a proportional response so far.

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:38.471
it could get bigger.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:39.672
But when you're talking about

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:40.840
what happened the other day

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.241
with the killing of civilians

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.810
and especially children

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.745
in that, in that, playground

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:47.180
or that soccer field,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.048
you're talking about the potential

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:51.384
for a much greater response by Israel.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:53.686
And again, this could just be step one.

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:56.189
But this is a proportional response,

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.158
not only against Hezbollah, but against,

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:00.193
it's a signal

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.561
to the Lebanese government

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.696
of get control of these terrorist

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:05.098
that are living among you.

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:07.100
And I want to read

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.900
and paraphrase

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.335
a portion of the statement

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:10.636
that we just got from the IDF

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:11.671
taking responsibility.

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:12.138
It says, quote,

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:13.106
the IDF carried out

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:13.906
a targeted strike

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:14.741
in Beirut

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:16.209
on the commander responsible

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.810
for the murder of the children

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.978
in the Golan Heights

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:20.079
and the killing of numerous

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.281
additional Israeli civilians.

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:22.615
General,

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:25.184
I think the concern has been going back

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:26.552
to October 7th,

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:29.622
of a wider regional conflict.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:31.391
the United States

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.825
has repeatedly warned Israel

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:35.428
about any potential attacks

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:37.797
going into Beirut specifically.

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:38.931
But we heard,

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:39.866
John Kirby,

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:40.666
the spokesperson

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:41.968
for the NSC, recently

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.035
say that,

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:45.772
concerns about a wider conflict based on

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:48.307
an Israeli response are exaggerated.

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:49.675
How do you see where

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:51.377
the conflict stands now

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:52.512
versus what this could

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:53.679
potentially lead up to?

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:56.115
Hey.

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:56.549
Well, there were a

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:57.784
couple of actions, Boris,

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:59.352
and you're exactly right.

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:01.354
John Kirby did say all those things.

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:03.523
And I think it was as a warning

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:05.024
to all that,

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:06.292
an Israeli attack

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:07.960
into southern Lebanon,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.463
a ground attack, as it were, or,

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:11.230
an extensive

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.498
air campaign

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:15.067
in Lebanon would be significant,

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:18.571
and it would not be to Israel's advantage

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:20.973
because it would open up a second front

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:22.008
while they're continuing

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:23.709
with their actions in Gaza.

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:25.011
But,

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:27.280
truthfully, Israel has to respond

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.549
to that kind of attack from Lebanon.

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:32.118
So, again, a proportional response

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.120
versus a ground incursion

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.388
of southern Lebanon,

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:35.922
or either

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:37.623
a massive airstrike

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:38.858
or an air campaign

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:40.259
against various targets

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:41.327
inside of Lebanon.

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:41.861
And again,

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.896
it's early yet that could occur.

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:45.798
More strikes could be conducted.

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.266
But this is a signal

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:48.901
if the Israeli government

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.736
and the Israeli Defense Forces say

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:52.538
it was a kinetic strike

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:54.774
against an identified target

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:55.808
of an individual

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:57.109
that conducted the command

00:07:57.109 --> 00:07:59.745
and control of that strike into,

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:02.548
into Israel a few days ago.

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:05.084
I think we're seeing a good thing.

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:05.885
It's it's

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:06.619
something that

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:07.920
that I was talking to

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.155
CNN on Saturday

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.791
saying it would be devastating for Israel

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:12.692
to open a second

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:14.861
front with a major ground incursion

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.496
or a massive air campaign.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.464
And it appears, at least so far,

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:20.366
that they've limited their strikes

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:23.636
to specifically the target that,

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:25.071
was the commander of

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:25.872
of the strike

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.406
that occurred the other day.

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:27.640
Yeah.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.241
general,

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:29.475
if you could stand by for us,

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:30.209
we'll come back to you.

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:31.177
I do want to bring in

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.745
Colorado Congressman Jason Crow,

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:34.347
who we had stick around,

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.581
with us as we got word of this

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:36.549
news, is a former Army

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.750
Ranger is also on the House,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.619
foreign affairs and Intel committees.

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:40.820
As we get word of this,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.921
a targeted strike.

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:42.822
Israel says

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:44.323
Israeli military says

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:45.958
on this Hezbollah commander

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:46.592
that they say,

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:47.860
was behind

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.729
this attack that killed 12 children

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:50.963
in northern Israel.

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:51.597
What are you

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:52.632
what are your thoughts

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:53.766
as you see this news?

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:55.601
Well, Israel absolutely has a right

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:57.436
and I'd even say an obligation

00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:58.871
to respond to this attack

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:01.707
that killed 12 children by Hezbollah.

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:02.742
But why do we talk about

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:04.544
issues of proportionality

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:05.545
is that it goes directly

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.412
to the concern

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:07.613
about escalation

00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:08.314
and amount of talk

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:10.583
about why escalation in this case

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.552
is a is a larger concern

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.453
than maybe it has been in the past.

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:16.055
what we have to do is we have to zoom out

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.256
and talk about Iran.

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:19.125
Iran works

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.060
through these regional proxies,

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.328
these proxy forces.

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:23.863
Right? Hamas is one of them.

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:25.998
Hezbollah is one of them, the Houthis.

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:27.333
They they have other militias

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:28.968
and forces throughout the Middle East.

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:30.970
But Hezbollah is the largest

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.138
and the most capable

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:34.240
of all of those proxy forces. Right.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.142
So the concern about escalation

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:37.310
is the most acute

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.945
when we're talking about Hezbollah.

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:39.579
Right.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.981
The thing that could lead to a larger

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:42.782
regional war

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:44.050
is if Hezbollah opens up

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.117
a northern front,

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:46.652
they have far more rockets

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:47.954
fire more personnel,

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:50.022
far more sophisticated weaponry

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:51.958
and more capability across the board.

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.726
And that could be very devastating

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:54.393
in the North.

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:55.962
And Hezbollah has vowed that

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:57.463
depending on the Israeli response,

00:09:57.463 --> 00:09:58.297
they wouldn't go to war

00:09:58.297 --> 00:09:59.365
with Israel alone.

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:00.032
To your point,

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:02.001
it would be these Iranian backed groups.
