00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.001
Across the U.S.

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.502
this weekend, large crowds

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:04.254
of pro-Palestinian protesters

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:05.255
took to city streets

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:07.424
to call for a cease fire.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:08.800
And on Capitol Hill Friday,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.844
dozens of activists were arrested

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.178
after entering the offices

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.513
of several senators.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:14.556
One of those senators

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:15.724
is here with me now,

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.892
independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:18.226
Senator,

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:19.644
thank you so much for joining me

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:20.520
this morning.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.523
Four weeks ago, more than 1400 Israelis,

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:24.774
mostly civilians,

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.109
were slaughtered in their homes

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.444
and at a festival.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:28.361
You've been critical

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.697
of Israel's response recently.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.032
How do you think Israel

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.826
should be responding?

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:36.453
Well, this is what you got.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.079
So I think clear to most people

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.955
what combusted.

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:39.581
And Hamas

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.082
is an awful

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.375
terrorist organization

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.251
is they slaughtered

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:45.462
1400 people in cold blood.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:48.131
Israel has a right to defend itself.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.300
But what Israel does not, in my view,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.803
have a right to do is to kill thousands

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:55.013
and thousands

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:57.932
of innocent men, women and children

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:01.478
who had nothing to do with that attack.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.147
So the immediate concern for my mind

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.483
is that we have got to stop the bombing.

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:10.028
Now, you had six had over 600,000

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.446
people pushed out of their homes.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:12.363
Where are they going?

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:14.657
You're saying in the United Nations

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.451
facilities overcrowded,

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.286
the sound of water, the sound of food,

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:20.413
the sound of medicine, not enough fuel.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.290
You've got a humanitarian disaster

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.209
that has to be dealt with right now.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.503
So, Senator. The the issue.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:27.212
I'm sorry, Go ahead.

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:30.173
No, please go. Ahead, Don. Okay. So

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.424
what you're saying about

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:32.050
what you're saying

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.302
about the lack of food and water

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:35.637
and so forth,

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:38.056
I think that most people in the West,

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:38.807
certainly the U.S.

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.266
believes that that is

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.393
because Hamas is hoarding it.

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:44.104
And the other question is,

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.314
how does Israel it is. Not just.

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:48.858
How does Israel destroy Hamas.

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:50.026
With that?

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:51.069
Hamas is burning it.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.946
They are. It's more than that.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.740
That's what Israeli's policy has been.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.618
Okay. So combination of fact.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:01:59.536
Let's get to the other

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:00.578
let's get to the other point

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:01.204
that you made,

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.497
which is really the key one,

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.666
which is innocent civilians dying.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:08.419
And they are how should his Israel

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.296
destroy Hamas

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.799
post attack on these innocent civilians

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:13.591
in Israel

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:17.053
without hurting killing innocent men,

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:17.887
women and children

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.890
when a Hamas is hiding behind them

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.559
and putting them in danger?

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:24.227
How does that work?

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:27.355
Well, that is exactly the right question

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:27.897
to be asked,

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:29.107
the military experts,

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.109
of which I am not one.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.819
But clearly, yes,

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.154
they have Israel's right

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.029
to defend itself.

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.949
Hamas has sworn that's what its goal is.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.033
It's to destroy Israel.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:40.368
They've got to deal with that.

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.495
But there's got to be a better way

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.955
than killing thousands of men,

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:44.706
women and children.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.709
So, once again, the immediate concern is

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:48.918
you've got to

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:50.837
have a pause in the bombing.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:51.754
You've got to take care

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:53.214
of the immediate disaster.

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:54.799
Israel has got to change your charging.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.217
Let me just say this.

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:57.010
The United States

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.969
of America provides

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.806
$3.8 billion every year to Israel.

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:02.891
We have a right.

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.017
Israel can do what they want.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.351
They're an independent country.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.061
But we have a right to say sorry.

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.230
You need a new military strategy.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.481
Go after Hamas.

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.691
But that means

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.568
but do not kill innocent

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.236
men, women and children.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:16.529
You mentioned money.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.323
There is going to be a measure

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:21.701
before you relatively soon for the House

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.954
passed 14 more than $14 billion.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.623
And there is going to be

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:26.915
at least

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.334
some version of that in the Senate.

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:30.793
Will you support that?

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:32.086
Or were you put conditions on?

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:32.712
Well, we'll do it.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:33.379
The bill will

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.505
see what the bill looks like.

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:35.798
But I think it's terribly important

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:37.884
that as we debate that the Saudis will

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:38.343
you want

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:38.801
this money,

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:39.928
you've got to change

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.596
your military strategy.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:43.890
The other point is we have to give hope

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.308
to the Palestinian people.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:46.059
They are living.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.227
They were living before

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.144
October 17,

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:51.564
the disastrous situation in Gaza at 75%.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.983
Youth unemployment, massive poverty.

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:55.818
And right now in Israel,

00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:57.654
you're having the Netanyahu government,

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.405
an extreme right wing government

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.198
with racist.

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:01.032
The board

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.325
trying to make it impossible

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.202
for a two state solution

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:04.994
in the West Bank.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.496
They're killing settlers there.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:07.288
So what we need

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:08.665
is the world to come together

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:09.999
to give hope to the Palestinians.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.002
We need a two state solution,

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:14.170
and we need to have

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.214
many of the very wealthy

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.423
countries in the region,

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.592
the United Arab Republic,

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.052
Saudi Arabia, Qatar.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.554
They are extraordinarily wealthy.

00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:25.807
The United States work for the community

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.600
in order to provide some hope

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.352
and decency of freedom

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.770
to the Palestinian people,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.772
which Hamas will have to do.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.565
I just you're right about that.

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:35.650
They have a lot of money

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.859
and they, to this point,

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:39.028
have not been really willing

00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:41.322
to use that money in that region

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:42.991
to help their fellow Arabs.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:44.158
I want to just clarify

00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:46.119
one thing, Senator, if I might.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:49.122
You support a humanitarian pause in Gaza

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.873
as some of your fellow progressives say

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:51.457
that there should be

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.834
a full on cease fire,

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.043
which would require an agreement

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:56.254
on both sides to halt the fighting.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:57.714
Do you support a cease fire?

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:00.049
And if not, why not?

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.301
Well, I don't know how you

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.303
can have a cease fire

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.304
permanent cease fire

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.556
with an organization like Hamas,

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:09.434
which is dedicated to turmoil

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.435
and chaos

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.645
and destroying the state of Israel.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.439
And I think what the Arab countries

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.606
in the region understand

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:18.359
that Hamas has got to go.

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:19.944
So what we need right now,

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:20.945
the immediate task

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.448
right now is to end the bombing,

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:23.823
to end

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:24.991
the horrific

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.451
humanitarian disaster

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:27.702
that the build go forward

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.455
with the entire world for a two tier

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:31.664
two state

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.041
solution to the crisis

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.419
to give the Palestinian people hope.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.671
Senator Democratic Congresswoman Rashida

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.548
Tlaib released a video on Friday.

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:43.551
I want you to watch part of it.

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:44.135
Mr.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:44.594
President,

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.012
the American people are not with you

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:51.976
on this one.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.066
We will remember in 2024

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:59.150
that last screen

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.026
said Joe Biden

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.361
supported the genocide

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.196
of the Palestinian people.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:03.821
I know you know

00:06:03.821 --> 00:06:05.156
the definition of genocide.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.325
It is defined as a crime

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:08.993
committed with intent

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:10.244
to destroy a national,

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:11.871
ethnic, racial or religious group.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:12.497
Do you think that's

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.791
what Israel is doing here?

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:15.833
What's going on right

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:17.460
now is a horror show.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.629
We don't have to quibble about words.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:20.922
Thousands of men,

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.423
women and children are being killed.

00:06:22.423 --> 00:06:24.592
It has got to end right now.

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.052
And one of the things that concerns

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:26.427
me, Donna,

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:27.512
is there's not been enough

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.222
talk about the right wing

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.556
Republicans are doing right.

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:30.973
They don't want

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:33.059
any aid to go to the Palestinians.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.019
Somebody should be talking about that.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.104
Somebody should be talking about

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:37.188
how Trump wants

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:41.234
to expel Palestinians from this country.

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:42.151
So it's you know,

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:43.778
you can disagree with Joe Biden,

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.279
but on his worst day,

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.572
it'll be 100 times better

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:48.032
where Trump and the right wing.

00:06:48.032 --> 00:06:49.575
So you think that Rashida Tlaib

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:52.203
should save her ire for for Trump

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:53.079
and the right way

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.164
and not for the Democrat.

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:56.958
Rashida is no friend of mine.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.459
Her family comes from Palestine.

00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:59.794
I think she has been shaken,

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.254
as all of us are about.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.797
What goes on is going on

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:03.756
right there, right now.

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:04.173
Yeah,

00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:04.966
we have to address

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.634
that humanitarian crisis.

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:08.636
But if anyone thinks

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:09.971
that Trump is going to be better

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:11.848
than Biden on this issue

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:13.516
or any other issue for that matter,

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:16.018
I think they are sorely mistaken.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.229
And I understand that.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.272
I also understand

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.941
and I know, you know, that words matter.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.569
And I want to ask about what she said.

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:25.361
Look, look,

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.155
we're not words matter,

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:29.198
but what matters more down to Israel

00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:31.617
have a horrible humanitarian disaster

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:33.035
that has to be dealt with right now.

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:34.787
You call it whatever you want to call it.

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:35.872
It has to be dealt with.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:36.789
Women and children

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:39.625
cannot be bombed with £2,000 bombs.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:40.543
And we need the entire.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:42.837
When she says from the river to the sea,

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.338
when she says from the river to the sea,

00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:48.301
which the ADL says is anti-Semitic,

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.927
she says it's aspirational,

00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:52.430
but the ADL says it is anti-Semitic.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.306
Do you want her to stop

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.891
using terms like that

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.893
when others and others.

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.352
Are going down?

00:07:58.352 --> 00:08:00.438
You know what I want to know else

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:01.355
this is what

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:03.107
President Obama just said the other day,

00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:04.358
I think quite correctly.

00:08:04.358 --> 00:08:05.735
And we all got to deal with this

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.820
enormously complex issue

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.531
and slogans like the River to the Sea.

00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:10.823
If the

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:12.700
if that means the destruction of Israel,

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.868
that's not going to work.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.286
People are saying Israel, right.

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:17.288
A wrong way for you all the way.

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:18.581
That's not going to work.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.458
This is a horrendously complex

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.210
that you've got a right wing government

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:22.835
in Israel

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.337
which is racist

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.379
and the people, by the way,

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:26.756
the good news is last poll

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:27.256
I saw,

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:29.383
only 18% of the people of Israel

00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:31.385
want Netanyahu to stay in office.

00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:32.678
I hope they get rid of him.

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.180
I hope they put in a government

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.139
which understands

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:36.516
the severity of the crisis

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.600
and can help us move toward

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.601
a two tier state.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:39.852
Senator, on the other hand,

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:41.103
in terms of Hamas,

00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:42.939
you got a terrorist organization

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.398
that cannot be trusted for a minute.

00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:46.359
This is, as President Obama said,

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.361
a very complex issue.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.154
Senator, real quick and you're

00:08:50.154 --> 00:08:51.822
you're really alluding to this in your

00:08:51.822 --> 00:08:53.950
in your answers and our discussion here.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.660
You really are in a unique position,

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.953
maybe even a difficult one,

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:57.995
because you're a leading

00:08:57.995 --> 00:09:00.915
progressive voice in American politics

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.416
and you're also Jewish

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:03.543
and you have family

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.795
who died in the Holocaust.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.881
How difficult is this for you?

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:10.049
This is like this is

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.676
nothing to do with me, Don.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.928
What this is, is

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:14.804
as a nation,

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:17.014
we are living now, in my view,

00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:18.432
for a more difficult moment

00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:20.643
than we have lived in my lifetime.

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.228
You know, people are worried about

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:23.771
they've had the pandemic, worried

00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:24.647
about climate change,

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.482
worried about the attacks on democracy.

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:29.694
Our health care system is is collapsing.

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.362
And we have artificial information

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:32.238
which is going to,

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.864
you know, make radical changes

00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:34.490
to the economy.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.200
You've got a crime all over this country.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.243
People are worried.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:37.827
The concern

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:38.869
all that I am begging

00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:40.454
people is understand

00:09:40.454 --> 00:09:42.081
slogans are not going to do it.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:43.874
Social media is not going to do it.

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.501
We need a serious discussion

00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:46.961
of how the hell we got out of this

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:48.254
difficult situation.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.256
Maintain democracy, bring peace

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.049
to the world,

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.426
and it ain't easy.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.802
But slogans are not going to do it

00:09:54.802 --> 00:09:56.554
on any side.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.055
Senator, thank you so much for your time

00:09:58.055 --> 00:09:58.723
this morning.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:01.267
I really appreciate it.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:01.809
Thank you, Don.
