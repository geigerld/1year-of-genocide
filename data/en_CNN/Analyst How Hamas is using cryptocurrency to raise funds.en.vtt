00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.875
Investigators in the

00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:02.002
US and around the world

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:03.878
have identified a revenue source

00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:06.131
being exploited by Hamas online

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:07.007
donors offering

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.009
support in cryptocurrency.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.760
Now, even before Hamas launched

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.554
a surprise attack on Israel, US

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.014
officials had been probing

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.557
the group's use of cryptocurrency

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.559
through alleged money launderers.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.268
Hamas's use

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.811
of digital currency represents

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:20.854
just one of the many ways

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:21.938
the terrorist organization

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:23.106
has sought to raise funds

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.816
while evading sanctions.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.609
Hamas and other terrorist groups

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.193
have used

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.361
Facebook and acts

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.863
to publicly post their crypto

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.407
wallet addresses asking for donations.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:33.283
That's according to a report

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.118
by US authorities.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:35.410
All right.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.871
Joining me now is military man seeking

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:41.416
CEO of the crypto analytics software firm

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:42.459
Beto O'Rourke.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:43.918
Thanks so much for being here with us.

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:46.755
So just first, how significant

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.131
a role is crypto in

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:52.260
terms of funding Hamas?

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:54.095
Well, from our

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:57.015
side, we've analyzed and studied deeply

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:57.515
the addresses

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.725
belonging to companies

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.643
controlled by Hamas,

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:02.729
as indicated in two orders

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.023
15, 22 and 1923.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.107
It's public.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:09.694
So the total amount of almost $41

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:12.614
million was received at this addresses.

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:15.158
And this is a total to turn over

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:15.909
all the addresses

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.912
listed in to previous seizure orders

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:22.665
and this was this significant amount

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:26.252
received from September 2021

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.837
and April 2024.

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:29.672
So over four years,

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:30.882
with the majority accounts

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:31.424
being received

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:35.595
between December 2022 and April 2023.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.680
So yes, all the things.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.556
So, so that's a lot.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.391
But obviously it could be a lot more

00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:41.518
that we don't know about.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.061
So how exactly does it work?

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.646
How do they they get the money?

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:45.105
I understand

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.107
they fundraise on social media.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.485
I mean, how does that all work?

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.445
So they gather

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.197
different, different social media

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:55.865
and putting the

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.700
different wallets, addresses

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.036
and then they're collecting

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.204
money, I mean, crypto

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.831
from all over the world.

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:06.668
And then they are using intermediary

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:08.461
addresses from a different kind

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.046
of exchanges around the world

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:11.172
and then collecting them

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:15.051
into several wallets and and funds.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.512
This means they are laundering money

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:18.680
using crypto.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.890
Well, it happens, unfortunately.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.644
Is it untraceable in terms of the people

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:28.106
who are who are donating this money?

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:28.898
Almost.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:29.649
So in case

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:33.653
if somebody say in investing or donating,

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.321
terrorists are going to be organizations

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.158
directly via centralized exchanges.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.910
It's possible, but nobody is doing that.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.328
So they are actually

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.371
they are usually

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.623
using decentralized wallets

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:47.333
and non-custodial wallets

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:48.459
and then

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.045
those organizations are laundering money

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:53.173
to avoid such.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.048
So just closing.

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:55.758
So it's almost impossible.

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:56.050
Yeah.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.135
So I mean, we're talking about,

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:57.886
you know, people

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.596
donating money on social media,

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.598
but in terms of these intermediaries

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:02.515
and so on, I mean, what

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:07.395
what role does Iran play here?

00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:08.855
You mean centralized exchanges and so

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.273
on, so

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:11.649
we can determine the precise

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:12.650
origin of the funds.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.612
So whether they were directly sent from

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:16.905
from other terrorist groups

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.823
or source from donations, etc..

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:20.617
But however, our investigation

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.327
revealed that a significant portion

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:22.660
of this

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.620
funds primarily

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.456
originated from cryptocurrency exchanges.

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:28.166
Some of them are really popular,

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.251
some of them are

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.628
have Russia origin,

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.630
but it's not connected with Russia.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.881
So because it's not

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.466
it's not, you know, exchanges,

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.676
they are not aiming to help terrorists.

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:40.637
That's the most important thing here.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.139
But in some of the cases, they are blind

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.641
and they cannot understand

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:45.433
what really happened.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:50.396
And early and sometimes weeks or months

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:51.314
should be passed

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:54.275
till the exchanges are revealing

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.027
such bad things happening.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.946
So it's not it's not online.

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.447
So time should pass.

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.532
And now we may see that

00:04:01.532 --> 00:04:04.160
some of the exchanges fall under such bad

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.370
circumstance in terms of money

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.580
laundering and terrorist financing.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.459
So, I mean, it sounds very hard to stop.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.461
I mean, what more can be done to

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:14.879
to cut off this source

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.507
of funding for Hamas?

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.050
Yeah, that's the good question.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.053
I mean, crypto is still in the gray zone,

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:25.056
but things that thankfully for you,

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.891
you know, international anti-money

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:27.809
and anti-money

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.852
laundering measures are coming.

00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:31.813
And because of legislation

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.816
helping to reveal the source of funds,

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.776
the dirty money in crypto,

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.737
it goes more and more better to reveal.

00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:41.322
And from my perspective,

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.449
the best way is to use KYC.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.492
AML measures

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.828
in any kind of wallets exchanges

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.831
and to to put exchanges,

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.541
put exchanges attention on that.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.001
And,

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.211
you know, after all, crypto is not about

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.587
crime, is not about terrorist

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:58.631
organizations, financing, etc.,

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.092
but anybody should be aware of it

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.177
because of where we are.

00:05:03.177 --> 00:05:03.886
So it happens

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:04.929
and everybody should pay

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:06.431
a lot of attention on it.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.599
Yeah, it's it's very complex

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.101
for most of us to untangle,

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:11.894
but really appreciate

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:12.770
getting your insights

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.272
on this Dmitri magic.

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:16.399
And thank you so much.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:16.816
Thanks.
