We were very innocent.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:45.932
You understand

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.101

You were hearing

shotgun shots and a lot of screa

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.888
I understand that there was no o

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:10.056

You had a lot of people, a lot o

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.826
And that moment when you're sitt

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:16.596
are the four of you and they're 

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.631
why you even imagine how you fel

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.667
I didn't believe that it happene

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.804
And they the the owner of the ho

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.840

And for one hour, we are in succ

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.251
not to let them go into the

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:39.385
to the safety of them,

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.421
but they are screaming all over

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.189
and you know,

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.559

and go, was black

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.204
and after 10 minutes they

00:03:58.204 --> 00:04:00.006
succeeded to open the window

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:01.808
to the door of the safety room

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:05.245
and ask for the and that's to su

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:08.047
because meanwhile we are

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.182
hiding in the closet.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.384
So they didn't know that we are 

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:14.387
but 2 minutes after they taken u

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.523

that they are going to lose thei

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.605
for nothing

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:35.775

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.076
It was

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.878
I was so sad that

00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:41.314
I'm probably going to die

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:44.217
for nothing because I didn't do 

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:46.419
I'm just maybe going to kill

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.187
because I'm Jewish.

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:50.290
Okay. At least ten,

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:52.992
ten terrorists taking two

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:54.794

from where

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.465
I have this courage to do what I

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:02.435
but the the

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:03.169

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.211
We don't want to kill you.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:14.380
We just want to take you through

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:17.550
And he tells me, he asked me,

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:20.053
you have friends from the police

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:21.254

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:23.122
And I said to him, Yeah.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:25.758
So he told me, so let's call one

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.095
So I told him my phone is still 

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:29.629
I'm mad at you.

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.631
Technically, I don't have my pho

00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:33.333

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.468
And then he bring another phone,

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:36.903
we called 109.

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:37.904
Well, while

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:39.772
the police is answering

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:41.341
and I'm talking is them,

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:43.242
I'm talking enable I'm telling m

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:44.711
Hello, my name is Yasmin.

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:49.182
I'm in Kibbutz Marie and we kidn

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:51.517

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.555
Please come.

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.323
Why did they want the police to 

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:59.125
They want to kidnap.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:00.493
That's that's what's funny.

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:03.029
They saw the the roads

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.264
the army is there,

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:06.833
so they want to stay alive.

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.101
So they thought that

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:10.136
if they took you to Gaza,

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:12.605
the IDF would could kill them.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:14.073
Yeah, if the IDF wasn't there.

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:15.208
But they didn't know. Yeah.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.543
After 2 hours, the police

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:19.579

I understand that I'm going to d

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:05.858

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:08.594
It's not possible to get a life

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:09.962
in this situation

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:15.001
and I'm starting to cry for myse

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:17.770
And the commander is, you know,

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:19.338
next to me.

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:20.673
But we have

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:22.975

He

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.051
he took all the time

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:33.986
in the phone in Arabic today.

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:34.620
I know that

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:38.191
and ask for surrender.

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:41.394
And because I was calling to the

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.037
put your clothes out.

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:52.905
And take 4 minutes.

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:56.175
He put out of both of us

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.211
was naked,

00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:59.545
and he's going with me

00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:01.247
slowly to the police and he's.

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:02.415
How does he go with you?

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:02.849
How is he?

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.852
He he hugged me in the back like

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:06.686
Okay.

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.888
It's like a like a your shield.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:11.357
I'm a shield. Yeah. Human shield

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:14.160
And he goes me to metal from the

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.128
but it's taken us for 4 minutes.

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:18.231
They are everybody's.

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:19.499
And I'm telling

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.466
don't you don't shoot

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:21.767
because this is the Hamas do tha

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:22.502
and do they see him?

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.871
Then they see him and they

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:27.373
they told him that they will,

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.075
if we will, going to do this.

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:30.042
They will show them.

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:31.677
But they didn't and they didn't 

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:33.980
Yeah, they you'll never know why

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:36.115
Yeah, because I know no one.

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:37.950
They stayed alive

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.586
and then we are two metal from t

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:44.724
and 20 policemen from Israel.

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:47.126
He pushed me a little bit.

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:50.496
I'm running to the police he got

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:53.199
and I'm safe.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.901
But I understand that my boyfrie

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:56.202
and the others are still

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.837
there is for the terrorists

00:08:57.837 --> 00:08:59.572
because just once around

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:02.341
5:00 the police don't understand

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.442
the big

00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:04.243
they had no idea

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:05.478
it 5:00 in the afternoon.

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:07.246
They have no idea already.

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:10.316
They think that I am maybe you k

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.184
I don't understand.

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:12.885
I'm telling them

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.587
no the 40

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:17.156
they tell me look at us, we are 

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.492
I'm telling there are more from 

00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:20.826
and they don't believe me.

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:21.994
So did you know that the

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.162
that the terrorists had shot.

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:25.197
I mean I didn't know in this,

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:26.165
in this time

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:28.234
I have a hope that Al still aliv

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.336
You for three days. Yeah, for a 

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:32.438
We are. Yeah. We helped if he wa

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.740
But then Tuesday,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.842
three days after the attack, the

00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:38.945
and they

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:41.347
have in the last month and that'

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.517
And he was dead and everybody wa

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.052
I think it's a dream

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:48.888
that maybe I'm going to wake up.

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:52.024
I don't understand it.

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:52.592
Yes.

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:54.360
You know, some of them say,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:54.727
yeah,

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:55.828
I know the

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.063
I know the information,

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:58.831
but I don't feel the information

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.900
I know is there, but I.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.169
I think it's okay.

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:05.237
You can't feel yet, do you? I do

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.739
You don't have the.

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:08.741
Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:10.743
Sometimes they have them emotion

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:13.112
but most of the time I live in a

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:15.414
But I know I mean, I agree it's 

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.116
because it's weird.

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:19.652
For me, that is he's gun

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:20.920
he was younger than me.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.655
I'm 44 and these 37.

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:23.923
So it's weird to me

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:27.393
that you want to get my age toda

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:29.095
You understand he'll never be 44

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:31.430
Yeah. And never be 40.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.666
It's very strange.

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.401
So many stories.

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:36.936
Horrific stories. Right.

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:38.771
Wow. That closet door.

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:40.473
How did they not kill you.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.708
I so I think I have an answer.

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:43.409
Yeah.

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:44.977
Also in the Hamas

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:46.646
there are a lot kind of people,

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:50.116
they are radical people and they

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:52.985
you know, and

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:55.521
moderate. Yeah.

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:57.790
And I think and I understand

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:01.460
after the situation that the com

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.029
that surrounded

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:05.765
that he can see the silence is

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:09.035
know that radical.

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:11.370
Exactly.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.304
And there are

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:13.339
I know after

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:14.140
the police told me

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.242
that there are two commando ther

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:19.078
that are very radical that that 

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.313
nobody is getting out.

00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:23.883
We are going back to us, to Gaza

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:26.752
with everybody lives their exist

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:27.753
Right.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.522
I mean, because some of them are

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.791
most of them are children, twent

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:33.693
Okay.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:35.695
They are afraid to die

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.631
and they want to get to Gaza wit

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:40.433
You could tell that they

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.835
they were also afraid. Yeah. Yea

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:45.337
Now, humans they are humans.

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:46.772
They are fed. Yes.

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:47.640
I mean, what

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.110
and they said you can't necessar

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.912
even feel sometimes.

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:53.446
Yeah.

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.815
You have children. Yeah.

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:56.849
Thank God for that.

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.017
I lost

00:11:58.017 --> 00:11:59.518
when I was in the closet

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:00.753
because you need to understand

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:02.655
we are in one hour.

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:04.123
That's right.

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:06.726
It was this was the mosque.

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:08.094
And space is time.

00:12:08.094 --> 00:12:08.494
Yeah,

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:10.362
we were like this, holding us

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:11.130
hands, and

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.665
we are very sweat

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:15.034
because it was hot in the closet

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:17.536
and we are holding our hands.

00:12:17.536 --> 00:12:20.072
And then I decide to write my

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:23.008
children a, you know, last word.

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:26.979
And I may well tell my girls I l

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:28.814
And probably going to die.

00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:31.650
So be safe. Be careful.

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:33.219
Stay.

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:34.520
Swee It's very

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.454
important for me

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:38.023
that my three children will stay

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:39.859
And now when you're with your

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:41.560
your youngest child, your son.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.294
Yeah,

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:43.262
we we're talking

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:44.830
with children of the same age.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.397
Yeah.

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:48.167
That he wrote you and you and kn

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:48.968

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:49.235
Yeah.

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:50.836
My son told him

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:52.204
that he wants to take me

00:12:52.204 --> 00:12:54.640
along with that and sister to th

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.275
and he wants to give us somethin

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.644
and he wants two sentences.

00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:00.012
I hope he will be happy.

00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:02.114
And please don't be sad anymore.

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:03.783

And the Italian
