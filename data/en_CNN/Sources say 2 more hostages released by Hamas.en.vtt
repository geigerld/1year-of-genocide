00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:00.208
We are

00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:01.793
beginning with breaking news

00:00:01.793 --> 00:00:03.378
in the Israel-Hamas war.

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:05.338
Sources telling CNN

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:06.548
that the terror group Hamas

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:08.383
has released two more hostages

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:09.217
who are believed to

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:13.096
be Israeli citizens Anderson.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:13.763
Yes, you know,

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:15.974
two Americans were released last week.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:16.433
Sources

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:17.976
also saying that today's release

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:18.560
is happening

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.437
with the help of officials from Qatar

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.105
who are involved in the other release,

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.607
as well as well as Egypt this time.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.192
CNN chief national security correspondent

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:26.860
Alex Marquardt

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.069
joins us with some details,

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.654
along with CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:30.822
Caitlin, let's start with you.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.240
What exactly do we know?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.616
Obviously, we have some information

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:34.993
that we are not giving out

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.328
until all of this is confirmed,

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.163
because this is still

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.456
a very fluid situation.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:39.956
They are not in

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.416
Israel, is my understanding.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:41.833
Right.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.585
It's an incredibly fluid situation.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:44.669
And so we are holding off

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:45.587
on some of the details

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:46.463
while we run those down,

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:47.380
because this is a very

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.381
sensitive situation.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.008
We want to make sure we get everything

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:50.800
completely right.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.843
But what we do know

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:53.261
is that two more hostages

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:55.138
have been released by Hamas.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:55.805
We are told

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:56.973
I'm told that they're not actually

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:58.099
in the custody

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:59.934
of the Israeli government yet,

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:01.061
but that they are on the way there

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:01.603
right now.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.813
And so that is part of the sensitivity

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:04.939
around this reporting

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:05.899
about these hostages.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.234
Obviously, given their situation.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.277
But this is significant.

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:10.445
I am told that they are both

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.113
two female hostages

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:13.364
that have been released.

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:14.949
They, of course, would be only the third

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.826
and the fourth hostages in total

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:18.244
to be released in the hundreds

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.037
That we do believe,

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.455
according to the IDF,

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.457
that Hamas has in their custody

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:23.416
at this moment.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:24.209
And so what we are

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.919
still trying to figure out, Anderson, is

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.670
whether or not they are dual citizens.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.380
We do know they are Israeli citizens,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.299
but maybe they have dual nationalities,

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:31.925
as we've seen

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.301
with a lot of these hostages

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:33.676
and the people

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:35.345
who were abducted by Hamas.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:36.304
So those are details

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:37.847
that we are still trying to figure out.

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.849
But it does appear that this came about

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.434
from some quiet mediation

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.060
that was happening

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.312
behind the scenes with the Egyptian

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:45.313
and Qatar governments

00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:46.481
that have been obviously playing

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:47.857
a really significant role

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:49.651
in trying to get these hostages

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.110
released,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.820
because Israel has made very clear

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.946
from all officials

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.948
that they are not personally negotiating

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.032
with Hamas

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:57.992
for the release of these hostages.

00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.494
And I do think this is a big part

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:00.453
of what we are seeing here

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:01.871
when it comes to the timing of what

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:02.997
everyone is waiting to happen

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:04.332
next in Gaza,

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:05.125
which is that

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.417
Israeli ground invasion

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:06.835
that we know

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:07.919
officials have said

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.003
and telegraphed quite

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:10.839
clearly is expected to come.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.382
There have been discussions with U.S.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:13.758
officials, with other government

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:15.635
officials about holding off on that

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.345
until more of these negotiations

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.389
for these hostages can happen.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.181
And so right now,

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.474
what we are working to confirm

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.893
is the identities of these two hostages,

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:25.270
where exactly they are now.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.687
And once

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:28.314
they get into the custody of the IDF,

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.023
which, Anderson,

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:29.858
as you know, is

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:31.359
what happened with those two hostages

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.486
last week, they came to the Gaza border.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:33.736
They were

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.530
then given over to the IDF

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.532
who brought them to a military base

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.117
first in central Israel.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:39.909
That's where they greeted

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.035
their parents before

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:42.537
having those medical checkups

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.372
and obviously kind of debriefings

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:47.041
of what they've been going through.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.126
Yeah, And Alex, there's

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.170
usually this interim step right handed.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.838
Usually Hamas,

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:52.839
wherever it's holding them,

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.674
hands them over to the representatives

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.550
of the international community,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.885
the Red Cross,

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.178
and then they make that transfer

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:01.181
to two IDF officials.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.473
These are two.

00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:03.558
There were two that

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.143
the remains who we talked about

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:06.644
last week.

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.646
Let's talk about the timing of this.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.356
Clearly,

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:13.234
Hamas has many captives in their custody.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.278
They could release all of them

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.197
if they wanted to.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.199
They are releasing them two by two.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.825
What does that tell you?

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:22.410
Well, it's certainly good news.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.369
No one's going to tell you

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.245
otherwise, Anderson.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:26.706
This is fantastic for those families

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.082
as well as for the Russians

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:29.417
who saw two of their family members

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:30.335
come back on Friday.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.337
But no doubt, Anderson,

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:33.254
whether it's the U.S.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:34.422
or Israel or Qatar,

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.715
which is leading these negotiations

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:36.591
along with Egypt.

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:37.342
They would like to see

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:38.468
much bigger numbers.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:38.676
I mean,

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:40.386
we heard from the IDF earlier today

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.054
that there are

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.807
some 222 hostages who are in custody.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.478
So we certainly don't want to see, you

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:49.062
know, this

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:52.148
these hostages coming out two by two.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.274
The the the

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:53.983
Qataris are

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:54.609
now pushing

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.860
for much bigger numbers,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.030
say dozens or scores of the civilians

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.822
of the foreigners

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:02.408
who are still in custody.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.369
In terms of the mechanics, Anderson,

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:05.203
you know, obviously,

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.996
Hamas is not going to come face

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:08.831
to face with Israeli officials

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.667
as they hand over prisoners.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:11.834
So you have the U.N.,

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:13.586
which operates independently inside Gaza.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.505
You have the Red Cross, which operates

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.048
fairly independently inside Gaza.

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.341
And so what has happened today,

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.634
we understand, as like

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:20.468
it did on Friday,

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:22.136
the same mechanism of Hamas

00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:23.805
handing these two captives

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.598
over to the Red Cross.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:25.890
They will

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.557
then be taken

00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:28.059
to somewhere along the border.

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.102
We don't know where.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.937
There are two formal

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.856
large border crossings in southern Gaza.

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:34.691
One goes into Egypt,

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:35.650
one goes into Israel.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.734
But frankly,

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:37.193
there are

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:38.194
there are a number of places

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.029
all along that fence line

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:41.823
where you are seeing today

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.616
all of those Israeli troops

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.784
where the Red Cross could

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.119
then hand those two Israeli

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.954
women over to the IDF,

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.163
as Caitlin mentioned.

00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:49.455
They would

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.207
then likely be taken to a military base

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:52.417
to get checked up to make sure

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.793
that they're okay.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:54.877
Hamas has claimed

00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:56.254
that the previous release

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.131
was for humanitarian reasons.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.173
It's not clear

00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:02.176
what shape the run on women are in.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:03.553
But we do understand

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.680
from the White House today that the U.S.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.347
that U.S.

00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:07.515
officials have debriefed

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.058
or are going to debrief

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:10.601
the two Americans

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:11.477
to gather intelligence,

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:12.979
to get a sense of where they were

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.105
held, how they were held,

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.398
and any other kind of information

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.066
that they could glean

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:17.859
from those two women.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:18.651
But, Anderson, certainly

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.195
the bottom line here is that

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:22.071
everyone wants to see

00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:24.699
a lot more hostages being released.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.200
And that is why there is this pressure

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.285
on the Israeli government

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.161
to delay their incursion

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.496
into Gaza Anderson.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.539
Yeah, and the international

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.874
Committee of the Red Cross has

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.625
has repeatedly requested access

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:37.795
to all the hostages who remain in Gaza.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.255
They have not been allowed access.

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.632
They've also requested proof of life.

00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:44.052
Last we heard, they had not received

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:44.927
any of that

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:46.929
from from those holding them

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:48.723
as long as jihad or Hamas.
