also one of the worst terrorist attacks on the American people in recent times as well. &gt;&gt; Joining me now is CNN military analyst general Wesley Clark. So general, first I'm gonna talk to you about what's going on at the border, but before that, can you just talk about the significance of these two very important U.S. Naval carriers, going into the region, and what is it's meant to do? &gt;&gt; Those two aaft carriers and the flotilla that goes with him, you have about 20 ships, you have a tremendous capacity for not only aircraft on each acre craft carrier, but the escorts, and what they can do in the way of tomahawk missiles, and other things. And so, there is a warning, they're there is a deterrent to Iran. Keep your hands off, stay out of it, or else. Because the general thinking is that, Hezbollah is not going to go -- without Iran saying go ahead. This ties Iran in directly into the assault. On the other hand, you can be sure that Iran is watching this. They're calculating, they're wondering whether the Israelis are going to get so bogged down in gaza, be so -- tarnished in world opinion, that they could justify releasing Hezbollah, and go for the finish of Israel. There is going to be that kind of thinking going on, in Tehran. Those two aircraft carriers are really important to stop that kind of thought. &gt;&gt; You want -- it is a deterrence. We have definitely heard some this morning, in interviews, not ruling out the notion of U.S. Troops being involved. I think it's important to put that into context. Certainly does not seem as though the U.S. Is going to get involved in a very active way with U.S. Troops in this conflicts. The discuss it is -- about how to get American hostages out. &gt;&gt; That's right, and I'm sure we've got a joint plan going on with Israelis. If we could locate the hostages, if it's possible to pull off an extraction mission, sure we would work with the Israelis to do that. There's also the possibility of those U.S. Forces in the north actually having to engage, should Hezbollah decide to launch its hundred 50,000 rockets against Israel. And Iran should be under no illusions. Those ships are not just there for show, those ships are ready to go and on the presidential order they could go. As president Biden said, we're 100 percent committed to Israel were not going to allow the destruction of Israel. &gt;&gt; I really want to get your perspective on what is happening inside gaza. And Thea that, according to the white house, hamas, they're the ones who stopped Americans from getting into Egypt, via the rafah border crossing. We're talking about Palestinians, we're talking in this case about Americans who are inside gaza. These are civilians. What does it tell you, first of all, that crossing was closed, and what is your sense of why this really happened. We're showing our viewers a map of the area we're talking about. Now &gt;&gt; Dana, we look at this a as a two phase -- show how powerful you are, and then fall back into gaza, and use civilian population as a shield, and then attack Israel on the stage of world opinion, and cause Israel to look like an evil force that is anti humanitarian. What's happening right now is that hamas is losing the second phase already, before the fighting is even started, violence of people there are getting out of the way. Hamas may be trying to keep them in position, but hamas is failing to do that, they are evacuating the northern area. Despite hamas roadblocks -- on a main evacuation route, that looks like something engineered by hamas to intimidate its own people. Their view is that those people, they're just human shields. They're collateral, they don't care about those people, what they're interested in is the destruction of Israel, and so the poor people in gaza,, they're not all hamas. There are innocent people there. They need to be protected too. And the United States -- hamas needs to be eliminated, and that's what the Israeli objective is going to be eventually. In this phase, it's already underway, hamas is losing control of the population, and that's a huge loss for hamas. &gt;&gt; Just to underscore, we're at a time, but just to underscore what you said, which is that hamas with, just for speed the leadership of gaza, is trying to prevent innocent civilians from getting out of harm's way. And getting out of a war zone, because I think it helps them, in the propaganda war. It's really important to talk
