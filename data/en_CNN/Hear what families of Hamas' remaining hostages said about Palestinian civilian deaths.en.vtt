00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:01.751
For those who still have

00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:03.795
family members being held hostage

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:05.171
by Hamas,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.966
the stakes could not be any higher.

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.676
And just few minutes ago,

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:13.096
I sat down with five of those families,

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:16.808
five American families with an exclusive,

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:17.767
exclusive interview.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.352
They were gathered in D.C.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.979
to push lawmakers here

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.480
and the White House

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.440
to do everything

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.482
they can

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:27.485
to try to help bring back these Americans

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:31.781
to their homes.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.824
One of the first things

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.827
I just want to say is because you are

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:39.039
Americans is

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:41.207
we were

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.544
honoring Rosalynn Carter yesterday

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:45.545
and we were talking

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:46.963
about the hostage crisis

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:49.591
because of Jimmy Carter.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.884
And that was the hostage crisis

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.260
that we had

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.679
where Americans were taking hostage.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.805
And we have another hostage

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.682
crisis right now.

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.059
And we have Americans in this country

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.851
who are actually rooting

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:03.855
for the hostage takers. And

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:05.565
it's

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.193
absolutely mind blowing to me.

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:09.986
And as people who have loved ones

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:11.946
who have been taken hostage,

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:15.867
I can't imagine what it's like for you.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.952
And I'm just wondering

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:19.120
what you think

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.457
and what you feel when you see people.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.500
I'm not talking about people

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.043
marching for Palestinian rights.

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.294
That's a separate issue.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:27.462
But specifically marching

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.464
in support of Hamas,

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:29.923
as we know,

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.467
those are two different issues.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.260
What is that like?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.970
This shouldn't be a political issue.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.556
This is a strictly humanitarian issue.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:43.269
You have 240 abducted right now, 160.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:44.771
This should be,

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.606
you know, any person just looking at

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.316
this issue should should sympathize.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:48.983
Think about it.

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:50.026
Could have been your son.

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:50.902
It could have been your daughter,

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:52.195
your mother.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:54.114
People taken from their beds,

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.491
people taken from their houses.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.077
It's it's not the same.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.163
I think it's a lack of education,

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:05.083
whatever it's going on protest wise.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.001
And

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.420
to see the Hamas as a freedom

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.008
fighter, it's it's fundamentally wrong.

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.385
That's what I think.

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.178
It's not a Islam issue.

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:17.679
Islam,

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.806
if you talk to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.391
I'm sure he will tell you

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.394
Islam is not about raping women,

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:28.189
beheading kids, burning people alive.

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:31.151
So I think people

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.902
should understand the facts.

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:35.655
To me, it's just sad and scary, really,

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.282
that people

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:40.118
choose to take side or not even look at

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.953
what the issue really is

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:45.790
or see our children, our wives,

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.792
fathers, you know, as people

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:48.334
for what they are.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.377
They don't even bother

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:50.378
looking at the story.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:52.463
They just make a judgment

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:54.966
based on lack of facts

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.301
and lack of education.

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.343
It's just scary to me.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:58.011
And fortunately,

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.262
we've moved to a place

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.222
where people want a simple,

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:02.223
evil and good,

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.809
and then they make their decision

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:05.935
based upon that.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.270
It's a complicated issue,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.645
and yeah,

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:09.314
you need to spend time to understand it

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:11.316
before formulating an opinion.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.484
Another round of hostages

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:15.111
are going to be released today.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:15.987
And we're family.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:16.404
We're told

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:17.697
the families have been notified

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:22.076
and sadly, none of you were notified.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.163
Another another day gone by.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.665
And no, no word of your loved ones.

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:30.877
And I'm just wondering,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.753
I know you're happy

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.254
for those who have had loved

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:33.880
ones released.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.923
And but for those of you

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:38.760
who are waiting for word of Omer,

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:40.887
it's really tough.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:41.763
It's really tough.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:42.430
I mean,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.766
we're happy to see anyone being released.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.517
But for me personally,

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:48.144
O'Mara is is a man.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:51.397
He's my son, 22 years old.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.942
He's not in the conversation yet.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.610
And it's it's really bad.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.988
Maybe, Jake, a way to visualize.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.490
Yeah, No time.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.034
Tick tock. Tick tock.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:03.534
What is that?

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:04.452
Why is there no time?

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:05.036
What what do you

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.663
what does that symbolize to you?

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.916
Symbolizes after 54 days.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:15.046
We have no idea on the physical condition

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.257
as well. A sign of life.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:21.678
This is against any international law,

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.888
even in times of conflict.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.140
The people walking this planet,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.059
that is basic principles

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.520
that are agreed upon.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.398
And in this case, the Hamas

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:36.401
terrorist organization has decided

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.070
not to abide by those principles.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.571
We have the International Red

00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:43.825
Cross, Doctors Without Borders wanting to

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:47.328
go in and are not allowed in.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.414
Question is why

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:52.292
you guys met with the Red Cross.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.419
What did you have to say to them?

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.545
First thing we said was

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:58.923
we want to have signs of life.

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.843
We also want to know if

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.429
people who are in Gaza

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.264
who were hostages

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:09.267
are healthy, what their condition is.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.269
They are the first people that see

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.645
these hostages.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.064
We have hostages who are coming back

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:16.482
emaciated.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:18.067
They've lost lots of weight.

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:19.944
They're dirty.

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:21.988
They have no light in them.

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:26.075
They've been in the dark in so many ways.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.410
They're not healthy.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.785
Yeah.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:30.204
And the Red Cross is

00:05:30.204 --> 00:05:31.998
their responsibility is to transfer them.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.208
But their responsibility also

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:36.127
is to be the voice

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:37.962
and to tell us what is happening.

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:39.422
So while we understand

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:40.506
their fragile position

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.924
where they need to be on the ground

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:43.843
and we want them there and they do

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.094
good work,

00:05:45.094 --> 00:05:46.679
we also want them to advocate

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:50.016
for the folks that are still in Gaza.

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.561
So on my show yesterday, we talked about

00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:56.272
accounts that we have heard

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.106
from loved

00:05:57.106 --> 00:06:00.276
ones of hostages who have been released,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.235
a little boy

00:06:01.235 --> 00:06:04.030
kept in solitary confinement.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.282
We saw a little girl,

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:08.951
that little Irish Israeli girl.

00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:09.410
Clearly,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.331
the light has gone out in her eyes,

00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:14.999
talked about being kept in the box.

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.251
She thought she was

00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:20.254
kept away from her family for a year.

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:23.091
She thought it had been a year.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.550
Another child

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.553
shown videos from October 7th.

00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:30.431
These are just a handful of accounts.

00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:32.767
This is how the kids were

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:33.518
kept.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:35.019
Also heard about

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:38.314
women being kept in cages.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.691
It's it's just it's awful.

00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:43.694
On one hand, it's sick, devastating.

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.488
You know, I think the it's depraved.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:46.406
I mean, it's

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.532
it's barbaric,

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:50.118
inhumane, inhumane, inhuman.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:52.245
Yeah,

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.455
I used the word holocaust.

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:56.290
I know I come from

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.961
and my family is a Holocaust survivor.

00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:00.253
You know,

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.838
we feel like it's all over

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.590
the Holocaust again, happening to us.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.094
the Israeli military is assessing claims

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:10.805
made by Hamas

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.099
that the youngest hostage,

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:17.103
ten month old care givers and his mom

00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:18.354
were killed.

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:19.647
Hamas is claiming

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:20.356
that they were killed

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:22.608
by an Israeli air strike.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:25.403
Obviously, whoever kidnaps

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:27.864
a baby and a mom, they're responsible

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.574
for what happens to them

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:32.160
regardless of how they were killed.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:32.660
I'm wondering

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.412
if any of you want to

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:37.165
comment on this awful news.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:39.250
Again, we don't know if it's even true.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:39.959
Right.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.544
I think the family came out

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:42.378
with a statement

00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:44.797
saying that they are looking at the facts

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:47.341
and hoping for good news.

00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:48.217
But that's part

00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:50.720
of the psychological warfare

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.388
that Hamas is doing.

00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:54.474
And going back to Liz's comment

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.851
about the International Red Cross.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.978
They need to be the witness.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.563
They are the conscience

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.273
of the international community

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:04.150
and need to speak up

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.320
and be vocal about what they are saying

00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:09.155
and calling them out

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.239
for these types of acts

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:11.365
that they are doing.

00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:14.619
The whole world needs to speak up.

00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:15.953
We don't feel that the

00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:17.955
international community is appalled

00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:19.999
the way they should be.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.959
It's humanitarian crisis

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:25.129
at the highest level and there don't seem

00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:28.716
to be enough outrage out there.

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:30.801
Now, over 30 different nationalities

00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:32.762
being held hostage today.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:33.804
And I think,

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:36.015
you know, we've seen the success

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:36.766
with the release

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.100
of some hostages

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.894
over the past several days.

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:43.231
And the US government, Israel, Egypt,

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:45.274
Qatar are working together

00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:47.693
and I'm really grateful for that.

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:48.402
That's how

00:08:48.402 --> 00:08:49.820
my aunt Aviva,

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.281
how Abigail have been released.

00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:55.701
But there's so many other hostages

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:57.411
who have not yet been released

00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:59.455
and time is of the essence.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:00.915
Do any of you think that

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:03.918
President Biden is not doing enough,

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.712
that he needs to be doing more?

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:07.880
It's okay if you feel that way.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.215
If I had a

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.716
loved one in captivity,

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:11.717
I probably would think that

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:14.971
nobody's doing enough.

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:15.596
We have heard

00:09:15.596 --> 00:09:18.599
President Biden expressing

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:21.644
the hostages is top priority,

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:23.729
but we're still sitting here

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.982
54 days later

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:28.484
with eight of us, eight families

00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:30.236
still waiting for their loved ones.

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:33.030
Think Biden administration, they do

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.744
more than enough since the first day.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:41.831
But the math shouldn't fool us,

00:09:41.872 --> 00:09:43.165
which means

00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:46.168
if every day ten people being released,

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.129
it doesn't mean necessarily

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.922
that the two weeks from now

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.549
their remaining 140

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.926
something hostages will be out.

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:56.178
So that's the main concern.

00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:56.846
You talked about

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:57.722
how you don't think that you're

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.725
getting enough support from the world.

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:01.642
And I'm sure you know

00:10:01.642 --> 00:10:03.060
that one of the reasons that is

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.146
and there are probably many reasons,

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:05.980
but one of the reasons

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.940
that is, is because

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:08.816
many people in the world

00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:11.360
think that the IDF's response

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.320
has killed too many

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.239
innocent Palestinians.

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.657
The IDF says

00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:17.074
they're going

00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:19.452
after Hamas and Hamas embeds

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.537
with the population

00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:24.290
and they're not trying to kill civilians.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.918
But Hamas goes where the population is.

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.337
That's the reason.

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:30.630
Do you think that the IDF

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.381
should be focusing more,

00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:33.799
not just the IDF, that Netanyahu

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:34.842
should be focusing

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:37.386
more on the hostages, getting them out,

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:38.971
saving them,

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:41.265
and the time for going after Hamas

00:10:41.265 --> 00:10:43.142
should come later

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:46.646
at the beginning of the conflict.

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:48.147
I think the Israeli government

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:51.817
was more focused on going after Hamas.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:55.196
I think the fact that the families

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.572
have come together,

00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:58.407
we each feel collectively

00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:01.952
that we have 240 new family members.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:04.246
And I think the success of the families

00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:08.167
being together and being able to unite

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.046
around the hostage issue and getting the

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:12.672
people of

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.675
Israel behind us

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.426
has changed the perception

00:11:17.426 --> 00:11:19.178
of the government of Israel.

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:22.348
The hostages have been 54 days.

00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:24.600
Somewhere in the dark in Gaza,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.102
it is

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:27.353
an immediate need,

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:28.104
the immediacy

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:29.689
of getting these hostages out.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.148
A young man like Hirsch,

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:33.401
who had his arm blown off,

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.444
he doesn't have days to wait.

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:36.445
And so

00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:37.530
little people,

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.949
big people, mothers, brothers,

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.200
young women

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.202
who we know are not being treated

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:44.745
well in Gaza.

00:11:44.745 --> 00:11:46.372
They need to get out.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.082
And so when we talk about it,

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:49.125
none of us are talking about

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:49.709
this politically.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.211
We're talking about it as a human crisis.

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:55.464
And so for me,

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.217
the issue of how do we finish

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:00.136
with the work of Hamas

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:02.263
and getting rid of them,

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:03.806
let's put it aside for a second

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.015
and let's just focus on

00:12:05.015 --> 00:12:07.643
getting these 150 folks,

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:11.105
people, our family, our relatives out

00:12:11.188 --> 00:12:13.107
and getting them safe.

00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:14.608
That should be everyone's priority

00:12:14.608 --> 00:12:15.234
right now.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:15.901
All I can say is

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.695
I hope that your loved ones

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.155
get home soon.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:22.158
And I know for the ones of you that have

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:24.785
men being held hostage

00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:26.579
who are not top priority

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:27.955
because women and children

00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:30.291
and older people are being

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:35.212
prioritized, and people in the IDF,

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.589
they will be last on the list.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.133
And I'm so sorry for that.

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:40.968
It's time to change this equation.

00:12:40.968 --> 00:12:43.012
Right? Who said that?

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:45.556
You know, we where is it coming from?

00:12:45.556 --> 00:12:47.933
We believe collectively

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:49.518
that anybody from any group

00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:50.770
should be released.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.773
Should be a mixed group from now on.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:54.148
Yes.

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:57.318
We 100% agree that children being

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.111
the sensitive souls that they are,

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:00.780
should have been released first.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.532
But from now on, they should be

00:13:03.532 --> 00:13:06.535
a consideration of men and women.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.454
Old and young

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:09.830
soldiers and civilians

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:10.956
still should come out.

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:12.208
They're all the same.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:13.375
There should be representation

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:16.337
of each and every group coming out.

00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:19.006
What do you want anybody watching

00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:22.927
right now to know about your loved one?

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:23.385
What should

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:25.513
somebody who's watched this

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.515
and is sitting at home afterwards?

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.600
What should they know about him?

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.435
He don is American kid.

00:13:31.435 --> 00:13:33.229
He graduated last year

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:36.482
from Tenafly High School.

00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:37.858
He love parties.

00:13:37.858 --> 00:13:39.401
He's got tons of friends.

00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:42.154
He's a professional swimmer.

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:44.782
He loved the good Life is a real foodie.

00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:46.700
Like he knows all the restaurants.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.078
Like we've been in concert everywhere.

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:52.289
Like

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:54.500
he doesn't belong there.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.335
Like dance with a family.

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:57.294
As simple as that.

00:13:57.294 --> 00:13:59.004
Yeah. Tell us about that.

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:00.089
What do you want

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:01.632
people to know about Homer Omar

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:03.384
As a kind person?

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:05.427
But when it comes to the room,

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:07.847
he just captured everybody's attention

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.515
just because of his

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.559
sheer size and kindness.

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:14.061
And. And

00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:15.354
he loves

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.189
playing basketball and admires

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.566
the NBA and the NFL.

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.317
Just the American kid.

00:14:20.317 --> 00:14:21.986
He belongs at home.

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.279
What about Ed?

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.738
What do you want us to know about other?

00:14:24.738 --> 00:14:26.240
He's a very talented kid.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.575
He sings. He dances.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:30.452
So he's typically the life of the party.

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:33.539
He has been in the Boy Scouts

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:34.665
until the age of 18.

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:36.667
So he mentors young kids.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:39.879
And maybe the most important part of his,

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:43.132
he and his older brother play NBA, too.

00:14:43.173 --> 00:14:45.718
Okay, so

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:48.554
I get my ass whipped by my eldest son,

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.306
so he needs his youngest

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:51.557
younger brother to come back

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.309
so he could go back and play with them.

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:54.435
NBA, too.

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:56.270
Emily, tell us about your Uncle Keith.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.855
What do you want us to know about him?

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:02.318
My Uncle Keith is a really gentle,

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:05.654
kind father and grandfather.

00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:07.990
He grew up in North Carolina.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.659
That's where I'm from.

00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:13.287
And family is just everything to him.

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:14.997
And he needs to be returned

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.999
to be with his grandchildren

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:19.752
and his wife and his children.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.962
I want them all home. So.

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:23.005
Thank you for talking to us.
