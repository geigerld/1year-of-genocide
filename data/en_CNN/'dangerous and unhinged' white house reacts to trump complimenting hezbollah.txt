AND ON THE POLITICAL FRONT, IT IS KIND OF A MIRACULOUS THING WE SEE HAPPENING, WHICH IS THAT WE JUST HAD MIKE MCCAUL, WHO'S CLASHED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION BEFORE. CHAIRMAN OF HOUSE FOR AFFAIRS, HAS THREATENED TO HOLD TONY BLINKEN IN CONTEMPT, COMPLEMENTING TONY BLINKEN AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR BEING THERE AND BEING ON THE GROUND TO STAND WITH ISRAEL. WHO IS NOT DOING THAT IS THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DONALD TRUMP, AND I WANT TO PLAY FOR EVERYONE WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY, BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO JUST RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE. LISTEN TO THIS. &gt;&gt; I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT BIBI NETANYAHU LET US DOWN. THAT WAS A VERY TERRIBLE THING, I WILL SAY THAT. WHAT I SEE SOMETIMES IN INTELLIGENCE, WE TALK ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE OR YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WENT WRONG OVER THE LAST WEEK. THEY'VE GOT TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT, BECAUSE THEY'RE FIGHTING POTENTIALLY A VERY BIG FORCE. AND THEY SAID, SHE, I HOPE HEZBOLLAH DOESN'T ATTACK FROM THE NORTH. BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST VULNERABLE SPOT. I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU KNOW, HEZBOLLAH IS VERY SMART. THEY'RE ALL VERY SMART. &gt;&gt; VERY SMART. FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THE WHITE HOUSE JUST PUT THIS OUT, A SPOKESPERSON ON THESE STATEMENTS SAYS, WE DON'T COMMENT ON 2024. STATEMENTS LIKE THIS ARE DANGEROUS AND UNHINGED. IT'S COMPLETELY LOST ON US WHY ANY AMERICAN WOULD EVER PRAISE AN IRAN-BACKED TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AS SMART, OR HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE UNITED STATES WARNING TERRORISTS NOT TO ATTACK ISRAEL, ESPECIALLY NOW AS ISRAEL'S FIGHTING BACK AGAINST ONE OF THE WORST ACTS OF MASS MURDER IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THERE USED TO BE AN IDEA THAT WAS -- BY REPUBLICANS. PARTISANSHIP OUGHT TO END AT THE WATER'S EDGE. THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE IN A TIME OF CRISIS LIKE THIS, WITH AN ALLY. THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T HAVE THE DECENCY TO TRY TO UNITE THE NATION, BUT HIS INSTINCT IS ALWAYS TO DIVIDE AND MAKE IT ABOUT HIMSELF. AND THEN TO PRAISE THE TERRORISTS, WHO ARE MURDERING CHILDREN, AS VERY SMART. YOU KNOW, IT REMINDS ME OF LANGUAGE HE USED AFTER TEAM IN SQUARE, WHEN HE PRAISED THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME FOR BEING TOUGH AND SMART. HE SEEMS TO PRAISE VIOLENT ACTIONS BY SO-CALLED STRONGMAN OR GROUPS. AND IT'S PART OF THAT. IT'S THIS INSTINCT TO MAKE IT ALL ABOUT HIMSELF, NOT THINKING ABOUT, OTHERS LET ALONE THINKING ABOUT THE NATION. &gt;&gt; CAN I JUST QUICKLY ASK YOU ABOUT THAT? WE JUST SAW ANTHONY BLINKEN IN A REMARKABLE, UNPRECEDENTED GATHERING OF ISRAELIS, HUGGING HIM, CRYING IN HIS ARMS. HE SECRETARY OF STATE, HE'S WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. DO YOU SEE THIS AS DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO FIND HIS ROLE, TO GET THE ATTENTION HE SO CRAVES AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO GOVERN? TRYING TO SHOW -- &gt;&gt; THAT'S INSTINCT. HE'S GOT TO INSERT HIMSELF. WHAT HE FEELS WHEN IT'S NOT ABOUT HIM, EVEN IF IT'S A TERRORIST ATTACK TRYING TO INSERT HIMSELF IN THIS. THE ABILITY TO RISE ABOVE AND UNITE. I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT ANYTHING MORE THAN HIS EGO AND HIS INSTINCT TO PRAISE STRONG MEN. NO BETTER HOW UGLY THAT IS. THIS IS NOT HARD TO UNITE RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; IS IT AS SIMPLE, ANNA, AS MAYBE -- &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD. &gt;&gt; IT IS BECAUSE FOR ME DONALD TRUMP IS -- HE IS AN INCOHERENT, NARCISSIST, WHO MAKES EVERYTHING ABOUT HIMSELF. BUT FOR ME, THE PROBLEM REALLY IS PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR TIM SCOTT. WHO TALKED ABOUT JOE BIDEN HAVING BLOOD ON HIS HANDS. PEOPLE LIKE RONNA MCDANIEL'S, THE HEAD OF THE RMC, WHO SAID THAT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. THAT IS IRRESPONSIBLE. YOU SEE, AMERICANS HERE HAVE TO TALK WITH ONE VOICE. THERE IS ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS, AND THAT IS HAMAS. AND WHETHER YOU ARE PRO-PALESTINIAN OR WHETHER YOU ARE PRO ISRAELI OR WHETHER YOUR PRO BOTH, YOU HAVE TO BE AGAINST HAMAS. AND THAT IS WHAT OUR FOCUS AS AMERICANS, AND CERTAINLY THE MEMBERS OF OUR GOVERNMENTS AND THOSE WHO HAVE PLATFORMS AND OUR LEADERS SHOULD BE DIRECTING THEIR FIRE AND DIRECTING THEIR VOICE. AND THE CONTRAST, AGAIN, COULD NOT BE STARK. OR AT A TIME WHEN -- THANKING AMERICA AND THANKING JOE BIDEN, AT A TIME WHEN YOU SEE ISRAELIS GATHERING AROUND OUR SECRETARY OF STATE, HUGGING HIM. AND THEY ARE HUGGING HIM AS AN EXTENSION OF AMERICA. YOU SEE HERE IN AMERICA PEOPLE TRYING TO BLAME AMERICANS FOR WHAT JUST HAPPENED IN ISRAEL. COME ON, FOLKS. COME ON. STOP THIS. STOP THE INSANITY, STOP THE PARTISANSHIP. WE HAVE TO UNITE AT A TIME LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. FORMER US  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS  CRITICIZING BENJAMIN NETANYAHU  AND ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE TRUMP  SPEAKING TO SUPPORTERS IN  FLORIDA, RECALLED AN INCIDENT  INVOLVING ISRAEL'S ROLE IN A  2020 US DRONE STRIKE. HE SAID  PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU PULLED  OUT OF THE PLAN TO KILL  ARONNE'S TOP SECURITY AND  INTELLIGENCE COMMANDER WHAT I  SEE, SOMETIMES THE INTELLIGENCE  YOU'D TALK ABOUT THE  INTELLIGENCE SO YOU'RE TALKING  ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT  WENT WRONG OVER THE LAST WEEK.  THEY'VE GOT A STRAIGHTENING OUT  BECAUSE THEY'RE FIGHTING  POTENTIALLY A VERY BIG FOREST.  I DID HAVE A BAD EXPERIENCE  WITH ISRAEL THOUGH, WHEN WE  TOOK OUT SOLEMANI IT WAS US AND  AS YOU WORK IT AS A GROUP AND  THE NIGHT BEFORE IT HAPPENED I  GOT TO CALL THAT ISRAEL WILL  NOT BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS  ATTACK I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT   BIBI NETANYAHU LET US DOWN THAT  WAS A VERY TERRIBLE THING. I  WILL SAY THAT ALL RIGHT,  OLIVIER KNOX, THE AUTHOR OF THE  WASHINGTON POST DAILY TO O2.  AND OF COURSE, NATIONAL   POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IS BACK  WITH US ON THIS.   &gt;&gt; SO OLIVIER THE STAKES ARE  VERY HIGH. OF COURSE, WITH THIS  STORY BUT THE REALITY IS QUITE   PAR FOR THE COURSE WHEN IT  COMES TO DONALD TRUMP   &gt;&gt; YEAH, IT REALLY IS. I MEAN,  WE STILL, WE HAVE TO START BY   SAYING, WHO KNOWS IF WHAT HE  SAID IS TRUE EVEN.  &gt;&gt; BUT YES, WE'RE TRYING TO  FIGURE THAT OUT AS YOU AND I  SPEAK. SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT  CAVEAT. I'M GLAD YOU RAISED,  BUT WE'VE WATCHED WE'VE WATCHED  THE ISRAELI RESPONSE TO THE  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S SUPPORT   OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS.   BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAS, HAS  JUST REPEATEDLY PRAISED THE  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. YOU SAW  THE SHOW OF SOLIDARITY TODAY  WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE,  TONY BLINKEN. IT'S NOT SUPER  HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHY DONALD  TRUMP MIGHT BE ANGRY AT BIBI  NETANYAHU NOW AND I DON'T THINK  IT HAS A LOT TOO. DO WITH A  YEARS OLD RAID AGAINST   AIRSTRIKE. I SHOULD SAY AGAINST  A TOP IRANIAN GENERAL.  &gt;&gt; IT'S   &gt;&gt; IT IS PART FOR THE COURSE IN  ANOTHER WAY WHICH IS OF COURSE  THAT HE HAS HISTORICALLY SAID A  LOT OF NICE THINGS ABOUT A LOT  OF BAD PEOPLE. HE'S PRAISED KIM  JONG UN. HE'S PRAISED THE  CHINESE RESPONSE, THE CHINESE  CRACKDOWN TO TENEMENTS HE  PRAISED VLADIMIR PUTIN. THIS  IS, AS YOU SAY, IT'S, IT'S VERY  PART FOR THE COURSE BUT I DON'T  THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AWAY FROM   THIS.  &gt;&gt; NO, I'M I'M GLAD YOU I'M  GLAD YOU PUT IT THAT WAY. I   AGREE. AND I'M SURE THAT THERE  ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE MISSING. I  WANT TO BRING IN THE REST OF  OUR POLITICAL PANEL HERE NOW,  JOINING US AS BRIAN FALLON, HE  IS THE CO-FOUNDER OF DEMAND  JUSTICE AND THE FORMER PRESS  SECRETARY FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S  2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. AND  WE ALSO HAVE SARAH MATTHEWS,  THE FORMER DEPUTY PRESS  SECRETARY WITH THE TRUMP   ADMINISTRATION. SO SARA, BEFORE  I GET TO BEFORE I GET TO THE  WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE AND TALK  TO BRIAN ABOUT IT, I JUST LIKE  TO KINDA GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO  RESPOND TO WHAT THE FORMER  PRESIDENT SAID HERE ABOUT THIS  RAID. I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY   KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT DID OR DIDN'T  HAPPEN THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO   SHARE WITH US IN TERMS OF  DETERMINING THE VERACITY OF  WHAT HE HAS TO SAY AND IF NOT,  AND PERHAPS IT'S CLASSIFIED SO   PERHAPS I'M ASSUMING THAT IF  NOT I'M JUST CURIOUS. YOU'RE   TAKE ON WHAT HIS MOTIVATIONS   MIGHT BE IN SAYING THIS. NOW   &gt;&gt; I WASN'T AT THE WHITE HOUSE  WHEN THIS RAID HAPPENED, AND SO  I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT   AND HIS THINKING ON THAT   SPECIFIC THING, BUT I THINK  SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY   IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT IT  WAS REPORTED IN 2021 THAT  DONALD TRUMP WAS VERY UNHAPPY  WITH NETANYAHU BECAUSE  NETANYAHU WAS ONE OF THE FIRST  PEOPLE TO CONGRATULATE  PRESIDENT BIDEN ON HIS WIN IN  THE NOVEMBER ELECTION AND SO I  THINK THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY  WHAT IS MOST SIGNIFICANT AND  DRIVING TRUMP'S BEEF WITH  NETANYAHU AND WHY HE MADE THOSE  REMARKS. HE MIGHT SAY IT HAS  SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT  SOLEMANI STRIKE AND THAT COULD  BE PART OF IT, BUT I DO THINK  THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THAT HE WAS  UPSET THAT NETANYAHU   ACKNOWLEDGED THAT BIDEN WON THE  ELECTION FAIR AND SQUARE. AND  SO THAT SEEMS TO BE THE DRIVING  FORCE HERE, BUT IT IS REALLY  DISGUSTING THESE REMARKS THAT I  THINK HE MADE WHERE HE'S THE  FORMER PRESIDENT IS PRAISING  HEZBOLLAH. AND I THINK A LOT OF  REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE BEEN  CRITICAL OF CONGRESSWOMAN TLAIB  FOR REFUSING TO DENOUNCE HAMAS  SHOULD BE EQUALLY UPSET DONE  WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT FOR  PRAISING HEZBOLLAH AND MAKING  THESE REMARKS AT A TIME WHEN WE  NEED TO SHOW SOLIDARITY WITH  ISRAEL AND SHOW UNWAVERING  SUPPORT
