00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.533
We've just

00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.668
received the IDF

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:03.570
initial findings on the Israeli

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.204
strike that killed

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:05.171
seven world

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.307
central kitchen workers in Gaza

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.341
on Monday.

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.709
The internal investigation

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.411
has found Israeli forces

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:12.712
believe they were targeting

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.314
Hamas, end quote,

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.283
mistakenly assumed to Hamas gunmen

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.052
were in the vehicles in the aid

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:19.786
convoy

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.254
Israel has now fired

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.256
two military commanders.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:24.257
Let's get right to CNN's

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:25.625
Nic Robertson, who joins us now

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.460
live from Jerusalem.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.928
Can you walk us through the findings?

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.730
It's a couple of pages.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.033
And what do you see that might be missing

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:33.900
when you look

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.736
at some of the details of this

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:38.838
Yeah, sure.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.140
This is a sequence of events

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.474
that the IDF has laid out

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:42.242
that they say led

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.710
to this misidentification

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.778
of misclassification

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:46.179
of the events on the ground. They say

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:47.881
the IDF

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:52.285
spotted a gunman getting on aid trucks.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:53.586
We're talking about trucks here,

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:54.721
the big vehicles

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.555
that carry

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.723
the actual pallets

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.291
and containers of food

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:00.193
and other humanitarian supplies.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:02.295
And then the IDF says they saw

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.931
another gunman. Again, a single.

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.866
So we're talking about two gunmen.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.101
They're saying they see

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:12.138
get on the aid truck or aid trucks.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.707
Then the convoy goes into the warehouse

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:15.675
and the IDF says

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:16.443
what happened

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.978
next is where the misidentification,

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.481
a missed clarification happens

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.483
that the IDF

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:26.986
then tracked the SUV as the vehicles

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.222
leaving the warehouse

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:31.391
after the aid trucks had been there.

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:33.093
The IDF says

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.028
they didn't realize these SUVs

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:37.063
worked for the world Central Kitchen,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.164
despite the fact

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:38.832
these were

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.533
markings are clearly emblazoned

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.035
on those vehicles.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:42.735
The IDF

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:43.937
then says that

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.872
those vehicles were engaged

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:49.075
because the IDF believed that the gunmen

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.212
were inside those SUVs now no longer

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.780
on the aid trucks

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.448
after they've been to the warehouse.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.684
But inside the SUV.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.018
Now, the IDF says

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:00.453
this should not have happened.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:01.921
It was against their protocols

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:03.823
and against their rules of engagement.

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:06.893
And they have now dismissed a major

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.362
who was directly involved in the incident

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:11.664
and the brigade chief of staff,

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:12.632
a reserve

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:13.933
colonel and disciplined

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.803
the the brigade commander as well.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:17.770
Now, the World

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.341
Central Kitchen say that it is good

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:24.010
that the IDF has acknowledged

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.045
and accepted responsibility

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.113
It's good

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:30.750
that they have taken disciplinary action.

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:32.452
However,

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:33.052
they're saying that

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:36.256
this is these outrageous killings

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:38.591
that what the IDF has said so far

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:39.425
on what they've done

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.528
is really of cold comfort.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.830
They said that the IDF report shows

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.832
that the World Central Kitchen workers

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:46.833
were doing

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:47.700
everything

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.069
that they should have been doing.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.006
But this, of course, leaves many,

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.074
many questions unanswered.

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:56.910
How could it be assumed

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.344
that the gunmen who been on

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.113
trucks were now inside?

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:01.548
We're talking about two gunmen

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:02.582
could be inside

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:03.783
three different vehicles

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:06.152
and so many more unanswered questions.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:07.787
Yeah, that's true.

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:09.322
We will wait to see what happens.

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.823
I know the World Central Kitchen

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:11.624
founder has asked for

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:13.092
an independent investigation

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:14.761
that is not done by the IDF.

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:15.628
I do want to talk to you

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.030
about something that has just happened

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.897
after this conversation

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:20.633
between Netanyahu and President Biden.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.870
The aid crossings into northern Gaza

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:27.006
are opening up and a dedicated port

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:29.375
Israel says will be available

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:30.376
for aid shipments.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.444
What else are you learning there?

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:35.014
Yeah, I think

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:35.448
it's kind of

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:36.216
key to look at what

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.417
the White House is saying here.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:37.750
U.S.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.018
policy is going to be determined

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.820
on how Israel moves forward

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.821
from these statements.

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:43.523
And we heard the same from Secretary

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:44.290
Blinken today.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.892
And it's what Palestinians

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.393
are telling us as well.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:47.961
It's one thing

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:48.361
to hear it

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.395
from the Israeli government,

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:50.396
particularly when they're pushed

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.131
by the United States to do this.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.766
But let's see the reality on the ground

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:54.534
and the context.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:55.401
And that, of course,

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.403
is that back in January this year,

00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:59.305
the Israeli government

00:03:59.305 --> 00:03:59.739
said that

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.641
it was okay for food shipments

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:02.108
to come in

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:03.543
through the port of Ashdod,

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:06.179
which is 20 miles from the Erez crossing.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.548
However, those food shipments

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:09.916
when they arrived

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.951
were then blocked by protesters

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.386
We already know that elements

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:14.821
with inside Netanyahu's

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:16.155
Prime Minister Netanyahu's

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.257
government, the right wing

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.224
elements, are saying

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:20.260
that they didn't agree with this move

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.694
by the Israeli government.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:22.629
This set the scene

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:23.463
for, again,

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:24.631
potential protests

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:26.566
to potentially stop convoys.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.500
It hasn't happened,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.935
but this is why the White House

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:29.769
will look closely.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.204
And another point of reference here

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:32.672
is that when he was here

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:33.139
in early

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.440
February, Secretary of State

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.175
Antony Blinken told the Israelis

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:37.577
that they should be opening the Erez

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:38.778
crossing in the north of Gaza

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:39.479
because that's

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.947
where the humanitarian situation

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:41.881
is most desperate.

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:42.882
That's where people are

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.217
literally dying of starvation.

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:45.752
We just got a figure from people

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:46.653
on the ground there today.

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:47.787
You know how much it is

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:52.492
for one kilo, £2.2 of potatoes today.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:53.926
22 bucks.

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:56.396
22 bucks for £2 of potatoes.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.964
That's the price of potatoes.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.198
That's why people are starving.

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:02.201
And in the north of Gaza right now,

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:02.735
and that's why

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.070
there's going to be so much scrutiny

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.071
to see

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:07.240
if this actually happens, that the U.S.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.641
has called so many times

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.643
for errors to be opened. Yes.

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:11.878
And the

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:13.279
UN agency

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.980
that's looking at

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.282
famine says famine is imminent.

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.884
They're a manmade famine.

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:18.584
Nic Robertson,

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.386
thank you so much for all your reporting.

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:20.920
Okay,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.922
so this report also comes out

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.090
as Israel is now,

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.791
as you guys were just

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.292
discussing, opening,

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:27.960
planning to open another crossing

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.394
into Gaza

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:29.996
to allow more humanitarian

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:30.730
aid to flow in.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.265
And this is after that phone call

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:33.733
between President Biden

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.401
and the Israeli prime minister,

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:37.203
where Biden issued an ultimatum

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:38.004
that Netanyahu

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.872
takes specific and concrete

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.207
and measurable steps

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:42.909
to protect aid workers

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.944
to or risk losing U.S. support.

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:45.812
CNN's Arlette

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.046
Science is at the White House

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:49.082
now with much more on on this.

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:49.449
Arlette,

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.583
what are you hearing this

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.985
morning from the White House about this

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:54.487
initial review,

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.488
this initial analysis,

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:56.656
this initial report

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:57.890
coming out about that strike?

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:00.827
Well, Kate, officials

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:01.661
here at the White House

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:02.995
were closely waiting

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:04.831
and watching for this initial report

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:05.565
from the Israelis

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:06.032
as they're trying

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.667
to get some further explanation

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:09.736
for what exactly led to that strike

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.971
on that world central kitchen convoy.

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.206
It comes on the heels

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.640
of a very blunt conversation

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.375
between President

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.509
Biden and Israeli Prime

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.578
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday,

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:19.912
where Biden warned

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:21.614
Israel would face consequences

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:22.682
if they do not do more

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:24.016
to protect civilians

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.853
and ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:27.720
Now, in that phone

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.921
call, a senior administration

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:30.189
official tells CNN

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:31.891
that Netanyahu admitted

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.760
that the IDF was to blame

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.428
for the strike on this convoy.

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:36.429
And this morning,

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:37.864
we have some interesting new language

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:38.798
from Secretary of State

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:39.632
Antony Blinken,

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:41.601
who ahead of the Israelis report

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:42.502
being released

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:44.303
said that there must be a thorough,

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:46.172
independent investigation

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.407
and full of accountability

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.541
for what happened. Take a listen

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.611
It's also

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:53.946
critical that we see

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:56.449
an independent,

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:57.517
thorough

00:06:57.517 --> 00:07:00.052
and fully publicized investigation

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.754
into the killing of the World

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.189
Central Kitchen

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.224
team

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:08.027
who were performing heroic work

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:10.062
under the most difficult circumstances

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:11.297
in trying to get assistance

00:07:11.297 --> 00:07:13.466
to people who so desperately need it.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:14.267
So we're looking to see

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.435
that investigation.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.470
We're looking to see a public accounting

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.440
and we're looking to see accountability

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.375
in its wake.

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:24.977
You know, this all comes on

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:26.045
the heels of what was

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:26.612
could be

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.414
one of the most consequential phone calls

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:30.249
of this conflict.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.951
Between President Biden and Israeli

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.486
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:34.620
in that phone call.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.689
Netanyahu assured the president

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.157
that Israel would be trying

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.126
to take steps to prevent incidents

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.761
like this from happening again.

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:42.695
That's according to a senior

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:43.729
administration official.

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:45.832
One thing that the two men agreed on

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.567
was that more needed to be done

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:48.000
to be able

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.634
to track

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:50.203
where these humanitarian aid

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:51.704
workers are in Gaza.

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:52.705
There's also

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:53.573
was a discussion

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.374
about the need to get more humanitarian

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:57.009
aid in to the enclave,

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:58.711
and that was through the opening

00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:00.012
of these access points.

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:01.747
As Nic was talking about earlier,

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:03.583
just in the hours after this call

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:04.951
between Biden and Netanyahu,

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:07.353
Israel approved the opening of that Erez

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:09.722
crossing in northern Gaza.

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:10.389
Now, one thing

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:11.357
that Secretary Blinken

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:12.058
and other officials

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:13.693
here at the White House have stressed

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:15.795
is that while they welcomed

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:17.763
the opening of this crossing,

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:18.764
while they open

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:20.099
welcome the ports,

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.567
they also want to see

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:22.502
the metrics of this,

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.669
see how many aid trucks

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:24.937
are actually getting in and see

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.072
how much assistance

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:27.406
is actually being distributed

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:28.241
to the American

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:29.942
to the Palestinian people.

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:30.543
But really,

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:32.111
this call between Biden

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:34.380
and Netanyahu will be closely watched

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:36.716
since it was one of the starkest warnings

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:37.450
that he's offered

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.051
that Biden has given to Netanyahu

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:39.585
about the way

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:41.287
that they're conducting their operations,

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:43.422
saying that things need to change

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.891
all the time at the White House for us.

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:45.691
Thank you so much live.
