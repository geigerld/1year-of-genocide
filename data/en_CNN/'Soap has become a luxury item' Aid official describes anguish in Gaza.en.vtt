00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.868
Former CNN war correspondent

00:00:01.868 --> 00:00:03.737
Arwa Damon has been to the enclave

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:05.372
three times during this war

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.240
with her charity, Inara,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.142
and she says that each trip reveals

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:09.776
that there is, quote,

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.811
less aid and more need.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.014
I reached her this week from Daryl Balla

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.516
on the Gaza coast.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:17.283
Arwa Damon,

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.286
welcome back to the program from Gaza.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.388
Thank you for having me on.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:22.088
Appreciate it.

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:23.456
Well, last time you were here,

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:24.524
after one of your trips,

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.425
you were in the studio

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.427
and you said essentially,

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.194
you know, things

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.330
just get exponentially worse.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.465
I asked you last time how it was.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:33.099
What is it

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.267
like this time

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:36.903
compared to when you were last there?

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:38.605
It's a sorrow

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:39.906
that is eclipsing

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.574
any kind of sorrow I've seen before.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:44.077
It's misery beyond the scope of misery.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.780
It's less humanitarian assistance,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.747
less ability

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:49.416
to support those who are in need

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.951
and an increasingly growing population

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:52.952
that extends to just

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.687
about every single human being

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:58.458
in this wretched stretch of land

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.160
who cannot cope with

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.362
even the most basic of things.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:03.596
Christiane, we,

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.832
international aid organizations

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.100
and local ones

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.969
have been reduced to trying to advocate

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.540
for something as simple as a bar of soap.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.875
Honestly, it's become a lot.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.944
It's terrible to hear you say that.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:19.145
And I know you tweeted that.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.381
Just explain what you mean by that

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.248
and what

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.450
what difference in life

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.186
and death would soap make right now?

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.487
So the bare bones of it

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.289
is that access to soap

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.856
and the ability

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.057
to maintain a certain level

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.592
of hygiene, reduces

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:35.028
the spread of disease by 40%.

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.696
What we are seeing right now

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:38.331
is a significant increase

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:40.533
in diseases like hepatitis A.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.102
I went down to Nasser Hospital,

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.670
and the head of the pediatric department

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.105
there told me that two children

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.108
a week are dying just in that hospital

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.243
because of hepatitis A.

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.879
It also means meningitis is spreading.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.047
It also means that

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:55.448
this horrific skin

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.584
disease called impetigo,

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.419
which is especially prevalent

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.788
in children and highly contagious

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.656
and can potentially be lethal

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.058
because if left untreated,

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.326
it can lead to kidney failure,

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.694
which can lead to death

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:09.496
is also all over the place.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.498
These are all diseases

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:12.866
that can be controlled,

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.300
which in return would empty

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.569
a bed space in these hospitals

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.137
to be able

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.972
to deal with the catastrophic injuries

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:19.539
that they're getting

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.074
from the bomb blasts.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.109
But there's no soap.

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.878
We go into these camps

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:27.680
and families are begging us for soap.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.482
What are they use instead of soap?

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:30.283
Well, one family

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:32.018
I spoke to said that they were going down

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.720
to the beach, getting sand,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.320
mixing it

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.022
with a little bit of salt and lemon.

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:36.856
And that's how they've

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:38.258
been cleaning themselves

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.893
for the last five months.

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.060
So if the cease fire,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.996
which we've all been advocating for,

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:43.396
to be able

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:44.864
to get more humanitarian aid

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.466
and obviously hasn't

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.835
materialized for the last ten months,

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.904
we are now trying to simplify it

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:52.205
down to soap.

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:52.972
Oh my goodness.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.474
I mean, that's really awful

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.209
to hear you say that.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.443
and I just need to say,

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.879
because there's a report

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.048
that actually where you are, I think

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.283
near Deborah. Right.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.784
There's the coast.

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:07.620
There is apparently showing up all brown

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.555
and murky

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.257
because of massive sewage spills.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:12.458
So these people are going there

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:13.927
also to try to get clean,

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:16.496
but there's not even clean seawater.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.397
And Christiane,

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:18.498
what people don't realize

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:19.899
when they hear about evacuation

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:20.667
orders is, yes,

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.035
we are very familiar

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.903
with that horrendous image of people

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:25.238
just carrying what they can.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:27.073
But each evacuation order

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:29.209
impacts organizations

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.078
ability to distribute and produce

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:33.246
safe, clean water.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.582
So the most recent evacuation orders

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:37.717
over the last two weeks from

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:38.851
hand hygiene units

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.486
reduced the population's

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:43.790
access to clean water by 70%.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.260
So that has already had an impact

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.028
on what people are going through.

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.863
But if we extrapolate beyond

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:51.731
that and look at what's

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.299
happening in the ICUs,

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.501
I was in the ICU at hospital.

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:56.836
There's a 13 year old boy

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.905
with severe burn injuries.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.907
He is in the ICU

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.542
because he has a blood infection

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:03.943
and signs of early sepsis,

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:05.812
because there weren't enough bandages

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:06.379
to be able

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.348
to keep his wounds properly clean.

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:09.682
There was a little year

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:11.651
and a half old girl

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.820
who is not stabilizing

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.622
from her catastrophic injuries,

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:17.590
because the small piece of plastic

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.692
called a tracheotomy or something

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.628
is not available in her size.

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:24.364
Now, we were luckily able to secure

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.298
some for her

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:26.766
and deliver them to the hospital.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.034
But if this little girl wakes

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:28.701
up, Christiane,

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.336
she's going to wake up and find out

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:31.571
that she's an orphan.

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:34.240
Oh, no. Oh, this is just so awful.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.976
We hear about the huge number of children

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:38.478
who have become orphans.

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:39.779
We also hear

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.014
a polio reported

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:41.748
for the first time

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.816
in 25 years in the Gaza Strip.

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.218
Apparently, a ten month old baby

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:46.586
was partially paralyzed.

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:48.121
I don't know whether you've been able

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.088
to hear

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:51.457
from the other humanitarians, the U.N.,

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.026
but apparently they're trying to start

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.727
even in the midst of this war

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:55.728
and destruction

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:58.331
of a polio vaccine program.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.499
Is that possible?

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.367
Yeah, they have to.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:02.568
And, you know,

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:04.037
there is movement in terms of,

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:04.604
you know,

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:06.306
getting a cold chain

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.207
in, getting the vaccine in

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.409
and training of people

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.977
to be able to deliver the vaccine.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.145
The plan is on the table,

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.880
but the plan, absolutely, 100%

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.248
cannot be implemented

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.350
unless there is some sort of a pause

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.085
in the fighting that is taking place.

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.687
And if that pause does not happen,

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:22.388
and if polio starts to spread,

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:25.058
we are going to start seeing and hearing

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.859
more and more horrific stories

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:27.960
of more and more children

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.495
ending up paralyzed of something

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:32.131
that, again, is completely preventable.

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:33.966
I do not have the words

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:35.168
to begin to describe

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.769
just how hard it is

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.004
to provide people

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.839
with even the most basic of items,

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.108
because things are not available.

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:44.077
I just came back from a fresh

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.912
vegetable distribution,

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.647
to a couple of the shelters

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:49.415
that that we work with,

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:50.383
some of the families,

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:50.950
and we purchased

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.018
this locally, by the way,

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.019
because

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.420
aid isn't really moving in,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.289
but commercial trucks are.

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:56.923
We purchased

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:59.292
some of these items at 20 times

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.494
their original price either.

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.863
Doesn't matter because these families

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.031
had not eaten

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.299
a fresh vegetable

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.868
for anywhere from five months,

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.370
and then at best, one

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.671
month was the last time

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:13.339
they had had fresh vegetables.

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.074
Oh, listen,

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:18.044
I mean, is the fighting worse

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.379
now than it was

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.247
two, three, four months ago?

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:22.849
I mean, the Israelis seem to say

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.917
they're busy degrading Hamas.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.819
They're in these cease fire

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.554
hostage swap negotiations.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:30.990
and yet, as you

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.125
say, aid is not getting in.

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:35.294
And we can quote also this week, the U.N.

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:36.763
said humanitarian efforts

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:37.563
ground to a halt

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.866
because of new Israeli evacuation orders.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:41.267
The International Rescue Committee

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:42.235
also had to stop aid

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.903
during these evacuation orders.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:47.006
It I mean, it's getting worse.

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.241
The international community

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.009
says it's trying to get aid

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:50.877
in, but you're saying

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:52.645
is practically at a trickle.

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:55.381
At best, it's less than a trickle.

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:56.082
It's like that

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.283
tiny little drop

00:06:57.283 --> 00:06:59.886
that barely comes out of the faucet.

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:02.588
And we also had to suspend our usual sort

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:03.890
of programs and activities

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.524
for a few days,

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:05.992
because two of our staff

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:07.593
and five of the shelters that we worked

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.262
with were under evacuation orders.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.196
And I myself have,

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:10.663
you know,

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:12.432
moved around a couple of times

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.633
in the last two weeks

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:15.735
that that I've been here.

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:17.103
The problem we have with

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:20.106
aid is the same as what it was

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.975
two months ago, but significantly worse.

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:24.710
We cannot access

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.646
the aid that Israel permits

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:27.513
to enter

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:28.714
Kerem Shalom,

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:31.484
because the route that Israel designates

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:34.420
for us to use to get that aid

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.322
is basically run by looters

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:37.657
and criminal gangs,

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:38.391
and Israel

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.126
is not securing that route,

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.527
nor is it providing us

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:42.995
with alternate routes.

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:45.665
There are alternatives that exist.

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:46.499
We can use

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:48.034
what's known as defense route,

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.035
where in theory,

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:51.237
Israel had at one point stated

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:52.538
that it would allow 40

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:54.106
trucks to go through there,

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:56.342
mostly trucks carrying medicine and fuel.

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:58.277
These days, on a lucky day.

00:07:58.277 --> 00:07:59.512
And it's not even daily

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.247
you're getting about 18 trucks

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:02.982
moving through there, items

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.217
that get into the north

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:06.619
through eddies right now. So that's soap.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:07.520
I've been talking about

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.754
those hygiene kits.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.223
They actually do get into

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:11.958
the northern part of Gaza,

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.460
but we are not permitted to move them

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.596
from the north to the south.

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:18.564
So we can't even scale up

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:20.333
what's being sent through the north.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.735
Why they will not give us

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:23.569
a straight answer.

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:25.605
We do not get straight answers

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:28.608
as to why we cannot properly move aid

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:29.642
from the South.

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:30.510
So, for example,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.344
fresh vegetables,

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.612
because we have them down here,

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:33.279
we can buy them

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.514
and send them to the north.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.748
Nor are we allowed to move

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:36.949
what gets into the north.

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:38.518
Hygiene kits down for

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:39.852
the population in the south.
