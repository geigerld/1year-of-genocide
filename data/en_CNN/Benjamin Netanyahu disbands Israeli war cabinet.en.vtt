00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.120
an Israeli official says prime minister Benjamin&nbsp;
Netanyahu has disbanded the war cabinet which was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.120
responsible for key decisions relating to&nbsp;
the Israel Hamas War it was formed in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.800
days after the October 7th Hamas attacks the&nbsp;
decision comes after opposition leader Benny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.440
gance withdrew from the body last week&nbsp;
meanwhile Israel's military announced a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.400
daily tactical pause along a specific route and&nbsp;
specific times to allow for humanitarian Aid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.240
into Gaza the IDF later clarified that it's&nbsp;
still its troops are still fighting in Rafa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.600
and parts of Gaza CNN's Paula hanock is joining&nbsp;
us now from Southern Israel Paula let's start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.720
with uh Benjamin netanyahu's decision to&nbsp;
disband his War cabinet what's behind that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.600
decision well am in the war cabinet there were&nbsp;
always three men who are basically making the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.440
decisions which was the Prime Minister the defense&nbsp;
minister and the opposition leader Benny Gant now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.280
of course since Gant has resigned saying uh he's&nbsp;
in protest of the fact there's no uh plan to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.560
the hostages out no day after plan uh for Gaza&nbsp;
and another plan to to get people back to Northern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.600
Israel as well who've been evacuated it is now&nbsp;
effectively a twers war cabinet so what he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.480
done is he's disbanded that and he has said&nbsp;
according to an official in his office that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.040
the decisions when it comes to the war in Gaza&nbsp;
will be made on a uh a security cabinet basis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:38.240
which is uh a wider cabinet basis uh also saying&nbsp;
that or experts are saying that this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.520
avoids the uh the pressure that was coming from&nbsp;
the far right of his Coalition uh some of those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.600
far right elements wanted to be part of the war&nbsp;
cabinet uh so by disbanding it potentially he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.480
has uh uh got rid of that problem as well he&nbsp;
doesn't have to accept or reject them because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.000
he does have a balancing act when it comes&nbsp;
to his Coalition at this point uh but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.480
do say within the prime minister's office this&nbsp;
won't make a difference to actually making the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.640
decisions on the uh the war in Gaza and if they&nbsp;
have to they will have smaller groups to decide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.680
tactical changes amra and regarding that tactical&nbsp;
pause uh if there is still fighting going on in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.920
Rafa and parts of Gaza as the IDF says is this&nbsp;
tactical pause in effect to allow humanitarian Aid

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.200
in so this is a pause that comes from the&nbsp;
Kem Shalom Crossing where we just were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.480
and it goes into Gaza and then up the salahadin&nbsp;
road which is effectively the the north south Road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.480
uh that runs through Gaza now from the idf's point&nbsp;
of view they say that they are securing that road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.440
so it will be safe for uh in uh International Aid&nbsp;
organizations to distribute AIDS which they say is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.440
stuck on the Gaza side uh of the Kem Shalom border&nbsp;
they say there's more than a thousand trucks that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.240
are there currently but we've spoken to some of&nbsp;
those Aid groups including the UN groups in Gaza&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.360
uh and they say that sometimes it is simply too&nbsp;
dangerous for them to be able to get to that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.520
cross in and pick up the aid it's not just the&nbsp;
fighting that they're concerned about it's also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.400
the sense of of lawlessness uh in Gaza there is&nbsp;
a lot of looting uh they say it's very dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.960
for them to be able to try and distribute the&nbsp;
aid I did ask the IDF spokesperson if there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.360
would be some kind of military uh escort with uh&nbsp;
these uh these trucks to try and get the aid in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.320
and that was uh not answered so at this point&nbsp;
it doesn't appear that that would be the case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.800
we've also heard from the Gaza media office&nbsp;
saying uh that as far as they're concerned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.600
there's been no tactical pause uh so they believe&nbsp;
that it is Israeli lies in their uh words now the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.080
IDF has been quite clear that the fighting will&nbsp;
continue it will continue in Rafa which is very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.320
close to where this uh this route is uh for the&nbsp;
Tactical pause uh as they will be continuing uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.720
what they have been doing since last month Amar&nbsp;
all right Paula hanock watching this for us from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.640
Southern Israel thank you Paula meanwhile a&nbsp;
US Special Envoy arrives in Israel Monday as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.360
tensions escalate on Israel's northern border&nbsp;
with Lebanon CNN's Ben Weedman is joining us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.520
now live from Beirut uh Ben you and officials&nbsp;
are warning that there is a very real danger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.800
of miscalculation escalating the conflict along&nbsp;
uh the Israel and lebanon's Border what have you

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:33.200
learned well what we've been seen is that&nbsp;
certainly in the last few weeks uh things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.640
on the border have gotten much hotter in terms&nbsp;
of the daily back and forth between hisbah and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.840
Israel although I must add that it's a currently&nbsp;
a Muslim holiday and yesterday on the at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.440
from hisbah side they didn't fire anything at&nbsp;
the Israelis as far as we can tell but this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.240
Envoy Amos Hawkin who's the senior energy&nbsp;
adviser at the White House and he's really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.880
the point man in dealing with the sort of the&nbsp;
Lebanon on Israel file for the United States&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.560
he's in Israel now we assume although it has&nbsp;
not been officially announced that he's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:15.760
to be coming uh to Beirut in the coming days&nbsp;
nonetheless what is obvious certainly from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.280
statements made by senior Israeli officials&nbsp;
including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:29.640
and the signs we're getting from hisbah is&nbsp;
that both sides are primed for escalation

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.880
every day the message goes out from South&nbsp;
Lebanon in slick propaganda videos accompanied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:45.200
by a stirring soundtrack hisbah is ready&nbsp;
to go from daily skirmishes to full scale&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:53.040
war with Israel Meed in what appears to be&nbsp;
an unwinable war in Gaza Israel has vowed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.080
to turn its military might on Hezbollah&nbsp;
earlier this month Israeli Prime Minister&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:06.000
Benjamin Netanyahu visited the Border saying&nbsp;
we are prepared for very strong action in the

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:16.960
north but the Iranian back group is by far the&nbsp;
most formidable battle hardened foe Israel has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:25.560
faced on its borders since the 1973 October&nbsp;
war after its guillas forced Israel to pull&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:33.280
out of South Lebanon 24 years ago in 2006&nbsp;
Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:41.160
although the war left parts of Beirut and much&nbsp;
of Southern Lebanon in Ruins retired Lebanese&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:48.480
Army Brigadier General elas Hana knows the&nbsp;
militant Group Well hasbalah is an exclusive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:55.680
Club well disciplined monitored and they have&nbsp;
which is the most important issue a charismatic

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:03.680
leader since October Israeli strikes&nbsp;
have killed more than 300 hisbah Fighters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.480
including last week high ranking&nbsp;
Commander Talib Abdullah given a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:15.200
hero's farewell in Beirut at the funeral&nbsp;
senior Hezbollah leader Hashim safadin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.760
warned we will increase our operations&nbsp;
in intensity and force in quantity and

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:30.480
quality analysts believe Iran has provided&nbsp;
Hezbollah with an arsenal of sophisticated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:39.600
long range missiles capable of reaching Tel Aviv&nbsp;
and Beyond until now Hezbollah has mostly limited&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:46.640
its strikes to military targets along the rugged&nbsp;
mountainous Frontier hitting Israel's extensive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:52.880
network of surveillance posts It also says&nbsp;
it is taken out an Iron Dome battery the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:59.560
backbone of Israel's missile defenses and has used&nbsp;
ground to- a missiles to shoot down three top of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:08.680
the line Hermes 900 drones in the process forcing&nbsp;
tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:16.840
in the north healah is learning faster than Israel&nbsp;
can adapt says Hanah you know they are learning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:23.000
it's like learning process it's like trial and&nbsp;
error so as far as you go in time you are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.840
more intensity more combined use of weapon and&nbsp;
then more in depths and More in Effectiveness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.280
against the Israelis and what is the problem&nbsp;
that the Israeli have no Pro have no answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:44.040
for that since October Israel has bolstered&nbsp;
its forces on the border and held exercises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:52.640
to prepare for war Hezbollah is also Ready&nbsp;
for War a war that is just one miscalculation

00:08:52.640 --> 00:09:03.440
away now Mr Hawkin is probably trying to convince&nbsp;
Vin the Israelis now is not a good time given the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:10.640
situation in Gaza to jump into a war with&nbsp;
Lebanon and of course in Lebanon given H&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:17.120
hezbollah's strength and abilities to strike well&nbsp;
inside Israel the price for Israel would be very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.040
high but prime minister Netanyahu is under&nbsp;
intense pressure from the public in Israel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:30.560
to allow those people who fled the north to go&nbsp;
back home so they're really in a bind now the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.680
one solution and what has been seen before is&nbsp;
that in late November of last year when there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:43.040
was an 8 day halt in the fighting in Gaza and&nbsp;
there was a release of hostages in exchange for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:51.160
Palestinian prisoners and detainees the Border&nbsp;
along between Lebanon and Israel was quiet hisb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.920
has made it clear if the fighting stops in&nbsp;
Gaza the Border will be quiet so probably a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:03.880
ceasefire is the best solution all around amra&nbsp;
Ben Weedman and beay for us thank you so much
