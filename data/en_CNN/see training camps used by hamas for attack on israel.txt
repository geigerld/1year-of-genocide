&gt;&gt; LAST NIGHT, IN OUR CONTINUE INVESTIGATION ABOUT HOW HAMAS PLANNED SATURDAYS ATTACK, WE BROUGHT YOU THE STORY OF THE HAMAS OFFICIAL WHO MASTERMINDED THE BRUTAL SHOUT KNOWN AS THE GUEST FOR HIS NEED TO LARGE IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION EVERY NIGHT TO STAY ALIVE. TONIGHT, CLARISSA WARD JOINS US AGAIN WITH NEW INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THESE GUNMAN TRAINED, AND HOW THEY WERE RIGHT UNDER THE NOSES, IN SOME, CASE OF THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES FOR YEARS CLARISSA, WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, ANDERSON, THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE FAILURES THAT LED UP TO THE ATROCITIES LAST SATURDAY. CNN'S OPEN SOURCE INVESTIGATOR, PAUL MURPHY, HAS SPENT THE LAST FEW DAYS POURING THROUGH A YEARS OF SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEO, SATELLITE IMAGERY, AND THE RESULTS AND THE FINDINGS ARE SHOCKING. [SOUND OF GUNFIRE] &gt;&gt; PROPAGANDA VIDEOS PUT OUT BY HAMAS WERE REVEALING CHILLING DETAILS ABOUT THE YEARS OF PREPARATIONS THAT WENT INTO SATURDAY'S BLOODY ATTACKS RIGHTS UNDER ISRAEL'S NOSE. ANALYZING METADATA FROM THE VIDEOS, A CNN INVESTIGATION CAN REVEAL THE PRESENCE OF AT LEAST SIX TRAINING SITES INSIDE GAZA. ONE JUST 720 METERS FROM THE MOST HEAVILY FORTIFIED PART OF ISRAEL'S BORDER. IN THAT CAMP, HAMAS RECREATED AND HE'S REALLY COMPOUND, WITH ELEMENTS OF THE NEARBY BORDER CROSSING, INCLUDING AN INSIGNIA OF THE AREAS RETALIATION. THE VIDEO SHOWED THE EVEN PRACTICE TAKING PRISONERS, AND ZIP TYING THEIR HANDS AT THE CAMP. SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THE CAMP WAS CONSTRUCTED WITHIN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. TWO OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF GAZA, HAMAS TRAINED FOR THEIR AUDACIOUS PARAGLIDER ASSAULT, REHEARSING TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS AT ALL SIX SITES, TWO YEARS OF SATELLITE IMAGERY REVIEWED BY CNN SHOWS NO INDICATION OF OFFENSIVE ISRAELI MILITARY ACTION. THE IMAGERY INSTEAD SHOWS THAT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, SOME CAMPS EVEN EXPANDED INTO FARMLAND, ANOTHER'S ACTIVITY IN THE CAMPS. THE STUNNING REVELATIONS RAISED QUESTIONS AS TO HOW HAMAS WAS ABLE TO TRAIN SO OPENLY, SO CLOSE TO THE BORDER FOR SO LONG. WHY ISRAELI OFFICIALS WERE UNABLE TO PICK UP ON AND PREVENT THE OCTOBER 7TH ATTACK. &gt;&gt; CLARISSA, WHAT'S THE IDEA'S RESPONSE TO THIS? &gt;&gt; WE HAVE COURSE REACHED OUT AND ASKED HIM FOR A STATEMENT, WHICH THEY HAVE PROVIDED. I WANT TO READ A VERBATIM WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS, SINCE THEY RELATE TO THE COMPLEX ANALYSIS OF INTELLIGENCE AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE ARE FIGHTING A WAR. THIS TOPIC TOGETHER WOULD NUMEROUS OTHER ISSUES WILL BE INVESTIGATED BY THE IDF AT THE END OF THE WAR. IT IS WORTH MENTIONING, ANDERSON, THAT HISTORICALLY THERE HAVE BEEN MANY STRIKES THAT ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES HAVE MATES ON HAMAS TRAINING CAMPS. ALSO, I WOULD JUST MENTION, THESE QUESTIONS THAT WE ARE ASKING OUR QUESTIONS THAT A LOT OF ISRAELIS WANT ANSWERS TO. THE TIMING MAY NOT BE RIGHT NOW, I THINK PEOPLE APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE PRIORITY. BUT, THEY WILL WANT THOSE ANSWERS, ANDERSON. &gt;&gt; THERE IS ALSO QUESTION ABOUT U.S. INTELLIGENCE FAILURES. ASSUMING THAT, I MEAN, GIVEN THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES THEY DIDN'T SEE THIS EITHER. &gt;&gt; I THINK THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS, ANDERSON, ABOUT HOW ON EARTH THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENS. I MEAN, YOU LOOK AT THAT VIDEO A TRAINING WITH A REPLICA OF THE BORDER CROSSING, THAT WAS LESS THAN A KILOMETER AWAY FROM THE BORDER CROSSING. YOU SEE THE SCALE AND THE SCOPE OF SOME OF THOSE CAMPS. IT'S HARD TO FATHOM OR UNDERSTAND THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE THAT THE ISRAELIS AND OTHER SUPPORTERS WOULD NOT BE AWARE OF IT. THE ASSUMPTION MAY BE THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF IT, THAT THEY PERHAPS DID NOT UNDERSTAND OR MISINTERPRETED THE INTELLIGENCE, DIDN'T SEE IT AS A DIRECT THREAT. AGAIN, THAT IS SPECULATIVE, WE DON'T KNOW. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THERE WILL BE AT SOME POINT A DEEP DIVE INVESTIGATION BY THE ISRAELIS, AND THE ISRA
