00:00:04.916 --> 00:00:06.000
And a warning for you now.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.250
Some disturbing video

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.250
we're going to show you

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.500
in the latest update

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.833
of the Israel-Hamas war.

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:13.041
These are some of the victims

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.500
after a deadly 24 hours in central Gaza,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.250
the Hamas run health ministry

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.750
says at least

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.375
250 people were killed

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:21.291
from Israeli strikes.

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:22.666
70 of the victims

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.750
were at the Alma

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.833
Ghazi refugee camp Sunday.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.416
Israel Defense Forces

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:29.625
told CNN, quote, in response to Hamas's

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:30.750
barbaric attacks,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.666
the IDF is operating to dismantle

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.625
Hamas military

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:35.666
and administrative capabilities.

00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:36.750
Also today,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.458
Israeli's

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:38.666
Israel's Prime Minister,

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.625
Benjamin Netanyahu, was in Gaza,

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:42.625
his second trip to the battlefield,

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:44.458
vowing to continue the, quote,

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:45.625
long fight.

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:46.000
A day

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.875
after promising to intensify

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:49.708
the campaign against Hamas,

00:00:49.708 --> 00:00:51.958
the IDF says since Friday, at least

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.333
15 of its soldiers

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.958
have been killed in Gaza.

00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:55.625
CNN senior

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:56.708
international correspondent

00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:58.833
Will Ripley is in Tel Aviv.

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.375
Will, tell us more about what

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.041
the prime minister said to troops today

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.208
during that visit to Gaza.

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:06.708
Well, he's certainly there to

00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:07.791
send them encouragement

00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:09.625
to say that their sacrifice

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:11.666
this was one of the deadliest weekends

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.083
in this 80 day war

00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:14.541
for the Israeli military.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:14.958
Just like

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.500
it was one of the deadliest

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.291
24 hour periods

00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:19.458
in Gaza

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:21.500
since this war began back on October 7th.

00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:22.583
80 days

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:26.041
and you have more than 20,600 people

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.708
who have been killed on the

00:01:28.708 --> 00:01:29.583
Palestinian side,

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:31.916
along with more than 53,000 injuries.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.041
And even though Israel's death toll

00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:35.833
is is much lower,

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:36.750
they do say that

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.000
they are adhering, Jessica,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.208
to international law,

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:40.041
that they are not

00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:42.125
indiscriminately targeting civilians,

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:42.791
but they're going

00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:45.208
after specific military targets

00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:46.625
based on intelligence.

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:48.250
They say they're targeting changes

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.250
as different intelligence comes in.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.250
And they say the fact that Hamas

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.125
is choosing to position itself in areas

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.250
densely packed with civilians

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.458
who are sheltering, civilians

00:01:58.458 --> 00:01:59.375
who are displaced.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:00.541
That that makes Hamas

00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:01.833
just as culpable for this

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:03.458
skyrocketing death toll.

00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:04.625
This is the Israeli argument

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.500
as it does Israel itself.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.125
So despite that, we had this U.N.

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:09.666
resolution last week

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:10.375
that, of course,

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:11.625
that was quite watered down

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:12.458
from the original draft

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:14.125
that the United States vetoed

00:02:14.125 --> 00:02:15.250
and then there were several delays

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.500
as they were rewriting it.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.958
Israel says they're not going to stop

00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:21.375
until they obtain their objective,

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:22.625
which is to eliminate

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:23.916
the leadership of Hamas.

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:24.666
And they have not

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:25.708
been able to do that yet.

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:26.875
Netanyahu

00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:27.791
in northern Gaza,

00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:29.416
where they have essentially obtained

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:30.625
operational control,

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:31.541
meeting with the troops

00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:34.125
and saying that this war will continue

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:35.458
President Biden in a phone

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:36.833
call with the prime minister

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:37.583
of Israel,

00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:40.083
encouraging a more slower,

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.625
more focused, streamlined technique.

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:44.833
Not such a such a large scale

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:46.291
casualty type of situation.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.208
President Biden,

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.125
speaking with Democratic donors,

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:50.750
did on one instance

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.291
use the word

00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:52.291
indiscriminate bombing,

00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:53.875
which would be a violation

00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:54.625
of international law.

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:56.583
But then the Israelis really said that

00:02:56.583 --> 00:02:57.833
that one reference

00:02:57.833 --> 00:02:58.500
from the US

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.208
president is not reflective

00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:01.708
of their reality on the ground.

00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:02.666
And so the fighting

00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:03.958
absolutely continues

00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.541
and you have a Christmas Day

00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:06.083
where we have now

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:08.125
just had some of the deadliest incidents

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:10.833
since this war began 80 days ago.

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:13.125
And well, before we let you go,

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:14.666
the IDF has also revealed

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:15.541
these new details

00:03:15.541 --> 00:03:17.791
about the Hamas tunnel network

00:03:17.791 --> 00:03:19.958
that they've been trying to destroy

00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.708
and penetrate there.

00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:23.791
What can you tell us about that? Yeah,

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:27.208
so this is a network of tunnels

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:28.416
underneath Gaza.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.083
Hamas has

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:30.208
has publicly stated

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:31.125
in the past that they've built

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:33.416
hundreds of miles of tunnels under Gaza.

00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:35.875
Although the exact number

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:37.083
of the tunnels is unknown

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:39.250
and impossible to independently verify.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.125
But what Israel says

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:42.208
they discovered and uncovered

00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:44.291
is a very elaborate tunnel system,

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.250
very high tech with capability to house

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.083
weapons facilities, bunkers,

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:51.791
command headquarters,

00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:54.000
even living quarters, apartments

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.583
for the Hamas senior leadership.

00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:56.541
And they also say that

00:03:56.541 --> 00:03:57.625
they recovered the bodies

00:03:57.625 --> 00:03:59.125
of five Israeli hostages,

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:00.833
three of them soldiers,

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:02.125
two of them civilians.

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:04.250
And once those five bodies were recovered

00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:06.666
and repatriated back here to Israel,

00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:08.458
that underground tunnel complex

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:10.125
that was housing the Hamas leadership

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:11.083
and a lot of the leadership

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:12.958
operations was destroyed

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:13.333
Of course,

00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:14.791
the leadership has since moved on

00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:16.125
to another location, Jessica.

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:17.458
Israel trying to track them down.

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:18.583
But this is a fight

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:20.375
that experts say is likely to continue

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:21.708
for many, many months to come

00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:22.541
because Hamas

00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.166
is actually getting more resources

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:24.958
funneled in

00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.125
from their supporters,

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:26.708
among whom

00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:28.291
they've actually gained credibility

00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:29.416
since October 7th

00:04:29.416 --> 00:04:31.583
for keeping this fight going.

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:32.833
And so they're going to get more money.

00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:33.750
They're going to get more weapons.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.708
And Israel says

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.625
they are going to have to keep fighting.

00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:38.458
Will Ripley for us tonight in Tel Aviv,

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:39.666
thanks so much for that reporting.

00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:41.000
Well, we appreciate it.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.708
And joining us

00:04:41.708 --> 00:04:42.416
now to talk

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:43.166
a little bit more about

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:44.666
this is retired Army Brigadier

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:46.166
General Mark Kimmitt.

00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:47.208
Thanks so much for being here

00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:48.250
on this Christmas Day.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.708
We really do appreciate it.

00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:50.750
I want to start first

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.708
with with some of Will's reporting there.

00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:54.125
We know that Israeli Prime

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:54.791
Minister Benjamin

00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:56.333
Netanyahu has said

00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:58.625
that Israeli forces are intensifying.

00:04:58.666 --> 00:04:59.583
That's his word.

00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:01.708
Operations inside the Gaza Strip.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.916
What do you think an intensification

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:05.791
looks like at this point?

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:07.875
Well, I think it

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:10.125
means probably putting more ground troops

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:11.916
in to finish up the fight

00:05:11.916 --> 00:05:14.125
inside of Gaza City, more ground troops

00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:16.583
to finish the fight on units.

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:17.625
I think it also means

00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:18.625
that they may step up

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:19.916
the amount of air attacks

00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:22.166
that are going into both of those cities.

00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:26.208
Because I think that they recognize

00:05:26.208 --> 00:05:28.750
that international criticism

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.958
cannot continue at this level.

00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.208
So the sooner they mop this up, sooner

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:35.666
they clean this up, the better.

00:05:35.708 --> 00:05:36.625
And candidly,

00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:38.625
that saves lives by speeding it up

00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.125
simply because you won't be finding

00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:41.833
as many days

00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:43.541
when you hear a casualty tolls

00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:46.250
of 250 plus.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.208
And his statement,

00:05:47.208 --> 00:05:48.083
Benjamin Netanyahu's

00:05:48.083 --> 00:05:49.041
statement is coming

00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:50.458
after the Secretary of State,

00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:52.375
Antony Blinken, said last week

00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:53.708
that this conflict, quote,

00:05:53.708 --> 00:05:56.083
needs to move to a lower intensity phase.

00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:58.125
So obviously opposite there.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:00.291
You mentioned international support

00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:02.250
and outside support for Israel.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.875
What do you anticipate the U.S.

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:04.916
support for Israel

00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:05.958
is going to look like as

00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.250
we continue moving forward?

00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:09.708
Well, look, these

00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:10.833
types of operations,

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:12.166
consumers significant amount

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:12.958
of ammunition,

00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.250
significant amount

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.583
of bombs, significant

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:17.291
amount of artillery rounds.

00:06:17.291 --> 00:06:18.458
I think we will continue

00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:20.916
to provide those assets,

00:06:20.916 --> 00:06:22.916
which by the way, we are also

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:25.041
and need to continue to provide Ukraine.

00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:26.250
I certainly hope

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.666
that part of those ammunition packages

00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:31.041
include precision guided weapons

00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:32.333
so that the Israelis

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:34.625
can be more precise in their attacks.

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:38.541
And let's talk more about the tunnels

00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:39.750
that will also kind of

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.541
walk us through there

00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:42.583
in his reporting before we came to you.

00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.541
The IDF has this new disclosure

00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:45.791
about what

00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:47.708
the tunnel network looks like in Gaza,

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:49.875
kind of where they have been able to go.

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:52.458
And they also reported the bodies

00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:53.041
that they found

00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:53.750
of the five

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.458
Israeli hostages that had been recovered.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.541
What are you taking away

00:06:58.541 --> 00:06:59.750
from this information

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.875
about these tunnels?

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:03.208
And what the IDF is finding there?

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:05.208
Well, what

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:06.250
it indicates to me

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.333
is that for many, many years, money

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:09.375
that has been provided

00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:10.500
by the United Nations

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.125
has been siphoned off

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:14.250
to buy the concrete, to buy the sand,

00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:16.333
to buy the material

00:07:16.333 --> 00:07:17.416
that is necessary

00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:20.875
to build these 300 miles of tunnels

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:22.458
that had no other purpose

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:23.500
and to fight wars.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.666
So I think it's

00:07:24.666 --> 00:07:25.916
not only a criticism

00:07:25.916 --> 00:07:27.583
of the barbarity of Hamas,

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:29.125
but it's an implicit criticism

00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:29.708
of the U.N.

00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:30.750
accounting for the money

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.708
that they've been providing

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:33.166
over the years.

00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:34.708
Because you're you're saying that

00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:35.916
that that has that's

00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:38.375
where some of it has gone.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.916
I don't know how else these tunnels

00:07:40.916 --> 00:07:42.208
could have appeared

00:07:42.208 --> 00:07:43.958
without the funding necessary.

00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.458
And there's no other real source

00:07:45.458 --> 00:07:48.833
of funding inside of

00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:50.541
Gaza except the money provided

00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:51.208
by the U.N.

00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:51.833
and some money

00:07:51.833 --> 00:07:54.000
that's been provided by Qatar.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.958
And just quickly,

00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958
lastly, before I let you go, you know,

00:07:57.208 --> 00:07:58.500
they talked about the five

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.791
bodies of the hostages

00:07:59.791 --> 00:08:01.250
that were found there.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.666
We're now closing in on three months

00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:05.458
in this conflict, and

00:08:06.666 --> 00:08:06.958
there are

00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.000
still dozens,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.125
over 100 hostages that remain in Gaza.

00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.875
Where do you see this going?

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:14.125
Does that rely solely

00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:15.625
on a diplomatic solution,

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:16.583
or is there

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:18.208
any sort of military intervention

00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:20.208
that you see coming down the road at all?

00:08:21.666 --> 00:08:24.291
I would be very surprised if even the

00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:25.458
the highest

00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:26.958
and military soldiers

00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.583
inside the special operations

00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:30.083
community in Israel

00:08:30.083 --> 00:08:32.250
would be capable of bringing back

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.916
even a percentage of the hostages.

00:08:34.916 --> 00:08:37.333
So it will depend on diplomacy.

00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:39.500
But nonetheless, one of the messages

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.208
that Prime Minister

00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:42.000
Netanyahu gave to his troops on

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.708
the ground is keep fighting

00:08:43.708 --> 00:08:44.333
the soldiers

00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:45.666
who need to focus on fighting

00:08:45.666 --> 00:08:46.791
because they can't depend

00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:48.583
on diplomacy to fix this.

00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:49.833
And so they're going to keep fighting

00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:51.416
until this war is over.

00:08:51.416 --> 00:08:53.125
That seems to be certain.

00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:53.458
All right.

00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:54.625
Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt,

00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:56.500
thanks so much again. We appreciate it.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.541
And Merry Christmas to you

00:08:58.708 --> 00:08:59.458
and you as well.
