00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:01.584
Tonight's hostage

00:00:01.584 --> 00:00:02.127
deal, which

00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:03.003
Israel's cabinet

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.546
just approved a few minutes

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:05.296
ago, calls

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:07.215
for a four day pause

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:09.718
in Israeli military operations in Gaza.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:10.844
Now, before the break,

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.887
Barack Ravid told us that his sources

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:14.848
say that military engagement

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.099
will not stop

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.019
until the first child hostage

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:22.981
crosses the border from Gaza into Israel.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:24.399
CNN's Jeremy

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.901
Diamond is in southern Israel

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:27.610
at a vantage point

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.528
right near the Gaza border

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.196
and can see into Gaza

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.240
and has been watching much

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.741
of the fighting

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:34.325
over the last several days and weeks.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.745
Jeremy, what are you hearing tonight?

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:39.581
Well, just as you were coming to me,

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.291
John, we heard the sound of outgoing

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.126
artillery and moments

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.794
after this deal was approved

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.337
by the Israeli government.

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:48.339
We heard several barrages

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:49.799
of outgoing artillery

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.676
in the direction of the Gaza Strip,

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.762
an indication that the military activity

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:54.971
by the Israeli

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.015
military will indeed continue

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:01.478
until this pause goes into effect

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.271
until those hostages

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.315
are released from Gaza.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:08.234
So and also one clear point

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:08.985
that the Israeli prime

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:10.278
minister made this evening

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.155
was that even as he was

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.282
urging his cabinet to approve this deal,

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:15.575
he was also making clear

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.077
that the war will continue

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.703
after this pause ends.

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:20.288
We also need to be clear that

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:21.790
if you look at the past of this

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.500
Israeli-Palestinian conflict,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.417
typically before

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.543
there is a cease fire, before

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.378
there is any kind of pause in fighting,

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:29.422
there is an uptick in military activity.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.924
So we're very much here waiting

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.926
and watching for that possibility.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:33.259
But, John,

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.135
I do also want to tell you

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:35.053
about a conversation

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:36.846
I just had with Gal Hirsch,

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:37.430
who is

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.182
the Israeli prime minister's

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.142
special coordinator for hostages.

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:44.312
You just told me moments ago about this

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:45.730
deal, about the discussions

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.607
in the cabinet meeting where he said that

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.150
only one,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.361
only two ministers voted against

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.321
this proposed deal.

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:54.114
He said that

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.657
the finance minister, Smotrich,

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:56.533
who appeared

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.243
to be indicating his objections

00:01:58.243 --> 00:01:59.077
to this deal,

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:01.329
actually ended up voting in favor of it.

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:02.455
And he also told me

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.124
that he delivered a message

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.126
just about a half hour ago

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:07.293
to the families

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.671
of some of these hostages, telling them

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:10.839
that the state of Israel

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:11.840
will do everything

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.425
to bring all of the hostages back home.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:16.177
And he really did want to emphasize

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:16.886
that this deal

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:18.721
for 50 hostages in exchange

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:20.181
for a four day pause

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:20.974
in fighting,

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.935
as well as three Palestinian prisoners

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.895
for every civilian hostage

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.188
release from Gaza,

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.149
that this deal is only the first

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.025
phase of these negotiations.

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:32.527
He really wanted to emphasize

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:34.571
that the Israeli government's position

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:35.613
is that they want to get

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:37.073
all of the hostages back

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:38.700
and that this military campaign,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.201
that these negotiations

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:42.787
will not end until that happens.

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.873
Jeremy, I am curious, you said the

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.457
the official with Prime Minister

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:48.042
Benjamin Netanyahu said that they had

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:49.085
he had spoken

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:50.336
to the families of the hostages.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.589
We had the granddaughter of one hostage

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:53.840
on about 20 minutes ago

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.717
and she said she's had no communication

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:56.467
whatsoever

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:57.719
from the prime minister's office.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.929
So how is the prime minister, insofar

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:00.847
as we know, reaching out

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:03.975
Yes.

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:05.059
So this is Gal Hirsch.

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:06.102
He is the special coordinator

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:08.354
for hostages for the prime minister.

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:09.606
He didn't say exactly how,

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:09.981
but he said

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.274
he delivered a message

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.443
to the families of these hostages.

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.028
And what's also clear

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:15.528
is that,

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:15.820
you know,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.197
they don't know yet exactly

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.615
which families of hostages

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.034
are going to see their loved ones

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.119
released. He would not get into that.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.330
But I also think it was interesting

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.080
that when he was talking

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.624
about the 50 individuals

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:28.291
who will get out,

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.251
he said children and their mothers.

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.127
We have been reporting

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:32.587
that it would be children and women.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.005
But I think it was really interesting

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:35.465
that he was specifying

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.549
that it would be children

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.217
and their mothers.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.260
We know, of course, of multiple cases

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.178
of children

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:41.804
who are being held hostage in Gaza

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:43.306
and who were taken hostage

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.849
with their mothers as well.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:45.767
And so that may give us

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.102
some indication of the families

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:49.145
that are most likely

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:51.397
to get out in this first round.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.858
Of of hostage releases

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:54.943
over these four days

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.487
for those 50 different individuals.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.697
That is perhaps an indication there.

00:03:59.697 --> 00:03:59.948
All right.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.532
Jeremy Diamond right on the border

00:04:01.532 --> 00:04:02.742
between Israel and Gaza,

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.869
where artillery fire has continued

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.163
even after the deal has been reached.

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:08.581
Jeremy, thank you very much

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.374
for your reporting.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:09.958
With me now

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:10.375
is Rami

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.000
Igarashi, former

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.168
chief of the Hostages

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:14.379
in MIA Unit of the Mossad

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.171
and retired U.S.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.714
Army Major General James Spider

00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:18.675
Marks, a CNN military analyst.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:19.801
Rami, let me start with you.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.219
You've been skeptical

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.680
of the possibility of this deal

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.473
as it was being negotiated

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:27.433
now that they have reached a deal.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:28.685
What are your opinions on it?

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.022
This deal is

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:35.108
has been that has been negotiated

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:35.984
on the basis

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.903
that the Hamas wants a cease fire.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.114
Hamas wants to be to be

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.366
saved from the Israeli military.

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:44.492
On the other hand,

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:45.952
the Israeli Israeli

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.870
military is determined

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.831
to eradicate the Hamas.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.208
It is not something that we want to do

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.793
is something that we have to do.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:56.170
There is no way that Israel can continue

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:59.340
living in any form with Hamas

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.717
over the border.

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.677
Now, this deal was reached

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.304
because of the Israeli

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:07.181
public opinion and the

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:07.890
the belief

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.517
that the moral duty

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:11.352
that the government has

00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:12.729
is such that it is

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.938
it overrides

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:15.940
the main objective of this war.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.733
And the main

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:17.692
objective of this war

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:20.361
is to eradicate the Hamas

00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:22.655
It is a very, very bad deal

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.699
for Israel in many, many ways.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.075
First of all, militarily,

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:27.994
it is not an easy deal.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:28.661
How are they going

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.164
to restart the war in four or five days?

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.250
Secondly, we know that the Hamas is going

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.919
to play all kinds of tricks on the way,

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:38.171
trying to

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:40.131
trying to

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:43.092
to release this prison, less

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.763
kidnap personnel that

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.431
it has.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.475
And and on the second hand,

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.268
it is not an easy deal

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:54.312
on the Israeli internal front.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.230
Remember, there are families

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.607
that their loved ones

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.525
are not going to be released

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.152
and there are families

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.404
that have soldiers in the Gaza Strip

00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:05.656
and they know of fighting in the Gaza

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:07.283
Strip in four days

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:08.951
time or in five days time.

00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:09.494
Is going to be

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.037
a lot more difficult than it is

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:11.996
right now.

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:14.707
General Marks, we've talked about this.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:16.959
What is the military impact

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:20.546
of a multiday pause

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.090
The primary impact

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.425
is that the IDF loses

00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:25.760
targetable intelligence.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.720
It starts to atrophy

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.554
the intelligence

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:29.514
that they've gathered

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:30.765
over the course of days

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:34.685
in Gaza begins to crumble around them

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:35.686
because over

00:06:35.686 --> 00:06:36.813
this pause,

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.065
Hamas will resupply reposition,

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.566
do everything in their power

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:43.027
to increase their security.

00:06:43.027 --> 00:06:45.196
And let there be no doubt

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.198
this is not being done by Hamas

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.450
for any humanitarian reasons.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.577
This is a transaction to them.

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:53.413
And I think we're at the point

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.163
where the military

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:54.747
has got a very,

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:56.416
very tough decision to make.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.209
You're in Gaza.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.502
Excuse me. You're in Gaza.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:00.795
You're exposed.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:02.380
You've got Hamas all around.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.924
You still active in the tunnel

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:05.758
network system.

00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.552
It's not been completely taken over

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.637
by the Israelis. By any means.

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:10.847
And so these Israeli

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.182
soldiers are targets.

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:14.434
That's the challenge.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.268
And then at the end

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.019
of a certain amount of time,

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:18.521
as has been described

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.356
that four days could turn into five or

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:21.357
six days.

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:22.525
If they continue to

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.903
to move hostages back across into Israel,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.405
that becomes a very,

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:29.824
very tough military task.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.242
The Israelis at that point

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:33.369
are going to have to transition

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:36.372
into a defensive posture, pause.

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:37.832
There's not a military term.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.584
You attack or you defend.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.544
They're going to have to start to defend.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:44.338
That changes the mission set entirely.

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:45.423
This becomes a very,

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:46.966
very difficult

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.343
test for military commanders to execute.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:50.219
Romney,

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:50.970
is there anything

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.638
that the Israeli military

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:54.307
or Israeli government can do?

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:55.808
What can they do

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:57.268
to make sure that Hamas lives

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:58.394
up to its side of the deal?

00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:02.356
Hamas is not trustworthy.

00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:03.399
As you can understand.

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:06.486
It's a terror group run by a psychopath,

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.196
and they're going to do anything

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.363
in their power

00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:12.700
to kill Israeli soldiers and to continue

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.160
to continue

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.453
regrouping

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.705
and strengthening themselves as they can

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:20.625
But the Israeli army has already said

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.085
that if any breach of the agreement,

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:24.879
even the smallest breach.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:28.090
It will go back into fighting full force,

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:29.884
saying that

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:30.635
I don't see

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.929
the Israeli military doing that.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.681
If there's any more hostages to be had

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.393
and and and this is where we are.

00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:41.020
We are at a very

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.356
we're a very difficult situation

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.691
where this deal is a bad deal.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.360
But we have to

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.569
to go through it

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:50.571
in order to release our people.

00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:52.865
And this is our moral obligation.

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:54.784
But I mean, don't forget,

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.410
I think at the end of the day,

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.161
difficult days

00:08:57.161 --> 00:08:59.205
it might be at the end of the day,

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.749
the Israeli army will go back to fighting

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:02.833
and Israel

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:04.460
must achieve its goal

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.629
of eradicating Hamas.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.798
Rami, Retired General James Spider Marks,

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.007
thank you both for being with us

00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:10.800
very, very much.
