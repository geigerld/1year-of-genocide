00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.442
Israeli forces

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.377
with bulldozers

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.945
and jeeps entered the camp

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.713
under the cover of darkness.

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:16.349
This has become a routine

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.518
and this is the usual aftermath.

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:21.521
Wreckage and rubble, asphalt roa

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.591
plowed down to the dirt

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:26.860
Once the damage is repaired,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.194
there's another raid.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.864
And it's the same thing all over

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:34.034
For almost two years, a low inte

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.635
war has been raging

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:37.871
in the occupied West Bank.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.707
Residents here in Janine's refug

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.075
say that there have been more

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.644
than 30 Israeli military incursi

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.847
ins since August of this year.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.483
The camp is home to militants

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.718
who Israel has accused

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.120
of involvement in attacks on Isr

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:57.090
But here, those whom Israel call

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.592
terrorists are seen as fighters

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.061
against a decades long

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.563
military occupation,

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.732
with the aim Couscous is not a f

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.801
He works for the local governmen

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.069
He says the kids are.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.303
But last week, Israeli

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:11.738
soldiers took over his home

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.506
during yet another raid

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.609
As he shows me around the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:17.310
remains of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.578
what was a family's

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.713
light crunch under our shoes.

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.918
I know brutal is how Wadiya sums

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.120
the soldier's behavior.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.589
Scars of battles past pockmarked

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:30.123
the camp's

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.259
walls, debris on almost every co

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.595
I have some images.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.298
Um, Sammy shows me spent cartrid

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.200
on the floor of her house

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.002
saying Israeli troops used this 

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.205
to fire down into the street.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:46.873
I had to do it,

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:47.941
but they took

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.642
my husband, bound his hands

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.377
and pushed him outside in the co

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:52.412
She says

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:53.313
They kept him there

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:54.647
from six in the evening

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:57.150
until five in the morning.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.185
Eventually, the soldiers let him

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.055
but took away her recently marri

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.624
After ransacking his bedroom,

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.993
searching for weapons.

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:07.560
18 year

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.228
old Mahmoud

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.830
Abdulhadi was shot last Thursday

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.133
Shot through his bedroom window.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.936
His mother holding a bloodstaine

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.404
Recounts how Israeli

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:19.172
soldiers

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:20.373
wouldn't allow medics

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:24.077
to taken to hospital So I was re

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.312
I was sure we were going to the 

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.414
she says. We went downstairs.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.717
A second officer was there and m

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:32.752
the medics put the stretcher dow

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:34.554
Mahmoud bled

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:37.590
to death in front of his home.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.292
Tuesday night, Israeli forces

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.461
raided the camp again.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.563
Sparking gun battles with milita

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.032
And in the process,

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:46.833
Israeli troops

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.468
killed at least four people,

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:50.537
including this eight year old bo

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.373
And then they left

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.776
And Ben Wedeman joins us now.

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:58.611
And Ben, as we've been reporting

00:02:58.611 --> 00:02:59.412
there had been reporting

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:00.547
beginning of this year on the sh

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:02.182
the violence that we have been s

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.516
in the West Bank

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.718
pre-dates the October the sevent

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:06.886
I mean, we've seen over

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.354
260 Palestinians,

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:09.856
it seems, detained in the West B

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:10.490
since Friday.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.090
24th,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.026
and that is according to the Pal

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.261
society here prison society.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:18.464
Why are more Palestinians being 

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.036
Well, basically,

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:23.970
I mean, it really

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.471
since the 7th of October,

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:27.340
you've seen this great upsurge.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.374
Now, of course,

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.342
I think part of it is

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.877
the Israelis are nervous

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.713
about the situation in the West 

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:34.814
Let's keep in mind

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:35.715
that actually

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.784
the situation around Gaza,

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.719
except for a flare up back in

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:44.190
May of this year, has been rarel

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.793
But what we've seen is increasin

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.461
the Israeli government

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.030
has been focusing on the West Ba

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:55.201
We have no high extremist minist

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.469
in the Israeli government

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:57.937
who are pushing

00:03:57.937 --> 00:04:00.340
the idea of expanding settlement

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:03.676
empowering the settlers more, ha

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:05.245
weapons to them.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.212
So certainly

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:07.113
what we're seeing

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:07.981
is that

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:09.249
there's more unrest

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.550
among the Palestinians

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.951
who aren't happy with this.

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.554
But more than that, I think the 

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:17.190
see the situation in the West Ba

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.992
and they're trying to sort of ke

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.159
that in

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.629
the natives under control, so to

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:24.664
But increasingly, as they watch

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:26.132
what's going on in Gaza

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.167
and they have been experience

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:30.069
experiencing in recent years

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.705
this upsurge in settlement activ

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:35.375
and settler violence, keeping in

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.143
how many have been killed

00:04:37.143 --> 00:04:40.146
since the beginning of the war i

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:42.382
are almost 250.

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:44.617
It's a powder keg.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.653
And even American officials

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:47.253
have warned

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:48.021
the Israelis

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:48.788
that they have to bring

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.890
the settlers under control.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.628
And perhaps the conditions for m

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:58.765
given to Israel have to be incre

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:01.768
because of the trouble that can 

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:04.003
by the current Israeli policy

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:05.638
in the West Bank.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:06.873
You say it's a powder keg.

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:07.073
I mean,

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.074
you know, the region,

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:10.176
you know the West Bank better th

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:11.077
most journalists,

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:12.111
I think it's fair to say.

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:14.213
So I'm keen to get your sense, B

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.281
what the mood is like.

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.849
We are seeing

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.052
we've seen the past several days

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.120
Palestinians being released, a j

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:22.588
jubilant celebration.

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:25.325
Someone can't even celebrate out

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.092
Of course,

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:27.694
that's what we've been hearing

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:30.163
But if this truce is not extende

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.265
and we go back to Israel

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:33.800
trying to break the back of Hama

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.767
we've heard from the IDF

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:35.501
in the last few moments

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.136
saying they're preparing ourselv

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.305
for continuing of this fighting.

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:41.874
If that continues, what

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:44.010
what could change in the West Ba

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:47.880
Well, I think

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.214
that if

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:49.949
the fighting resumes in Gaza

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.185
and we see the kind of bloodshed

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.186
the sort of mass

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.621
killing of civilians in Gaza,

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:57.657
the situation could become

00:05:57.657 --> 00:05:59.025
even more unstable.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.126
Keep in mind

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:02.428
that it's not the Palestinian Au

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:03.730
backed by the United States

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.131
and the European Union

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:07.700
and led by Mahmoud Abbas

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.635
that's winning the freedom

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.637
of these Palestinian prisoners

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.272
and the detainees.

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:14.407
It's Hamas

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.476
and by and large,

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:19.645
the Palestinian Authority is loo

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:22.115
by most Palestinians in the West

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:25.151
as corrupt and incapable

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.987
and powerless when it comes to d

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:28.755
with the Israelis.

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:30.423
That's why, for instance, Jenin,

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:32.692
which technically is under Pales

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:34.026
Authority, control

00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:34.861
the Israelis

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:36.996
every time they go into that cit

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:38.431
they drive right in.

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:40.700
The Palestinian police,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.868
who I saw yesterday

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:44.070
when I went to Jenin, disappear.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.638
They put up no resistance.

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:46.305
So the

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:48.508
the structure, the political str

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:50.009
that was established

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.111
by the Oslo Accords, sponsored

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:53.679
by the United States,

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.848
establishing the Palestinian Aut

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:57.750
that's eroding

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.920
as the war in Gaza continues.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.788
If it continues,

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:03.122
and it probably will continue

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:05.091
in the coming days.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.660
So politically, the head

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:09.095
at the top

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.897
of the Palestinian Authority is

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:13.099
not particularly stable.
