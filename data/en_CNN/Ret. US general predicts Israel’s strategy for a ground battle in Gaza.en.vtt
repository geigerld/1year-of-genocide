00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.867
With me now,

00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.669
CNN military analyst, retired Major

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:03.903
General James Spider Marks.

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:05.438
Spider, great to see you here.

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:05.772
John,

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.774
this is the restricted area right now

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:10.310
where the Israeli military is massing.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.214
We have seen satellite images of tanks

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.217
lining up, literally lining up here,

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:17.884
preparing to go.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:19.352
I can show you where that is.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.520
This is not privileged

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.588
top secret information.

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:22.856
The Israelis have made very clear

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:23.857
where this is happening.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.693
Those pictures were taken from up here.

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:28.828
We can also assume there might be tanks

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.997
preparing elsewhere in this restricted

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:32.165
so and so, Spider.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.067
What are they doing now

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.002
and what are they getting ready to do?

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:36.536
Yeah.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.038
At this particular point, John,

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.773
what they're doing is what we call pre

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:41.041
combat checks.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.308
Individuals and teams

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:43.343
are getting ready to go.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:44.277
There's a lot of silence.

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:45.478
There's a lot of focus.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:46.413
This is business.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:47.981
Nobody's messing around.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.549
They're also doing rehearsals.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.151
What's going to take place on the ground?

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.952
They've got a scheme of maneuver.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.120
They have a plan.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.288
They're using sand,

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.990
what we call sand tables.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.158
And they're trying to figure out

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:58.958
what they're going to do.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.360
They're going to refine that.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.028
But simultaneously, they're doing

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:03.096
intelligence collection.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:03.596
We'll talk to me

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:04.898
about the intelligence collection

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:05.265
right now.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:05.732
What different

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:06.733
types of intelligence are you?

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:06.933
Yeah, well,

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.701
what they're probably using, I would

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:09.302
I would imagine,

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:10.904
is they're probably using drones.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:11.938
They want to get the drones up

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:12.338
in the air.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:13.573
They want to get the very latest

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.642
because those plans will be altered

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:17.610
based on many drones.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.911
Yeah.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.046
Imagery, imagery, intelligence

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:21.481
And the thing that they can do

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.549
at their level,

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:22.749
you know,

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.751
the individual operators can fly drones.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.019
They can get intelligence

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.253
that's going to affect them

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.055
in a very tactical way.

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:30.390
They're also probably putting

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.692
special ops teams, very small teams

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.894
across into Gaza.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.429
There's lots of chaos.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.430
There's a lot of smoke.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.231
There's a lot of haze.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.299
There's a lot of stuff going on

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.267
so they can infiltrate folks

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:44.270
to put eyes on targets as best they can.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:45.205
So I would imagine

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:46.973
that's taking place as well.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.109
And they're also tracking the cell phones

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.610
of all the Hamas leaders.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.611
Signals intelligence,

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:54.214
signals intelligence. Exactly. Correct.

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.082
And that's why they're that's why

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:56.950
there is targeting

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.885
taking place right now in southern Gaza,

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.253
because that's where a lot of the Hamas

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:01.688
leadership phones are located.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:02.589
Yeah, we were talking about that

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.956
right here.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.492
This is this is the imagery from Rafah.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:06.359
You can see where

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.727
some of those things are taking place.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:08.528
We have some video here

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.529
also of the trucks

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.997
coming over right there.

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:12.465
But as you were looking at that,

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.567
you think that they made those strikes

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:15.869
because they were following

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.337
signals intelligence. Absolutely.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.706
And you look at where Hamas was located.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.874
Look, they're not completely

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.575
and exclusively focused in the north.

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.177
Got it there throughout Gaza.

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:24.844
Let's go back.

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:26.546
I want to talk about these tanks

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:28.548
that we see preparing to go in

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:30.783
when they do make that decision to go

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:32.752
in, whether it's this weekend

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:34.320
or a few days from now,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.122
what paths do you think they'll take?

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.323
Yeah, I think what's going to happen

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.424
if it's more than just tanks,

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:39.826
these are combat arms teams.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.394
So you've got infantry

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:42.128
that's mounted,

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:43.396
you've got armor forces,

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.498
you've got artillery, etc..

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.000
And it's going to be preceded

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.501
by good intelligence.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.036
I think what they would probably do,

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.305
look, the Wadi Gaza comes through here.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:53.806
That's a river marshland.

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.241
Yeah, it's the wetlands.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.910
I think what they would do is they would

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.944
enter in from here.

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:58.678
They'd come in on

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.847
multiple axes of advance.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:01.948
They'd come in from the north.

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:03.183
Of course they'd come in here.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.151
And also, Israel has a navy.

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:05.552
They've got

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:06.486
what's called Corvettes,

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.755
which are small, smaller attack ships.

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:10.690
They've got 45 patrol boats

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.658
and they've got 10,000

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.126
sailors on active duty.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:15.228
I would also anticipate activity

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:16.095
that would look like this,

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.364
because what Israeli Israel wants to do

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:21.768
you want to secure this combat zone,

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.636
you want to secure the perimeter,

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:24.604
and then you go,

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:26.606
all these units will link up,

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:28.208
go to the same place, link up

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.176
then you begin the operation

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:32.512
to go after very specific targets.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.314
And those targets, John,

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:35.982
are really the political

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:38.284
and military leaders of Hamas people,

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.587
the people they want to go after them.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:41.654
And I think they would

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:42.455
probably have either

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:44.023
a kill or capture mission

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.091
in this particular case.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.826
I would imagine it's a kill mission.

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:47.327
Second thing,

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:47.760
they want to go

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.129
after is the tunnel complex,

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.332
which is extensive, as you realize.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:53.800
I can show you

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.034
they're going to lose this.

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:55.935
This is a map of what

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.003
the tunnels look like

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:59.839
in 2021 is some time ago

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.874
they've probably expanded and redone it.

00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:02.609
But you can see

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.710
some of the tunnel imagery

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.143
that was there

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:06.579
that that is the most difficult task

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.614
that they have to take on.

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:09.249
This is urban terrain

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.718
with the subterranean peace

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:14.654
and Israel has got to identify,

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:16.022
they have to deny

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.824
and they have to destroy those tunnels.

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:21.728
That is a man combat suck.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.696
That's going to draw people into it.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.098
This is going to be a difficult,

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.032
difficult fight.

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:26.833
All right, Spider,

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:27.967
thank you so much

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.469
for explaining all this.

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.471
Don't go far because obviously,

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:32.805
you know, more things could be happening

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:34.540
very, very soon. Thank you very much.
