00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
AND TO BEN WEDEMAN, IN SOUTHERN 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.572
LEBANON, THE SCALE OF THIS CALL 

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.273
FOR EVACUATION BY THE IDF, 

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:09.209
ESTIMATED TO BE MORE THAN A 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.676
MILLION PEOPLE.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:13.513
WHAT'S THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THIS 

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:14.047
ACTUALLY HAPPENING?

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.548
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IT'S GOING TO BE 

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:16.716
VERY DIFFICULT, FIRST OF ALL, 

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:19.352
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE SHEER 

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:25.992
NUMBER OF PEOPLE, PERHAPS 

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:26.726
1.1 MILLION PEOPLE A SITUATION 

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:27.727
WHERE THERE'S VERY LITTLE FUEL, 

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:30.530
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE, WHERE ARE 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.599
THEY GOING TO GO, WHERE ARE THEY

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.933
GOING TO BE HOUSED?

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:34.968
THE U.N. AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.470
ORGANIZATIONS IN GAZA ARE SAYING

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.639
IT'S SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE GIVEN 

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:40.507
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND THE 

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.876
CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE'S AN ACTIVE

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:43.143
WAR.

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:44.744
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO JUST MOVE 

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:48.114
IN THE STREET, SO MOVING 

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.050
1.1 MILLION PEOPLE FROM NORTHERN

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.051
GAZA TO SOUTHERN PART IS 

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:54.254
SOMETHING THAT'S HARD TO IMAGINE

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.689
BEING DONE ON PRACTICAL TERMS.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.124
NOW, I'VE BEEN IN GAZA BEFORE, 

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.759
FOR INSTANCE, IN 2014 THE 

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:00.994
ISRAELIS ORDERED THE EVACUATION 

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.696
OF CIVILIANS FROM NORTHERN 

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.799
COMMUNITIES, ONES NEAR THE 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:06.733
ISRAELI BORDER.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.435
FOR THE MOST PART PEOPLE WERE 

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.436
ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU 

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.804
COULD GET OUT BY WALKING, YOU 

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.906
COULD GET OUT BY RIDING ON A 

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.007
DONKEY CART, PERHAPS, IF YOU 

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.910
COULD GET A CAR RIDE OUT.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.513
BUT THAT WAS RELATIVELY SMALL 

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.615
NUMBERS COMPARED TO GAZA CITY.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.217
GAZA CITY IS HUGE.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.285
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO PUT ALL 

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.120
THESE PEOPLE WHEN YOU MOVE THEM 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.621
SOUTH WHEN NONE OF THE RELIEF 

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.724
SUPPLIES, TENTS, FOOD, WATER, 

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:32.659
MEDICINE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED INTO 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:33.526
THE GAZA STRIP.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.395
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE 

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.830
HOW THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE DONE.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.065
AND HAMAS IS CALLING ON PEOPLE 

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:42.268
TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES, TO STAY 

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:42.602
PUT.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.038
SO, THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY 

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:46.506
DIFFICULT, AND CERTAINLY IF 

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:49.175
PEOPLE DO NOT OR CANNOT EVACUATE

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.944
THOSE AREAS, THE ISRAELIS ARE 

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:54.581
CALLING THEM TO LEAVE, AND THIS 

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:54.981
CALLING THEM TO LEAVE, AND THIS 

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.617
GROUND OFFENSIVE GOES AHEAD, 

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.886
PROBABILITY IS, IT WILL BE A 

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:04.657
BLOOD BATH. 

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:06.392
&gt;&gt; BEN WEDEMAN JOINING US IN 

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.861
SOUTHERN LEBANON, BEN, THANK YOU

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:08.228
VERY MUCH.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.163
AND JOINING US NOW TO GET MORE 

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:11.698
OF THESE QUESTIONS ANSWERED, I 

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:13.800
DO, F SPOKESMAN LIEUTENANT 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.402
COLONEL PETER LEARNER, COLONEL, 

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.638
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AGAIN 

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:19.305
THIS MORNING AS ALWAYS.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.007
I WANT TO ASK YOU FOR 

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.809
CONFIRMATION ON WHAT HAMAS IS 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.744
CLAIMING, THAT 13 ISRAELI 

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:26.112
PRISONERS TAKEN HOSTAGE DURING 

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:27.614
THE WEEKEND'S ATTACK, THEY ARE 

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:28.481
CLAIMING THEY HAVE BEEN KILLED 

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:32.819
IN GAZA BY ISRAELI BOMBINGS.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.587
HAS THE IDF CONFIRMED THOSE 

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:34.921
DEATHS?

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:35.155
?

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.623
I CAN'T CONFIRM THOSE, AND WE 

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:37.557
HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS WITH 

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.325
EVERYTHING HAMAS IS SAYING.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:43.363
AND THEIR PROPAGANDA EFFORTS ARE

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:43.730
EXTENSIVE.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.031
THIS MORNING WE ARE CONTINUING 

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.433
OUR ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE HAMAS

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.969
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, AND 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:50.703
THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT 

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:53.840
THE GAZA STRIP, SPECIFICALLY WE 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.176
ARE TARGETING SPECIAL OPERATIONS

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.178
CAPABILITIES, WE'VE TAKEN UP 

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.013
THEIR DRONE CAPABILITIES.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.415
THEY HAD ATTACK DRONES THAT WERE

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:04.817
POSEN AND PREPARED TO BE 

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.519
LAUNCHED AT ISRAEL BUT WE'VE 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.620
TAKEN SOME OF THOSE OUT AND 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.822
WE'RE CONTINUING OUR EFFORT TO 

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:12.091
MAKE SURE HAMAS CAN NEVER, EVER 

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.459
THREATEN ISRAEL AGAIN AND THEY 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.495
CANNOT BE PERMITTED TO DO SO. 

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:18.498
&gt;&gt; YOU DO NOT HAVE CONFIRMATION 

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:21.367
OF WHAT HAMAS IS CLAIMING THERE.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.168
DO YOU HAVE ANY UPDATE ON THE 

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.102
CONDITION OF ALL OF THE 

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.938
HOSTAGES, ANY OF THEM THAT ARE 

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:25.805
BEING HELD?

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.908
&gt;&gt; WELL, TO MY KNOWLEDGE THEY'VE

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:29.876
NOT RELEASED ANY INFORMATION 

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:34.214
EXCEPT FOR DISINFORMATION, AND 

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.850
WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT VERY 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.251
CAUTIOUSLY.

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:39.686
THE SITUATION IS AS SUCH, WE 

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:40.820
BELIEVE THAT HAMAS ARE 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.188
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.156
WELL-BEING OF ALL OF THE 

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:44.691
HOSTAGES THAT THEY'VE TAKEN, AND

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.125
THEY NEED TO RETURN THEM 

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:47.327
IMMEDIATELY, THEY NEED TO 

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.229
RELEASE THEM TO ISRAEL.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.430
AND THEY WILL PAY THE 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.199
CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.568
THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND, 

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.904
OBVIOUSLY, IS A COMPLICATED ONE,

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.872
AND WE'RE TAKING OPERATING IN 

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:00.807
CAUTION WITH REGARD TO THE 

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:01.741
HOSTAGE SITUATION AND OF COURSE 

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:06.145
IT IS INFLUENCING OUR 

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:08.081
OPERATIONAL GAME PLAN. 

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.682
&gt;&gt; HOW IS IT INFLUENCING IT?

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:11.351
IS IT CAUSING THE IDF NOT TO 

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:13.386
TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS AT THIS 

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:16.756
MOMENT, THAT IT WOULD OTHERWISE 

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:17.123
TAKE?

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:18.925
&gt;&gt; I OBVIOUSLY WON'T ELABORATE 

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.793
ON OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS, 

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.428
BUT DEFINITELY IT IS PART OF THE

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:23.796
PLANNING PROCESS, AND WE DO NEED

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:26.332
TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION.

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:26.699
&gt;&gt; OKAY. 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.234
&gt;&gt; OUR PRIORITY IS TO RETURN 

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:31.638
THEM HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:35.775
&gt;&gt; THE ORDER FROM RECOMMENDATION

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:38.144
FROM ISRAEL FOR ABOUT 

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:39.245
1.1 MILLION PEOPLE ACCORDING TO 

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:42.115
THE U.N. TO MOVE OUT OF NORTHERN

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:42.782
GAZA, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME 

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.684
REPORTS OF A TIME FRAME PUT ON 

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:44.984
THAT.

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.352
IS THERE A TIME FRAME THAT THE 

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:49.589
IDF HAS PUT ON THAT?

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:53.159
&gt;&gt; SO, THE ORDERS IS TO EVACUATE

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.060
IMMEDIATELY, AND I WOULD HIGHLY 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.730
RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE ADHERE TO 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.500
THAT INSTRUCTION BECAUSE THE 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.635
MILITARY IS DETERMINED TO TAKE 

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:07.640
OUT HAMAS'S CAPABILITIES, THEY 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.676
OPERATE FROM A STRONGHOLD WITHIN

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:11.811
GAZA AND GAZA CITY AND THEY CAN 

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:18.084
NO LONGER BE UTILIZE THAT AREA.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:19.786
IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE AND 

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:21.754
MITIGATE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, 

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:22.555
THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN ASKING 

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:24.824
US OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS,

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.326
WHAT ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN 

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.827
CORRIDOR, THIS IS PART OF THE 

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:28.861
HUMANITARIAN EFFORT SO THAT 

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.730
PEOPLE WILL NOT BE INFLUENCED 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.765
MORE THAN THEY HAVE TO BE IN 

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:33.266
THIS CONFLICT.

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:36.102
HAMAS, UNFORTUNATELY IS CALLING 

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:37.003
ON THE OTHER HAND, NO, PEOPLE, 

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:40.039
DO NOT EVACUATE, STAY AND 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:40.807
SACRIFICE YOURSELF.

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:43.576
HAMAS HAS NO REGARD FOR HUMAN 

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.011
LIFE, ISRAELI OR PALESTINIAN.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.779
THEY WILL SACRIFICE EVERYBODY AS

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:47.814
THEY ARE PROVING TIME AND TIME 

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:48.147
AGAIN. 

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:51.684
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS, IS THERE A 

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.986
SAFE WINDOW FOR ALL OF THOSE 

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:55.388
PEOPLE, A MILLION PLUS PEOPLE TO

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:56.255
EVACUATE TO THE SOUTH?

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:57.590
THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS IT IS, 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.258
QUOTE, IMPOSSIBLE FOR SUCH A 

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.027
MOVEMENT TO TAKE PLACE WITHOUT 

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.528
DEVASTATING HUMANITARIAN 

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:05.865
CONSEQUENCES, AS THESE AIR 

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:06.632
STRIKES CONTINUE. 

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:07.867
&gt;&gt; HERE'S WHAT WE DO.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:11.571
WHEN WE SAW A THREAT ON THE 

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.539
BORDER WITH GAZA WE EVACUATED 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.007
THE PEOPLE FROM THE BORDER FROM 

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:15.341
GAZA.

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:18.845
WHAT IS HAMAS DOING?

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:19.946
THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:20.546
S

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:21.514
SACRIFICING THEM, STAY PUT.

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:23.516
THE IDF IS COMING.

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:26.018
WE ARE OPERATING EXTENSIVELY.

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:27.253
WHEN THEY PLACE THEIR OFFENSIVE 

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:28.755
DRONES, STRIKE DRONES, SUICIDE 

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:30.790
DRONES ON THE ROOFS OF HOUSES, 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.524
THEY ARE JEOPARDIZING EVERYBODY 

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:33.025
IN THAT HOUSE, THEY DON'T CARE.

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:34.193
SO WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE, 

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:36.129
EVACUATE THIS AREA, BECAUSE WE 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.964
ARE OPERATING, WE PLAN ON 

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:39.399
BROADENING THE SCOPE OF OUR 

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.534
OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE 

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:41.901
OUR GOAL. 

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:46.472
&gt;&gt; COLONEL, I'M GOING TO MOVE 

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.708
ON, IS THERE A WINDOW OF SAFETY.

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:51.477
THE U.N. HAS SAID 24 HOURS, FOR 

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:52.178
EXAMPLE, IS THERE A WINDOW OF 

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:53.646
SAFETY WHEN THIS EVACUATION -- 

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:54.380
&gt;&gt; I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.950
THE EVACUATION TAKES PLACE 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:58.351
IMMEDIATELY.

00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:00.653
THE WINDOW OF -- THE 24 HOURS 

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:04.090
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.791
HIGHLY RECOMMENDATION, BUT IT 

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:07.026
COULD GO ON BEYOND THAT BUT I 

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:08.761
WOULD SAY THE INSTRUCTION IS GET

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.563
UP, AND GET OUT OF THE NORTH OF 

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:13.065
GAZA AND GAZA CITY AND MOVE TO 

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:13.466
THE SOUTH. 

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.101
&gt;&gt; AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, THOUGH,

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.303
MOVE TO THE SOUTH, BUT THERE IS 

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:21.073
STILL NO CROSSING OUT OF GAZA 

00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:23.242
FOR THEM?

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:25.478
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE'RE DIRECTING THEM 

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.814
EXACTLY WHERE WE EXPECT THEM NOT

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.348
TO BE WHERE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO 

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:31.884
SAFEGUARD THEIR OWN LIVES SHOULD

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:32.919
MOVE FROM.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.654
NOT TO GO INTO EGYPT OR ANYTHING

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:36.722
LIKE THAT, BUT THEY SHOULD NOT 

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:38.891
BE IN THE AREA WHICH WE 

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:40.026
DESIGNATED AND HAVE TOLD THEM 

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:40.460
SPECIFICALLY.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.395
THIS IS LIKE A FOREWARNING OF 

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:44.063
WHERE WE'RE OPERATING, 

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:45.631
FOREWARNING OF WHERE IT'S GOING 

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:48.100
TO BE MORE EXTENSIVE COMBAT, 

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.469
WHERE THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.770
EXTENSIVE STRIKES, YOU KNOW, 

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.339
THIS IS THE WHOLE IDEA OF TRYING

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.641
TO MAKE SAFEGUARD PEOPLE'S 

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:55.942
LIVES.

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:57.710
THE INSTRUCTION TO LEAVE IS TO 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.645
SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES SO THEY 

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:02.114
SHOULD LEAVE FROM THE NORTH OF 

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:03.549
GAZA, FROM GAZA CITY AND GO TO 

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:07.320
THE SOUTH OF THE CITY, OF THE 

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.689
GAZA WADI, AND THEY SHOULD -- 

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.958
THEY SHOULD SET UP THERE.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.759
IF THEY STAY, THEY ARE 

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:14.794
JEOPARDIZING THEMSELVES, THIS IS

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:16.395
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:17.763
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE 

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:18.431
CONSIDERATIONS, THERE ARE 

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.699
PROBLEMS, OF COURSE, I WOULD SAY

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:21.033
HAMAS NEED TO DEAL WITH ALL OF 

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.668
THOSE PROBLEMS, OF HOW TO SHIP 

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:23.736
PEOPLE FROM THE NORTH TO THE 

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:25.738
SOUTH, LIKE WE DID, WE TOOK 

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:26.939
PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOUSES IN THE 

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:29.208
SOUTH OF ISRAEL AND WE MOVED 

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:31.043
THEM ELSEWHERE.

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:32.445
AND HAMAS SHOULD HAVE THE 

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:33.112
RESPONSIBILITY, RATHER THAN 

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:34.647
FAILING THE PEOPLE OF GAZA, THEY

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:36.282
SHOULD HELP THE PEOPLE OF GAZA. 

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:39.418
&gt;&gt; COLONEL, I THINK THE QUESTION

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:41.020
BECOMES, FOR HOW LONG CAN THEY 

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.055
REMAIN IN THE SOUTH?

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:44.657
WILL AN ORDER LIKE ISRAEL HAS 

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:46.158
GIVEN IN THE NORTH THEN COME TO 

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:49.629
THEM IN THE SOUTH?

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:52.665
IF THERE IS NO CROSSING THAT 

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:52.999
OPENS. 

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:55.368
&gt;&gt; OUR OPERATION IS FOCUSED 

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.769
TOWARDS HAMAS, NOT TO THE PEOPLE

00:08:56.769 --> 00:08:58.938
OF GAZA, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF 

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:01.941
GAZA ARE NOT OUR ENEMY, THE 

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:05.011
HAMAS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION HAS

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:08.180
BUTCHERED OVER A THOUSAND, 200 

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.182
PEOPLE, AND ISRAEL CANNOT BE 

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:12.084
PERMITTED TO GOVERN THE GAZA 

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.753
STRIP AND USE IT AS A STAGING 

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:14.453
GROUND AGAINST ISRAEL.

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:16.155
WHEN WE RECOMMEND TO THE PEOPLE 

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:17.123
OF GAZA GO TO THE SOUTH, YOU 

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:18.591
SHOULD LISTEN, GO TO THE SOUTH, 

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.794
DO NOT STAY IN GAZA CITY, DO NOT

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:23.429
STAY IN THE NORTH, AND YES, 

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:24.564
EVERYBODY SHOULD LISTEN TO THAT 

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.298
RECOMMENDATION.
