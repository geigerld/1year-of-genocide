00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.068
I want to bring in CNN's Katie Bo Lillis.

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:03.837
She's got new reporting that U.S.

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:06.039
intelligence did have some warnings

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.874
about a prospect

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:09.976
of more violence here from Hamas.

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:12.212
Just days before Saturday's

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.646
surprise attack came out.

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:14.881
What did these reports say?

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.449
How specific were they?

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.784
Yeah, so, Anderson, what we have learned

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.252
is that the intelligence community

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:20.153
was circulating

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:20.653
a pair

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.522
of two separate intelligence assessments

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.290
just in the days leading into October

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.892
seven, a devastating attack.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:27.894
One of them on September 28th

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:28.561
warned based on

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.996
multiple streams of intelligence

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:32.399
that Hamas was poised to escalate

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.666
with some cross-border

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.368
rocket fire into Israel.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.204
A separate October 5th wire from the CIA

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:39.806
warned sort of generally

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.841
of the of increasing possibility

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.109
by the increasing

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.544
possibility of violence by Hamas.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:44.911
But, Anderson,

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:45.678
I think
what's really important

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:46.379
to understand here

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.047
is that

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.448
none of these two

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.517
none of neither of these two reports

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.185
provided any sort of specific

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.319
tactical detail

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.622
about the size, scope, scale

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:56.856
brutality of the attack

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:59.859
that actually did occur on October seven.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.094
So they were these sort of

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:01.895
kind of high level

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.063
warnings that, you know, look,

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.131
that the tensions in between

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.167
sort of Palestinian militant groups

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:08.835
and and Israel are growing.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:09.969
There's an increased possibility

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:10.804
for violence,

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:11.738
but they weren't offering

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.706
any sort of specific evidence

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:14.841
of the planning

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.309
for the attack that actually unfolded

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.010
on Saturday.

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:19.479
Do we know

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.747
if those reports were passed

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:21.948
on to Israeli intelligence

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:22.916
or I mean,

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:23.316
it sounds like

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:24.484
it didn't really sound

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:25.919
any particular alarm bells

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.954
because it kind of sounded like, well,

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:29.255
there may be more rocket attacks,

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.257
but not nothing really too specific.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.225
Yeah.
So this is the

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.393
the important thing to understand.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:33.927
The nuance here,

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:34.494
to understand

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:35.128
here, Anderson, is

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:35.762
there's a big difference

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.964
in between sort of strategic warning

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.933
and kind of more kind of tactical

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:40.900
warning about, okay, here's

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.569
exactly what's about to happen.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.037
And so this was certainly kind of

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.638
in the in the camp of strategic warning.

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:46.473
Right.
And I think

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:47.407
based on what our sources

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:47.907
are telling us,

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.342
for a lot of officials

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:51.377
who were reading this intelligence,

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:51.811
you know,

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.179
they were interpreting it

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.880
correctly is like,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.681
look, there's, you know,

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:55.748
heightened tensions in the region.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:56.950
There's something to be concerned about.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.485
Something could happen here.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:01:59.119
But they

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.154
they were sort of viewing this as likely

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.022
another round of cross-border

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:03.723
rocket fire.

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:05.792
You know,
maybe the Iron Dome intercepts

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.161
some missiles, maybe Israel retaliates.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.929
You know,
maybe we even see something as dramatic

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.731
as the clash that took place in 20, 21

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.099
between Hamas and Israel.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.868
But they weren't in any way

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:16.803
sort of imagining that these warnings

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:17.837
were indicating

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:20.473
something of the size and scale

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.541
of what we did see on Saturday.

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.742
As for whether or not this was shared

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:24.611
with Israeli officials,

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.546
but because the United States

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:28.214
doesn't do a lot of its own

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.883
intelligence collection inside Gaza,

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.951
it really
relies on Israel

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.453
to do a lot of that sort of raw

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.021
reporting and a lot of that collection.

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.656
It just sort of takes the information

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.125
and then analyzes it for itself.

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:40.560
Many of the officials that we spoke

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.362
to said it wouldn't necessarily

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.731
be indicated for the U.S.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.632
to sort of turn around

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.267
and share these reports

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.635
or share these sort of assessments

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:49.235
with Israel.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.237
Again,
because much of the raw information

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.672
in these intelligence assessments

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.440
was coming from Israel in the first place

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.842
and Israel wasn't

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:56.609
raising these alarm

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.810
bells with the United States

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:00.446
Katie Butler, those

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.681
appreciate the reporting. Thank you.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:02.582
Joining me now

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.217
to talk
more about this

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.718
and other things happening in

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:06.753
the region is Mark Esper.

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:07.787
He was defense secretary

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:08.521
under President Trump,

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:09.422
is author of the book

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:10.623
A Sacred Oath

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.492
Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:14.227
during Extraordinary Times.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:14.794
Secretary Esper,

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:16.329
appreciate you joining us.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.430
First of all, what do you make of this,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.698
this new information about U.S.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.400
intelligence warning

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.368
that something

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.203
may be happening,

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.705
some uptick, not too specific.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:26.673
What do you.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.674
Should it have been caught?

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:30.476
Should that have raised more alarms?

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.778
It's very interesting.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:33.713
I'm not surprised that we had some type

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.716
of intelligence at that level.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:39.018
I am a little surprised that there

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:40.153
wasn't more preparation

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:41.988
taking taking on the Israeli end,

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:43.923
if you will, to,

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:44.524
you know,

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:45.725
heighten the security level

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.760
along the fence line, the border line

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.062
between Israel and Gaza.

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:52.098
I think there have been two failures.

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:53.266
If you look at the situation

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:53.833
now, one has been

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.101
the intelligence failure.

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:56.302
But the second one is

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:58.304
a military readiness failure.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:58.972
To

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:00.240
step up

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.341
patrols, surveillance

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:04.043
or whatnot along the along the border.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.478
So that look, that

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:06.546
there will be time for that later.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.548
But that's kind of what jumps to my mind

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:10.516
when we talk about this

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:12.318
Yeah.
And as you said,

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:13.386
I mean, time for that later.

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.154
But CNN did do a report

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:18.224
just the board was looking at

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:20.860
what the Hamas, the training videos

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.328
they were putting out

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:25.531
and geolocated a site that they built

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:28.334
which mirrored a Israeli

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.636
settler community

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:30.837
that they were doing

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:31.704
training on

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:33.573
that was very close to one of the major

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:35.041
border crossings

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.343
and was visible from the air.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:38.344
It's remarkable

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:40.980
that that Israel did not pick up

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.449
any real signs of this operation,

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.451
which was clearly planned

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:46.986
for a very long period of time

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.022
involving many, many different people.

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.225
Yeah, that was a very interesting report.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.793
And I read it with some

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.194
a good deal of curiosity

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:56.696
that it would go back that far.

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:58.731
And it was should have been visible.

00:04:59.332 --> 00:04:59.799
Like I said,

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.334
I think there will be time later

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:02.869
they'll go back and really dig into this.

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:04.203
I think the immediate question

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:04.804
when you

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:06.706
look at these pieces of information

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:09.409
that should have been assessed is clearly

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.611
there was a blind spot. Blind spot.

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.946
And as you go into this next phase

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:14.614
where you're looking

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:16.816
at a military incursion into Gaza

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.051
and maybe some other things,

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:19.552
I do think you want to make a quick check

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:20.853
to make sure that this blind spots

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.088
are no longer there.

00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:23.356
And so I think there is a need

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.757
for an immediate assessment

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:26.159
as to what happened and why.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.261
And then you can dig later, kind of

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.729
pull each and every thread later.

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.630
But that would be

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.297
my concern is

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:32.432
what what didn't

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:33.766
we see over the past year

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.268
and why didn't we see it

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:36.936
and have we rectified that

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.304
before we step into these next

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:39.439
phases of the operation?

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:41.808
I want to ask

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:42.141
you what

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:43.843
you think about the idea

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.611
of of a million

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.814
residents in Gaza moving south

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.917
in a 24 hour period, which is what Israel

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:52.518
is is

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.319
telling people to do,

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.253
they dropping leaflets.

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:56.322
Do you have a number of humanitarian

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.424
organizations saying this is impossible

00:05:58.658 --> 00:05:59.859
it's going to lead

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.527
to catastrophic consequences?

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.262
Hamas is saying don't leave.

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:03.730
I understand

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:04.697
militarily why

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:05.598
they would not want

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:06.933
the civilian population to leave.

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:08.267
They want to use them

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:12.038
as much as possible as human shields

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:14.140
Have you seen mass migrations of people

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.574
like that?

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.442
Is that possible?

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:19.679
Moving a million

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:21.848
people in 24 hours is a difficult task.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:23.649
But I've also never seen

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.818
a military on the cusp of an invasion

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:27.720
give a warning

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.589
to the adversaries that they're coming in

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.492
and to allow cities in some time,

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:34.527
if you will, to flee.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.929
Look, it's a tough situation.

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:37.830
It was a situation

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.166
brought on by these atrocious, terrible,

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:41.734
barbaric terrorist acts

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:44.537
by Hamas, killing over 1300

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.873
Israelis, murdering, raping

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:48.474
slaughtering children, the elderly.

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.076
And now on top of that.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:50.610
We know that

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.380
we have 130 250 hostages in Gaza.

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:55.715
I'd like to see these U.N.

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.250
agencies come out and demand

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.252
that Hamas release the hostages.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.287
That would be a great gesture as well.

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:04.590
But look, it's a tough situation.

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:07.460
Israel has every right to proceed,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.662
and I think they'll do so professionally.

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:11.898
And I think they've given fair warning.

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:13.666
And then I think, look,

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:14.467
I'm in favor

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:16.502
of opening up a humanitarian corridor

00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:17.136
in the south,

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:19.071
but I would limit that to women, children

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.339
and the elderly

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:21.874
and try and address

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:23.142
that side of the problem. That way.

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:27.713
In terms of the fight ahead.

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:28.548
How difficult

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:30.016
do you think it's going to be?

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:30.516
Obviously,

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:31.818
there's the civilian component.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:34.353
There's the hostages to think about

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:35.788
and just operating

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:38.825
in an urban environment like Gaza City.

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:42.361
I mean, it is a a warren of streets

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:45.097
and it is densely packed.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:46.499
It's

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:47.133
how difficult

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.101
from your perspective is it?

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:50.236
Very difficult.

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:52.104
You know,
first of all, at the strategic level,

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:54.273
every every day or moment, the passes

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:55.341
you have to make sure

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:56.542
that you don't create a second

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.144
front with Hezbollah in the north. Right.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.178
You don't want to fight

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.913
two fronts at the same time.

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:01.948
Of course, on top of that,

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:02.849
as we already addressed,

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:03.783
you have hostages.

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:05.117
And so will Hamas

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:06.486
follow through on their threats to begin

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.387
executing hostages?

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.323
Israelis and Americans, by the way,

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.124
we think they have a few Americans

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:13.926
as a as this proceeds

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:15.094
at the tactical level,

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:17.296
urban warfare is very, very difficult.

00:08:17.296 --> 00:08:18.998
I know from my time in the Army

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.067
during the Gulf War, as we faced

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:21.868
urban areas,

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.903
it can consume a lot of troops

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:24.570
very quickly.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.938
So I think part of what

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:27.139
Israel is doing right now

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:29.575
by flattening buildings and pummeling

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:32.512
the area is really trying to reduce

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:33.212
the amount

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:34.614
of places and spaces

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:35.748
and floors and doors.

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:36.516
Every place

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.884
that Hamas can hide

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:38.551
to ambush

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:39.218
Israeli troops

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:40.386
as they come through

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:41.854
and try and clear out the areas

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.456
they try to uncover

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.924
you know,
the subterranean networks

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:47.193
that Hamas has built underneath Gaza.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.861
But it's it's it's really difficult.

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.263
It can consume a lot of troops

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:51.764
even if they're not killed or injured.

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:52.765
You just have to leave troops

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.500
behind to protect the space.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.768
Part of my concern here

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:57.603
is that maybe the lack of action

00:08:57.603 --> 00:08:59.205
by Hezbollah in the north

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.541
isn't
because they've made a strategic decision

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.509
to sit the conflict out,

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:04.210
but maybe they made

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.511
an operational decision

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:06.979
to execute some

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:09.315
to to execute some patience

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:10.149
and wait

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:12.251
until the IDF gets really entrenched

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:13.920
in Gaza.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.820
It's bogged down.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.355
And then they start,

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:17.924
you know, something in the north.

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:19.892
And that would be an operational matter,

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.394
which I'm
sure the IDF is considering

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.428
very carefully. As well.

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:26.232
Yeah.
Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper,

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:26.999
thank you for your time.
