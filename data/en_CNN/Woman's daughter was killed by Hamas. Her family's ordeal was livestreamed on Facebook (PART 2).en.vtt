00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.501
They put us on the ground and

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.919
said, Stay here, don't move.

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:05.922
If you move, you're dead.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.426
And they took all the knives

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:10.719
that we had

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.764
said, Don't do anything stupid.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.266
And

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.144
meanwhile, your l my my kid,

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:23.231
my, my 11 year old, she started

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.483
communicating with the commander,

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:28.319
asking him, why are you doing this?

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.863
Why did you kill my sister?

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:30.947
And he said, You're.

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:31.448
Don't worry.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.908
Your sister is with Allah.

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:35.076
She's safe now.

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.494
She's with Allah.

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:39.039
Zaki, all this time cannot talk.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.415
He's shocked.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:41.791
He's not functioning.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:45.712
Because he saw his kid dead.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.589
And it was just holding his head

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.882
and crying.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.341
And I was looking at him.

00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.092
And, you know,

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:54.012
when you have this impression

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:57.307
of nothing behind it, it was like that.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:02.228
So he is one of the strongest men I know.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.814
Every time I did something happens.

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:07.650
He's the one that holds the situation.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.819
It

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:10.737
it was

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.114
it was painful to see him like that.

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:15.366
And then they said, okay.

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.284
You and you.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:17.952
And they were pointing at something.

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:19.454
And in the movie

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:21.581
he said, you when you get up,

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.374
you're coming with us.

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:26.377
And they cuffed his hand with

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.380
white stripes and barefooted also,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.256
I think.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.050
And they said,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.426
okay, you're coming with us.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.136
And they took them.

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:37.972
They were in front of the back door.

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:40.225
They asked, whose car is it?

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:43.645
And he said, This is my car.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:45.855
To us, they said, okay, stay.

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:48.817
Stay on the ground or you will be killed.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:52.987
We'll shoot you or you be dead.

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.322
So we stayed.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:57.951
We told our husbands.

00:01:58.034 --> 00:01:59.202
Listen me, we said.

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:00.703
We said we love you. Don't.

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:02.372
Don't do anything stupid.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:03.790
Don't be a hero.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.669
Just do what they say, please.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.129
And the kids started yelling.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:09.879
Don't take him. Do.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.464
Thank you. And?

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.174
And they said, No, no, it's okay.

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:14.801
He'll be back. He'll be back.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.427
They promised the kids.

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:18.513
He would be back.

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:21.057
We couldn't do anything.

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:24.936
And he was into, I think,

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.938
530 in the afternoon

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:30.692
that that we heard people

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:34.863
talking around us, you know, and we just

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.031
looked outside, peeked outside.

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.909
Yishai peeked outside and said, there

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:40.577
there's somebody is

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:42.078
walking around the house.

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:42.579
They said,

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.831
child, child, which is IDF, IDF.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.542
They're are actually our saviors.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:50.545
They took us out of the house, actually.

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:52.255
But the kids didn't want to go.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.381
They said, Please,

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.883
I don't want anybody else

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:56.551
to be dead in this house.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:57.552
I don't want

00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:59.762
anybody else getting murdered.

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.514
The kids didn't want to go.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.558
It took me

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:04.767
20 minutes

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:07.604
outside the kibbutz just to breathe

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.731
because I couldn't breathe all the way.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.151
I am shackled on me and yelled near me.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.153
And we went.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:18.156
We went out like this.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:18.990
Sorry.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.200
Your 11 year old daughter

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.367
and your nine year old son,

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.287
as and Taki had already been taken.

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:25.330
Already been kidnaped?

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.663
Yeah.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:26.998
And my son, your daughter.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:27.999
Was dead and her.

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.375
Body was left in the house.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:30.877
It was left in the house.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:31.419
I couldn't.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.837
They didn't let us go there.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.590
We asked them to go to see my son,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.466
the terrorists.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:36.925
They didn't

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.384
let me see my, my,

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.595
my daughter before I went.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.388
They didn't.

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.682
I couldn't.

00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:46.059
I couldn't say goodbye.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.643
I couldn't.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.062
She stayed there for three days

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.230
and her body.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.398
Yes, in a pile of blood,

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.816
you know, on the floor.

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:55.360
Your kids, your Elisha, her.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.111
They're okay.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:57.528
Fine.

00:03:57.528 --> 00:03:58.279
Okay.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:03.117
Look, you tell me.

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:06.579
It's like sanity in insanity.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:07.121
It's.

00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:10.792
It's one day's up and one days down.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.293
They cry, they miss.

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:14.295
They're dead.

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:15.755
They're nine and 11 years old.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:18.758
Yes. They are.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.385
We buried, man.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.804
A week and a half ago,

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:23.680
they were there,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.514
and it was

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.016
I think they had to do it for the closure

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:29.060
because I don't think you understand

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.896
at that age death.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:34.065
I don't think you understand

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:38.152
that your sister is dead without seeing.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:41.447
And actually, I hope they didn't see

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:45.159
the funeral was some kind of closure

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.203
and they missed her.

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.455
She painted a picture that he.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:50.498
Could bury.

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:54.335
With with Marianne in jail was really,

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:57.338
really, you know,

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.048
quiet and

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:02.427
and and didn't want to come.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.721
They didn't want to see it.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.015
It was a closed casket, of course,

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:07.682
you can see it.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.517
And they wanted to hug her.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:10.351
And they wanted

00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:14.439
to, you know, just better hair

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:16.566
her curls and hold.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:17.150
Her hand.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.276
And they couldn't.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.777
Their older sister.

00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:21.195
Yes.

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:23.239
And they they admired her.

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.907
She was a loving kind.

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:26.409
She was a ray of light.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.203
She was pure, pure good.

00:05:29.203 --> 00:05:31.873
Seriously, she was so good.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:32.915
I don't know. Understand.

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:34.167
How can you kill?

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.793
It's like killing a unicorn.

00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:36.586
You can never.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:40.715
Kill a unicorn.

00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:45.261
But now we're really united and focused

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:48.556
about bringing Saki's Suzuki home

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:49.640
alive and well.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.475
What do you think?

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:51.434
Is it

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.853
Is it hopeful that he will come home?

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.563
Yeah, he will come home.

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:59.567
He will come home to us. Yes. He has to.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.777
Alive and well.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:04.739
Yes, the way he got out.

00:06:04.822 --> 00:06:06.074
I hope so.

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.575
I know he will.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:08.951
I'll do anything.

00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:12.205
Anything in my power

00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:13.998
or everybody's power.

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:14.832
I will use

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:18.378
everybody's power just to bring him and

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:19.796
all of the hostages home.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.756
But him especially.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.049
Yes, he's my husband.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.759
He's my better half.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:25.635
He's my stronger.

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.595
Half. I need him.

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.722
He needs to mourn his daughter.

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:31.599
He needs to hug his kids.

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:32.600
He didn't do.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.229
Anything to deserve this.

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:38.564
Nothing peaceful, man.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:40.983
He just, you know. Lived in the kibbutz.

00:06:40.983 --> 00:06:42.735
He was Jewish and lived in the kibbutz.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.529
That's it.

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:45.571
That's the reason.

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:48.574
That's the reason my son was murdered.

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:49.951
Hateful.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.619
Just pure hate.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.453
Pure hate.

00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:53.621
Nothing. Nothing more.

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:55.164
She didn't do anything.

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:56.999
What? An 18 year old playing.

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:59.710
Volleyball in love with her, with her.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.754
Boyfriend can do.

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:02.964
What did she do to them?

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:04.632
Nothing.

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:05.967
Just living in the kibbutz.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.468
On the border of Gaza.

00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:08.428
That's the problem.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.972
That's. That's her fault.

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.390
That's where she was murdered.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.309
