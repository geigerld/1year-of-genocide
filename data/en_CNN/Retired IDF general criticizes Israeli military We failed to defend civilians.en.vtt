00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.734
The tension at the

00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.334
border of

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.870
Israel and Gaza is palpable tonight.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:04.471
And here

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.438
where Nic Robertson is,

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:06.573
you can even hear the thuds

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:07.741
of the explosions in Gaza

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.242
from here in Tel Aviv.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:09.776
It comes as

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:10.643
we are learning tonight

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:11.911
about the incredible bravery

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:14.014
of a retired Israeli general

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.016
who headed straight into a hall

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:16.716
Oh's kibbutz,

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.518
which is just a few miles from Gaza

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.519
as it was under attack

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.621
on Saturday morning and along the way.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:22.655
General Ziv,

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:23.189
armed only

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.891
with a pistol, encountered

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:25.992
Israeli soldiers

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.428
who were outmanned and outgunned.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:29.763
And I spoke with him.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:30.897
He was deeply emotional,

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.832
as he told me about the horrors

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.167
he witnessed

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.403
General,

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:40.140
that morning Saturday morning,

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.074
you.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.043
Was this the gun?

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.310
What what kind did you have?

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.346
This is new This is new.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.581
The gun that they had

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.984
was was a little bit more simple.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:53.420
It's this one

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.754
that was your pistol.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:55.488
So you were about to go

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.424
for a bike ride, collect,

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.225
take your pistol with you?

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:02.595
No, I live next to Kfar Saba.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:03.296
Yeah,

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.398
it's like an hour and a half from here.

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.501
And it was biking my bike at 6:00, like,

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.136
every Saturday.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:14.040
And we had that left, and

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.342
I thought it,

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.244
you know, might be some rocket

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.947
or something simple that we already know.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.648
Yes.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:22.849
And then I had the call

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.150
that something very serious

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.653
and very heavy is happening.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.954
So I took that.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:28.621
The only four

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.322
that are waiting

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.357
for such occasion in the cabinet

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:35.295
and took my college and run to Gaza

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.897
to to engage to two to me, the forces

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.267
So then what did you do

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:44.671
We had

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.107
very few forces, very few units.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.209
So I engage with the units

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.810
and we went to a place to a place

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.445
to see what's going on

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.514
along the way with a lot of engagements.

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.883
The, well, huge amount with Hamas.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:01.154
Yes, a lot of close contact engagements.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.790
So I was with the soldiers.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.658
I was shooting with that

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:08.261
when a soldier was was injured

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:08.895
next to me.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:13.299
I took his gun and shot and we progress

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.235
from place to place all day long

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.369
until late night.

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.538
And then later on that evening

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:21.808
or Saturday night, more units came in.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.276
So I had to engage them

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.477
into the situation

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:25.812
and have them to

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.347
to manage with the battle

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.282
in some of the kibbutzim.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:31.518
In general, what did you see?

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:32.552
What did you see them doing

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:33.153
in this kibbutz?

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.221
You know, it's, it's it's terrible.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.290
In my whole military career,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.893
I haven't seen such a lot of fighting

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.060
and terrible things,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.829
you know, off of killing.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.930
I saw women

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.031
holding their children

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.467
and being shot by holding them.

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:48.835
People were hiding,

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.470
you know, on the furnitures

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.639
and got murdered.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.007
I saw a few people that

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.041
the head was Trump

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:57.277
children

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:04.651
so it

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:06.586
was terrible, terrible,

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:07.487
terrible, terrible.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.455
And we say we feel I feel a shame.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.891
We fail to to protect them.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:12.992
They they live here

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.227
that were the first line

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:16.796
of all Israel or Passover, anything.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.832
And we fail we fail to to to defend them.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.003
It's it's it's a personal humiliation

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.605
and national humiliation.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:28.341
Humiliation at the same time.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.644
So it is hard for anyone to hear

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:32.445
what you're saying,

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.380
to imagine that you saw you had to

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.082
to see a mother within the child.

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:37.550
Sorry, people.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.051
I mean,

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.754
can you even unsee such things?

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.590
Could you even comprehend,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.692
as you saw it happen, that it was

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:46.559
that it was a human

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:47.827
being doing these things

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:49.329
to another human being,

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.130
and nothing of that is human.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.265
It's it's animals.

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.601
It's only animals can do such a thing.

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.469
I've never seen such a thing.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:57.804
This is this is really

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:01.274
low as only animal can do.

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:02.642
It's only animal can do.

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:04.978
I there's nothing human

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.980
that you can see in the act.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.282
You know, it's it's

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:11.417
burning, burning, burning, people.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:14.821
I went that afternoon and later to

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.991
to the party, to the festival

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.526
hundreds of people and kids,

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.795
you know, 16, 17, 18,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.299
Masako are dead.

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.468
And you saw because I know

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:29.535
and when you kill somebody

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:31.170
from close contact

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.406
and some of them try to escape

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:34.807
so they're waiting for them

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:35.708
to get to the car

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.477
and they start to shoot.

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:38.778
And then when they are in the car

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.046
they are trapped.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.115
And you saw, you know,

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.916
just just

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.019
overwhelmed by

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.754
the amount of bullets.

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:49.856
And later on they try to burn the car

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:51.891
with the with the, with the bodies

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:56.863
animals, real animals.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.032
And we cannot have them as a neighbor.

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:00.033
I mean,

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:01.534
the, you know,

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:04.270
if they act as there is a jungle law,

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:06.506
we have to act also with it

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:07.907
because we are in the same jungle.

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:10.710
And we cannot have the jungle in our own,

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.011
you know, own homes.

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:14.414
How many Hamas fighters did you see?

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:16.783
Who was how many did you see?

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:19.652
Myself in my own I.

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.521
Dozens of them.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:24.324
Yeah, but but I think they were

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.027
much above 1500 Hamas.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.263
I mean, I didn't know that by then.

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:32.598
But what we have learned later

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:34.334
is that that there were

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.803
at least 1500 people or more.

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:39.972
Some of them, you know, more

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.407
commando type.

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:44.477
The first line of of toll, these

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.879
some of them a second assailant

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.214
and even civilians,

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:50.249
they call civilians to take gun

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.818
to come over to the kibbutzim.

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:54.320
And, you know, and been and rape

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.055
and do whatever they want.

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.990
And and we killed many,

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.325
many of those, by the way.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:01.427
All of them came with the weapon.

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:03.029
General, thank you very much.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.363
Thank you

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:03.896
very much

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:07.133
for full asking and being here with us.

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:07.934
Thank you very much.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.404
General.

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:12.739
Safe did not hold back

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:14.941
on criticizing his own government

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.509
and his own military.

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:17.710
He called what happened Saturday

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.646
a complete failure

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:23.216
It's a total collapse.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.518
I'm not going to say any excuses.

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:27.987
It's a total collapse.

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:30.656
It's a systematic collapse.

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.458
It's it's the intelligence.

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:35.461
It's the whole defense system.

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:38.564
The defense system has a lot of elements.

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:39.031
You know,

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:41.768
it's it's it's defense is the technology.

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.203
It's the deployment of the army.

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:46.205
It's the back up, so many things.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:50.042
It all collapsed so so we cannot,

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:52.111
you know, saying that

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.982
any excuses is not is not acceptable.

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:57.683
We have to inquire that.

00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:58.751
We have to investigate

00:06:58.751 --> 00:06:59.852
what did we have to learn?

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:01.621
A very serious lessons,

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:04.624
by the way, in none of the scenarios,

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:08.194
we had an ideal the Hamas form for me

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.363
Still, the organization

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:11.697
will act as an army.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:13.933
What we think

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.969
today is that that Iran is behind it.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.572
They're plain is a copy paste

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:20.907
of the Fevola.

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:22.809
They have a similar playing in

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:23.876
in the in the north

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:25.378
in all over the Sydney.

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:26.646
Exactly the same thing

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:29.882
that we have seen here but then again

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:34.086
we should have guess or learn or take

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:35.555
under a serious assumption

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:38.491
that such thing could have happened

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.059
and within the security lapse

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:40.793
prior to Hamas's

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:41.327
assault over

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:41.727
the weekend

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:42.595
has many wondering

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:43.229
what will be done

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.064
to make sure it never happens again.

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:46.265
Joining us now is former Israeli

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:47.767
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.068
Sir, we appreciate your time

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:49.635
this morning.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:50.870
We want to look forward

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.138
and kind of what to expect,

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.606
what you're seeing.

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:55.007
But to start there,

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:56.776
I think it's been striking

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:58.411
when you listen to Israeli

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.012
officials, IDF officials,

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:01.747
as they try and figure out what happened,

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:03.716
including this from a retired general

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:04.684
to our colleague last night.

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:05.017
Take a listen.

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:07.820
We say

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.488
we feel I

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.723
feel a shame we fail to to protect them.

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:12.658
They they live here

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:13.926
that are the first line

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:16.429
of full Israel of our sovereignty.

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:19.499
And we fail we fail to to to defend them.

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.669
It's a personal humiliation

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.271
and national humiliation,

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:27.974
humiliation at the same time.

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:28.741
And, sir,

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:29.709
I think what stuck out to me,

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.444
you had an interview with Channel 11 News

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:32.111
where you're talking about

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:33.646
how the international community views

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:34.514
Israel right now, said,

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.314
I don't want their pity.

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:36.382
I want them to fear us.

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:38.751
I want them to understand our strength.

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:41.454
Are you concerned that kind of the the

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.623
how Israel is perceived

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:44.957
has been punctured

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:47.460
over the course of the last six days?

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:48.928
Oh, absolutely.

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:52.064
And whoever that general is is correct

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:52.632
there.

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:53.666
There's no doubt

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:56.736
the first and foremost duty

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:58.104
sovereign state

00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:00.339
is to protect its citizens

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:03.943
and it's actually 1500

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:06.679
Israeli citizens were slaughtered

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.448
by Nazi monsters

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:12.552
and go were enough to fix all of this off

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:14.353
of our military history

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:16.989
teaches us that time and again,

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:18.558
there's a limit to

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.761
our mistakes like

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:23.362
brutal barber like Barbaro

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:24.964
sound like nine elevenths

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:26.866
like the Yom Kippur War

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:28.401
were enough to fix it.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.803
But now our view is forward

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:32.972
into the next stage

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.840
from collecting ourselves

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.976
and taking out and killing

00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:38.177
all the

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.679
terrorists that entered Israel

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:42.148
to the next stage. The offensive stage.
