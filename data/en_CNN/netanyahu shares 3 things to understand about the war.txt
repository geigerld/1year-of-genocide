Let's start with what's happening at that&nbsp; hospital. Israeli forces have said that they&nbsp;&nbsp; are engaged in intense fighting around Al shifa&nbsp; hospital, the largest medical facility in gaza.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you say that the hospital sits on top&nbsp; of a hamas command and control center. But,&nbsp;&nbsp; of course, there are also patients, civilians&nbsp; sheltering in that complex getting treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you intend to go after hamas without&nbsp; putting sick and injured civilians in that&nbsp;&nbsp; hospital at more risk than they already are? &gt;&gt; We've called to evacuate all the patients&nbsp;&nbsp; from that hospital. In fact, 100 or so&nbsp; have already been evacuated. I've called&nbsp;&nbsp; for hospitals, and the French president&nbsp; has sent a floating hospital ship. I've&nbsp;&nbsp; asked emirates to send a field hospital.&nbsp; They have. Other countries have done the&nbsp;&nbsp; same. There's no reason why we just&nbsp; can't take the patients out of there&nbsp;&nbsp; instead of letting hamas use it as a command&nbsp; center for terrorism with the rockets they [9:03:40 AM] terrorism with the rockets they fire against&nbsp; Israel, for the terror tunnels they use to kill&nbsp;&nbsp; Israeli civilians. Remember, Dana, let's keep&nbsp; this in focus. Just imagine what would happen&nbsp;&nbsp; if the United States were attacked viciously&nbsp; by 20 9/11s, that's the proportion number,&nbsp;&nbsp; 50,000 Americans killed, 10,000 Americans&nbsp; held hostage including babies, elderly, women,&nbsp;&nbsp; children, 10,000 rockets falling on your cities.&nbsp; That's the number of rockets that are falling all&nbsp;&nbsp; the time on our cities, may fall during this&nbsp; interview, as a matter of fact, and I'll have&nbsp;&nbsp; to go to a shelter. What would America do? It&nbsp; would take all its force and go after these&nbsp;&nbsp; killers. What if these killers embed themselves&nbsp; in hospitals, schools, U.N. Facilities? You'd do&nbsp;&nbsp; everything in your power to get the civilians&nbsp; out, which is what we're doing. We call them&nbsp;&nbsp; to leave. You certainly wouldn't give immunity&nbsp; top the terrorists. We're obviously treading&nbsp;&nbsp; carefully when it comes to hospitals, but we're&nbsp; also not going to give immunity to the terrorists. [9:04:41 AM] terrorists. So far, even though hamas has&nbsp; tried to prevent the civilians from leaving,&nbsp;&nbsp; hundreds of thousands have left, sometimes&nbsp; having to go through hamas gun points and&nbsp;&nbsp; gunfire and wants to keep them in harm's way. &gt;&gt; Just to be clear, sir, Israel will aid,&nbsp;&nbsp; help these civilians who are quite sick&nbsp; and inside these hospitals come out,&nbsp;&nbsp; not just in Al shifa, but there are&nbsp;&nbsp; other hospitals where this is happening? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, we're telling them to leave.&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Telling them or helping them? &gt;&gt; Helping them by creating safe&nbsp;&nbsp; corridors. We have designated routes to a safe&nbsp; zone south of gaza city where there's no fighting,&nbsp;&nbsp; and we're telling them, go ahead, move. By&nbsp; the way, 70,000 have moved. Three days ago,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think 50,000 moved yesterday. More will move&nbsp; today. We want all the civilians to be moved&nbsp;&nbsp; out of harm's way. Hamas is doing everything in&nbsp; their power to keep them in harm's way. Go ahead.&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Do you believe there are&nbsp; hostages below that hospital, [9:05:41 AM] hostages below that hospital,&nbsp; Israeli or American hostages?&nbsp; &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go into the intelligence&nbsp; picture we have, but you know there's been&nbsp;&nbsp; this vicious thing -- they take hostages --&nbsp; imagine a baby is held hostage. Who takes a&nbsp;&nbsp; baby hostage? I don't know if you have children,&nbsp; Dana, I'm sure your camera crew has, we all have&nbsp;&nbsp; children. What is this taking children hostage?&nbsp; Threatening to kill them. This is savagery of&nbsp;&nbsp; the highest order. We're doing everything in our&nbsp; power to achieve two things. One, destroy hamas&nbsp;&nbsp; because without it, none of us have a future.&nbsp; It's not only our war. It's your war, too,&nbsp;&nbsp; the battle of civilization against barberism. It&nbsp; will pass to other places. Middle East will fall,&nbsp;&nbsp; Europe is next, you'll be next. The first goal is&nbsp; to destroy hamas and the second goal is to bring&nbsp;&nbsp; back our hostages. We're trying to do both. &gt;&gt; Those are completely understandable goals,&nbsp;&nbsp; goals that [9:06:41 AM] understandable goals, goals that the United&nbsp; States very much supports, understanding that&nbsp;&nbsp; hamas is a barbaric terrorist organization.&nbsp; Israel is not hamas, and the United States&nbsp;&nbsp; also makes very clear that democracies have to&nbsp; do better. The secretary of state, Tony blinken,&nbsp;&nbsp; said that far too many Palestinian civilians&nbsp; have been killed. What is your response to that?&nbsp; &gt;&gt; I think any civilian loss is a tragedy and&nbsp; the blame should be placed squarely on hamas&nbsp;&nbsp; because it prevents them from leaving the&nbsp; war zone, sometimes at gunpoint. It's fired&nbsp;&nbsp; in the safe zone and the safe corridor that we&nbsp; enacted. The other day to prevent Palestinians&nbsp;&nbsp; from leaving harm's way, it puts rockets inside&nbsp; the schools, hospitals. It has tunnels below&nbsp;&nbsp; children's beds. That's what we're dealing with. &gt;&gt; Absolutely, but because Israel isn't hamas,&nbsp;&nbsp; is Israel doing everything possible to take that&nbsp; into consideration? &gt;&gt; Yes, Dana, more than that. [9:07:43 AM] &gt;&gt; Yes, Dana, more than that. And more than that.&nbsp; We're trying to minimize civilian casualties as&nbsp;&nbsp; a result of our ground action, I think the number&nbsp; of civilian carpalities is actually being reduced&nbsp;&nbsp; because people are heeding our calls to leave&nbsp; the area and defying hamas' attempt to keep them&nbsp;&nbsp; there, and we'll do everything in our power to&nbsp; do that. The one example I can give you is this.&nbsp;&nbsp; These savages, they perpetrated the worst horrors&nbsp; on Jews since the holocaust. The German chancellor&nbsp;&nbsp; Schultz called them the new Nazis. Look at the&nbsp; old Nazis. The allies were attacked by hitler so&nbsp;&nbsp; they invaded France and then Germany. When they&nbsp; did that, they went into the cities. They had to&nbsp;&nbsp; fight the German army that was often embedded&nbsp; in the cities, in civilian neighborhoods. Many&nbsp;&nbsp; civilians were killed. Who is the blame laid onto?&nbsp; Did they say the Nazis -- the allies are wrong,&nbsp;&nbsp; the allies should stop fighting? They said,&nbsp; look, use forces as judiciously as you can, but [9:08:44 AM] judiciously as you can, but don't give the&nbsp; Nazis any refuge, don't feed the Nazis.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is what we're doing, using force in&nbsp; the most judicious way, we have to defeat&nbsp;&nbsp; these new Nazis, for our sake, your sake, too. &gt;&gt; I want to ask about the hostages. Thousands&nbsp;&nbsp; of families rallied this weekend right across the&nbsp; street from where you are right now. They're very&nbsp;&nbsp; frustrated they're not getting more information&nbsp; from you on where their loved ones are,&nbsp;&nbsp; believe your government is not doing enough&nbsp; to get them back. What do you say to them?&nbsp; &gt;&gt; It's understandable. They're under tremendous&nbsp; distress, they're under torture. You can imagine&nbsp;&nbsp; you have your father, your husband, your&nbsp; son, your daughter taken by these savages --&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Are you doing enough? &gt;&gt; We're doing everything we&nbsp;&nbsp; can around the clock, and I can't talk about it.&nbsp; I personally met with hostage families -- families&nbsp;&nbsp; of hostages several times. It tears your&nbsp; heart out. Yes, we're doing everything and [9:09:46 AM] Yes, we're doing everything and&nbsp; many things that I can't say here,&nbsp;&nbsp; obviously. But this is one of our two&nbsp; war goals. One is to destroy hamas,&nbsp;&nbsp; and the second is to bring back our hostages.&nbsp; We'll do everything we can. We think the entire&nbsp;&nbsp; world should join us. Demand from the red&nbsp; cross that it demand vips its to the hostages,&nbsp;&nbsp; demand unconditional release of the hostages, say&nbsp; this is barbarism that is unacceptable. I'd like&nbsp;&nbsp; to see the U.N., the U.N. Secretary-general who&nbsp; basically laid the blame on Israel, lay the blame&nbsp;&nbsp; on these savages. Israel is fighting according&nbsp; to international law. The Israeli army is doing&nbsp;&nbsp; an exemplarily job trying to minimize civilian&nbsp; casualties and maximize terrorist casualties.&nbsp;&nbsp; We theed the international community not to give&nbsp; support and moral support and legitimacy to sheer&nbsp;&nbsp; evil that hamas represents. Support Israel.&nbsp; Attack hamas. &gt;&gt; Prime minister Netanyahu, one [9:10:47 AM] &gt;&gt; Prime minister Netanyahu, one of the questions&nbsp; right now is, when it comes to hostages,&nbsp;&nbsp; is whether there can be a negotiation that works&nbsp; towards a deal to free large groups of hostages&nbsp;&nbsp; in exchange for ap sustained days' long pause in&nbsp; fighting. Is that acceptable to you? If so, how&nbsp;&nbsp; long of a pause would Israel be willing to allow? &gt;&gt; I said we're going to pursue the battle to&nbsp;&nbsp; destroy hamas to its end. But I also said the&nbsp; only cease-fire that we would consider is one in&nbsp;&nbsp; which we have our hostages released. That remains&nbsp; true. It doesn't mean we can't give humanitarian&nbsp;&nbsp; pause for a few hours in a place, a specific time&nbsp; and place where we want to have a humanitarian&nbsp;&nbsp; corridor and have the people leave safely. We've&nbsp; done that, and hundreds of thousands have left&nbsp;&nbsp; the fighting zone in that fashion. &gt;&gt; How long of a pause would you&nbsp;&nbsp; be willing to support? &gt;&gt; So far we've dealt&nbsp;&nbsp; with a few hours. If you're&nbsp; talking about a cease-fire -- [9:11:48 AM] cease-fire -- &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a&nbsp;&nbsp; cease-fire. A longer pause, days, for example. &gt;&gt; That's not a pause. If you're talking about&nbsp;&nbsp; stopping the fighting, that's exactly what hamas&nbsp; wants. Hamas wants an end Ms series of pauses&nbsp;&nbsp; that basically dissipate -- like the Germans after&nbsp; normandy. Okay, let's have a cease-fire. Hold off,&nbsp;&nbsp; let us replenish our supplies, get out of&nbsp; our terror tunnels, let us rearm ourselves&nbsp;&nbsp; and so on. Obviously we're not going to&nbsp; do that. In order to have a cease-fire of&nbsp;&nbsp; any -- a cease-fire in the entire area, that&nbsp; will require the release of our hostages.&nbsp; &gt;&gt; The U.S. Says you need an extended&nbsp; pause in order to get the hostages out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you not believe that as well? &gt;&gt; We don't -- we don't disagree&nbsp;&nbsp; with that, we need to get our hostages out. &gt;&gt; The U.S. Also says any postwar plan for&nbsp;&nbsp; gaza must include palestinian-led&nbsp; governance and gaza unified with [9:12:49 AM] governance and gaza unified with the west bank&nbsp; under the Palestinian authority. You appeared&nbsp;&nbsp; to reject that yesterday. You said Israel will&nbsp; not accept a, quote, civilian authority there&nbsp;&nbsp; that educates its children to hate Israel.&nbsp; I want to be clear. Are you saying Israel&nbsp;&nbsp; would not accept giving control of gaza over&nbsp; to the Palestinian authority after the war?&nbsp; &gt;&gt; The first thing we have to do is destroy hamas,&nbsp; because otherwise they'll do it again and again&nbsp;&nbsp; and again and they've said so. We'll destroy&nbsp; hamas. The second thing we have to understand&nbsp;&nbsp; is there has to be an overriding and overreaching&nbsp; Israeli military envelope. We've seen, any place&nbsp;&nbsp; we leave, we exit, give it to some other force,&nbsp; very soon terrorism resurfaces. The third thing we&nbsp;&nbsp; have to understand is a civilian authority has to&nbsp; cooperate on two comboels, one is to demilitarize&nbsp;&nbsp; gaza, the second is to -- the Palestinian&nbsp; authority has unfortunately failed on both [9:13:52 AM] has unfortunately failed on both counts.&nbsp; They don't demilitarize the west bank.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to do it. We have to fight the&nbsp; terrorists. They don't deradical lies,&nbsp;&nbsp; teach children the hate red of Israel, they&nbsp; pay for laefs, the more Jews they kill,&nbsp;&nbsp; the more they pay. They refuse to this day,&nbsp; 36 days after this savagery, to condemn what&nbsp;&nbsp; hamas did on October 7th. &gt;&gt; If not the P.A. --&nbsp; &gt;&gt; There has to be a reconstructed civilian&nbsp; authority. There has to be something else.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise we're just falling into that same&nbsp; rabbit hole. We're going to have the same&nbsp;&nbsp; result. Remember the P.A. Was already in gaza.&nbsp; When Israel left gaza, it handed the keys over&nbsp;&nbsp; to P.A. Within a very short time hamas took&nbsp; over, kicked them out. They're not willing to&nbsp;&nbsp; fight hamas. They're still not willing to fight&nbsp; hamas. You have to have some kind of authority,&nbsp;&nbsp; civilian, Palestinian authority that&nbsp; is willing to fight the terrorists and [9:14:53 AM] fight the terrorists and educating --&nbsp; important LI must educate the children&nbsp;&nbsp; for a fewer of peace, peace, cooperation,&nbsp; prosperity. Cooperation with Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp; not the annihilation of israelment so&nbsp; far that hasn't happened. The burden of&nbsp;&nbsp; proof is on the P.A. And they've failed every&nbsp; single time. I say that regrettably. Honestly,&nbsp;&nbsp; we have to be realistic about what we expect.&nbsp; We can't fall back on formulas that failment&nbsp;&nbsp; we have to succeed, to succeed to give gaza a&nbsp; better future. Let's not bring it to a failed&nbsp;&nbsp; past. Let's create a different reality there. &gt;&gt; Prime minister Netanyahu, before I let you go,&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you've been asked this several times,&nbsp; but I have had multiple people inside Israel&nbsp;&nbsp; reach out to me knowing that I was going to&nbsp; interview you and say the one thing they want&nbsp;&nbsp; to hear from you is that you take personal&nbsp; responsibility for failing to prevent the&nbsp;&nbsp; October 7th attacks and protecting your people. I&nbsp; know you say the time for that will come after the&nbsp;&nbsp; war. Why won't you take responsibility now? &gt;&gt; I've already addressed that many times. [9:15:54 AM] many times. And I said this whole&nbsp; question will be addressed after the war.&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Why not now? &gt;&gt; Well, did people ask Franklin Roosevelt&nbsp;&nbsp; after pearl harbor that question? Did people ask&nbsp; George Bush after the surprise attack of November&nbsp;&nbsp; 11th? It's a yes that needs to be asked. &gt;&gt; The question has been asked.&nbsp; &gt;&gt; I've said the one thing that is important&nbsp; -- I've said we're going to answer all these&nbsp;&nbsp; questions including I'm going to be asked tough&nbsp; questions. I think right now what we have to do&nbsp;&nbsp; is unite the country for one purpose, one purpose&nbsp; alone. That's to achieve victory. That's what&nbsp;&nbsp; we did. We formed a unity government, the&nbsp; country is June nighted as never before.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's what we have to pursue. What the people&nbsp; expect me to do right now is two things. One,&nbsp;&nbsp; achieve the victory and bring the hostages back.&nbsp; Second, make sure that gaza never becomes --&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Israelis are disappointed that you&nbsp; won't take responsibility, you said?&nbsp; &gt;&gt; I said I'll answer all the&nbsp; questions required, including [9:16:55 AM] questions required, including the questions of&nbsp; responsibility. There will be enough time for
