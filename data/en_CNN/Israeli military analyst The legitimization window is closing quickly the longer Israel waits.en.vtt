00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.368
WE BEGIN WITH TEAM COVERAGE.

00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:03.370
ERIN BURNETT IN TEL AVIV STARTS 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.870
IT OFF.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.673
THAT IS QUITE A CLAIM BY 

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:07.374
PRESIDENT HERZOG.

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:11.277
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS?

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.580
&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.547
LET'S GO THROUGH WHAT THEY SAY 

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:15.215
THEY FOUND.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.684
THEY SAY THEY FOUND A USB ON ONE

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.085
OF THE HAMAS MILITANTS INVOLVED 

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:22.055
IN THE ATTACKS, AND ON THAT USB 

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.490
THERE WAS INFORMATION FROM WHAT 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.559
HAD BEEN AN AL QAEDA 2003 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.193
OPERATIONAL MANUAL WHICH 

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.095
INCLUDED A PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS 

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:32.565
ON HOW TO ASSEMBLE A CYANIDE 

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.768
CHEMICAL WEAPON AND HOW TO 

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.236
DISPERSE IT WITH CRUDE DRAWINGS.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.937
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.672
THEY ARE HOWEVER CLEAR THAT 

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.307
THERE WAS NO INDICATIONS AT 

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.409
LEAST WE'VE RECEIVED NO 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.543
INDICATIONS FROM THE ISRAELI 

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.744
GOVERNMENT THAT THERE WERE ANY 

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.046
PLANS TO DEPLOY SUCH A WEAPON.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.048
JUST THAT IT WAS ON THAT USB.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.516
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE WERE 

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.384
BATTLE PLANS FOUND ON OPERATIVE 

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.319
AS WELL, WE'VE SEEN THOSE 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.522
OURSELVES THAT GO THROUGH EACH 

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.925
OF THE KIBBUTZIM THAT WERE 

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.160
ATTACKED, STREET BY STREET, AN 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.561
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF DETAILED 

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.195
INFORMATION.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.397
AND ON THOSE PLANS WE DO KNOW 

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.799
TALKING TO SECURITY AT AT LEAST 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.667
ONE KIBBUTZ THAT THEY FOLLOWED 

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:13.273
THOSE TO THE "T" AND WENT ITEM 

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:13.606
BY ITEM.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:14.340
SO WE CAN'T MISS THE 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.742
SIGNIFICANCE, BUT THERE IS NO 

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:16.776
INDICATION AS OF YET THAT THERE 

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:18.945
WAS ANY PLAN TO USE ANY SUCH 

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:19.279
WEAPON.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.514
&gt;&gt; THE BARRAGE OF AIRSTRIKES 

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.216
OVERNIGHT, 320 TARGETS IS WHAT 

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:25.518
THE IDF IS SAYING, WHAT ARE YOU 

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:29.322
SEEING AND HEARING THIS MORNING?

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:32.025
&gt;&gt; SO 320 AIRSTRIKES, THEY GIVE 

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.326
OUT NUMBERS MOST DAYS.

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:35.695
SO RUNNING AT A 500 STRIKE OVER 

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:36.529
48 HOUR PERIOD.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:37.464
THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT 

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:40.767
IS HAPPENING IN GAZA.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:41.701
THE PALESTINIAN HEALTH AUTHORITY

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.069
THERE IS SAYING THAT FOR EXAMPLE

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.338
NEAR RAFAH THAT THERE WERE FOUR 

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:46.272
STRIKES THERE ON INDIVIDUAL 

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.808
HOMES AND THAT 29 PEOPLE WERE 

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:49.242
KILLED.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.910
IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.312
BUT IT DOES SPEAK TO SOMETHING 

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.247
BOTH SIDES ARE ACTUALLY AGREEING

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.748
ON, EVEN IF NOT EXPLICITLY, 

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.317
WHICH IS THAT THE ISRAELI 

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.751
STRIKES ARE EXTREMELY TARGETED.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:00.520
SO TARGETING SPECIFIC HOMES 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.321
WHERE THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE 

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:05.492
ARE LINKS TO HAMAS MILITANTS, 

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.694
ALSO TALKING ABOUT ISLAMIC 

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.497
JIHAD, THAT THEY ARE INCLUDING 

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:11.364
PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD 

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:14.501
TARGETS AS LEGITIMATE TARGETS IN

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.769
ADDITION TO HAMAS MILITANTS 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.103
ITSELF.

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.239
WE'LL GET TO NIC IN A MOMENT TO 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.108
HEAR MORE, BUT THERE ARE DAYS 

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:23.343
WHEN WE'VE HEARD THE ASSAULT, 

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.145
YOU CAN HEAR ARTILLERY.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.080
HERE WE DO HEAR OFTEN THE THUDS 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.282
OF THOSE BOMBS AND IT HAS BEEN 

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.383
QUIET TODAY.

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:31.317
IT WAS QUIET YESTERDAY.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.285
AT LEAST FROM WHERE WE'RE 

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:34.721
STANDING AT THE BEGINNING TWO 

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:35.989
WEEKS AGO GHOEN I WAS HERE.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.323
IT WAS A CONSTANT THUD THAT YOU 

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.458
COULD ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY FEEL 

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:39.559
THROUGH YOUR BODY THROUGHOUT THE

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.826
DAY.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.961
WE ARE NOT HEARING THAT.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:42.829
SO THAT IS DIFFERENT.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.198
AND THERE ARE THOSE THOUSANDS OF

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:48.234
TROOPS MASSED ALONG THE BORDER 

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:48.968
WAITING FOR THE GREEN LIGHT TO 

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.670
GO IN, ALL UP ALONG THE 25 MILE 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.472
LONG BORDER.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:53.439
ISRAELI OFFICIALS HERE HAVE BEEN

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.574
WARNING FOR DAYS BUT THE 

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.309
QUESTION ROMAINS WHEN EXACTLY IT

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.310
WILL HAPPEN.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.314
AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE 

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:01.915
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN 

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:03.383
NETANYAHU WHO HAS BEEN PRESENTED

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:04.083
WITH MANY POSSIBLE OPERATIONS 

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.285
THAT HE COULD GREEN LIGHT, THEY 

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:07.954
COULD GO ON, SO WE'LL SEE 

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.322
WHETHER THIS WAIT INDICATES A 

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.291
SHIFT IN HIS DECISION MAKING ON 

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.327
WHAT GOING IN ENTAILS.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:23.136
NIC ROBERTSON AS PHIL SAID IS IN

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:23.469
ISRAEL.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.973
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING?

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:27.807
&gt;&gt; Reporter: OVERNIGHT LAST 

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:28.875
NIGHT THE LATE EVENING HOURS 

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.778
INTO THE EARLY MORNING HOURS, 

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:34.781
REALLY HEAVY BOMBARDMENT SHAKING

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.015
THIS HOUSE, THE MOST SUSTAINED 

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.518
AMOUNT OF MISSILES AND ARTILLERY

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:40.086
THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED HERE.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.822
AND WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR TWO 

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:43.189
WEEKS.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.692
TODAY AS YOU SAY MUCH QUIETER.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.660
WE HEAR DRONES IN THE SKY, BUT 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.530
NO SOUNDS OF IMPACTS HERE IN 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.130
NORTHERN GAZA.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.699
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.000
HEARING AS WELL IS THE REASON 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.704
THAT THE GOVERNMENT HERE IS -- 

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.839
NETANYAHU'S GOVERNMENT IS SO 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.207
CONCERNED ABOUT HUMANITARIAN 

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:02.475
PAUSES, THEY THINK THAT THAT 

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:05.678
WILL BE USED BY HAMAS TO GAIN AN

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:06.813
ADVANTAGE, TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF 

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:07.847
THE PRESSURE THAT THEY ARE 

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:08.982
FACING AT THE MOMENT.

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:11.284
AND THIS PRESSURE DESIGNED TO 

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.186
HELP MOVE ALONG HOSTAGE 

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:14.387
RELEASES, TALKING TO SOME OF THE

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:15.421
TROOPS WHO ARE CLOSE TO THE 

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.624
FRONT HERE, THEY TALK ABOUT, YOU

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.359
KNOW, BEING TOLD TO BE READY FOR

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.426
ACTION AND THEN ACTION NOT 

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:23.263
COMING AND SORT OF STOOD 

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:23.696
UP/STOOD DOWN.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.199
BUT SPEAKING TO PAST VETERANS OF

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.067
WARS HERE, THEY SAY WE'VE BEEN 

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:29.302
THROUGH THIS HERE BEFORE, WE CAN

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:31.704
STAY OUT AND DO THIS IN THE 

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:33.273
FIELD AS LONG AS WE LIKE.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.709
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TROOPS 

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:38.845
AT THE FRONTLINES, THAT IS A 

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:45.018
FORCE WAITING TO GO.

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:46.552
BRISTLING WITH BATTLE READY 

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:49.022
TROOPS, FARMERS' FIELDS NORTH OF

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.057
GAZA CHURN WITH A CONTROLLED 

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:55.194
FURY OF A NATION READYING FOR AN

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:55.828
INCURSION TO STRIKE HAMAS.

00:04:55.828 --> 00:05:00.533
YET THEY ARE WAITING WITH NO 

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:01.768
EXPLANATION WHY.

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:03.202
FEELS LIKE THE EARLY RUSH FOR 

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:04.804
BATTLE READINESS HAS PASSED.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:09.309
TROOPS  SS ARE DEPLOYED STANDIN.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.009
THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG CAN 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.344
THEY BE KEPT OUT HERE.

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:14.647
ACCORDING TO FORMER IDF GENERAL,

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.282
AS LONG AS IS NEEDED.

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.750
THERE ARE MILITARY GAINS.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.056
&gt;&gt; WE ARE NOW IMPROVING OUR 

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:25.325
INTELLIGENCE AND OUR CAPACITY OF

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.092
TARGETS.

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:27.060
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT THE POLITICAL 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.730
CAL COULD YOU RACE HERE IS MORE 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.130
COMPLICATED.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.498
&gt;&gt; I THINK BOTH IN WASHINGTON 

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:38.638
AND IN JERUSALEM THEY UNDERSTAND

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:43.176
THAT THE LEGITIZATION WINDOW IS 

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:43.643
CLOSING QUICKLY.

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:45.311
&gt;&gt; Reporter: CIVILIAN LOSSES IN 

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:46.946
GAZA ARE GROWING.

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:49.982
MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEM 

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:51.651
CHILDREN ACCORDING TO 

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:52.919
PALESTINIAN HEALTH OFFICIALS.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.288
LENGTHY NEGOTIATIONS HAVE LED TO

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:58.157
TWO AMERICAN HOSTAGES RELEASED.

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:01.327
A TINIMENT A OF HUMANITARIAN AID

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:02.929
HAS CROSSED INTO GAZA THAT 

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:08.034
ISRAEL FEARS ENDS UP IN HAMAS' 

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:08.334
HANDS.

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:08.935
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN 

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:10.870
NETANYAHU CALCULUS OF WHEN TO 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.506
SEND IN GROUND TROOPS HAS NEVER 

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.441
BEEN SO FRAUGHT UNDER PRESSURE 

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:16.576
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE FOR MORE 

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.177
HOSTAGE RELEASES.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:22.815
&gt;&gt; NETANYAHU IS IN A REAL 

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:23.149
PROBLEM.

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:28.488
HE CANNOT SAY NO TO BIDEN BUT HE

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:32.058
CANNOT SAY YES TO THE 

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.227
HUMANITARIAN AID THAT DRIFTS 

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.828
INTO NORTHERN GAZA.

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:36.829
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT HE IS ALSO 

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:39.699
UNDER PRESSURE AT HOME TOO.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.268
MILITARY AND OTHERS HAWKISH FOR 

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:43.636
DECISIVE BLOW AGAINST HAMAS.

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:47.240
&gt;&gt; WE ARE FINISHING PREPARING, 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.308
YOU KNOW, THE GROUND FORCE 

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:53.713
BECAUSE WE'VE CHANGED PLANS, WE 

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:56.649
ARE GOING TO -- FOR HEAVY 

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:57.049
MANEUVERING.

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:59.218
&gt;&gt; Reporter: NETANYAHU'S DILEMMA

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:01.320
COMPOUNDED BY HIS DEPENDENCE ON 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.290
AMERICAN WEAPONS.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.925
&gt;&gt; THE PRESSURE FROM WASHINGTON 

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:09.128
IS REAL.

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:13.299
IT IS REAL AS STRONG AND THE 

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:19.839
PRIME MINISTER SAYS MANY TIMES 

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.707
TO HIS MINISTERS, LISTEN, WE ARE

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:22.442
GETTING FROM THE UNITED STATES 

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.011
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:27.814
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHERE LESS THAN A 

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.916
WEEK AGO THESE FIELDS WERE 

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:31.918
TEEMING WITH TANKS, TROOPS 

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:34.420
MAKING LAST MINUTE REPAIRS, 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.456
TODAY JUST TRACKS IN THE SAND.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.424
THERE IS A SOLDIER'S JACKET 

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:39.492
HERE, BREAD AND BAG ON THE 

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:40.293
TABLE.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.794
THE QUESTION IS, WHERE HAVE ALL 

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:46.699
THE TANKS GONE, FORWARD FOR 

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.034
INCURSION OR BACK TO BASE FOR A 

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:48.334
PAUSE.

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:50.336
CLOSE TO THE FRONT LINE IN GAZA 

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:53.940
THESE DAYS, MORE QUESTIONS THAN 

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.273
ANSWERS.

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:55.842
AN INCURSION STILL HIGHLY 

00:07:55.842 --> 00:08:00.613
PROBABLE BUT WHEN.

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:01.848
AND WHILE WE'VE BEEN STANDING 

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:03.583
HERE THE LAST FEW MINUTES, WE'VE

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:06.619
HEARD SMALL ARMS FIRE, GUNFIRE 

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:07.720
COMING FROM THIS DIRECTION OVER 

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.155
HERE WHICH IS THE DIRECTION 

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:13.359
TOWARDS THE BORDER.

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:14.894
WE CAN'T TELL WHAT IS ACTUALLY 

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:17.063
HAPPENING THERE, BUT I THINK 

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:18.030
THAT IT IS INDICATIVE OF THE 

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.234
TENSIONS ALONG THE BORDER FENCE 

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:21.667
AT THE MOMENT.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:25.338
&gt;&gt; NIC, HERE IS THE THING PEP I 

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:28.307
KNOW YOU ARE SAYING TROOPS CAN 

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:29.308
TELLING YOU THAT THEY CAN 

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:33.312
INDICATE INDEFINITELY AND YOU'D 

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:34.914
EXPECT THEM TO AND ISAY THAT.

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:36.449
BUT THE REPORT THAT U.S. IS 

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:38.718
PUTTING PRESSURE ON NETANYAHU TO

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:40.987
WAIT, IT MAKES SENSE, BUT HOW 

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:43.556
LONG CAN NETANYAHU WAIT AND DOES

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:45.925
HE LOSE HIS POSITION OF STRENGTH

00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:47.727
AND AUTHORITY BY APPEARING TO 

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:48.861
CAVE TO U.S. INTERESTS ON THE 

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.263
TIMING OF WHAT HE DOES?

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:51.898
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU KNOW, I THINK 

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:54.800
PART OF THE CALCULUS FOR 

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.369
NETANYAHU WILL BE WHAT DO HIS 

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.137
ENEMIES IN THE REGION PERCEIVE.

00:08:58.137 --> 00:08:59.472
IF THE UNITED STATES AND 

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:00.373
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS ABLE 

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.708
TO TELL ISRAEL NOT TO GO AFTER 

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.077
HAMAS, FOR MANY ISRAELIS THAT 

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:05.912
WILL ULTIMATELY LOOK LIKE A SIGN

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:07.914
OF WEAKNESS AND THE CALCULUS 

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:09.615
WILL BE WHAT WILL HEZBOLLAH DO 

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:13.319
KNOWING THAT, KNOWING THAT THEY 

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:17.690
ARE POTENTIALLY ABOUT TO LAUNCH 

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.825
ATTACKS ON ISRAEL AT SCALE IF 

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:21.460
THE IDF GOES INTO GAZA.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.863
SO I THINK THAT THAT ALL BECOMES

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:25.665
PART OF THE CALCULUS.

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:27.433
CALCULUS THAT ISRAELIS 

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:28.634
THEMSELVES GENERALLY DON'T FEEL 

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:32.371
SAFE AFTER THE BARBARIC ATTACKS 

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:33.873
MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AGO.

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:36.242
I THINK THAT HE CAN HOLD BACK 

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.810
FOR A WHILE, BUT EVERYONE IS 

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.512
POISED AS AN EXPECTATION.

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:40.613
BUT THEN IT BECOME AS QUESTION 

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:44.317
WHAT PRECISELY IS THE IN-DURING 

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:46.419
GOING TO DO, HOW BIG WILL IT BE,

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.321
HOW MANY CIVILIANS WILL BE IN 

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:53.426
THE WAY OF THAT INCURSION.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.027
BUT WHEN IT COMES BACK TO HOW 

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:57.029
LONG CAN THEY WAIT, ONE VETERAN 

00:09:57.029 --> 00:10:03.703
OF THE 1967 WAR, ARAB/ISRAELI 

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:06.205
WAR SAID WE WERE HELD IN THE 

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:06.906
DESERT FOR A MONTH AND WE 

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:07.907
TRAINED, WE PRACTICED.

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:09.075
AND ACTUALLY THAT WORKED TO OUR 

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:09.442
ADVANTAGE.

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.611
SO I THINK THAT THE PSYCHE HERE 

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.746
IS NOT JUST SOLDIERS WILL TELL 

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:15.648
YOU WHAT THEY THINK YOU WANT TO 

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.016
HEAR AND WHAT THEIR COMMANDERS 

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:17.783
WANT YOU TO HEAR.

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:19.652
I THINK THE PSYCHE IS WHAT IT 

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:20.753
TAKES, WE'LL DO.

00:10:20.753 --> 00:10:21.487
TAKES, WE'LL DO.
