00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.700
the United

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.901
Nations led

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.136
polio vaccination

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:04.938
campaign kicked off on Sunday,

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:08.174
giving shots to around 87,000 children.

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.676
Now, the UN's agency

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.077
for Palestinian refugees

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:11.778
says the

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.380
second phase of the campaign

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.547
will be focused

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:16.449
on the south of the strip.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.617
All the

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:18.952
all of the initial shots

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:19.452
are scheduled

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:22.555
to be administered by September the 12th.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.991
I remember the promises to immunize

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.928
640,000 kids in the enclave.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.030
Let's give us an update

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.065
on what is an enormously difficult

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.833
logistical challenges.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:34.768
Rick Peppercorn,

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.102
the World Health Organization

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.837
representative for the West Bank

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:38.571
and Gaza,

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.739
not just organizing

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.007
but actually involved

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.643
in the administering of these vaccines.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:45.078
It's good to have you, Rick.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.479
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.848
Firstly,

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.617
this this vaccination drive

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.185
can only happen

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.455
if these temporary ceasefires hold.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:56.589
Correct.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.726
So tell us how that going at present.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:02.896
Well, definitely.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:03.530
And indeed.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.399
And the daunting task for all of us.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.069
And greetings from all of us in Gaza,

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.602
the Arabella,

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:10.770
which is also

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.907
the polio emergency operation center.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:17.477
So the task is to indeed reach 90%,

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:21.047
90% vaccination coverage of 640,000

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.248
children

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.384
every year, rounds for two rounds.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.386
And we welcome this commitment

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:27.187
issue right

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:27.887
set from area

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:30.423
specific humanitarian forces.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.558
And that's why we

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.327
we defined it in Gaza in three zones.

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:37.297
So in a in a central zones,

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:38.565
in central zone

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.033
and in southern zone

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.868
and in northern zone,

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:42.969
each zone

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.438
we will vaccinate for three days,

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.408
most likely another day, three plus one.

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:49.909
And then we shift to the other zone.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.579
And then four weeks later we do the same.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.146
So we,

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:54.747
we we started yesterday

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.382
with the seventh zone and

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:57.650
and the southern zone.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.818
The target

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:02.922
population is one of the 56,583.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.057
Then we moved to the south

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:04.891
target population

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:06.726
three inches 40,000 case

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:08.261
and naught one on the 50.

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.930
So yesterday was a good day.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.433
It was actually a successful day.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.502
I was not completely surprised

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.804
because the Gaza population

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:18.805
deaths and high

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.807
except of for vaccination.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.175
But I think they came out

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.176
in their droves.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.011
Families, fathers, modest,

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:25.678
having children.

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:28.681
I visited 6 or 7 of those centers

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:29.916
and happy children

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.718
showing their left little finger

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.153
that they were

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.089
vaccinated and be vaccinated.

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:40.126
More than 86,000 almost 87,000

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:41.828
children in in one day.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.665
Now, this is a

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:46.900
this is a remarkable

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.768
challenge and a remarkable feat

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:49.169
that you've

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:49.669
been able

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.304
to get these jabs into the arms

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:54.040
of all this vaccine, into the,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.176
into so many kids at this point.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:56.876
Tell me,

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.145
where were these kids coming from?

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.346
Who are they coming with?

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:03.283
And what kind of state within

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:05.518
welcoming of Reverend Vitor fathers

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.253
which are models, etc..

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.422
So today, for example, is the second day

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:11.591
and I went with a few mobile teams

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:12.358
and we went

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.760
and maybe you know that from the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.694
from the television

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:15.828
era, from TV,

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:18.665
this, this endless colorful roads,

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.668
which is endless, makeshift camps

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:22.502
all over.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:24.370
We went all over in those camps

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.906
with one of these, mobile teams.

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.107
And everywhere,

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:28.374
you know,

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.076
where we met mothers and fathers

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:31.477
with groups of children.

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:32.378
I mean, in those camps,

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.914
almost every child was vaccinated.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:36.549
So we reached a high target.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.885
And I think maybe we even,

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.386
underestimated the target

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.421
in the central zone,

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:42.422
because with the recent

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:44.324
evacuation orders,

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:45.058
the Gaza

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:48.061
population is constantly in flux.

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.196
but I say there is.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:53.800
And real appetite for this vaccination.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.236
People realize why and how.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:56.936
And again,

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:58.004
we should not forget that

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:00.907
Gaza always has a very high coverage

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:01.908
in routine

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.510
immunization before this crisis.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.213
coverage over 90, 95%.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:09.849
You

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.751
you are absolutely

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.653
relying on these temporary

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.656
ceasefires, holding in order to get,

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:18.725
as many of these vaccines

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:20.093
into kids as you can.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.527
What's your message

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:24.497
to Israel and Hamas as we speak?

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:27.734
And what are the consequences for Gaza

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:29.269
and Israel

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.571
and indeed surrounding countries

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:33.606
if this polio outbreak

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:36.609
is not brought under control?

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:39.245
Well, I think it's it's

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:41.147
the message is, of course, that,

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.749
we have a plan

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.184
and all this it's incredibly complex.

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:46.519
I mean, I cannot even describe

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:49.689
to 513 teams operational, etc..

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:52.692
And every day from six till two

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:53.726
and all the other teams

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:54.727
that manages their war

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:56.663
to midnight, actually analyzes

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.564
monitoring, independent monitoring.

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:00.667
I can't even describe how complex it is.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.502
I don't the things in Afghanistan

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:04.637
this is way more complex.

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.639
So the request is very clear.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.174
All the pieces of this puzzle

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:09.309
have to fit together.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.576
And the most important,

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:12.979
this is, of course, this

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.782
area specific humanitarian pause us,

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:18.251
which the parties have to stick to

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.585
because otherwise,

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:20.920
if it would have happened,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.923
we will not never reach this goal.

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:26.826
did, this target, the children,

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:27.427
their parents,

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:29.896
everybody will lose their confidence

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:31.030
with the risk

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.132
that we do not stop the transmission

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:34.667
within Gaza,

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.603
and indeed, that the risk of polio spread

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:40.807
out of Gaza and that we, the World Health

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:43.076
Organization, all member states,

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.677
we are working to eradicate

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:45.745
polio of world.

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:47.480
We have only two countries

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.948
where you have the wild polio virus

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:50.016
vanished in Pakistan.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:50.717
You see this

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:53.653
vaccine derived outbreaks always in areas

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:55.388
of strife and war,

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.056
children under vaccinators.

00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:59.459
So we have to tackle this, problem.

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:02.095
Right on. I want to say one more point.

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.296
There is a bit of a fight,

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.230
a positive fight

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.498
about this polio campaign.

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:07.066
We are only in day two.

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:08.868
We have ten more days to go

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.303
and then four weeks later

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:11.270
and the others,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.172
the rest of the health situation

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:15.608
is deeply concerning.

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:17.877
Only yesterday I had another W.H.O.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.412
team going to the north,

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:22.248
bringing few medical supplies,

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:24.717
and taking patients out to get of it.

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:26.552
Yes, from Indonesian hospital.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.087
Come at Walnut Safra.

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:29.355
This was the surge

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:30.656
mission, only approved

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.558
out of eight missions over the last week.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:34.060
And they came back

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.828
at 1:00 in the morning.

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:37.697
Highly dangerous, highly risky

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:39.499
and completely unnecessary.

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:40.967
This has to improve.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:42.468
And my other request,

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:44.270
of course, is everyone.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.472
This would work much better

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.441
if if there would be a ceasefire

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:50.510
and we can make other arrangements.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.645
I mean, this is not an ideal campaign.

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:54.180
In ideal situation,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.115
you want to go house to house.

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:57.583
There's very few houses left.

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:58.985
So we made myself

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:00.119
understand for war, people.

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:05.258
Understood.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:05.958
Well, you've

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:06.659
delineated

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.394
very erudite Lee,

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:10.696
just the sort of challenges

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:11.764
that your organization

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.332
and others supporting you.

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:15.468
are, facing.

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:18.471
but the numbers at present, as you say,

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:20.740
bode well, which is,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.207
you know, a

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:22.308
small ray of light in

00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:23.743
what has been such a dark,

00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:25.411
dull, dark ten months.

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:26.179
Thank you very much

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:27.914
indeed for your own work

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:28.815
and for joining us today.
