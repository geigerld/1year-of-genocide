00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.110
the Israeli defense forces spokesman lieutenant
general Jonathan conricus.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.540
Colonel, I appreciate your time again, obviously
in these early hours of the morning for you.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.460
You heard that man there, you know, asking
the question about his family who are dead.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.410
What did they do to deserve this?

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.960
What is your reaction, colonel, to these accusations
that you hear that the strikes on the jabalia

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.310
refugee camp are hitting civilians and amount
to a massacre by the idf?

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.250
&gt;&gt; Hi, Erin.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.180
Sad images, really, at the human level when
I watch it and I detach myself from the reality

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.780
that we are facing, I see sad events and I
see people suffering, and that is not something

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.260
that we intend to.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.640
What I could say to that man without even
a drop of cynicism is you should've evacuated,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.430
you and your family, you shouldn't have been
there.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.930
That doesn't mean that we wanted to kill anybody,
it just means that when we warned Palestinians

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.390
two weeks ago to evacuate that

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.390
[7:10:29 PM]

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.789
two weeks ago to evacuate that specific area
because there was going to be major combat

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.930
operations, they should've heeded the warning
and they should have left.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.170
The sad reality that is unfolding now is that
the civilians in gaza are paying the price

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.560
for the atrocities of hamas.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.870
We are fighting a battle here to defend ourselves.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.500
We cannot allow a situation for hamas to continue
to exist after the atrocities of October 7th,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.560
and in order for us to be able to safeguard
ourselves, we have to eradicate hamas wherever

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.810
they are, even if they're hiding in tunnels
underneath populated areas.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.430
&gt;&gt; Colonel conricus, to the point about wanting
them to leave, these are 100,000 people in

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.409
a refugee camp.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.010
By definition, they lack resources.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.740
Where were people like that supposed to go?

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.530
Was it even reasonable to tell them to go?

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.440
They don't have anything to begin with.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.280
&gt;&gt; No, no, that is unfortunately not accurate
at all.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.280
I'd like to explain why.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.280
If you look at the footage that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.280
[7:11:29 PM]

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.250
If you look at the footage that you're showing,
you don't see tents.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.289
This isn't some makeshift refugee camp.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.660
These are permanent dwellings of Palestinians
living in a palestinian-controlled area under

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.280
Palestinian rule.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.190
These aren't refugees no more than my grandparents
are refugees who came from Poland and Morocco

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.440
in 1948.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.020
This is the time scope that we are talking
about.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.670
These aren't refugees, and it's not a refugee
camp any more than half of the population

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.130
in modern Israel are refugees or the expulsion
from Arab countries in 1948.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.470
So --
&gt;&gt; Colonel, I understand your point about

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.470
permanence.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.010
I'm sure king Abdullah would say the same
about refugee camps of Syria and Egypt and

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.019
Jordan.

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.541
But, while I understand the point you're making
about the permanency of the residents, they

00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:48.541
are poor.

00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:52.620
They can't leave --
&gt;&gt; Erin, yes, they could, they could.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.480
They made a decision.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.629
The fact that they made the wrong decision
does not make them a target.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:58.629
That is not what I'm saying.

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.629
I am saying that we warned

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.629
[7:12:29 PM]

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:01.629
I am saying that we warned ahead.

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.380
Everybody in jabalia knows the same guy who
was holding the page listing the unfortunate

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.790
death in his family, I feel for him.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.910
But he knows that hamas is there.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.480
He knows that the place is full of what they
call resistance.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.780
All of them know it.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.519
And they know that there will be fighting
there.

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.099
And they know that the safest place for them
to be is not there.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.320
It's in the south.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.610
&gt;&gt; So let me ask you a question about, though,
how you know what you're striking.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.290
Because I know you put out a statement today,
the idf did, at least, colonel, regarding

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.390
the second strike in 24 hours in jabalia camp.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.299
And a quote it is that based on precise intelligence,
idf fighter jets struck hamas command and

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.599
control complex in jabalia.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:50.370
Colonel, of course, we all know Israeli intelligence
failed in the leadup to the hamas terror attack

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.610
on October 7th.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.310
How do you know that Israeli intelligence
is right now?

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.690
&gt;&gt; Erin, I think you asked the same question
three weeks ago,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.690
[7:13:31 PM]

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.060
same question three weeks ago, and I think
I will provide the same answer that I'm saying

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.060
now.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.900
We are basing our military operations of intelligence.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.640
We continue to monitor their communications.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.560
We continue to listen and see what they're
doing.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.440
We issue information, not claims, but we issue
names, faces, and positions of dead hamas

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.950
commanders and key operatives.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.540
We do that because we do still have excellent
intelligence, very granular intelligence of

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.140
what they are doing of their whereabouts.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.720
Granted, I cannot argue with what you said
the first part.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.220
Yes, we failed on October 7th, clearly.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.780
And that needs to be investigated.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.310
But definitely that does not imply that our
intelligence is wrong on the contrary.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.690
We continue working based on that intelligence,
and we generate more intelligence.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.100
Our ground troops are there in friction with
the enemy.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.690
Every encounter when we meet the enemy, we
defeat them, even if we have casualties and

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.160
then we generate more and more targeting
