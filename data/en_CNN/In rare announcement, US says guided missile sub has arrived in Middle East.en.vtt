00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.735
The US is using a submarine

00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:05.839
to send a message to Iran
to stay out of Israel's war against Hamas.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.509
US Central Command posted this photo
of a guided missile submarine.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.544
Apparently heading through the Suez Canal.

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:15.982
That's up contains up to 154
extremely powerful Tomahawk cruise

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:17.450
missiles on board.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.284
It is very rare

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:22.088
for the Pentagon to reveal anything
about the locations of its missile subs.

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:25.458
Telling the world that this sub is now in
the region is a clear message

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.628
to Iran and its proxies
to leave Israel alone.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:29.596
So let's bring in

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:32.532
CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann
with more on this.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:37.070
So despite being forthcoming
about these additional reinforcements

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.942
or and we continue to see an increase
in the number of attacks against U.S.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.745
forces in the region, most

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:49.616
believe that they are
at the hands of Iranian proxies.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:54.287
So what does that say about the type
of deterrence the US is using right now?

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.956
Correct. So let's deal
with both of those separately.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.825
First, there's the issue of the submarine,

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:02.796
a guided missile submarine, an Ohio class
heading through the Suez Canal there.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.397
And that joins a list of U.S.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.399
forces, certainly naval forces

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.736
already in the region to carrier
strike groups on amphibious ready group.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.340
That's more than 10,000 sailors right
there alone, as well as that submarine.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.578
The Navy and the Pentagon are normally
very secretive about submarine operations.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:23.349
So when you see them surface, it is very
much a statement as it is the case here,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:27.087
the Ohio class sub transiting through
what appears to be the Suez Canal there.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.622
A message
very much to Iran and its proxies,

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.691
but they have not been silent either.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:32.192
The U.S.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:36.629
has attributed many of the attacks
and we've seen 38 since October 17th

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.832
against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria.

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:43.336
Many of those attributed to or blamed on
Iran and its proxies in the region.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.339
Most of those have been carried out
by suicide drones.

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:51.478
One way attack drones or rockets
there have been about 20 minor injuries

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:52.545
to U.S. forces.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.914
The vast
majority of those attacks were intercepted

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:58.017
by essentially defensive measures
at the U.S.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:00.520
facilities.
In U.S. positions in Iraq and Syria.

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:03.990
But the barrage has kept up at a fairly
steady pace.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.025
These are not large barrages.

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:09.596
These are almost sort of ones and twos
when it comes to rockets and drones.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:12.565
But they are still significant
because that message of deterrence

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.668
clearly not getting through to the extent
that it's supposed to,

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.704
or at least to the extent
that the Pentagon wants it to.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.607
So this is something
the U.S. is keeping a very close eye on.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.210
Do these militias in Iraq and Syria
try to get more involved?

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.113
Do they up the pressure
and up the attacks on U.S.

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:27.780
forces?

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.550
That is something the Pentagon is watching
very closely be on.

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.553
This is we're getting word
now that President Biden spoke

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:36.856
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu this morning to discuss

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.926
the latest developments in Israel
and its war on Hamas.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.395
CNN Pentagon
correspondent Oren Liebermann, thank you

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:46.533
All right.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:47.033
Want to turn

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:50.470
now to Israel's war against Hamas,
because what we saw over the weekend

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.575
may indeed have been one of Israel's
heaviest bombards months of Gaza.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.378
The war torn territory
really getting pummeled

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:02.081
overnight,
both in the air and on the ground as well.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:06.319
The IDF is saying that it has cut off
the northern part of the enclave

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:10.356
from the south, effectively
splitting Gaza into two parts

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:15.595
and warning that its forces will continue
to attack the enclave with strength.

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:18.531
Israel is urging civilians
to escape to the south in order

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:22.969
to avoid the airstrikes, but many say
there is just nowhere safe to run.

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.672
The death
toll throughout Gaza is skyrocketing.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:28.841
The Hamas controlled Ministry of Health
says there are more than 10,000

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:32.011
Palestinians who have been killed
since the war began last month.

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.214
Most of them women and children.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.550
The US secretary of state,
meantime, wrapping up a whirlwind

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.019
diplomatic tour in the region.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.922
Earlier, he's been on this trip
so many times in the past few weeks

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.559
before leaving Turkey,
Anthony Blinken underscored the importance

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.662
of protecting all civilian lives.

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.932
We know the

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:58.805
deep concern here for the terrible toll
that Gaza is taking on Palestinians,

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:02.508
on men, women and children
in Gaza, innocent civilians.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:06.646
A concern that we share and that we're
working on every single day.

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:11.050
We've engaged the Israelis on steps
that they can take

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:14.220
to minimize civilian casualties

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.554
All right.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:18.024
CNN's Jamie Diamond joins us
live now from Sderot in southern Israel.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:21.194
Jeremy, it is highly likely that the IDF
is going to be officially entering

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:24.030
Gaza City in the coming days.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:27.600
Just walk us through
how the IDF expects that Hamas

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.704
is actually preparing for that moment.

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.841
Well, there's no question
that the Israeli military has prepared for

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:38.111
the fact that Hamas
has been reinforcing its positions

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:42.482
inside of Gaza City, which is Hamas's
stronghold in northern Gaza.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.985
And, you know, over the weekend,
when I was inside Gaza with Israeli

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:51.090
forces, it was very clear that even though
they say they have cut off northern

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.627
from southern Gaza, the commanders on
the ground were very clear to me

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:58.731
that they understand that Hamas still
maintains extensive tunnel capabilities

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:02.335
below ground that allows their fighters
to flow from north to south.

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:06.306
And that also presents a danger
to those forces in the air

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.542
for potential ambushes by Hamas fighters.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:12.879
And there is nowhere that Hamas
has more tunneling capabilities,

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:17.450
it appears, than inside the densely
populated urban areas of Gaza

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.451
City as of yet.

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:19.886
Israeli forces say

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:22.922
that they have encircled that city,
that they have cut off northern

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.390
from southern Gaza.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.462
But what they have yet to do is go deep
into Gaza City to engage in what will be

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:35.668
the prospect of very bloody, deadly combat
in a very urban and dense environment.

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:39.439
But what Israel has been doing to prepare
for the possibility

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:43.076
of a significant ground
incursion into Gaza City is

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:46.346
it has been pummeling northern Gaza
with airstrikes overnight.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:50.350
450 targets were struck by Israel's
military.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.820
We watched last night as
many of those strikes were taking place.

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:57.256
Very bright
flashes of light, very loud booms.

00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:01.027
And we are watching once again
as night has fallen here as those strikes

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:06.899
have resumed with quite a series
significant intensity.

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:08.201
Last night,

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:12.805
what we also saw was communications
in Gaza being effectively shut down.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.474
Some of those have resumed today.

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:17.744
But it was notable to see that
because communications have typically

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:22.715
been shut down at very significant moments
in Israel's campaign against Gaza.

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:28.321
So we will see whether Israel decides
to actually go deep into Gaza City.

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:29.889
Clearly, they have encircled the area.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.424
They say that they are establishing

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:34.227
a corridor
for civilians to flee from north to south.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.461
We know that in the past

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:39.298
that has not always been a 100% guarantee
or close to it of safety.

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:40.867
For those civilians.

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:44.170
And so a lot remains to be seen
as Israel's military

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.272
campaign develops in the coming days.

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:49.742
Yeah, a lot of the civilians in the north
simply have nowhere to go either.

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:52.078
They have been told to head south. Jeremy
Diamond life was that.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:52.912
Thank you so much.
