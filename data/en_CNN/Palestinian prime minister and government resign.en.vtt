00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.867
Israeli military has

00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:01.701
also presented

00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:03.470
a plan for evacuating civilians

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.672
from the areas of fighting in Gaza.

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:06.573
Prime Minister Benjamin

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:07.540
Netanyahu's office

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.775
says the IDF presented

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:09.442
the war cabinet

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.745
with an upcoming operational plan,

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:13.279
but it doesn't specifically mention

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.347
the southern

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.582
Gaza city of Rafah,

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:16.916
where Israel is being planning

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.219
a potential ground offensive.

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:20.453
This comes as talks are expected

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.055
to resume in Qatar today

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.189
to try to secure the release

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.958
of more hostages in

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.493
Gaza in exchange for a pause

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:27.160
in the fighting.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.195
Journalist Eliot Cohen joins us.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:29.629
Let's start

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:30.697
with those hostage talks then,

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.033
because you're describing how that does

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.601
appear still to be some momentum

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.301
behind them.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:35.702
That does,

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:36.069
we have these

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.571
talks in Paris on Friday and Saturday.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.873
And we had Jake Sullivan

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.708
of the National Security Council

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.642
coming out after saying there's

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.778
an understanding on the contours

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:46.679
of a potential deal had been reached.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.181
So now it seems that in Doha,

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.416
they're going to be trying to deal

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.183
with the thornier

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.352
issues to try to deal with those details

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.120
and come to some kind of compromise.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.487
Now, up

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.089
until these talks, the sticking point,

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.891
at least so far as Israel was concerned,

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:58.658
was Hamas

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:00.160
demands that there be a complete

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.528
cessation of hostilities

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.662
and the release of thousands

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:03.663
of Palestinian

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:04.631
prisoners,

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.698
demands that Prime Minister

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.867
Netanyahu described as delusional.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.502
So the hope now is that

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.004
perhaps they are inching towards

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.072
some kind of compromise,

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:12.872
which, as you say,

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.908
would lead to the freeing of some,

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:15.575
but probably not

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.343
all of those Israeli hostages.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:19.079
More than just round about 100

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.113
believed to still be alive

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.314
and being held in captivity

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:22.015
in the Gaza Strip

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.083
after being kidnaped on October

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:23.850
the seventh

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.584
in exchange

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.052
for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners.

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:26.853
And, of course,

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:28.254
the all important humanity

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.290
and pause of around about six weeks.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.524
And, of course, at the same time

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.660
is that a surge in humanitarian

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.061
aid to go where it's desperately needed

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.865
in terms of the Palestinian Authority

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.134
What's the latest situation there

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:42.602
in terms of leadership?

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.170
So we heard just this morning

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.804
that the prime

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:46.072
minister, Mohammed Shtayyeh,

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.207
submitted his resignation

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.975
along with that of his entire government

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.009
to Mahmoud

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:50.944
Abbas, the president

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.378
of the Palestinian Authority.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.080
Now, he still needs to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.682
offer his resignation in person.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.450
That still needs to be accepted.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.085
But this is seen to be

00:01:59.085 --> 00:01:59.719
perhaps one

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.521
step towards the

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:03.756
revitalization, the reconstitution

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.492
of the Palestinian Authority,

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:06.292
to enable it

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.294
to be palatable to the Americans

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.729
and perhaps less

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.331
unpalatable to the Israelis

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.299
for taking control of the Gaza Strip

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.701
that they after this war.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.970
Now, he will probably be asked to stay on

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.670
as a caretaker

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.538
prime minister

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:19.806
And there's no indication

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:20.974
that whoever replaces him

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:21.774
will be any different.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:22.475
And, of course,

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:23.343
the real change

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.811
for the Palestinian Authority least,

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.412
it won't be seen as changing

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:27.614
to any serious degree

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:28.781
until such time as Mahmoud

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.483
Abbas is no longer president.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.584
He, of course, is in now

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.720
the 19th year of a four year term.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.122
He's widely reviled among Palestinians.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:36.723
He's widely

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:38.224
seen as being corrupt as well.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.160
So I think for the Palestinian Authority

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.395
to be seen to be really changing

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:42.829
that,

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.563
Mahmoud Abbas

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.932
would probably be expected to go as well.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.634
Okay, Eliot, thank you so much.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:47.967
The death

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:48.868
toll from

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:49.569
this conflict

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.905
is also rising outside of Gaza.

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:53.907
The Palestinian Ministry of Health

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:56.142
says more than 400 Palestinians

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.410
have now been killed

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.978
in the occupied West Bank

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.346
and East Jerusalem

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:00.713
since

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.015
October 7th, either

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.184
by Israeli forces or settlers.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.719
That would include three Palestinians

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.821
killed in the Jenin refugee camp

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.858
this past week, which the IDF confirmed

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:12.392
as part

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:13.493
of what they described

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.662
as a counter terrorism raid.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:16.529
Our Nic

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:17.397
Robertson met

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:18.665
with the father of slain

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.534
Palestinian-American teen Tawfiq Abdul

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:24.037
Jabbar, who was shot in the West Bank

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.038
last month.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.506
His father says their family

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.374
is still struggling for answers

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.642
and trying to bring the person

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.010
responsible for his son's

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.278
killing to justice.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.081
Yeah, so this dirt road,

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:36.216
you see it down here?

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.584
Yeah. This is where we are.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:40.787
Tawfiq was shot at an American father,

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:44.157
Hafez Abdul Jabbar, showing us his family

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.993
land where he says his son was murdered.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.562
By an Israeli settler in January.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.931
He wasn't going to do anything wrong,

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:53.132
simply a barbecue

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:54.801
Friday prayer and come back home.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:55.969
And he's not a terrorist.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:56.970
He's a American.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.272
Palestinian kid full of life

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.208
wanted to do so much in his life.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:04.978
His son Tawfiq, was 17 years

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:07.847
old, studying towards his dream job.

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:09.682
Nasser engineer.

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:12.185
The family, left Louisiana last spring,

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.953
returning temporarily

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:16.489
to their roots in the occupied West Bank.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:19.025
They visited their ancestral hilltop

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.060
village home most years.

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:22.762
All around the village,

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:25.198
there are murals of Cow Fig

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.234
remembered immortalized, and underneath

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:30.970
it says the smiling martyr.

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:33.139
Tough weeks trauma

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.575
increasingly common in the West Bank.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.010
And this is getting worse

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.745
and worse in the worst since October.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:39.746
That way, worse.

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:41.481
They're turning it more like into Gaza.

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.716
Exactly. They want to turn up to Gaza.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.152
You see the bullet? Yes.

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.787
A month after Tawfik

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.089
death, Hafez is struggling

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.624
to get justice.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:52.592
The single shot

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:55.561
that killed his son, an exploding bullet

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.430
entering the back of his head,

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.233
clear in the CT scan of his brain.

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.435
Photos of the crime scene

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:04.103
and an investigation

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:06.773
by the Palestinian Authority document.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.908
Ten shots.

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:11.110
Video shows what Hafez says

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.646
is a soldier taking the final shot.

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.381
An eyewitness says

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.550
a settler took the first shot.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.952
Israeli investigators say an off duty

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:21.087
police officer

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:23.923
and an off duty soldier were also present

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.992
at the time of 12 week's killing,

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.261
but have yet to charge any of them.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:31.197
They say the investigation is ongoing.

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:32.832
That's the problem that I'm facing

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.068
right now that we all face in here.

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:36.869
That when they do such a thing

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:38.004
and they're not stopped

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.039
and they're not questioned, it's okay

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.007
for them to do it again

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:41.841
and again and again.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.543
And that's what keeps happening here.

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:44.644
This is not the first kid

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.846
that got shot and killed in the same area

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.381
since October 7th.

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:49.115
Nearly 400

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:50.883
Palestinians have been killed

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:53.219
by Israeli soldiers and Israeli settlers.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.154
There are currently 9000

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:57.290
Palestinians being held in Israeli

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.825
prisons and jails.

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:00.660
Sari Bashi is an Israeli

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.195
human rights expert

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.396
living in the West

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:05.164
Bank, has been tracking

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:06.632
Israeli security force

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:09.001
tactics there for more than a decade.

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:13.172
Hamas says brutal October 7th attacks.

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:15.675
She believes became a watershed

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:16.876
for unprecedented

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.245
Israeli violence in the West Bank.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:21.414
We have seen things piloted

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:21.981
in Gaza

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.616
and later moved to the West Bank

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:25.351
in terms of the levels of violence.

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.487
The airstrikes, the drone strikes

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.788
in Gaza

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:29.355
are starting

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:30.189
to become much

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:33.393
more frequent in the West Bank.

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:36.562
And not just more aggressive

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:37.964
and more frequent,

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:39.098
but more audacious

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:42.135
to not to mention possibly illegal,

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.269
according to U.N.

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:44.170
experts

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.872
like this, covert Israeli

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:47.874
special forces up in a hospital

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.742
that killed three militants

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.978
believed to be planning an attack.

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:54.180
The hospital says the men were sleeping

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.948
when shot.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.085
IDF diggers gouging out West

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.119
Bank streets,

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:02.021
rendering them unusable

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:04.891
akin to Gaza's battle torn thoroughfares.

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:07.226
Also deepens fears

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:09.662
the West Bank is worsening

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.398
the impact of Israel's actions

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:13.566
according to respected

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:16.502
Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki,

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:19.439
is enabling groups like Hamas.

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:21.507
The West Bank is becoming more

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:22.742
militant today

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:25.411
than Gaza was before the war or today

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:26.846
because of what the Israeli

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:27.947
government is doing here,

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:28.548
because of what

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:29.782
the Israeli government is doing,

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:30.850
what the army is doing,

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.552
and what the settlers are doing.

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:34.454
While we support in such a regime

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.989
like that, Hafez is angry.

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:37.790
President Joe

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.626
Biden isn't doing more to pressure Israel

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:43.496
to rein in radical settler leaders,

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:46.132
like Security Minister Ma Ben-gvir,

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:48.000
whose party has called

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.303
for the annexation of the West Bank.

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:53.873
The Israeli government

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:54.574
maintains

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:56.042
its military operations

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:59.178
only target terror suspects, but

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.446
settler violence

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:02.682
has spiraled in recent months.

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:04.217
These officials on TV

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:05.518
from the Israeli governments

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:07.887
making these comments and passing weapons

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:08.754
from being a four year

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.022
old to these settlers,

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.757
that's why they feel like

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:12.692
they can do anything

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:14.727
without being charged

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:16.362
or without being stopped.

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:17.563
Impunity

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:18.631
that is ripping

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:21.067
irreversibly through his family.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.136
How can they forget their brother?

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:26.205
Can they ever forget their brother?

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:27.039
Can they ever forget

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:28.808
who shot their brother?

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:29.475
No.

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:30.409
Well, I told my wife

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.144
I want to have another Tawfik

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:34.981
and I want my older son to get married

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:36.549
and have another two feet

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.918
across the square from his family home.

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:40.920
That predates Israel's creation

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.955
by more than 70 years.

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:45.157
Is the town's cemetery to fix

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:47.827
where Tawfik is buried?

00:08:47.827 --> 00:08:50.897
Feet from two of Hafez's uncles whom

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:53.132
he says were killed by settlers

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:55.034
36 years ago.

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:56.769
That's a message to them,

00:08:56.769 --> 00:08:58.337
to the Israeli government.

00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:00.273
We're not going nowhere.

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:02.074
Even if you put all of us right here,

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:04.410
generations will come.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.512
And for to this country from you guys.

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:08.781
Defiance. Yes.

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:12.184
But beneath it a father struggling.

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:15.187
When do I see him again?

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:17.690
Want to see my 17 years old

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:18.224
again?

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:22.595
When?

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:25.431
When do I get to see him again?

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:25.865
That's.

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:28.768
That's the minute that I

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:31.771
right now I think about.

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:32.872
I don't think about money.

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:34.707
I don't think about business anymore.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:36.242
I don't think about anything else

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.577
other than

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:42.782
when do I see my son again?

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:45.484
