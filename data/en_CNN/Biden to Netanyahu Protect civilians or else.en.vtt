00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.600
We need to go to

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.102
Secretary of State Blinken.

00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:03.069
He is in Brussels.

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:03.803
Let's listen in

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.372
and we'll come back to that.

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:08.341
And I made clear then

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.543
the commitment of the United States

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:13.480
to Israel's security and to ensuring

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.949
that October 7th

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.818
could never happen again.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.654
I also underscored Israel's moral,

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.692
strategic and legal requirements

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.462
to protect civilians and provide

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.864
humanitarian assistance

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.465
to those who needed it.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.934
Now, of course,

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.304
what happened after October 7th

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.840
could have ended immediately

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.443
if Hamas had stopped hiding behind

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.879
civilians, released the hostages

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:50.283
and put down its weapons

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:53.787
But Israel is not Hamas.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.589
Israel is a democracy.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.559
Hamas, a terrorist organization,

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.360
and democracies

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.595
place the highest value on human life.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:06.499
Every human life,

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.368
as has been said,

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:10.770
whoever saves the life,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.172
saves the entire world.

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.108
That's our strength.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.544
It's what distinguishes us

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:18.745
from terrorists.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.180
Like Hamas.

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:24.317
If we lose that reverence for human life,

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.754
we risk becoming indistinguishable

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.756
from those we confront

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.026
Here's the current reality in Gaza.

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.795
Despite important steps

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:36.529
that Israel has taken

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.532
to allow assistance into Gaza.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.734
The results on the ground

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.204
are woefully insufficient

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.939
and unacceptable.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:49.175
100% of the population in Gaza

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.811
knows acute levels of food insecurity.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:55.048
100% of the population

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:57.784
is in need of humanitarian assistance

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.886
and those working heroically

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:03.323
to provide that assistance are doing so

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.326
in great peril to their own lives.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.696
This week's horrific attack

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.332
on the world's central kitchen

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:15.235
was not the first such incident.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:18.471
It must be the last.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:19.973
President Biden spoke a short

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.942
while ago with Prime Minister Netanyahu.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:23.810
The leaders discussed

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.878
the situation in Gaza.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:27.080
The president

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.481
emphasized that the strikes

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.183
on humanitarian workers

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:32.352
and the overall humanitarian situation

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.621
are unacceptable.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.122
He made clear

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:38.491
the need for Israel to announce

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.394
a series of specific concrete

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.062
and measurable steps to address

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:46.032
civilian harm, humanitarian suffering

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.602
and the safety of aid workers.

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.337
He made clear that U.S.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.273
policy with respect to Gaza

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.541
will be determined

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:55.408
by our assessment

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:57.410
of Israel's immediate action

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.912
on these steps.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.146
He underscored as well

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:02.682
that an immediate cease fire is essential

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.516
to stabilize

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.018
and improve the humanitarian situation

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.753
and protect innocent civilians.

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.221
And he urged Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.956
to empower his negotiators

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:10.990
to conclude a deal

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.493
without delay to bring the hostages home.

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:16.696
The two leaders also discussed

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.199
public Iranian threats against Israel

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.201
and the Israeli people.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.235
President Biden reaffirmed

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.603
the United States strong support

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:24.604
for Israel

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.506
in the face of these threats

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.641
and our commitment to Israel's security

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.411
Right now,

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:34.314
there is no higher priority in Gaza

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:36.482
than protecting civilians.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.651
Surging humanitarian assistance

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.753
and ensuring the security

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.722
of those who provide it.

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.025
Israel must meet this moment.

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:46.593
We've been.

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:47.860
We discussed Secretary of State

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.262
Antony Blinken at NATO's

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.730
headquarters on the 75th

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.098
anniversary of the founding

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:53.132
of the organization.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:55.235
He's live in Brussels, Belgium.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.103
Some significant remarks

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.339
when it comes to the conflict in Gaza.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.440
The secretary of state saying

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.374
that he has communicated

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.610
to Israeli officials not only the U.S.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.711
his commitment

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:05.612
to Israel

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:06.646
and its war against Hamas,

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:10.350
but also the moral obligation that Israel

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.884
has to protect civilians

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:14.020
and aid workers in the Gaza Strip.

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:15.622
He specifically said,

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:16.189
and I quote,

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.458
If we lose reverence for human life,

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.893
we become indistinguishable

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:23.096
from them, from Hamas terrorists.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:26.132
He described the efforts so far

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.034
by Israel since October seven to protect

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:30.136
civilians and humanitarian aid workers

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:32.171
as woefully inadequate.

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:33.973
And he laid out what we just got

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:34.941
a readout from the call

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:35.675
that President Biden

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:37.477
had with the prime minister

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:40.213
that the United States would consider

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:41.281
its approach to Israel

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.217
based on concrete steps to change

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.853
the way that Israelis handled civilians

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:47.954
and aid workers.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.922
That's what
they're expecting data from Israel,

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:50.723
which is clear.

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:51.758
He said,

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:53.559
that they need to have concrete,

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.963
measurable steps to address harm

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:57.964
to civilians,

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.198
civilians suffering,

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:00.633
and also to aid workers.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:03.436
And he said that US aid to Gaza

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.372
may be determined by those steps.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:07.473
That's essentially what he said.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:08.641
And this is really significant

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.343
because it comes on the heels

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.512
of a very close Biden ally.

00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:14.180
Senator Coons,

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.181
talking this morning

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:15.915
about being open

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:17.650
to putting conditions on aid to Israel,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.985
which is really

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.953
the first time that we have heard

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:22.422
the administration go so far.

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:23.690
And this is even as we're

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.058
hearing from a senior administration

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:27.160
official, that the policy hasn't changed.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.028
The president is frustrated.

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:30.596
The policy hasn't changed.

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:32.765
This is signaling a potential

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:33.933
policy change.

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:36.002
So nonetheless, this is this is big.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:36.836
Absolutely.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.639
Notably, the timing of the the apparent

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.708
accidental strike coming

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:43.076
almost a day after the U.S.

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.711
announced this enormous deal.

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:48.181
$18 billion to sell F-15 fighter jets

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.182
to Israel.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:49.949
The question now

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.751
being, is this rhetoric

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:53.386
that actually moves the needle or do

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:55.655
there have to be conditions on arms

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:56.122
in order

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.657
to get Prime Minister

00:05:57.657 --> 00:05:58.791
Netanyahu and some of the other

00:05:58.791 --> 00:05:59.959
Israeli officials

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:00.560
to carry out

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.694
significant change in the way

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.663
that they've been conducting the war?

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:04.864
We have with us

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:06.299
retired Colonel

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:06.966
Cedric Leighton

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:08.901
to give us some perspective.

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:09.502
Colonel Leighton,

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:10.136
from what you heard

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:12.338
from the secretary of state there,

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:14.741
it is a noticeable shift

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:16.409
saying that the policy toward

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.978
Israel will change, determined on

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:21.447
the way that

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.349
Israel conducts its operations in Gaza.

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:23.983
Absolutely.

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:24.684
And in essence,

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:25.351
what we're talking about,

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.153
Boris here is conditioning the aide

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:29.155
on Israeli conduct going forward.

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:30.656
I and I guess

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.125
in this case, you can kind of say

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.059
past is prolog

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.062
because the past conduct of Israeli

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.364
operations has not met U.S. standards.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:39.732
And at this point in time,

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:40.366
it appears

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.467
as if it appears

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:43.336
as if the Department of Defense

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.570
and the administration

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.037
are looking

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:47.240
at changing the policy potentially

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.841
where they actually say, look,

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.810
you cannot use these weapons

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.078
against civilian targets,

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.514
you cannot use these weapons against

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:55.314
aid workers.

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:56.816
And that's the kind of thing

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:59.018
that I think might be happening here.

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:00.753
Whether or not it does, of course, is

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:02.889
is going to be borne out in the next

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:04.323
few days, probably.

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:04.857
But didn't

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:07.827
you mention the F-15 sale to Israel?

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.428
That's something

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:09.395
that's going to take place over

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.930
the next four or five years

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.264
in order

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.398
to actually get those weapons

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:13.466
to the Israelis.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:14.133
But the other part of

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:16.536
this is they have already delivered,

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:17.470
Aaron, in the process

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.505
of delivering more £2,000 bombs

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:20.606
to Israel.

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:22.308
That's a much more immediate thing.

00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:23.176
It's going to be interesting

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:25.678
to see
whether or not that delivery is stopped

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:28.181
before they actually are

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:31.017
put into Israeli airplanes

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:32.618
for potential use.

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:33.319
And that's

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:34.887
that's going to be a significant thing.

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:36.756
There are two things that the Israelis

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:37.457
that the U.S.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:38.491
is worried about with Israel.

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:39.025
One of them is

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:40.893
the immediate conduct in Gaza.

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:42.829
The second thing is using Israel

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.430
as a buffer against Iran.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.532
And that is going to be

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:47.633
kind of the balancing act

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:48.968
that the administration has to deal

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:49.869
with at this point.

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:51.871
Let's listen in to Admiral Kirby

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:53.906
and the overall humanitarian situation

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:55.508
in Gaza are unacceptable.

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:57.944
He made clear

00:07:57.944 --> 00:07:58.277
the need

00:07:58.277 --> 00:07:59.479
for Israel to announce

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:00.213
and to implement

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.048
a series of specific concrete

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.483
and measurable steps

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.451
to address civilian harm,

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.153
humanitarian suffering

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.489
and the safety of aid workers.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.257
He made clear that U.S.

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:12.758
policy with respect to Gaza

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:15.027
will be determined by our assessment

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.363
of Israel's immediate action

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:19.031
on these steps.

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:20.733
He underscored that an immediate cease

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:22.702
fire is essential to stabilize

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:24.904
and improve the humanitarian situation

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:26.772
and to protect innocent civilians.

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:28.207
And he urged the prime minister

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:29.642
to empower his negotiators

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:30.476
to conclude a deal

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:32.512
without delay to bring the hostages home.

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:34.714
The two leaders also discussed

00:08:34.714 --> 00:08:36.716
public Iranian threats against Israel

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:38.251
and the Israeli people.

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:39.852
President Biden made clear

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:41.087
that the United States

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:42.421
strongly supports Israel

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:43.990
in the face of those threats.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.924
That's all I have.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:45.558
Admiral,

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:48.361
you're not specifying what concrete steps

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:49.662
Israel must take.

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:50.596
Example, I.

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:53.833
I gave you some of a broad sense of it.

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:55.801
We want to see more crossings opened up.

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.169
We want to see more trucks getting

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:58.371
in, particularly from Jordan.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.007
We want to see

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:03.476
tangible steps that the mitigation

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:05.144
of civilian harm,

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:07.747
particularly to humanitarian aid workers,

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:08.981
but obviously all civilians.

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:11.417
But we want to see that they have

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:12.552
that they have moved forward

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.587
on proper steps to de-conflict

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:16.556
with aid workers

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:17.023
as they move

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:19.659
around, that the information flow

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:20.826
is vital.

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:23.429
Their language we've heard for weeks

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:25.698
now, you're not talking about

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:26.599
sort of telling us

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:27.466
how exactly

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:30.202
you will measure those measurable steps

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:32.672
right.

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:34.774
What I said was

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:36.842
we're going to

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:37.777
we're going to

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:40.112
examine our policy approaches

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:43.316
based on the our assessment of the way

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.651
the Israeli side

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:49.388
modifies their behavior,

00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:51.891
modifies their policy and decision

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:53.426
making processes.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.493
And so,

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:55.728
first of all, let's

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:57.730
see what they say they're going to do.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.831
And then let's watch

00:09:58.831 --> 00:09:59.532
and see

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:00.933
how they execute to what they say.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.134
And I don't want to get ahead of them

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:03.269
on what they are

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.070
and what they

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.805
what they plan to say about the changes

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:06.739
they're going to make.

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:08.374
But we'll base

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:09.342
our policy decisions

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:10.276
based on an assessment

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.444
of how they execute

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.745
to their policy decisions.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:13.412
You're not talking

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:14.146
about what

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:15.481
potential US

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:17.550
policy changes are on the table.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.652
Can you say whether the president

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:21.120
share that with the Prime Minister

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.121
on this phone call?

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:23.623
The President made clear

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.025
that the that absent changes

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:27.460
in the protection

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.995
of civilians on the ground, absent

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:30.896
changes to the

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:32.565
volume of humanitarian assistance

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:33.799
getting in, absent

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:37.837
absent any movement on

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:41.807
a cease fire

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:44.610
that will allow hostages

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.078
to get out and more aid to get in.

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:48.848
Absent, you know, a calming down

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:49.749
that he will have

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:51.917
to reconsider his own policy

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:53.819
choices with respect to Gaza.
