00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.089
Audie, let's talk a little bit more about
the community in Michigan.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.410
That as you talked a little bit about this
yesterday about just the sheer emotion that

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.410
is driving this.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.710
And just to kinda give people a sense, in
Michigan, David referenced the 10,000 votes

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.880
that separated Hillary Clinton from Donald
Trump when Donald Trump won Michigan, it was

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:32.239
150,000 votes that separated trump and Biden
when we in the 2020 when Biden won, there

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.370
are about 140,000 people who voted in that
election who say that they are muslims.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.039
Now that's obviously not all air Americans
are Muslim.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.860
Not all muslims are Arab American.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.559
But this is a really significant community.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.340
And to leave has been encouraging them to
vote as a book block.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.850
How do you see that playing out?

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.640
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that's the point of primaries,
right?

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.850
It's, it's, you're moment as she says, to
have a bull horn and say this is the issue

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.850
that

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.850
[6:07:27 AM]

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.850
and say this is the issue that matters to
me.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.600
I'd also like to broaden this out because
this is not necessarily an issue.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.820
What's going on in gaza that is affecting
Arab Americans only generationally young people

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.010
but democratic party view this differently.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.360
Michigan has a large student population.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.760
Michigan has, as you said, a large arab-american
and even black Muslim population.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.420
These are all people who find affinity with
what they see as oppression in the region

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.640
and one of the reasons why I think this is
an interesting test is having a test the coalition,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.509
meaning you're white blue collar labor guys,
your various affinity groups, your students.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.580
This is a different picture than South Carolina.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.030
Don't you think where it was really more like,
hey, remember those folks who helped us last

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.030
time.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.030
Are they coming back?

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.600
This is like, oh, well, what is the picture
of the group of voters?

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.469
To backup Biden and is this going to happen
&gt;&gt; I mean, is that

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:52.940
&gt;&gt; Too much?

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.280
And I think you get a little representative
in Michigan of each slice of his

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.280
[6:08:29 AM]

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.330
Michigan of each slice of his co yeah
&gt;&gt; They're saying, look, you walk the picket

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.940
lines for labor, like the mayor of Dearborn
was upset when they sent campaign people instead

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.560
of policy people to talk about that Middle
East, they're saying, take us seriously.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.160
And I think that's maybe how we can think
of it instead of just sort of like which identity

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.810
group is complaining today
&gt;&gt; Fair enough.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.810
Let's take a look.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.612
John Stuart actually opened the Daily Show
with a monologue about gaza last night, I

00:02:21.612 --> 00:02:32.219
want to watch a little bit that good could
you please be more careful with

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.370
&gt;&gt; Your bombing?

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.700
Go to but really good in the united States
have told Israel that when we gave him all

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.830
the ball bombs like you're coc, dealer coming
in with an eight ball and going don't stay

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.470
up all night
&gt;&gt; Jonah Goldberg, we've talked a lot about

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.910
where Democrats are on this and Ashley, you
know, weigh in too, but there's a reason why

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.500
the president has been worry is this entire
time on this issue, which is that still despite

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.500
the pressure from

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.500
[6:09:31 AM]

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.560
still despite the pressure from Progressives,
a lot of the countries with them on Israel,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.510
yeah that's my problem with the way the media
generally talks about the Michigan issue at

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.250
all that is you know, there's nothing wrong
with the squeaky wheel getting attention.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.570
That's how politics, that's up them awkward.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.180
It rks people who organized and protest get
attention at the same time.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.250
It's sort of assumed that if he would just
switch positions to what the sort of the receipt,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.340
it's Williams won that would solve as political
problems and it would not David's right about

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.780
Michigan being on the teetering point for
Biden.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.180
If he went whole hog the other way, he probably
lose Pennsylvania.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.349
&gt;&gt; And he might
&gt;&gt; And it's not obvious to me when you look

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.959
at the numbers that that switching positions
would gain him more votes than would lose

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.780
them even in Michigan.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.810
&gt;&gt; This all
&gt;&gt; Goes to the bit and I think this is part

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.340
of Audie's point, is like it's more of a generational
thing that is a real threat to Biden than

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.930
the Arab American and are Muslim vote and
Michigan and it just goes effect that his

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.390
coalition is much bigger than Donald

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.390
[6:10:31 AM]

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.390
is much bigger than Donald Trump's.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.440
And therefore, you going to have people on
different sides of issues and the same coalition

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.790
fdr had straight up klansman and communists,
Jews, and blacks and his coalition and weird

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.440
things happen in making us back to that it
was a big tent party back then.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.070
And so I think that he's just it's not bad
position where he is kind of a no-win political

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.439
situation no matter what.

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:23.439
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:28.910
No the president and administrations and walk-ins
incredibly fine line for months now since

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.650
October, in fact.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.919
But I think the announcement that we're close
to a ceasefire is a game changer, especially

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.030
going into Michigan tonight and expense especially
going into the state of union.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.460
So I am hearing has from the administration
that they're sort of breathing a sigh of relief

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.729
to some degree that there could be some pressure
being led out the bow here and will.

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.340
But we'll see to everyone's point tonight
how this plays out.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.509
But I don't think that there's any sort of
hair on fire concern because again, I think

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.190
they think that this whole thing will be wrapped
up and we still have eight more months.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.190
[6:11:33 AM]

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.190
eight more months.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.320
&gt;&gt; Very interesting, I will say max foster
earlier in the show
