00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:00.767
Tal Heinrich.

00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:01.034
She is

00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.502
spokesperson for the Israeli

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:04.571
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:05.372
And Tal, it's

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:05.939
great to be with you,

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:06.873
of course, here in New York.

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.208
So,

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.909
you know, just to start with the

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.545
the limited flooding of the tunnels

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.280
that we understand the IDF is doing.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.881
Israel says it's

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.950
doing on a limited basis in tunnels

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.385
where they do not believe

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:19.919
hostages are being held prisoner.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.955
Biden says that is an assertion

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.656
that he cannot confirm it.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:24.724
How do you know for sure

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:25.959
that there are no hostages

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.527
in the tunnels being flooded?

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.261
First, Erin,

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.162
regarding the tunnels,

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.130
I cannot comment

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.831
on operational military activity

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.266
happening on the ground or anything

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.468
strategic moving ahead.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:36.202
This is a question

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.004
that you will have to refer to the IDF.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:38.838
What I can say

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:39.906
is that we said in the past,

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.241
the IDF spokesperson has said

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.809
that we're looking at various ways

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.144
to eliminate these tunnels.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.478
We have eliminated

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.148
much of the tunnel infrastructure,

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.916
but there are still many of them,

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:50.750
as you heard from

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.551
from your reporter

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.019
also in the area of Khan Yunis,

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.588
where our forces are now operating.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:59.192
And obviously, when we work on the ground

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:00.093
to eliminate the Hamas

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.327
service regime in Gaza,

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.095
the hostages

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.631
situation is the top of mind.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.265
Yes.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:06.933
I'm curious, though, and I understand

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:07.901
they're saying where they don't believe

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:08.701
the hostages are.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.036
But a question to you

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.805
just on an intelligence basis,

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:15.542
if Israel knows where they are not,

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.911
how do you know where they are?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:18.511
Well, again,

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.213
this is a question for the IDF.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.181
What we know

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:21.781
is that Hamas

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.049
in the response to pressure.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.751
We have seen the release of hostages

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:25.351
so far

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.220
based on the outline that we agreed upon,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.289
because thanks to the military pressure

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.890
and we continue to hit them hard

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.125
because we want to reach

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.026
the twofold goal,

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:33.426
the mission

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.761
that we have defined for this war.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.362
So President Biden has warned

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.764
Israel it's losing support. Right.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.199
He said to the Prime minister, Netanyahu,

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.867
you need to change your tactics and

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.870
and likely your government.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.171
Is there a response

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.339
from the prime minister?

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:46.773
Well, first,

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.274
Israel is a democratic states.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.075
They're the ones who

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:49.809
choose the government,

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:52.212
as you know, or the people of Israel.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.012
And right now,

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.581
my country is not dealing with politics.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:54.814
Aaron.

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:55.748
From left to right,

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.050
there's a public consensus.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.251
We're all united right now

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.419
around the goal.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.221
And the goal is to defeat Hamas.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:02.055
You know,

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.556
the terrorists targeted us

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:04.491
on October 7th.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:05.492
They didn't ask

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.694
who voted for who, for which party.

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:08.695
They didn't care.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:09.062
And, you know,

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.597
some of these hardest hit communities

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.198
and I know that you've been

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.300
you've been to the southern areas

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.303
are honestly the people

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.739
who are most strong

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.308
supporters of the Palestinian cause

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.243
in certain areas.

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:24.544
And they of them were in those kibbutzim.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:27.280
Yes. Right. So

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.582
in terms of the civilians,

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:30.183
General Clark

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.518
was talking about how when you fled,

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:32.852
there's unknown consequences

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:33.319
at this point.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.953
Could involve, say,

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.188
buildings coming down. Right.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:37.490
Obviously unknown at this point

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.492
as he lays it out.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.627
A lot of civilians have died.

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:41.961
We know that.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.229
Israel says

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.165
the IDF says they've killed at least 7000

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.232
Hamas members.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:46.566
Obviously,

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.201
we can't independently confirm that.

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:50.036
But I did recently speak to Jonathan

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.671
Conricus, IDF spokesperson,

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.339
and I asked him about a report

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.507
that said that senior

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.608
Israeli military officials

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:58.211
said that they were basically killing

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.446
two civilians for every Hamas member,

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.148
and he called that

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:05.151
a, quote, tremendously positive ratio.

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:06.519
That if it was two civilians

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.687
for every one Hamas,

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.122
that's tremendously positive.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.323
How do you see it?

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.724
Well, it depends what you compare

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:12.292
Israel to.

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:14.561
If you compare Israel to perfection.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.763
Of course, nobody's nobody's perfect.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:17.330
We don't want to see

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.431
any civilian casualty.

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.265
We want to

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.100
ease the civilian suffering in Gaza.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.103
The IDF is going to such extent that

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.538
no other Western military,

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.240
no other military has has done before

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.609
to safeguard the civilian population

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.377
in an enemy war zone.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.612
And I think that Israel

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:33.980
is really defining

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.217
the gold standard here of urban warfare.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:39.986
And if you compare the campaigns in Iraq

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.889
and Afghanistan, the civilian to combat

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.825
casualty ratio, that then Israel, once

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:46.893
the dust would settle,

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:47.427
you will see that

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.262
Israel compares favorably.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.263
And I understand that.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:52.365
I understand that sort academically.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.133
If those numbers are put out there

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.235
when you talk about the gold standard.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.636
But yet what we are confronted with

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:57.470
every day

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.405
is a horrific loss of Palestinian life

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.507
and a lot of anguish and anguish.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.076
It is hard to hear

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.411
that being the gold standard.

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:06.813
Every civilian casualty

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.381
is a huge tragedy.

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.148
There hasn't been a

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:10.917
war in human history,

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.186
even the most justified ones

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:15.088
that haven't seen a certain

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.356
extent of collateral damage.

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:17.123
But again,

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:18.591
what we are doing on the ground,

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:19.492
the fact that we are

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:21.060
telling the civilian population

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.463
where our soldiers are, are entering

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.632
and when this is unprecedented,

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:26.699
and I'm sure that some,

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:26.966
you know,

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.402
family and friends of us

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:30.570
armed forces, service members

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.272
watching us right now would wonder

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.139
who does that.

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.440
Who announces where the troops

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.074
are exactly going

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:36.409
to operate to the civilians

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.478
And the terrorists would know

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:39.812
this is what the IDF is doing

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:42.482
because we're a moral military I country.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.516
I want to give you a chance to respond

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:44.083
to another report

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.652
that aired on CNN last night.

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:46.319
My colleague

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.487
Nima Elbagir was reporting

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:48.521
on some of the money

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:49.789
that has gone to Hamas.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.824
Obviously, a lot of money in recent years

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:52.525
and questions

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:54.060
about whether Netanyahu's policies

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.995
actually aided and abetted that

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:56.763
by allowing hundreds

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:57.497
of millions of dollars

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.899
in actual cash to go into Gaza.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.601
That from from Hamas.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:02.435
Despite concerns

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:03.770
from Netanyahu's own government,

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.072
some of which were raised by then

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:07.740
Education Minister Naftali Bennett,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.708
who spoke to NEMA.

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:11.878
And here's what he said.

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:13.780
I stopped the cash

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.381
suitcases because I believe

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:19.485
that's a horrendous mistake to allow

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.621
Hamas to have all these suitcases

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:22.922
full of cash

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:25.958
that goes directly to rearming themselves

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.493
against the Israelis.

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:30.163
Why would we feed them

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:33.166
cash to kill us?

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.500
So when he says he stopped it,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.001
he's referring to

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.135
when he became prime minister

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:38.838
by saying he stopped the Netanyahu policy

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.873
that he refers to as cash in suitcases.

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:42.041
Does Netanyahu believe

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:43.009
now that he made a mistake

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.544
by allowing cash to go in?

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:47.914
Well, again, this is a we allowed money

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:49.182
to go inside Gaza,

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.684
not for Hamas, obviously.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.319
And it's not only a policy

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.454
that happened, by the way,

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.455
during this government,

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.056
the previous Israeli government,

00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:58.691
because we wanted the money

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:01.160
to reach the Palestinian people,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.330
to fix the water system that we saw Hamas

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:06.632
turn pipes, water pipes into missiles,

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:08.501
the sewage system and so forth.

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:09.202
We wanted to

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:09.602
you knew it

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:10.870
wasn't being used for those purposes

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.004
because you could see the system.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:12.438
Well.

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:13.740
Well,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.776
listen, it's a major problem every time.

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:17.243
And I think it's

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:18.678
a repeating pattern here in history.

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:20.179
Every time the state of Israel

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:21.414
has cut more slack

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:23.683
to the Palestinian people, it backfired.

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:25.585
It was answered with more bloodshed,

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:27.086
more murder.

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:28.521
And if you go back,

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:28.755
you know,

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:31.758
you go back to the 1947 partition plan

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:34.293
of the United Nations.

00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:35.828
They we said yes.

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:36.429
They said no,

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:38.030
They started a war against us.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.465
We retreated from Gaza.

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:40.700
We signed the Oslo Accords.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.236
We got suicide bombings in our cities.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.139
We in 2005, the disengagement from Gaza,

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.806
we got missiles

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.574
raining down on our communities.

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.443
And now we allowed in more, you know,

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:51.944
fake rehabilitation efforts.

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:52.745
And we cut more slack

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:53.780
to Palestinian workers

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.047
who wanted to work in Israel,

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.449
expanded the fishing zone.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:57.150
What did we get?

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.384
The October 7th massacre.

00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:00.353
It's a repeating pattern.

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:00.653
All right.

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:01.888
Well, I appreciate your time

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:03.456
and thank you very much.

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:04.757
It's good to see you in person.
