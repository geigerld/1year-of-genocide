&gt;&gt; This is CNN breaking news. &gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, happening right now,&nbsp;&nbsp; the U.S. National security adviser Jake&nbsp; Sullivan is speaking at tel aviv after&nbsp;&nbsp; meeting with Israeli leaders. Let's&nbsp; listen in. &gt;&gt; President Biden, on his [3:49:03 AM] &gt;&gt; President Biden, on his visit on October 18th&nbsp; and our message then is the same as my message&nbsp;&nbsp; today. But just that the United States stands with&nbsp; Israel. As president Biden has said many times,&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel has a right, indeed a duty to defend&nbsp; itself against hamas. A terrorist group that&nbsp;&nbsp; committed the worst massacre of the jewish&nbsp; people since the holocaust. That used and&nbsp;&nbsp; sexual violence to terrorize Israeli&nbsp; women. That continues to hold hostages,&nbsp;&nbsp; women, the elderly, the sick, the wounded&nbsp; and heightened tunnels they purposely built&nbsp;&nbsp; under infrastructure. And I'm here today,&nbsp; on president Biden's behalf to emphasize&nbsp;&nbsp; our continued commitment to support Israel&nbsp; in its fight against hamas. Yesterday and&nbsp;&nbsp; today I met with Israeli prime minister&nbsp; Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet&nbsp;&nbsp; and president her sock and arrangement of&nbsp; senior officials. We discuss the ongoing war,&nbsp;&nbsp; the military operations and we discussed our&nbsp; shared objective of ensuring the hamas will [3:50:03 AM] of ensuring the hamas will never again pose a&nbsp; threat to the state of Israel. While minimizing&nbsp;&nbsp; harm to civilians, while ensuring the increased&nbsp; and sustained flow of humanitarian assistance into&nbsp;&nbsp; gaza and while working day in and day out, hour by&nbsp; hour to secure the release of all of the remaining&nbsp;&nbsp; hostages so that they could return home to their&nbsp; loved ones. We consulted on a joint efforts with&nbsp;&nbsp; the united nations, with Egypt, and other regional&nbsp; partners to deliver the humanitarian aid. We did&nbsp;&nbsp; not do a great job of putting the podium sign on.&nbsp; And I describe the U.S. Efforts in coordination&nbsp;&nbsp; with allies and partners to deter attempts to disk&nbsp; spend the conflict regionally including in the red&nbsp;&nbsp; sea and expressed president Biden's commitment&nbsp; to express income on the blue line through a&nbsp;&nbsp; combination of deterrence and diplomacy. Later,&nbsp; today in, fact I will visit from all of to be&nbsp;&nbsp; with president abbas and discuss ongoing promotion&nbsp; to stability he west bank. Including efforts to&nbsp;&nbsp; confront terrorist attacks him to support&nbsp; the Palestinian authority security forces [3:51:04 AM] authority security forces through the U.S.&nbsp; Security cordon either through Israel and&nbsp;&nbsp; the Palestinian authority. And their ongoing&nbsp; efforts to revisit and revitalize the Palestinian&nbsp;&nbsp; authority. And their initiatives to hold extremist&nbsp; settlers against Palestinians. I have and will&nbsp;&nbsp; continue to stay president Biden in the United&nbsp; States commitment to preserving space for, peace&nbsp;&nbsp; for a two-state solution where Israel security is&nbsp; guaranteed. The Israeli people need and deserve to&nbsp;&nbsp; live in peace and security with their neighbors in&nbsp; the region that is integrated, dynamic and stable.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is what we're working to court. That is what&nbsp; I discussed with my counterpart here in Israel&nbsp;&nbsp; Kim. This will be for the future, and will that&nbsp; will be happy to take your questions. With that,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll start with Alex on CNN. &gt;&gt; Thanks very much Jake. The&nbsp;&nbsp; administration has made it clear that you are&nbsp; hoping that this vital transition at some point&nbsp;&nbsp; from the science entity face to a lower&nbsp; intensity face. What does this tell you in [3:52:04 AM] What does this tell you in terms of the conditions&nbsp; that need to begin for that to happen? And how&nbsp;&nbsp; does that sink up with your preferred timeline?&nbsp; Tim the administration has insisted that they have&nbsp;&nbsp; the attempt to keep the civilian safe. And, we&nbsp; have CNN and others reporting that almost half of&nbsp;&nbsp; the 30,000 bombs have been dropped on gaza, from&nbsp; so-called gun bombs and precise and if there was&nbsp;&nbsp; a real intent to protect civilians wouldn't they&nbsp; be using much more precise smaller I munitions?&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim &gt;&gt; I really appreciate the questions&nbsp; of the conflict, and I think that there's&nbsp;&nbsp; been some misunderstanding in the reporting.&nbsp; Not for me. But from others thin when Israel&nbsp;&nbsp; launched this campaign to rule out the terrorist&nbsp; threat that hamas poses to the state of Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp; it may clear from the beginning that this world&nbsp; will proceed. We are now in the middle of a high&nbsp;&nbsp; intensity phase with ongoing operations,&nbsp; military operations and in the southern [3:53:05 AM] operations and in the southern half of gaza.&nbsp; But there will be a transition to another face&nbsp;&nbsp; in this world. One that is focused in more&nbsp; precise ways on targeting the leadership,&nbsp;&nbsp; an intelligence driven up that continues to deal&nbsp; with the ongoing threat that hamas poses. Tim&nbsp;&nbsp; so it was obviously a subject of conversation&nbsp; that I had with the prime minister Netanyahu,&nbsp;&nbsp; with the war cabinet and with the leadership&nbsp; on the idf and the defense minister. Tim and&nbsp;&nbsp; it's important that this conversation is, first&nbsp; we're not here to tell anybody that you must&nbsp;&nbsp; be, -- this is our perspective, our, partner as&nbsp; your. From this is what we believe is the best&nbsp;&nbsp; way to achieve both tactical and strategic goals.&nbsp; And then second, it has to take place in private.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we can't telegraph for the enemy what&nbsp; the plan is. Tim so I have to speak to timelines,&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to speak to conditions here from&nbsp; the podium. But we have very constructive [3:54:05 AM] But we have very constructive conversation&nbsp; yesterday. About the transition about the high&nbsp;&nbsp; intensity face forward. And I expected that would&nbsp; occur, in the future. When exactly that happens an&nbsp;&nbsp; exactly under what conditions, will be continuing&nbsp; intensive discussion between the united States and&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel. Tim I will make sure that conversation,&nbsp; it least us far as I can do it is going to stay&nbsp;&nbsp; and take place behind closed doors. Love when&nbsp; it comes to the issues to the bombs, the type of&nbsp;&nbsp; bombs that Israel was using what I would say is&nbsp; that different types of ammunition, it requires&nbsp;&nbsp; different types of military operations. Which&nbsp; means the method by which the bombs delivered,&nbsp;&nbsp; they don't have the tell kicks on it it's&nbsp; different in terms of how the planes fly,&nbsp;&nbsp; all the targets have selected. And&nbsp; they all go through the same process.&nbsp;&nbsp; A process by which it selects processes&nbsp; and tried to distinguish targets that hit [3:55:05 AM] distinguish targets that hit hamas, that might&nbsp; take the lives of innocent civilians. At the&nbsp;&nbsp; end of the, day Israel has the intend that&nbsp; it strong this distinctions clearly and in a&nbsp;&nbsp; sustainable way. But we want to see the results&nbsp; matchup to. That that's a conversation that I&nbsp;&nbsp; had in full with them today and yesterday&nbsp; as well. And we will continue to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Including on the type of ammunitions they&nbsp; used and when they used a certain type of&nbsp;&nbsp; those are delivered to ensure that from the&nbsp; United States perspective they are fulfilling&nbsp;&nbsp; their obligations, their responsibilities&nbsp; as to international humanitarian law.
