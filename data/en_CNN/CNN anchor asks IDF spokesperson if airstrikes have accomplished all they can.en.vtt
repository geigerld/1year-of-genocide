00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.583
Right now, Israeli

00:00:00.583 --> 00:00:01.167
forces say

00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.043
they are conducting

00:00:02.043 --> 00:00:03.795
a significant operation,

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:04.796
including strikes

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:06.881
against Hamas targets in Gaza.

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:08.174
CNN team near the border

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.093
capturing these images of flares

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:11.219
lighting up the night sky

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.137
just a short time ago.

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:13.096
And joining me now

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:13.680
to discuss

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.807
is IDF international spokesperson,

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:17.726
Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.769
Colonel, thanks very much for your time.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.312
We've seen a lot of these explosions

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.231
and fires last night and tonight.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.566
What can you tell us about

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.442
what we're seeing?

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.610
What are these strikes going after?

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.530
War continue?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.823
Well, first of all, good evening.

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:32.991
Thank you for having me.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:35.035
War continues in Gaza.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.578
We are striking Hamas

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.038
and we are going strong.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.539
Hold after a stronghold,

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.207
according to our plan,

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:45.003
in a systematic effort to dismantle Hamas

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.005
from its military capabilities

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.382
in order to make sure that October seven

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:50.759
never happens again.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.595
But specifically, you can't

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.305
tell us what the strikes are about

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:56.473
at this point.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:00.560
They are about underground infrastructure

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:03.104
that Hamas has in various

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:04.397
populated areas.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.816
And we have troops on the ground,

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.652
infantry, armor combat engineers.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.154
They are striking

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:13.031
and they are also directing

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.574
fires from the air,

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:15.909
according to intelligence

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.285
that they have on the ground.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:18.244
And intelligence

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.829
that is being generated

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:20.830
all in an effort

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.749
to strike Hamas militants.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.751
And there was a special focus

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:27.587
on Hamas commanders

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.714
in the IDF also says that Israeli

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.007
forces are ready to shift

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.759
into an offensive mode

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.010
at any moment

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.429
on the northern border with Lebanon.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.723
Can you tell us about that?

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:41.017
Well, actually, our posture

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:41.935
along the Lebanese

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.937
border has been very defensive,

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:46.898
and we've only been responding to attacks

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.275
from Hezbollah today.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:49.901
An Israeli

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:51.152
civilian was killed

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:53.279
when a anti-tank missile

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.031
that was fired from Lebanon

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:58.159
by Hezbollah at an Israeli community

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.036
An Israeli civilian was killed

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.162
and others were wounded.

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:02.580
And there has been rocket attacks.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.289
And that's.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.832
Now

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.543
we are deployed in significant strength

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.920
and are ready to respond

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.506
to any escalation coming from Lebanon

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:12.674
and continue

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.467
to warn the state of Lebanon

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:15.802
and Hezbollah

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.679
that it would not be in their interest

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.931
to escalate the situation.

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:20.431
And, Colonel.

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:20.849
All weekend

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.976
long, we've seen images of carnage

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.769
in Gaza.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.312
The civilian death

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.857
toll appears to be going up with every

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.401
Israeli strike inside of Gaza.

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:32.235
I know you've said

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.362
and your counterparts have said that

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.156
you're not targeting civilians.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:36.489
You're doing

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.991
your best not to target civilians,

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.325
but yet there are

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.744
scores of civilian casualties.

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:45.331
I'm wondering, at what point do you say

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.708
these strikes have accomplished

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.585
all that they can accomplish

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.628
and you have to shift to a more ground

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:53.131
based offensive inside of Gaza

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.216
to make sure that you're not causing

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:57.218
an excessive

00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:00.013
number of civilian casualties?

00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:00.638
Yeah, I agree.

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:01.598
I mean, we have said

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:02.056
and we will

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:04.267
continue to say that we are not fighting

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.810
against the civilian population.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.146
They are not our enemy. Hamas is.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.232
And the sad reality and the reason behind

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:13.067
all of this really sad footage

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:13.693
that we see

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.278
coming out of Gaza, it's

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.738
not the Israeli activity.

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.281
It's the fact that Hamas

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.533
systematically, systematically

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.493
hides behind those civilians.

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:22.994
You know, there's

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.955
an ongoing operation to try to evacuate

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.540
Palestinians civilians

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.042
from northern Gaza.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.960
More than 800,000

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.921
have already made the smart decision

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:33.838
to do so.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:35.298
We've opened specific

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.425
humanitarian corridors yesterday

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.427
and today for the continued

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:41.638
unhindered flow

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:42.847
of Palestinian

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:45.016
civilians south to safer areas.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.143
There is water in the south.

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:47.977
There is access

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.188
to food and medicine in the south.

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:51.314
And it is

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.690
definitely a safer

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.858
and the safest area

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:54.984
to be in the Gaza Strip.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.528
And we continue to call on the population

00:03:57.528 --> 00:03:58.196
to move south.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.948
We don't want them in the battlefield

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.658
and we don't want them in harm's way.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.452
We want Hamas to stand up and fight.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:05.662
And we are going to

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.121
take the battle to Hamas.

00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:08.414
And we really hope

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.041
that the civilian population

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:11.626
won't continue to be held

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:13.628
by Hamas as human shields.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.088
And you say you want the civilians

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.756
to move south

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.591
so they're out of harm's way.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.385
Wouldn't a humanitarian pause

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.347
facilitate that help in that effort?

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:24.973
Why?

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.100
Why stand against that idea

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.185
of a humanitarian pause right now?

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.312
Why not be open to something temporary

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.064
so civilians can safely

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.108
get out of these areas?

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.235
I totally agree.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.069
And that's what I said.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.154
We've done that twice in two days.

00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:41.489
Yesterday and today,

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.825
there were humanitarian corridors.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.702
We opened up an area

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:47.120
along Salahadin Road,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.371
which is the main road.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.123
And we told the Palestinians

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:50.915
before we listened

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.084
between ten and two,

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.669
there's going to be a pause

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.504
and we will facilitate the free

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.631
and unhindered movement from the north

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.591
south of Gaza

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:02.677
so that you can be in relative safety,

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:03.636
take your belongings,

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:04.929
take your family and go

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:06.347
We have done this twice.

00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:07.849
We have issued

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.019
a statement in exactly what we're doing.

00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:11.936
Okay.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.604
And forgive me for interrupting,

00:05:13.604 --> 00:05:14.689
but I just want to make sure

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:15.732
because the terminology

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.608
is important to get right here.

00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:20.945
Are you saying that the IDF did have what

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.656
you consider to be a humanitarian pause

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:24.282
this weekend?

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:25.616
As had been requested

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:28.494
by the Biden administration or Israel?

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:29.954
Is this your own version

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:31.247
of a humanitarian pause?

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:32.415
Can you just clarify that?

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.501
Yeah, I will happily clarify.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.713
Yesterday and today, for many hours

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.591
with prior notice and warning,

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.009
we facilitate that.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.470
We stop firing in certain areas

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.721
of northern Gaza,

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.806
which is the main combat area.

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:50.767
And we called on Palestinians

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.477
to move south. Many did.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.519
Not enough.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.729
More than 800,000

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.773
have left northern Gaza, which is good.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.649
But we want all of the civilians

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:00.068
to be out of harm's way.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:00.651
And we did

00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:02.487
so not once, but twice

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.405
in order to facilitate more.

00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:06.240
The sad reality is that even

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.201
these efforts were hindered

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:08.910
by Hamas,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.287
who started firing at the convoys

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:13.623
and Israeli troops in that area.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:14.082
And then,

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:16.626
unfortunately, that humanitarian window

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.586
was eventually closed.

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:19.670
But the bottom line is,

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.254
I think that

00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:22.215
we don't only talk the talk,

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.300
but we actually do it on the ground.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.010
And we have for two

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.262
days in a road, facilitated

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.515
safe access

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.016
and safe transit

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:33.643
of Palestinian civilians.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:34.185
I understand

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.353
it is underreported

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:36.687
because perhaps it doesn't go

00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:38.106
according to the narrative,

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.400
but we are trying to get civilians

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:41.317
wrong, trying to

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:42.819
And that's what I'm trying to ask

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.195
to get that clarification.

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.279
And so are you saying

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.365
that these humanitarian windows

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.117
that were opened up over the weekend,

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.536
do they meet

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:52.495
to the satisfaction

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:53.496
of the Biden administration,

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:54.455
what they were calling for

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:55.998
and having some kind of pause

00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:57.625
to facilitate

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.627
the movement of civilians

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.170
out of harm's way?

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.213
Do you have confirmation

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:04.382
from the Biden administration that, okay.

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:06.050
Thank you for doing that,

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.761
or has it not reached that level yet?

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:09.554
I don't know

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.681
exactly how the administration

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:12.515
feels about it.

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:14.308
I know that we are doing

00:07:14.308 --> 00:07:17.186
real honest efforts to get civilians

00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:18.521
out of the battlefield.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.857
Not only are we telling them where to go,

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.108
but we are also helping

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.443
and creating much better

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.486
humanitarian conditions in the south,

00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:26.070
which is where

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.655
we're telling people to go.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:28.865
There's less combat there.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.700
There is access to water by the way,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.868
from Israel as well.

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:32.535
We've opened

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.036
the taps from our side

00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:36.205
and there's an inflow of goods.

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:37.748
More and more trucks,

00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:39.667
humanitarian trucks come in every day

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:42.128
to the south there's a humanitarian zone.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.504
And at the end of the day,

00:07:43.504 --> 00:07:45.381
it's the best thing for civilians to do.

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:47.592
And we are facilitating it, honestly,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.427
because we want a battlefield

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.012
where we can face Hamas

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:53.055
and make sure that we engage them

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:54.182
and them only

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.975
and beat them on the battlefield

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.435
to make sure that never again

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.979
will they be able to attack Israel

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.063
All right, Colonel Conricus,

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:02.064
thank you very much for your time.
