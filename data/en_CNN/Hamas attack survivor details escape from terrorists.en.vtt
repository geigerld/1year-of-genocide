00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.569
To someone who has experienced the terror
of October 7th Ahiad Ben-Yitzchak is a survivor

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.590
and he was enjoying life with friends on the
beach when bullets and missiles began to rain

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.920
down around them.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:20.359
He and his friends did manage to escape and
get to an army base and they weren't safe

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.210
at all when they got there.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.760
He decided to leave and make a run for his
car, eventually having to abandon it even

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.619
after he was shot.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.480
He wrote this harrowing story of survival
and he joins us now to remind people of what

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.510
happened on October 7th and to remember his
friend who was killed.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.460
First and foremost, how are you doing?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.110
How is your injury, but more importantly because
I see you standing here before us mentally.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.110
[11:46:14 AM]

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.110
mentally.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.110
How are you doing?

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.110
&gt;&gt; I'm fine.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.210
I'm really excited to be here.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.930
To give me an opportunity and it's part of
my healing process to talk about it and it's

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.969
really helpful.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.260
You know, I need some time.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.310
I think about it a lot.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.229
It's -- it's tough, but I'm fine.

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.619
Like, generally fine.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.110
Most of the time I'm sad because I just heard
about the bibas family, it's the first time

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.500
I hear about it and it's -- it's break moi
heart.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.690
&gt;&gt; But I'm fine.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.790
I'm okay.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.579
&gt;&gt; You are here with us.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:25.579
You're here.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:26.579
You're breathing.

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.799
You're alive and that's really the most important
thing.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:30.799
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:31.799
&gt;&gt; This is a lot to go through.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.360
I read your -- I thought it was a journal
entry, but it just came out of you.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.290
You wrote it first in hebrew and then it was
translated and I want to read a bit of that

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.079
because it really struck me this morning and
had me at that point where I was choking up

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.090
and I could feel the fear in your

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.090
[11:47:14 AM]

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.090
could feel the fear in your words.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.090
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.090
&gt;&gt; You say in a bit here.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.130
You had gotten to this military installation.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.640
You left because you could see that they were
going to be overwhelmed and the fighting was

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.610
coming and you say this, I hear the most dreadful
boom as you're running away, pinging, echoing

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.000
against the metal of the vehicle that you
had gotten into be followed by successive

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.920
gunshots and popping sounds of death.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.020
Even before I started driving I thought I
had brought extinction to all of us.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.980
Here we are being slaughtered in an intimate,
personal manner, more intimate than sex.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.800
Whoever is shooting at us, knows us and wants
to kill us one by one.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.980
We are a target.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.989
A prize.

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.060
They're shooting at us with lust.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.650
I know they wouldn't let go.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.180
This is a new feeling.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.700
The feeling of ending.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.239
We have no chance and here you are.

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.239
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.739
I'm a very lucky guy.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.040
&gt;&gt; How did you get through it?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.580
&gt;&gt; It was a miracle, to be honest.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.890
It was a miracle, and I didn't think I could
get out, not

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.890
[11:48:16 AM]

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:57.099
think I could get out, not alive, not in one
piece, but I'm here and I am stand on both

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.620
feet.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.770
I feel really luck, and I still -- like, I
am overwholewomaned.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.180
Still overwhelmed.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.079
&gt;&gt; There's a sense that it's too much to go
through.

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.079
&gt;&gt; It was too much.

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.580
&gt;&gt; It's too much.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.250
Speaking of too much, you and some of your
friends did survive, you had someone driving

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.340
and screaming at him and then you run into
the gunmen who are shooting at you and turn

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.450
around, jump out of the car and it catches
fire.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.640
It's something out of a horror movie, really,
but one of your friends did not survive.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640
Can you tell us about her?

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640
Her name is molgava.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.690
I missed her a lot.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.570
She was walking with me.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.740
She was a cook like I did.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.170
We had supposed to have a shift the same evening
together.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.900
She was beautiful.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.970
She was so kind, and I just missed her a lot.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.970
[11:49:18 AM]

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.970
missed her a lot.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.970
It's so sad.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.239
I think about her a lot, and she's missing,
and I want -- I want people to know this story

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.610
for a memorial, and that's it.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:17.609
She's a very good friend of mine and it break
my heart every day to think about her.

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.609
&gt;&gt; She's not here.

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:19.609
You did survive.

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:20.699
Your friends did survive.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:27.439
You helped them survive and you had no idea,
but something pushed you to make it, and I'm

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:33.550
-- I'm so glad you're here.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.639
Me, too.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.840
&gt;&gt; And able to share stories.
