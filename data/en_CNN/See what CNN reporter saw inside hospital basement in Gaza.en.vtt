00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:00.750
CNN's Nic

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.543
Robertson and

00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:04.546
his crew got an up close view of the ash,

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:05.422
the bullets,

00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:07.799
the trail of absolute destruction.

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:11.344
The rare inside look at how the IDF is

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:12.345
fighting comes

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.347
at a consequential moment in this war.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.974
As the American president

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:16.933
says the strip's

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.686
main hospital must be protected

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.312
Now, Israel says the

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.314
very same facility houses

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.483
a Hamas command complex below it.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:27.360
And CNN reported the story

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.610
that you're

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.238
about to see under Israeli Defense Force

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:31.364
Escort at all times.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.700
But CNN did not submit its script

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.618
or its footage to the IDF.

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:38.079
And CNN retained editorial control

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.498
over the final report You'll see now

00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:45.128
driving into Gaza

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:47.380
with the Israeli forces.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.466
It's a war zone.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.509
The conditions of our access

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.595
only show officers

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.346
no faces of soldiers

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:57.640
and don't show sensitive equipment.

00:00:57.974 --> 00:00:59.726
We are passing mile

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.062
after mile of destruction

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.023
buildings blown, collapsed.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:08.860
Nothing untouched by the fury of Israel's

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.030
hunt for Hamas streets here

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:15.366
crushed back to sand shops.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.035
Everything that we see,

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.621
no sign of any civilians here.

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.122
And the soldiers have been telling us

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.999
that even inside the stores,

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.042
they've been fighting things

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.294
like rocket propelled grenades

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:28.296
ready to use against them

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:30.215
as they were advancing through this area.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:32.175
Right here,

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:33.301
a few miles in,

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:35.470
we pull up at a command post.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.139
Soldiers living in blown

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.849
apartment buildings.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.768
Every building I'm looking at here,

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.561
wherever you turn,

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.396
it's destroyed and shut up.

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:48.608
Hard to imagine how civilians endured

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.318
the bombardment here.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:53.696
Our next journey much deeper into Gaza.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:57.492
We arrive a hundred meters from a battle

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.202
with Hamas.

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:05.166
Tanks blasting targets

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.751
and nearby buildings.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:08.795
The IDF's top spokesperson

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.630
waiting for us.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.466
We are now conducting an operation

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.052
inside Gaza next to Rantisi Hospital.

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:18.638
Israel is facing massive

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.348
international pressure

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:22.475
over the destruction of homes.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.228
The shockingly high civilian death toll.

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:27.939
And in the last few days over

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.859
it's apparently heavy handed tactics

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.443
at hospitals.

00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:35.029
We are working the tunnel.

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.073
The bulldozers rebuild

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:37.657
the tunnels

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:38.533
that we suspect

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.326
that underneath the hospital.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.370
Gary has brought us here

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:46.166
to show the connection he says exists

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.542
between Hamas

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:50.044
and the Rantisi Children's Hospital.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.379
We are now here

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:52.755
in an

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:56.843
area between a hospital, a school

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.846
and a terrace house.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.765
A Hamas commander, he says, live there.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:04.184
He points out

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.728
the solar panels on the roof.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.771
This is a tunnel that was sliding

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.773
like this, the floor.

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:11.774
You can see here,

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:12.942
this is the ladder going down.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:13.985
The ladder going down.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.612
It's going down.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.655
This is a 20 meter tunnel.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.365
And Lucas here.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:19.908
Look at that.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:20.617
Look at that.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.911
Look at the final pool here.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.747
But look down here.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.750
The cables are going down to the tunnel.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:30.168
Okay.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:31.085
So they're hard

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:33.546
wired into the water to show you

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.299
the solar panels on the terrace house,

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.010
provide electricity

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.637
directly to the tunnel.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.555
We've run into the robot

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.766
inside the tunnel, and the robot

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.644
saw a massive door

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.062
a door

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.522
that is on the direction of the hospital.

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:53.566
We're in what is an active fire

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:54.108
zone here.

00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:56.236
You can hear the small arms fire.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.278
The IDF say that's

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:59.322
still clearing that area out.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.032
We're getting down here

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.116
just taking a bit of cover

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:02.700
because they say

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.118
we're still taking classes.

00:04:04.118 --> 00:04:05.662
But over here,

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.288
we were able to smell what smelled

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:08.831
like rotting flesh

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:09.999
that is perhaps

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.292
buried underneath the rubble.

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:12.835
No, no, don't go up like

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:14.003
that.

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:15.129
Expose yourself

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.006
as we move off to the hospital.

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:18.633
100 meters away.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.635
We're still taking fire.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.720
We're still conducting an operation.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.431
Operation conducted by our special unit.

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.225
The Israeli Navy SEALs

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.935
are researching the hospitals.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.355
Gary later tells us he took a big risk

00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:35.275
bringing us into such a combat zone.

00:04:35.733 --> 00:04:38.945
It is clear he wants this story told.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.405
We're searching here

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.115
to see the connection of the tunnel

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:42.949
to the hospital.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.909
Okay, don't. Don't fudge here.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.828
I won't you where the connection?

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.579
We are looking for that connection

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:50.957
as we finally reached the hospital.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.584
It is already getting dark.

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:54.627
A huge hole

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:55.712
has been blasted

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.880
through the walls into the basement.

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.633
Why is the hospital so damaged?

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.010
We'll talk about why he's asking us.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.218
So the

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.430
let's this this.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.433
We came to this hospital five days ago.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.184
There were still patients

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:10.935
inside the hospital.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:12.854
We did not enter into the hospital.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.439
He claims since then,

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.356
all patients

00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:18.192
were evacuated by hospital staff.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.986
We assist this evacuation,

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.738
of course, to make it a safe place

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.740
for all the patients in the hospital.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.074
We do not know that

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:26.409
the hospital is entirely clear.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.951
We do not know.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.537
We only entered to this area, which was

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:30.913
which was suspected

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:32.415
because we were being fired.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:35.001
Gary leads us through a warren

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.171
of basement corridors to this room.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.423
This was the armory.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:40.923
Okay.

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:42.967
This was the Hamas armory.

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.595
He shows us a few rusting guns

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.263
and some explosives.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:50.767
These guns alone have potentially huge

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.436
implications for Gaza's hospitals.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:54.729
And Israel's

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.315
apparent push to take control of them.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:58.524
The International Committee

00:05:58.524 --> 00:05:59.525
for the Red Cross say

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.152
that hospitals are given

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.820
special protection

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.114
under international humanitarian law

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.657
in a time of war.

00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:08.576
But if militants store weapons there

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:10.453
or use them as a base of fire.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.497
Then that protection falls away.

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:15.792
In other rooms, he shows us a motorbike

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.752
with a bullet hole in it

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:18.753
that he suspects

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.839
was used by Hamas attackers October 7th

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.675
and nearby possible evidence.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.220
Hostages could have been held here.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:29.013
We are now in the basement

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:29.722
in the same area.

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:32.308
Yards from the motorcycle, we see a chair

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.060
we see a rope.

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:35.728
Here,

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.022
a woman's clothes or a woman's

00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:39.357
something cover and a woman.

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:39.816
She think a

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.442
woman was tied up in this chair.

00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:42.777
This is an assumption

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:44.320
going to be checked by DNA

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.364
for evidence, Hagar says.

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.074
Points towards Hamas

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:48.825
and possible

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.201
hostage presents

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.411
below the hospital

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.621
and by bringing us here to this hospital

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.789
and showing us the connection

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:55.415
that you believe

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.624
exists between the terrorists

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.876
and the possibly hostages.

00:06:58.876 --> 00:06:59.544
What does this say

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:02.171
about the other hospitals here? In Gaza?

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:03.548
Cynically, Shifa

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.883
Hospital is no bisects by intelligence

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.677
to be a terrorist hub.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:08.428
And also, it's

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.513
suspicious also in holding hostages.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.889
This is the best shelter

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:13.933
for the terrible war machine of Hamas.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.435
But the hospital authorities said

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.311
they have no knowledge of Hamas

00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:19.147
or other groups inside the hospitals.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.064
Is that possible?

00:07:20.064 --> 00:07:21.607
I think that's not possible.

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:22.358
It's one hospital

00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:23.985
to have this kind of an infrastructure.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.195
We knew the terrorists were here.

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:28.489
We knew we knew by intelligence.

00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:30.116
And also we got some fire

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.868
from this area, from this area,

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:32.952
from this area.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.704
And we were ready to fire

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.789
because what we found an armory.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:39.041
But so much damage all around here.

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.084
There is damage all around

00:07:40.084 --> 00:07:40.960
here because Hamas

00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:44.922
made it impossible for us to fight him.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.632
He built all this infrastructure

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:48.843
in tunnels and in hospitals

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.888
around areas populated.

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:53.681
As we exit the hospital.

00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:55.391
It is already dark,

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:56.642
but just getting ready to leave

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:57.101
right now.

00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:57.935
The firefight

00:07:57.935 --> 00:07:58.811
still going

00:07:58.811 --> 00:07:59.896
on, still intense

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.689
bullets fired explosions

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:03.024
going on up the street there.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.150
This war

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.318
and the controversies

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:08.488
surrounding it far from resolved.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.824
