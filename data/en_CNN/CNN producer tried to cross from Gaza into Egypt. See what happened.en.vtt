00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.633
Well, as we've been doing

00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.534
every night on OUTFRONT,

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:03.603
we have another exclusive dispat

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:05.305
from the journalist Ibrahim Damo

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:06.973
He is inside Gaza.

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:08.008
Ibrahim and his family,

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:08.408
as you know,

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.642
moved from the north to the sout

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:10.777
and they were hopeful

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.245
that they would finally be able 

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:13.680
through Egypt.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.782
Those hopes up for now.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:18.551
Still hopes not yet successful.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:19.452
Ibrahim and his wife

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.254
Rasha and their two young sons,

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:22.856
aged 11 and seven,

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.090
evacuated in northern Gaza

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.592
when Israel told civilians to le

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.527
They complied.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:30.030
They fled to the south and now t

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.264
and wait.

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:32.032
Here's the update

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.968
that Ibrahim shared with us toda

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.572

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:48.148
the last travel.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:51.151

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:57.624
But I'm not sure.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.225
Now, call for my freedom.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.360

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.596

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:05.432
not the alternative.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.369

Some have been called out a bit

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:23.650
like I something

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.151
I wish you hadn't thought about.

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:25.552
But I learned

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:25.819
that in

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.421
a way of doing all of the wrong 

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.723
that we might not want in a hurr

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.126
And then no limits and mechanism

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.061
be learned how to lose more.

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:35.228

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.400
with the common love.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.435
Itami is the name of How Little 

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:43.570
My Butterfly.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.141
How do you feel on IRC, Colonel 

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:48.908

I will admit to her.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.584
