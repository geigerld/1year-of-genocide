00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.917
A Cornell University

00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:02.419
student will appear in court

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:03.461
after he was arrested

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:04.421
and charged with threatening

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.798
to kill and injure Jewish students.

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:08.383
According to court documents.

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:09.300
The suspect posted

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.261
at least one threat from the area

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:12.470
where the university is located

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.472
and also admitted to posting the threat,

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:16.599
posting the threats in an interview

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:17.809
with the FBI.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:19.728
CNN's Athena Jones, very latest on this.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.187
She also sat down with a group of Jewish

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.355
high school students

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.150
about this terrifying and dangerous rise

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.526
in anti-Semitism.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:27.277
Athena,

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.279
now that first and foremost

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.322
after the arrest at Cornell, what is

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.615
what is the latest that you're hearing?

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:33.283
Well, we know that

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:34.367
this suspect, Patrick Dye,

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:34.826
is expected

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:36.494
to appear this afternoon in court.

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:37.787
They'll discuss, you know,

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:38.747
his representation,

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:39.622
whether he'll be able to be

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.708
released on bail or not.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.753
But this all comes as Jews, Jewish people

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:45.128
all across

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.296
America are concerned

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.256
about the rise in anti-Semitism.

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.841
I sat down with five Jewish

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.468
teenagers, and concerns

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:52.343
about anti-Semitism

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:53.428
are the very first thing

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.513
that that came up in that discussion.

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:56.848
Another thing that really struck me

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:57.515
immediately upon

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.183
sitting down with them

00:00:58.183 --> 00:00:58.683
is just

00:00:58.683 --> 00:00:59.851
what a strong connection

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.145
each and every one of them has to Israel.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.396
Each of them has family

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.230
and friends there.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.814
They've gone

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:05.982
multiple times to visit

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:07.192
Israel over the course of their life.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.985
They consider this a second home

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:10.612
and they spoke about their concerns

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:11.988
about how the war

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:13.865
will impact their loved ones in Israel,

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:14.991
how it affects their lives

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:15.909
here in America,

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.121
and how it will affect the world.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.874
It's a situation that hits close to home.

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:25.543
We're such a tight knit community.

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.253
This is like our family.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.714
It's this shock that's like consistent

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.633
and you can't escape it.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:32.592
I started

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.511
reaching out to people to check up,

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:35.720
and it was hours later.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.930
I'm still checking up on people

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.931
and there's still more people

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:38.473
to reach out to

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:40.100
and talk to and people that

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.268
I was really worried about.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:45.146
What have the last few weeks been like

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:46.523
being here in America,

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.066
observing what's going on in

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.025
Israel and Gaza?

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:49.984
I think it's been this

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:54.197
sort of balancing act of worrying about

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.032
like, when's the other shoe

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:57.659
going to drop here in America

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.495
and caring for and like making sure

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:01.704
to be a good support system

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:03.665
for like my friends and family in Israel.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:04.958
Waiting for the other shoe to drop?

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:05.625
How do you mean?

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.627
I feel like right now in America,

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.254
we're in kind of this grace period

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:09.796
with Israel

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.422
where Israel was attacked

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:12.507
and the

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:13.967
general feeling towards

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.010
Israel is still fairly positive

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.470
and that pity

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.596
is not going to be there anymore.

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:19.389
And I think that that's

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.890
when bad things are going to start

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.351
happening in America to Jews.

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:25.311
I disagree with the fact that

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.938
the majority of American sentiment

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:29.566
is one of pro-Israel or pity or sympathy.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.192
I think now that,

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:33.361
you know, Israel has been

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:35.780
bombing Gaza and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.489
there have been attempts

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.991
to get the hostages back and all this

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:41.703
all that the military apparatus.

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:43.538
They say the political response

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:44.956
to the war has been

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.332
that especially what

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.376
they're seeing on social media.

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:49.043
It's a very,

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:51.462
I think, inherent Jewish value

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:52.213
in times of grief

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.506
to sit in your pain

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.466
and sit in your discomfort

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.468
and faster in prayer and community

00:02:57.468 --> 00:02:58.845
and acknowledge what's going on.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.263
And that's our way of dealing

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:01.890
with grief and processing.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.350
And I think to have such raw pain

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.226
be turned into something

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:07.061
political is

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.606
very, very difficult to deal with.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.316
It's an impossible situation

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:12.817
when you've been attacked

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:13.860
by this terror group

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.195
that's also governing

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.238
and hiding behind its own people.

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:19.949
I can't, like watch

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.493
innocent Palestinians die, but like,

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:23.828
it's like you poke a bear

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:25.663
and Hamas poked a bear

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:26.289
and then went

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.166
and hid behind a

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.084
behind a bunch of little cubs.

00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:31.628
It's hard for me to hear.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.046
Free Gaza, a free Palestine,

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.925
because that's not that Hamas is hurting

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:37.926
Gaza's citizens

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.761
just as much as it's hurting

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:40.845
Israeli citizens,

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.598
like being pro-Palestine or pro Gaza

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.975
should not mean being pro Hamas.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.518
How do you think this ends.

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:47.810
When you're

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.312
working on the amount

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:52.190
of precedent that there is

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:53.483
with Israel, with Gaza,

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:54.984
with the Palestinians, with Hamas?

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.778
I don't foresee this ending

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.780
in a way that will feel very final.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.615
Israel has lost

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:04.285
the innocent civilians in Gaza have lost.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.372
Nobody can win a war like this.

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:09.916
And so what does the end look like?

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.542
It looks like loss.

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:13.127
Where do you find the hope

00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:14.504
in a situation like this?

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.130
I have no hope that this conflict

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.924
will be resolved in the next century.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.133
Like not at all.

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:22.053
I think this will be an almost immutable

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:24.097
fact of the Middle East

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.515
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.850
This is where I turn to religion

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.935
and prayer.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.728
God, you know, really

00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:32.146
the core of Judaism.

00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:33.648
And that's

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:34.941
that's helping me get through this.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.401
Frances Geller was planning

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.986
to spend a gap year in Israel

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.487
before going to college.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.656
That plan is now uncertain.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:42.824
I truly believe

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.159
that perseverance is in our DNA.

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.910
We've been on

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.829
we've been around for all this time.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.247
They try to get rid of us.

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:49.872
They won't.

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:51.833
And how can you not believe that?

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.418
That's who we are.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.877
Hopefulness and fighting.

00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:58.756
And it's undeniable.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.008
So a really powerful and

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:00.967
important conversation

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.010
with these teenagers.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.219
And another thing that struck me

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.053
from this conversation

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:06.014
is this overwhelming desire

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.724
to help every one of them

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:08.391
feels guilty

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:09.517
that they can't do more

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:11.227
from their perch here in America.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.895
One young man said that his best friend

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:13.479
and he

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.647
they live parallel lives

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:15.398
until his best friend's

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:16.399
family moved to Israel.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.358
And now

00:05:17.358 --> 00:05:18.735
his best friend is in a few months

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.445
going to be joining the Israeli military.

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:21.070
And here he is

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.612
in America

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:23.406
feeling like he can't really do much.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.490
So a lot of

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.534
feelings of helplessness and guilt

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:27.660
consuming them.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.870
Just to reinforce,

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.621
these are high school students.

00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:34.083
I'm just amazed at their eloquence

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:35.960
and their ability

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.836
to put voice

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.464
to the complexity of the pain

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:40.798
and what they're living through,

00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:42.925
but also knowing that this started

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:44.886
with a terror attack coming from Hamas.

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.679
But my God, John.

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:46.846
Yeah.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.181
And also living with the fear

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.515
now that they feel

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:50.725
increasingly under threat.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:51.976
I will say.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:52.935
Athena, terrific job.

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:53.978
Thank you. Thanks. Thanks.
