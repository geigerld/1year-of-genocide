00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:02.869
Here's my take.

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:03.770
Looking at

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.437
the crises

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.039
proliferating around the world, it's

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.906
clear that we are

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:07.974
in an age

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.843
of geopolitical tension

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.178
that resembles the Cold War.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:12.579
A time

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.446
of constant,

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:16.082
continual threats to international order.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.351
But this time, the West

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.553
is treating each of these threats

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:21.888
as one offs to be dealt

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.057
with separately in the hope that soon

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.292
normalcy will return.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.461
But conflict is the new normal.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.764
Look around.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.266
The war is going badly for Ukraine,

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.068
which is critically outgunned

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.102
and outmanned

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.571
by its much larger adversary.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.639
Its key advantage

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.341
access to Western arms

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.710
and money is in peril.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.444
The US Congress

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.179
seems unwilling to pass legislation

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.981
to send in more arms and money.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.649
The European Union is stepping in

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.284
and selling parts of the gap.

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:52.385
But Europe does not have

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.421
the military industrial complex

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.790
to send Ukraine the level of armaments it

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.957
needs to fight Russia.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.459
Ukraine

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.427
Zombie has held out

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.595
heroically against Russia's onslaught.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.197
But as a senior European

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:05.965
diplomat said to me recently,

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.934
Ukrainians are brave and bold,

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.702
but they are not supermen.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.438
They will not be able to hold on

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.673
if they don't have weapons and supplies.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.608
Putin is making sure

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.477
that he can keep the war going.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.312
Getting arms from North Korea

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:21.781
and recruiting men from as far as Cuba.

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:24.017
He continues to benefit from the fact

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.219
that many of the world's major economies,

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.020
from China

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.121
and India to Turkey

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.322
and the Gulf states

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.691
are trading freely with Russia.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.227
If Russia's aggression works, it turns up

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:36.963
a norm that has largely stood for years.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.432
No change of borders by force.

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.134
Meanwhile, in the Middle East,

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:42.035
many believed

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:43.369
when the Gaza war began

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.404
that it would be short

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:45.271
and that Prime Minister

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.507
Netanyahu's government would fall.

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:50.343
Neither is likely the Israeli Defense

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.678
Forces, humiliated

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.713
by the surprise attack of October 7th,

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:54.714
are determined

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:57.684
to completely eradicate Hamas from Gaza.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.185
That means months

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:01.621
more bombing, fighting and bulldozing.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.124
The tensions and internal debates

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.125
that Israel's actions

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.160
will produce in other countries

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.294
will only rise

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:11.164
Bibi Netanyahu is going nowhere.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:12.832
Most Israelis may dislike him,

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.201
but they approve of his war policies.

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:16.336
This week,

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:17.670
in a pointed rebuke

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.372
to international calls

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:20.106
to pursue

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:21.608
a two-State solution,

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:22.942
including from the US

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:23.910
and Britain,

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.478
Israel's Knesset approved

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:26.246
a resolution

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:27.714
declaring that it was opposed

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:29.983
to any unilateral recognition

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.518
of a Palestinian state

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:34.254
with 99 out of 120 votes.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.822
Bibi's coalition, remember,

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.590
has only 64 members.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.826
So many opposition parliamentarians

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:40.793
joined in.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.362
One less notice

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.796
today has been in the north.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.632
Israel has been striking and killing

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.033
Hezbollah militants

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.535
to the point that by one account

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.803
they have killed over 200 of them.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.238
This campaign will continue

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:53.940
and might even accelerate.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.542
The IDF's goal is to weaken

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.110
Hezbollah to the point

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.212
that the roughly 80,000 Israelis

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:00.313
who fled their homes

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:03.049
in northern Israel can return.

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.517
But at some point, Hezbollah

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.319
might respond forcefully,

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.287
which could trigger

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.489
an Israeli incursion into Lebanon,

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.024
truly widening the war

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.427
And then we have the

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:15.762
Houthies who have managed

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:16.863
to assert themselves

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.865
through a series of pinprick strikes

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.800
that, according to one consulting firm,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.101
have reduced the number

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:23.369
of container vessels

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.904
through the Suez Canal

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:26.606
by about 72%

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:28.741
since they began in December.

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:30.376
American efforts to organize

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.345
an effective coalition to keep trade

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.981
flowing through the Red Sea have failed.

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:36.249
Its efforts

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.550
to respond to Houthi

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.053
attacks have not stopped the Houthis.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.589
This failure is a blow to the credibility

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:43.856
of the United States,

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.092
guaranteeing the freedom of the seas.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.094
A key component of the open

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:49.295
global economy

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.231
that's been built over two centuries.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.532
First to the British Navy

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:53.733
and then the American.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:54.901
And more threats

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:55.768
to maritime

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:57.070
underpinnings of that order

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.771
are on the horizon.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.806
Russia and China

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:02.041
have both been building up the capacity

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:04.344
to cut undersea cables,

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.346
which are now an integral part

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:08.448
of the cloud on which data is stored

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:10.083
across the globe.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.652
If the US can't deter a substate actor

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:13.786
like the Houthis

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:15.255
from its disruptive behavior

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.489
in the Red Sea,

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.291
what chances that have against powers

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.592
like China and Russia?

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.128
There are ways to address all

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:23.162
these problems,

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.764
but it requires a paradigm

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.733
shift in the Western world.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:29.369
We are now in a high security age.

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:31.237
That means governments have to spend

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:33.039
significantly more on defense

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.108
and spend more efficiently.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.509
The US took on the role

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:37.310
as guarantor

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.846
of the Freedom of the Seas in 1945

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.547
and has been master of the seas

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:42.282
ever since.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:45.585
In the 1980s it had almost 600 ships,

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:48.688
but today it has fewer than 300.

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:49.922
Europe has lost

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.858
its military industrial complex

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:52.558
which allowed it

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:54.360
to produce munitions

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.063
on a near-constant basis

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:58.965
in these new, dangerous times.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.900
Congressional Republicans have decided

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.769
to return to isolationism,

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:04.103
hoping that they can bury

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:05.171
their heads in the sand

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.074
and the problems will somehow go away.

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.208
It should be noted that

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:10.777
contrary to popular belief,

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.445
ostriches do not bury

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:13.446
their heads in the sand

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:15.181
to escape threats.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:15.615
In fact,

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:18.518
it would lead to their asphyxiation.

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:20.586
Maybe the birds understand something.

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.789
Congressional Republicans don't

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:24.324
go to

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:25.958
