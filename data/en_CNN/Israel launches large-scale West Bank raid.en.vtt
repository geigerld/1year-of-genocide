00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.434
At least nine Palestinians

00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:02.836
have been killed in the West

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.237
Bank after the Israeli military

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:06.740
launched rates and airstrikes overnight.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.407
That's according

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:09.876
to the Palestinian Health ministry.

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.544
The Israeli military says it launched

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.346
a large counter-terror operation

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.115
overnight in two refugee camps.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:15.749
Officials say

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.217
the Israeli military was targeting,

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.318
quote, Islamic

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.920
Iranian terrorist infrastructure.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.355
CNN's Paula Hancocks is live for us

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.424
this hour in Abu Dhabi. And Paula.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.860
This marks the largest Israeli operation

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.428
in the West Bank. For years.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.563
And we understand we are hearing

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.298
there's been a response from Hamas

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:35.301
this hour to what has occurred.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:38.304
Yeah.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.105
Christina remarks.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:39.906
This is certainly

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.641
a significant operation.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.576
We have been saying for months

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:44.577
that there have been

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.012
these limited operations

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:47.180
by the Israeli military

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.149
into the occupied West Bank.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.817
Hundreds of Palestinians

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.919
have been killed over recent months,

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:54.888
since October 7th of last year.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.723
But this is definitely something

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.758
more significant that we are seeing now.

00:00:58.758 --> 00:00:59.893
We did hear from the governor

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.128
of Jeanine that he said

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:03.830
just after midnight.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.399
So in the early hours of Wednesday,

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.902
the Israeli military surrounded

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.270
the refugee camp.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.338
And Jeanine itself,

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:15.675
he says that he can still hear gunfire

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.844
ongoing in the area.

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:18.578
So it is believed

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.280
this operation is still going.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.915
And he says a third of the city

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.918
is without electricity at this point.

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:25.552
Now, as you say,

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:26.553
we know that nine

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:28.388
Palestinians have been killed.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.290
We hear from the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.491
the Red Crescent Society,

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:32.692
from the Ministry of Health,

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.461
that those deaths

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.129
happened from airstrikes,

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.765
also from strikes on the ground.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.900
We hear drones are in the air as well.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.835
And when it comes

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:44.838
to the Israeli response so far,

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:45.672
we understand

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:46.639
there are hundreds,

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.343
at least hundreds of personnel involved.

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:51.811
We've been told that

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.080
there are four battalions of the border

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.048
police alone,

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:57.951
including undercover border police.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.452
And that doesn't include the military

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.787
and the intelligence element.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.423
So this is a large operation.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:04.457
Now, one thing I wanted to

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.558
mention was a tweet

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:08.094
we had from the Israeli foreign minister,

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.195
which was interesting.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.698
He gave a reason for this operation,

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:13.399
saying that it was to thwart

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.402
what he called Islamic Iranian terrorist

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.138
infrastructure, saying that

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.439
Iran is funding

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.475
and arming terrorists in the West Bank

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.278
as trying to create a situation

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.180
similar to Gaza and Lebanon.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.014
And he said, quote,

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:29.816
we must address this threat

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:30.517
just like

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:31.151
we're handling

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.586
terror infrastructure in Gaza,

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:36.055
including temporary evacuation

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.790
of Palestinian residents

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.692
and any step necessary.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.828
This is a war like any other,

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.197
and we must win it.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.732
Now, that is significant.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:47.233
The fact that he's suggesting

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.035
there could be evacuations

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:50.036
in the occupied West

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.671
Bank, just as there are

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.574
and have been in Gaza, putting

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.009
really a connection

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.077
between those two areas

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.946
and the potential Israeli

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:02.081
reaction to those areas.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.082
Now, we've also heard

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.817
from the Ministry of Health

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.553
in the West Bank

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:09.055
that at least two hospitals

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.823
have been blocked

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:12.091
by the Israeli military,

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:12.492
saying that

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:13.660
there have been mounds of dirt,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.596
for example, pushed towards those areas.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.966
we have seen and obtained video

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.835
that would back up some of those claims.

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:24.370
You've seen some very heavy

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.874
Israeli military assets in those areas.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.542
Bulldozers, for example,

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:32.879
pushing up infrastructure and pavements

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.448
and roads in those areas.

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:38.518
and we are still getting information

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:40.119
and video coming in,

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.656
showing the extent of this operation.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.058
but what we're hearing

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.092
from the Israeli side

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:49.762
is that they are trying to, to to end

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.165
the Iranian terrorist infrastructure,

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:55.368
as they put it, in this, this area

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:56.936
from the Palestinian side

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:59.439
and certainly from those in Janine,

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.740
one of the key areas

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.908
that has been targeted,

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:02.875
certainly from the,

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:03.710
the governor,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.111
they are concerned

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.513
about access to hospitals, about,

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:10.717
hundreds, within those hospitals itself.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.019
given that they're claiming that,

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.954
that Israel has restricted,

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:16.589
all access that we heard

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.824
from the Red Crescent Society

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:18.658
as well, saying,

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:21.227
that their maneuvering of ambulances

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:22.061
has been

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.529
heavily restricted

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.632
by the Israeli military as well.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:26.432
Max. Christina.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:30.970
if this war expands funds from Gaza to,

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.706
the West Bank, that's obviously

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:35.942
a big escalation of that war, isn't it?

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.277
Just Israel have the

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.344
the resources for that.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:43.449
I mean, I think they

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.051
certainly have the resources.

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:48.554
It would be a significant escalation.

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:50.189
The fact that the foreign minister

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.858
is connected in the to,

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:55.495
in such a blatant way on zoom,

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:57.997
Twitter is is significant

00:04:57.997 --> 00:04:58.865
in itself,

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:01.534
mentioning potential evacuation

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:03.136
of Palestinian residents,

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.537
something that we have been seeing

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:06.139
for months, in Gaza

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:06.572
and something

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.041
we are still seeing,

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:08.975
the,

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.944
the Gaza residents that have been, moved

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:14.747
sometimes a dozen times from area to area

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:16.316
as the Israeli military tries

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:16.883
to clear out

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:18.751
civilians, they say, and target

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.653
Hamas militants

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:21.554
that are within

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:22.855
that area, will tunnels

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.824
that are within that area.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.760
Now, if that were to be replicated in

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.829
in the West Bank, it would be,

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.665
very significant, very devastating

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:33.366
when you're talking

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:36.602
about these refugee camps in, in, shams,

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:38.071
for example, in Janine,

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:40.306
they are densely populated.

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:41.808
It a very similar situation

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.776
to what we see, in Gaza,

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.678
where it would be difficult

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.047
for them to be to be evacuated.

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:50.116
And of course, there would be a concern

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:51.017
if this operation

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.319
were to be significantly increased

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.354
by the Israelis

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.290
that there would be civilian casualties

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.158
within that as well.

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:00.827
Now, at this point, the Israeli military

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:02.495
not specifying

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:04.764
how wide this operation is

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:06.599
or how long it will go on for,

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.501
but suffice to say it is larger

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:09.802
than we have seen in some time.

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:12.939
Paula, thank you very much.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.307
just to add to Paula's excellent

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:15.041
reporting there

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:15.775
that we have

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:17.210
had a response from Hamas,

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.211
in the last hour

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.046
calling for a general mobilization

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.348
and escalation of confrontation

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:24.350
in response to the Israeli operations

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.485
in the West Bank.

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:26.052
Although it is

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.186
hard to see

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:28.721
how that retaliation

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:29.822
would actually happen

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:30.990
given the scale of what

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.024
has been occurring in the West

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:34.527
Bank, as Paula has outlined there.

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:36.195
CNN anchor and chief national security

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:37.897
analyst Jim Sciutto is in Tel Aviv.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.465
Jim, what are you learning about

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:42.468
this operation this morning?

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:43.469
Well, John, it's

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.071
the biggest Israeli operation

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:45.738
in the West Bank

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:48.107
since the October 7th attacks.

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:49.876
Israeli officials, the IDF,

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:50.610
say they're going

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.677
after what they call

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:55.114
Islamic Iranian terror infrastructure.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:55.815
The allegation

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:57.316
they're making is that

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:59.352
weapons are coming into the West

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:02.455
Bank, funded by facilitated by Iran,

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:04.123
and that this attack is intended

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:04.891
to target that

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:05.825
the death toll

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:08.961
at this point stands at at least nine.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:10.096
And what we're hearing

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.731
now publicly in response

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:13.232
from Hamas is Hamas

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:13.633
is calling

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:15.435
for a mobilization

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.402
of its supporters

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:18.104
and fighters in the West Bank.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.907
So it's a significant operation.

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:22.575
And that reaction from Hamas

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:23.876
is significant.

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:24.944
Israeli officials

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:25.611
make the point

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.346
that the terror environment,

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:28.181
the threat is real.

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:29.081
Now, you may remember

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:30.750
a little more than a week ago,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.452
there was a suicide

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.920
bombing here in Tel Aviv,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.088
where only the bomber was killed.

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:37.223
So the Israeli

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:38.191
officials, Israeli

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.258
officials, are justifying

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:40.626
it based on the nature of the threat.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:41.994
And what they say is the infrastructure

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:43.029
building in the West Bank.

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:45.731
Where does this put

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:46.365
the the

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:49.368
hostage and ceasefire negotiations?

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:52.004
Listen, you know,

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:54.106
I've covered so many negotiations

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:55.274
like this, and oftentimes

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:56.275
you will see attacks

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:57.376
like this, operations

00:07:57.376 --> 00:07:57.743
like this,

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.879
in the midst of sensitive negotiations.

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:00.780
And it's hard to say

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.515
which way it will cut.

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:04.350
Will it disrupt those negotiations

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.551
because it.

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:08.120
Well, when you have Israel and Hamas

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.222
carrying out operations

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:10.523
like this against each other

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:11.591
certainly can make it harder

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:12.859
for negotiators.

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:13.926
Can you make the argument

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:15.127
that it allows Israeli

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:17.196
negotiators to show toughness

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:19.532
in terms of counterterror operations,

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:21.434
and therefore make it easier

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:22.969
to make concessions to bring a deal

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:25.037
across the finish line? Maybe.

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:25.872
But let's be frank,

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.974
those negotiations are quite sensitive

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:28.541
right now.

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:29.208
It's not clear

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.810
that they are making progress

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.179
on the most intractable issues.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.114
So any increase in hostilities,

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:36.682
particularly in the West

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:37.917
Bank, are ones

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:39.585
that you have to treat as a risk.

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:40.486
And it's been notable

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:42.455
to hear the Israeli foreign minister

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:45.525
tweeting today that Israel should treat

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:46.692
carry out

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:48.194
operations in the West Bank

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.630
like they've been carrying out in Gaza.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.532
That certainly would be quite

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.766
an escalation.

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:54.400
Yes it would.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:54.667
All right.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:55.835
Jim Sciutto, great to have you there.

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:56.636
Thanks so much,
