00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.251
It's been 76 days since

00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:01.960
Hamas militants

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.044
massacred hundreds

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:05.088
at a music festival in southern Israel.

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:07.298
And now one woman who survived

00:00:07.298 --> 00:00:09.634
has returned to the scene to be reunited

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:11.386
with the man who saved her life.

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:15.557
Here's CNN's Will Ripley.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.766
Looking at that cloud of smoke.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.143
What does that trigger for you?

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:19.269
So seeing the smoke,

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.230
it definitely reminds me of those noises.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.648
Bring me back to that day.

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:24.816
In southern Israel.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.401
You don't need a map to know

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.736
you're near Gaza.

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:28.695
Why are you here?

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.156
Why do you want to go back?

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.866
Sorry. That loud boom.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.702
Outgoing artillery near our car

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.120
rattling native New Yorker

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.830
Natalie sent a dodgy.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.998
Tell me what that made you feel like

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:40.832
just now.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:41.750
I got scared that, like,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.752
we're being shot at.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.336
By

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:46.963
the last time she was on this road.

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:50.633
Natalie was running for her life

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.510
just after sunrise on Saturday,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.803
October 7th.

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:55.013
Rocket interception

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:56.473
seen from the dance floor

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.058
at the Nova Music Festival.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.017
Hamas militants

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.269
killed more than 350 people,

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.270
mostly young,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.482
mostly Jewish, mostly unarmed.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.026
I feel so lucky that

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:11.029
that I made it out that I got out alive.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.740
I feel that it's my duty to be

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.200
that voice for all of those

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.202
who weren't as lucky as me.

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:19.662
That sense of duty is why she's returning

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.289
to Israel for the first time

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.083
since the attacks.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.418
Just seeing all these faces and

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.294
and knowing people

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:27.670
that loved these faces.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.673
Faces of friends who never made it home.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.300
Oh, my God.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.427
She's gone.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.512
It's so crazy.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.055
I was dancing right next to them.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:38.348
You know,

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.309
it's so hard to see how many of them are.

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:43.686
And it could have been you.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:45.396
The music festival campsite

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:47.023
now a place where families

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:48.566
come to grieve.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:49.859
Rockets in the sky.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.820
Gunshots on the ground.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.738
All she could do was run.

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:55.490
Many took cover in bathrooms,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.117
bomb shelters, ditches.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.952
Most of them ended up dead.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.495
4 hours of running,

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.330
exhausted, dehydrated.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.124
I never thought that Natalie collapsed.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.291
I would really just sit down

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.417
and accept my fate.

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:07.961
Too tired to run.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.671
As a truck came closer.

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:10.713
We have nowhere to run to.

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:11.256
Like where are we going

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.090
to get up and run to?

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.216
Like, this is a terrorist

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:14.676
coming to kill us.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:15.927
That's it.

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:18.263
Kind of like that one here.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:19.389
The man behind the wheel.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.100
Not a terrorist from a nearby village.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.768
Natalie never got his name.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.812
She only tracked him down a few days ago.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:28.690
It's why she's come back to thank him.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.858
They're about to meet for the

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:38.074
first time since that day.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:41.119
The man fighting back tears, Moshe Shati,

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.037
an Israeli father of four

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:44.330
who left home

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.666
and drove directly into danger.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:50.336
Not once or twice more than ten trips

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:54.048
to and from the music festival.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:55.800
Yo,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.218
yo.

00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.845
Nobody

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.096
wants to.

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:02.432
There are moments of you live

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:05.935
so close to this.

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:08.855
But were you prepared fully for what

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.481
you saw on October 7th?

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.817
The logic behind the work is.

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:16.362
Things like this you can't forget.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.781
I'll never forget what I saw.

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:19.866
It's very.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.785
Very tough.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:25.163
Haunted by the horrors he saw.

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.999
Heartened by the lives he saved.

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.710
So many people were saved in this truck.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.921
With Natalie, one of well

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.839
over 100 people.

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.674
He packed into his pickup

00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:38.384
and drove to safety.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.469
As a like this.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.387
This truck saved so many lives.

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.556
And he just looks like an average truck,

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:46.476
like I said, right there in that corner.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:47.352
If it wasn't for him,

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.436
I truly don't think

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:49.729
I would have been here today.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:55.485
One bright chapter on a very dark day,

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:56.277
Natalie told us.

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:56.778
One reason

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.071
she's sharing her story is

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.864
she doesn't want people to forget

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:02.075
that there is a human face

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.076
to all of this.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.118
These young people

00:04:04.118 --> 00:04:05.912
who were killed on October 7th

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.372
have been politicized.

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:08.748
And Natalie herself

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.875
has been the target of pretty intense

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:11.918
online hate

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.336
as a result of sharing her story.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.296
She wants people to remember that

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:18.299
civilians on both sides are dying

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.217
and they have families.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.385
They have people who love them.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.304
And she says they need to be remembered.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.931
