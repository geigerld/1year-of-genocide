00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.201
Talk about what your team

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:03.269
learned about this blueprint

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.005
and the length of time that Israel

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.140
had to review these plans and why

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.710
it wasn't listened to.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.413
So somewhere around along

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:14.881
2022, Israeli

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.250
intelligence was able to get

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.620
the plan for the Hamas attack.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.255
It codenamed it was coordinated

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.357
by Israeli intelligence,

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:27.127
the wall of Jericho, the Jericho Wall.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.461
Any details?

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.162
Many, many,

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.097
many different

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.332
details of how

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.467
the attack is going to take place

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.736
exactly as it took place

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.872
more than a year after?

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.674
This could be an intelligence

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.677
victory for for Israel.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.347
But Israeli analysts,

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:49.382
some of the

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.052
senior of Israeli intelligence,

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.854
saw the plan as more of the goal,

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:55.622
as a compass

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:58.291
for the building of the forces

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:00.326
where Hamas wants to be,

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.828
but not with Hamas.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:05.565
So while having that plan, they saw this

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:08.068
as something that Hamas is far from

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.570
being capable of doing.

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:14.307
They believe that Hamas has

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.009
doesn't have the ability

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.178
to conduct such a massive operation.

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:18.945
We are talking about,

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.580
according to that plan,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.848
to break the fence

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:23.083
between Gaza and Israel

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.351
in 60 different places.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.353
Israel believed they could do that

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:30.356
maybe in two places.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:33.193
They called for the bombing

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:35.128
and destruction of the cameras

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.730
instantly the same simultaneously,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.965
the beginning of the attack

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:41.401
of the cameras, the automatic guns,

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:42.869
the communication centers,

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.839
and then the ramping of the division

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:46.940
headquarters, the Gaza

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.841
division headquarters

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.675
that is in charge

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.910
of protecting the front,

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.547
the main in July of this year.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.916
So a year after

00:01:56.916 --> 00:02:00.220
an analyst that was reviewing

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:04.390
intercepts about Hamas military exercises

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.458
wrote a letter,

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.059
an e-mail,

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:09.762
an exchange of email, encrypted e-mail.

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.732
She comes from a 200, the Israeli NSA,

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:15.935
the equivalent to the American embassy.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.571
And she described the drill

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:19.973
and she said that

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.207
she believes

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:25.178
that Hamas is narrowing the gap between

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.647
the wall of Jericho player

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:30.283
and Israel capabilities.

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:34.087
And there was a pushback from

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.822
senior most senior

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:38.758
intelligence officer said that told her

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:41.461
this is an imaginary plan.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.863
They cannot do that.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.399
And so here is the tragedy for Israeli

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:50.003
intelligence, for Israeli public,

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.672
instead of positioning.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.675
It's not just an intelligence debate.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:56.543
If Israel

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.378
if the Israeli Defense Forces

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:01.047
would adopt this plan,

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:04.250
something that Hamas can do

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.085
even without any connection

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.620
to the intention of the US

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.055
decision to execute,

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.256
this is something that the analyst

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.091
could say

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.660
she did not push back

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.361
on the Israeli wisdom

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.629
that time,

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.265
that time leading three four months ago

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:22.268
that Hamas doesn't want to go to war.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:25.171
But if the Israeli defense establishment

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.105
had the knowledge

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.707
that Hamas is capable

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:30.043
of launching such an attack,

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.545
that would put a totally different size

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.547
of forces on the border.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.449
The outcome could be very different.

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.550
Also, according to your

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.954
reporting, this analyst,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.290
this woman analyst, we saw

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:46.759
an exercise that Hamas

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.762
undertook a trial run

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.498
and raised red flags, again, saying

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:53.266
this looks

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:56.469
very much like the Wall of Jericho plan

00:03:56.536 --> 00:03:59.205
that we discussed before

00:03:59.205 --> 00:03:59.806
and again,

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:03.243
which seem to have been dismissed,

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.645
not just that she even has,

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:08.214
she says here's an interesting

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:09.816
bit of information,

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:13.653
the same quote from the Koran

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.388
serial murder

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:18.258
that begins with which the

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.260
this detailed plan for action,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.761
the still plan for attack

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.831
starts with it's call for this.

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.266
This is something about Moses,

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.367
but it is

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.168
it's about this surprise

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.771
entry through a gate.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:32.772
I think it's not the case

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.607
that Hamas picked this up.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.242
The people participating,

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:37.076
the Hamas gunmen

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:39.078
participating in that drill

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:42.782
were using the same quote, the same quote

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.385
is now part of the emblem of Hamas

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:47.186
used in all Hamas publications

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.888
in the statement incidents

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:50.456
since the since the attack.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:51.924
As you know, the Israeli government

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:54.060
posted online on X last month,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.328
quote, Contrary to the false

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:56.996
claims, under no circumstances

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:58.464
and at no stage was Prime Minister

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:00.133
Netanyahu warned of Hamas's

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.501
war intentions.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:02.335
They went on to say at

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:03.770
no point was a warning given

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.904
to Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:07.040
on Hamas's intention to start a war.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.807
On the contrary,

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:08.875
all the defense officials,

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:09.575
including the heads

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:10.977
of the intelligence directorate

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.278
and the Shin Bet, assess

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:14.681
that Hamas was deterred.

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:16.182
Do you know if the prime minister

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:17.550
was in fact informed?

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.384
Because it sounds like

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:19.185
from your reporting

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.953
that this document

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:22.155
was was widely

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.090
disseminated in intelligence

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.192
in military circles?

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:26.726
Yes.

00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:27.694
So we don't

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:32.765
know if Prime Minister Netanyahu got the

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.234
was presented with this document.

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:35.902
We do know

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:38.971
and we this comes from previous reporting

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.940
that he was warned against again

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.575
and again and again.

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:43.676
And it details

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:44.143
at least

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:45.211
four different letters

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:49.115
throughout the last year that the members

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:50.983
of the so-called

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:53.986
axis of resistance, Iran, Hamas,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.154
Hezbollah,

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:56.422
see Israeli weakness

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:58.658
and they might decide to use

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:00.093
what they believe

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:01.928
a window of opportunity to attack.

00:06:01.928 --> 00:06:05.431
Yeah, this document was sent to many

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.200
and I think this is a good point

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.471
for further reporting about who saw

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:12.472
and who decided

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:13.206
to continue

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.641
with this so-called conception,

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:16.309
this the

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:17.577
the ability to believe

00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:18.811
this Hamas is good thing.

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:20.680
Ronen Bergman, it's incredible reporting.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.147
Thank you.

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:23.149
More now on the forces at play tonight.

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:24.450
Joining us is Alex Marquardt

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.251
and Oren Liebermann,

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.419
also Axios reporter

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:27.153
and CNN political

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.187
and foreign policy analyst.

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:29.288
Barak revealed.

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:29.856
And CNN

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:31.090
military analyst, retired Army

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.959
Lieutenant General Mark Hertling.

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:33.593
Brock, first of all,

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:34.994
how damning is this report

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:38.564
for the Israeli government?

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:40.233
Well, I think

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:43.870
this this is part of a series of stories

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.971
that appeared in the Israeli

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:48.841
press over the last week or two weeks

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:52.345
that what happens behind them is a fight

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.046
between the Israeli

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:55.982
intelligence community or parts of it,

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.850
especially the military intelligence

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.853
and the political echelon with each side

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:02.255
leaking stuff

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.757
that are more comfortable to him

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:06.125
when it comes to everything

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:07.794
that's happened in the year

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:09.028
before the war.

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:13.099
And, you know, a lot of people in Israel

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.500
think that the reason that now

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.503
we hear about those documents

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:18.805
is because it's

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.807
very comfortable for Benjamin

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:21.874
Netanyahu and his people.

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:22.475
And they're trying

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:23.943
to put those things out

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.711
in order to build a case

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:27.613
for the inquiry committee

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.482
that most likely is going to be formed

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:33.519
on the day after the war. I mean,

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:35.188
as you know,

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:36.122
intelligence officials,

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:36.956
military officials

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:39.492
have accepted responsibility.

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:41.761
Benjamin Netanyahu has not in any form

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:43.229
accepted any responsibility

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.665
for the attack on on October 7th.

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.433
He had very early on,

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:49.936
right before the the

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:51.971
the operation in Gaza.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.973
He had tweeted out a criticism

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.408
of the heads of the military

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:57.443
and intelligence and then quickly

00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:58.544
withdrew that tweet

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:01.481
and apologized for for that.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.982
But it certainly seems like

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.051
this is something

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:08.521
he wants out there.

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:09.155
No doubt.

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.256
By the way,

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:12.525
there was a huge intelligence failure.

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:14.460
It's not that it's not true.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.195
There was a huge intelligence failure.

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:16.729
I just

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:18.297
you know, in one of the emails,

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:20.266
this analyst from Israel

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:21.868
Signals Intelligence Agency,

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.736
a 201

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:25.771
of the headlines of one of her emails

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:26.739
that was warning from

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:27.740
this plan

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.342
was the headline was

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.644
Death in the Kibbutz.

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:32.044
Okay.

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:34.213
How symbolic is that?

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:35.548
Several months ago, death

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:37.416
in the kibbutz, you wrote.

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:39.752
So there was a huge intelligence failure,

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:40.853
not the third level,

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:42.355
but the higher level of the people

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.123
who were actually making the decisions.

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:46.492
And that their job is to actually warn

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:47.760
that political echelon

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.661
of what was going on.

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:51.731
But at the same time, Netanyahu did

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:53.533
get a lot of other warnings

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.401
that had to do also with,

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:57.637
you know, the general situation

00:08:57.637 --> 00:09:01.274
where Israel's enemies were planning to

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:02.775
gang up on it

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:05.745
because of the domestic crisis over

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:06.779
Netanyahu's

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:08.180
judicial overhaul in the months

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.215
before the war.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.350
Alex, what do you make of this report?

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.653
How are U.S. officials likely to react?

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:14.387
Well, Anderson,

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.121
I really do

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.255
think it goes to this theme

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.123
that we've been reporting on

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:17.990
for quite some time

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.792
of the underestimation

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:21.694
of what Hamas was capable of doing

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:24.130
and certainly what they intended to do.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.231
You and I have talked

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.299
about intelligence

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.466
reports and assessments

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:28.534
both on the Israeli

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:30.236
and the American side

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:30.870
in the days

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.438
leading up to October 7th

00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:34.740
that indicated that Hamas

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.108
might do something.

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:36.542
Now, what

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:38.144
that something was expected

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:40.112
to be was what we had seen

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:42.481
before in previous rounds of fighting

00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:43.583
that were frankly rather

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:44.951
inconsequential for Israel.

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:45.985
And that would have been

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:48.354
rockets being fired across the border,

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:49.155
which then likely

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:50.122
would have been intercepted

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:50.790
by the Iron Dome,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.291
which is exactly what we're seeing

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.225
on our screen right there.

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:54.860
But there was no sense

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.396
that Hamas would be able to break

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:58.030
through the friends

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.831
fence and carry out

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:02.034
the types of massacres that they did.

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:03.603
There is

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:04.503
acknowledgment

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:05.738
and public

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:07.573
acknowledgment here in the U.S.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:08.641
from intelligence officials

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:10.343
and Biden administration officials

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:12.111
that this was

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:14.580
purely an Israeli intelligence failure.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.848
American intelligence officials

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:17.750
are not taking any responsibility

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.084
for this.

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:18.751
They are laying it

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:20.653
at the feet of the intelligence

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:22.955
apparatus and security apparatus

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.357
in Israel.

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:25.424
Essentially, the U.S.

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:27.159
has been so focused on China

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:28.561
and on Russia and Ukraine

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:31.163
that they just don't spend a lot of time

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:32.565
thinking about Hamas

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:34.166
and other Palestinian militant groups.

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.701
Now, will that change going forward?

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:36.702
That remains to be seen.

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:37.903
We've certainly seen U.S.

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:39.572
intelligence playing a much bigger role

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:41.807
during this conflict with drones

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:42.975
and other kinds of signals

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:44.343
intelligence gathering.

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:45.277
But in their minds,

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:48.180
this is an Israeli intelligence failure.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.382
I think most will tell you

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:50.416
that Netanyahu

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:51.751
is not expected to survive this.

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.986
But there's also an expectation that

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:56.656
the heads of the intelligence agencies,

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.157
there's going to be a reckoning.
