AND TO BEN WEDEMAN, IN SOUTHERN  LEBANON, THE SCALE OF THIS CALL  FOR EVACUATION BY THE IDF,  ESTIMATED TO BE MORE THAN A  MILLION PEOPLE. WHAT'S THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THIS  ACTUALLY HAPPENING? &gt;&gt; Reporter: IT'S GOING TO BE  VERY DIFFICULT, FIRST OF ALL,  GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE SHEER  NUMBER OF PEOPLE, PERHAPS  1.1 MILLION PEOPLE A SITUATION  WHERE THERE'S VERY LITTLE FUEL,  THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE, WHERE ARE  THEY GOING TO GO, WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO BE HOUSED? THE U.N. AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN GAZA ARE SAYING IT'S SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE GIVEN  THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND THE  CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE'S AN ACTIVE WAR. PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO JUST MOVE  IN THE STREET, SO MOVING  1.1 MILLION PEOPLE FROM NORTHERN GAZA TO SOUTHERN PART IS  SOMETHING THAT'S HARD TO IMAGINE BEING DONE ON PRACTICAL TERMS. NOW, I'VE BEEN IN GAZA BEFORE,  FOR INSTANCE, IN 2014 THE  ISRAELIS ORDERED THE EVACUATION  OF CIVILIANS FROM NORTHERN  COMMUNITIES, ONES NEAR THE  ISRAELI BORDER. FOR THE MOST PART PEOPLE WERE  ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU  COULD GET OUT BY WALKING, YOU  COULD GET OUT BY RIDING ON A  DONKEY CART, PERHAPS, IF YOU  COULD GET A CAR RIDE OUT. BUT THAT WAS RELATIVELY SMALL  NUMBERS COMPARED TO GAZA CITY. GAZA CITY IS HUGE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO PUT ALL  THESE PEOPLE WHEN YOU MOVE THEM  SOUTH WHEN NONE OF THE RELIEF  SUPPLIES, TENTS, FOOD, WATER,  MEDICINE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED INTO  THE GAZA STRIP. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE  HOW THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE DONE. AND HAMAS IS CALLING ON PEOPLE  TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES, TO STAY  PUT. SO, THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY  DIFFICULT, AND CERTAINLY IF  PEOPLE DO NOT OR CANNOT EVACUATE THOSE AREAS, THE ISRAELIS ARE  CALLING THEM TO LEAVE, AND THIS  GROUND OFFENSIVE GOES AHEAD,  PROBABILITY IS, IT WILL BE A  BLOOD BATH.  &gt;&gt; BEN WEDEMAN JOINING US IN  SOUTHERN LEBANON, BEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND JOINING US NOW TO GET MORE  OF THESE QUESTIONS ANSWERED, I  DO, F SPOKESMAN LIEUTENANT  COLONEL PETER LEARNER, COLONEL,  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AGAIN  THIS MORNING AS ALWAYS. I WANT TO ASK YOU FOR  CONFIRMATION ON WHAT HAMAS IS  CLAIMING, THAT 13 ISRAELI  PRISONERS TAKEN HOSTAGE DURING  THE WEEKEND'S ATTACK, THEY ARE  CLAIMING THEY HAVE BEEN KILLED  IN GAZA BY ISRAELI BOMBINGS. HAS THE IDF CONFIRMED THOSE  DEATHS? ? I CAN'T CONFIRM THOSE, AND WE  HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS WITH  EVERYTHING HAMAS IS SAYING. AND THEIR PROPAGANDA EFFORTS ARE EXTENSIVE. THIS MORNING WE ARE CONTINUING  OUR ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE HAMAS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, AND  THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT  THE GAZA STRIP, SPECIFICALLY WE  ARE TARGETING SPECIAL OPERATIONS CAPABILITIES, WE'VE TAKEN UP  THEIR DRONE CAPABILITIES. THEY HAD ATTACK DRONES THAT WERE POSEN AND PREPARED TO BE  LAUNCHED AT ISRAEL BUT WE'VE  TAKEN SOME OF THOSE OUT AND  WE'RE CONTINUING OUR EFFORT TO  MAKE SURE HAMAS CAN NEVER, EVER  THREATEN ISRAEL AGAIN AND THEY  CANNOT BE PERMITTED TO DO SO.  &gt;&gt; YOU DO NOT HAVE CONFIRMATION  OF WHAT HAMAS IS CLAIMING THERE. DO YOU HAVE ANY UPDATE ON THE  CONDITION OF ALL OF THE  HOSTAGES, ANY OF THEM THAT ARE  BEING HELD? &gt;&gt; WELL, TO MY KNOWLEDGE THEY'VE NOT RELEASED ANY INFORMATION  EXCEPT FOR DISINFORMATION, AND  WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT VERY  CAUTIOUSLY. THE SITUATION IS AS SUCH, WE  BELIEVE THAT HAMAS ARE  RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE  WELL-BEING OF ALL OF THE  HOSTAGES THAT THEY'VE TAKEN, AND THEY NEED TO RETURN THEM  IMMEDIATELY, THEY NEED TO  RELEASE THEM TO ISRAEL. AND THEY WILL PAY THE  CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR ACTIONS. THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND,  OBVIOUSLY, IS A COMPLICATED ONE, AND WE'RE TAKING OPERATING IN  CAUTION WITH REGARD TO THE  HOSTAGE SITUATION AND OF COURSE  IT IS INFLUENCING OUR  OPERATIONAL GAME PLAN.  &gt;&gt; HOW IS IT INFLUENCING IT? IS IT CAUSING THE IDF NOT TO  TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS AT THIS  MOMENT, THAT IT WOULD OTHERWISE  TAKE? &gt;&gt; I OBVIOUSLY WON'T ELABORATE  ON OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS,  BUT DEFINITELY IT IS PART OF THE PLANNING PROCESS, AND WE DO NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. &gt;&gt; OKAY.  &gt;&gt; OUR PRIORITY IS TO RETURN  THEM HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  &gt;&gt; THE ORDER FROM RECOMMENDATION FROM ISRAEL FOR ABOUT  1.1 MILLION PEOPLE ACCORDING TO  THE U.N. TO MOVE OUT OF NORTHERN GAZA, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME  REPORTS OF A TIME FRAME PUT ON  THAT. IS THERE A TIME FRAME THAT THE  IDF HAS PUT ON THAT? &gt;&gt; SO, THE ORDERS IS TO EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY, AND I WOULD HIGHLY  RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE ADHERE TO  THAT INSTRUCTION BECAUSE THE  MILITARY IS DETERMINED TO TAKE  OUT HAMAS'S CAPABILITIES, THEY  OPERATE FROM A STRONGHOLD WITHIN GAZA AND GAZA CITY AND THEY CAN  NO LONGER BE UTILIZE THAT AREA. IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE AND  MITIGATE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES,  THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN ASKING  US OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, WHAT ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN  CORRIDOR, THIS IS PART OF THE  HUMANITARIAN EFFORT SO THAT  PEOPLE WILL NOT BE INFLUENCED  MORE THAN THEY HAVE TO BE IN  THIS CONFLICT. HAMAS, UNFORTUNATELY IS CALLING  ON THE OTHER HAND, NO, PEOPLE,  DO NOT EVACUATE, STAY AND  SACRIFICE YOURSELF. HAMAS HAS NO REGARD FOR HUMAN  LIFE, ISRAELI OR PALESTINIAN. THEY WILL SACRIFICE EVERYBODY AS THEY ARE PROVING TIME AND TIME  AGAIN.  &gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS, IS THERE A  SAFE WINDOW FOR ALL OF THOSE  PEOPLE, A MILLION PLUS PEOPLE TO EVACUATE TO THE SOUTH? THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS IT IS,  QUOTE, IMPOSSIBLE FOR SUCH A  MOVEMENT TO TAKE PLACE WITHOUT  DEVASTATING HUMANITARIAN  CONSEQUENCES, AS THESE AIR  STRIKES CONTINUE.  &gt;&gt; HERE'S WHAT WE DO. WHEN WE SAW A THREAT ON THE  BORDER WITH GAZA WE EVACUATED  THE PEOPLE FROM THE BORDER FROM  GAZA. WHAT IS HAMAS DOING? THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING. S SACRIFICING THEM, STAY PUT. THE IDF IS COMING. WE ARE OPERATING EXTENSIVELY. WHEN THEY PLACE THEIR OFFENSIVE  DRONES, STRIKE DRONES, SUICIDE  DRONES ON THE ROOFS OF HOUSES,  THEY ARE JEOPARDIZING EVERYBODY  IN THAT HOUSE, THEY DON'T CARE. SO WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE,  EVACUATE THIS AREA, BECAUSE WE  ARE OPERATING, WE PLAN ON  BROADENING THE SCOPE OF OUR  OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE  OUR GOAL.  &gt;&gt; COLONEL, I'M GOING TO MOVE  ON, IS THERE A WINDOW OF SAFETY. THE U.N. HAS SAID 24 HOURS, FOR  EXAMPLE, IS THERE A WINDOW OF  SAFETY WHEN THIS EVACUATION --  &gt;&gt; I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT THE EVACUATION TAKES PLACE  IMMEDIATELY. THE WINDOW OF -- THE 24 HOURS  THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE  HIGHLY RECOMMENDATION, BUT IT  COULD GO ON BEYOND THAT BUT I  WOULD SAY THE INSTRUCTION IS GET UP, AND GET OUT OF THE NORTH OF  GAZA AND GAZA CITY AND MOVE TO  THE SOUTH.  &gt;&gt; AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, THOUGH, MOVE TO THE SOUTH, BUT THERE IS  STILL NO CROSSING OUT OF GAZA  FOR THEM? &gt;&gt; YEAH, WE'RE DIRECTING THEM  EXACTLY WHERE WE EXPECT THEM NOT TO BE WHERE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO  SAFEGUARD THEIR OWN LIVES SHOULD MOVE FROM. NOT TO GO INTO EGYPT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, BUT THEY SHOULD NOT  BE IN THE AREA WHICH WE  DESIGNATED AND HAVE TOLD THEM  SPECIFICALLY. THIS IS LIKE A FOREWARNING OF  WHERE WE'RE OPERATING,  FOREWARNING OF WHERE IT'S GOING  TO BE MORE EXTENSIVE COMBAT,  WHERE THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE EXTENSIVE STRIKES, YOU KNOW,  THIS IS THE WHOLE IDEA OF TRYING TO MAKE SAFEGUARD PEOPLE'S  LIVES. THE INSTRUCTION TO LEAVE IS TO  SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES SO THEY  SHOULD LEAVE FROM THE NORTH OF  GAZA, FROM GAZA CITY AND GO TO  THE SOUTH OF THE CITY, OF THE  GAZA WADI, AND THEY SHOULD --  THEY SHOULD SET UP THERE. IF THEY STAY, THEY ARE  JEOPARDIZING THEMSELVES, THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE  CONSIDERATIONS, THERE ARE  PROBLEMS, OF COURSE, I WOULD SAY HAMAS NEED TO DEAL WITH ALL OF  THOSE PROBLEMS, OF HOW TO SHIP  PEOPLE FROM THE NORTH TO THE  SOUTH, LIKE WE DID, WE TOOK  PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOUSES IN THE  SOUTH OF ISRAEL AND WE MOVED  THEM ELSEWHERE. AND HAMAS SHOULD HAVE THE  RESPONSIBILITY, RATHER THAN  FAILING THE PEOPLE OF GAZA, THEY SHOULD HELP THE PEOPLE OF GAZA.  &gt;&gt; COLONEL, I THINK THE QUESTION BECOMES, FOR HOW LONG CAN THEY  REMAIN IN THE SOUTH? WILL AN ORDER LIKE ISRAEL HAS  GIVEN IN THE NORTH THEN COME TO  THEM IN THE SOUTH? IF THERE IS NO CROSSING THAT  OPENS.  &gt;&gt; OUR OPERATION IS FOCUSED  TOWARDS HAMAS, NOT TO THE PEOPLE OF GAZA, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF  GAZA ARE NOT OUR ENEMY, THE  HAMAS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION HAS BUTCHERED OVER A THOUSAND, 200  PEOPLE, AND ISRAEL CANNOT BE  PERMITTED TO GOVERN THE GAZA  STRIP AND USE IT AS A STAGING  GROUND AGAINST ISRAEL. WHEN WE RECOMMEND TO THE PEOPLE  OF GAZA GO TO THE SOUTH, YOU  SHOULD LISTEN, GO TO THE SOUTH,  DO NOT STAY IN GAZA CITY, DO NOT STAY IN THE NORTH, AND YES,  EVERYBODY SHOULD LISTEN TO THAT  RECOMMENDATION.
