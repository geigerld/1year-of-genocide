OPTIMISM ABOUT A POTENTIAL DEAL  TO FREE SOME OF THE HOSTAGES  HELD BY HAMAS TELLING REPORTERS  YESTERDAY HE BELIEVES IT'S,  QUOTE, GOING TO HAPPEN. FAMILIES OF THE AMERICANS  BELIEVED TO BE HELD HOSTAGE WILL MEET WITH OFFICIALS AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND ON CAPITOL HILL  TODAY. THAT COMES AFTER THOUSANDS OF  DEMONSTRATORS FILLED THE  NATIONAL MALL YESTERDAY IN THE  MARCH FOR ISRAEL, MANY SHOWING  SUPPORT FOR THOSE HOSTAGES. NOW, THE FAMILY OF 8-YEAR-OLD  EMILY HAND ARE ANXIOUSLY  AWAITING NEWS, INITIALLY  BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN KILLED  DURING THE OCTOBER 7th HAMAS  ATTACKS BUT NOW BELIEVED TO BE  AMONG THE 239 HOSTAGES. BEFORE LEARNING HIS DAUGHTER WAS ALIVE, HER FATHER SAID HER DEATH WAS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE THAN  BEING HELD CAPTIVE BY HAMAS. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE WEST THAT I WAS  HOPING FOR. SHE WAS EITHER DEAD OR IN GAZA. AND IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT  WHAT THEY DO TO PEOPLE IN GAZA,  THAT IS WORSE THAN DEATH. &gt;&gt; EMILY'S FATHER WAS PLANNING  TO BURR ARE YOU HIS DAUGHTER  ALONGSIDE HER MOTHER, WITH WHO  DIED FROM CANCER SEVERAL YEARS  AGO, AND NOW HE IS WAITING FOR A CHANCE TO HUG HIS BEAUTIFUL  LITTLE GIRL. EMILY TURNS 9 THIS FRIDAY. &gt;&gt; SHE WON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT DAY  IT IS. SHE WON'T KNOW IT'S HER  BIRTHDAY. THERE WILL BE NO BIRTHDAY CAKE. NO PARTY. NO FRIENDS. JUST BE PETRIFIED IN A TUNNEL  UNDER GAZA. THAT'S HER BIRTHDAY. &gt;&gt; EMILY'S FATHER, THOMAS HAND,  IS WITH US NOW.  &gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING.  &gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU,  GRIEVING WITH YOU, HOPING FOR  YOU. NOW YOU ARE HERE IN THE FIGHT OF YOUR LIFE FOR YOUR DAUGHTER, WHO TURNS 9 ON FRIDAY. TELL US ABOUT THAT FIGHT. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE BEEN WORKING NON-STOP TO PUT PRESSURE ON ALL THE  GOVERNMENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD  TO DO THEIR BEST TO GET,  PARTICULARLY MY LITTLE EMILY,  BACK HOME. SHE IS AN IRISH CITIZEN, SO WE  PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE  IRISH GOVERNMENT. WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE  POSSIBLY CAN TO GET HER HOME,  AND ALL THE HOSTAGES. AT LEAST THE CHILDREN. THEY COULD START OFF WITH THE  BABIES AND THE CHILDREN. THEY'VE GOT BABIES BEING  KIDNAPPED OVERRE. &gt;&gt; POPPY MAKES A SALIENT POINT. ALL OF US WERE SHAKEN WHEN WE  WATCHED YOUR INTERVIEW WITH  CLARISSA WARD, I THINK, AND WE  KIND OF RODE THE ROLLER COASTER  WITH YOU, OBVIOUSLY, TO A  SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEGREE WHEN  WE SAW YOUR INTERVIEW WITH ED  LAVANDERA WHERE THINGS HAD  CHANGED. WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE TO  YOU? I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW PAINFUL AND  DIFFICULT IT IS TO HAVE TO COME  OUT AND TALK ABOUT THIS. I ALSO IMAGINE THE SUPPORT FOR  WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING HAS  BEEN TREMENDOUS. &gt;&gt; THE SUPPORT WORLDWIDE IS  TREMENDOUS, AND I'VE GOT PEOPLE  IN BRAZIL SENDING ME MESSAGES,  COMFORT AND SUPPORT. YEAH. THE CAMPAIGN IS VIRAL, I SUPPOSE YOU'D CALLED IT. AND IT'S BEEN GREAT, THE SUPPORT THAT WE'RE BEING GIVEN. &gt;&gt; IN THE LAST 24 HOURS,  PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD A LENGTHY  CALL WITH PRIME MINISTER  BENJAMIN NETANYAHU AND PRESIDENT BIDEN CAME OUT OF THAT CALL AND  SAID HE BELIEVES IT'S, QUOTE,  GOING TO HAPPEN. DOES THAT GIVE YOU MORE HOPE? THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET OUT? &gt;&gt; OF COURSE. YOU KNOW, AMERICA HAS A LOT OF  INFLUENCE ALL OVER THE WORLD. IF HE SAYS THAT, OBVIOUSLY, HE  KNOWS MORE THAN I DO, AND EVERY  LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION GIVES  US HOPE THAT WE CAN GET EMILY  AND AT LEAST THE CHILDREN AND  BABIES OUT OF GAZA.  &gt;&gt; HOW OFTEN ARE YOU GETTING  INFORMATION EITHER FROM THE  IRISH OFFICIALS, THE U.S.  OFFICIALS --  &gt;&gt; VERY, VERY LITTLE. NOBODY REALLY KNOWS ANYTHING. I JUST -- I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SHE'S NOT DEAD. YOU KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HAMAS TERRORISTS. THERE IS EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF  IT. SOMEONE SAW HER BEING LED AWAY. HER AND HER FRIEND AND HER  FRIEND'S MOTHER. &gt;&gt; CAN I ASK YOU, I KNOW FOR A  FACT, THAT IS THE REPORTING, BUT DO YOU ALSO FEEL IT? YOU KNOW, PARENTS FEEL SOMETHING WITH THEIR CHILDREN, RIGHT, A  BOND LIKE NO OTHER. CAN YOU FEEL EMILY? &gt;&gt; NO. NO. MY FEELINGS, I CAN'T LET MY  FEELINGS INTERFERE WITH GETTING  HER BACK. IT'S LIKE A CAMPAIGN. WE JUST KEEP MOVING FORWARD. I DON'T EVEN SEE THE INTERVIEWS. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO LOOK AT THE INTERVIEWS. I DON'T WATCH THE NEWS. I HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR IT. IT'S JUST FULL ON GET IT EMILY  BACK.  &gt;&gt; TO THAT POINT, PART OF THAT  IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN TIMES  SQUARE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF  NEW YORK, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YEAH.  &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING? &gt;&gt; BIG BILLBOARDS. I GUESS, FOR SURE EMILY AND  MARCHING ON FROM THERE. JUST TO KEEP EMILY -- JUST TO  KEEP HER ALIVE IN PEOPLE'S MINDS AND HEARTS. &gt;&gt; WE MENTIONED, AND YOU HAVE  SPOKEN ABOUT, HER BIRTHDAY ON  FRIDAY. BILLBOARDS? &gt;&gt; AND DRIVING AND NOT BEING  ABLE TO STOP AND THINK. HOW MUCH OF THAT IS BECAUSE YOU  HAVE A GOAL HERE, BECAUSE YOU  HAVE A TRUE PORPS, A NORTH STAR, AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS BECAUSE  YOU DON'T WANT TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW? &gt;&gt; YEAH. I CAN'T. I ACTUALLY KEEP HER IN A SPECIAL PLACE, AND I DON'T WANT TO  IMAGINE WHAT SHE'S GOING  THROUGH. EVERY DAY, 38 DAYS NOW. I CAN'T THINK ABOUT IT. IT WOULD BE TOO PAINFUL. SHE IS DOWN IN THE TUNNELS OF  GAZA WITH HAMAS. I DON'T WANT TO THINK OF WHAT  CONDITIONS SHE'S IN. HOW SHE IS BEING TREATED. HOW SHE IS BEING FED. HOW SHE IS -- IF SHE HAS BEEN  GIVEN WATER. JUST HAS SHE GOT A TOOTHBRUSH  AND TOOTHPASTE. TOILET FACILITIES. THESE ARE TUNNELS UNDERNEATH  GAZA. I DON'T KNOW. COULD BE LIKE THE TRAIN CARTS IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR. THEY WERE JUST ALL IN A CATTLE  CAR AND PE E&amp;P OO WHERE YOU  STOOD. &gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU SAID WHEN YOU GET  HER BACK, YOU WILL TAKE HER TO  DISNEY WORLD AND GIVE HER THE  WORLD. SHE IS SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU. THANK YOU.  &gt;&gt; THANK YOU.  &gt;&gt; WE'RE -- I'M NOT GOING TO  SEND HER TO SCHOOL FOR AT LEAST  A YEAR. WE'RE GOING TO GIVE HER THE  JUST HAPPY TIMES. AND FIX HER. YOU KNOW, SHE IS NOT GOING TO  COME BACK -- NONE OF THEM ARE  GOING TO COME BACK THE WAY THEY  WENT IN. THEY ARE GOING TO BE MENTALLY  AND PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY  BROKEN. AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT  OF FIXING. THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF  TIME AND ENERGY TO PUCKS HER. -- TO FIX HER. WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO  FIX HER. &gt;&gt; WE HOPE AND PRAY FOR THAT  MOMENT WHEN YOU GET TO GIVE HER  THE WORLD, ANYTHING YOU NEED OR  WE CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO GET THE
