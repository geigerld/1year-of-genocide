00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.768
More breaking news right now.

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:03.603
And this coming from the Middle

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:04.204
East, tensions

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:05.372
skyrocketing there

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.440
after assassinations this week.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.641
And we are getting right now

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.243
some brand new details

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.411
about exactly

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:12.812
how the assassination

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.381
of the Hamas political leader,

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.882
Ismail Haniya, went down.

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.217
And this

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.318
these are incredible details.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:19.753
A Jeremy Diamond is breaking.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:20.920
He's in Haifa, Israel,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.555
in northern Israel right now.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:23.156
And Jeremy,

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:24.124
these details

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:27.127
are pretty stunning.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.162
Yeah, no doubt about it, Erin.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:29.396
I mean,

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.563
this was a quite

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.532
sophisticated operation.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.200
I'm told by a source familiar

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.001
with the matter

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.002
that Ismail Haniyeh

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.003
was assassinated

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.972
in Tehran early yesterday

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.373
morning using a bomb

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.808
that was covertly hidden

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:42.709
in the guest house

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:43.743
where he was staying.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:44.811
But this bomb,

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:45.245
I'm told,

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:46.980
was actually covertly

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.649
planted inside that guest house

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.117
about two months ago,

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:51.751
and it was only

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.219
remotely detonated once.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.054
It was clear

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.021
that Ismail Haniyeh,

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:56.189
Hamas's political leader,

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.124
was actually inside his room,

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:00.393
inside of that guest house

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.495
when that bomb was detonated.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.330
He was killed alongside

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.198
his bodyguard,

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:06.533
who was also there.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.500
Now, we should note that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.301
Israel has still

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.903
neither confirmed nor denied

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.438
its involvement in this.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:12.872
Iranian officials

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.474
and Hamas have said

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:15.608
that Israel was behind

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:16.843
this attack.

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.245
I'm also told that Israel

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.080
Israeli officials

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.481
actually briefed U.S.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.249
officials on this operation,

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.251
but only after it took place,

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.453
only after

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:27.220
we learned

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.887
that Ismail

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:30.056
Haniya had been killed in this.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:31.324
What's also interesting here

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:32.325
is that this guest house

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.793
was actually under the control

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.095
of Iran's Islamic

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.830
Revolutionary Guard Corps.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.897
And so this represents

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.866
a stunning breach of security

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:40.300
for them,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.935
a very big embarrassment

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.670
for the IRGC.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.971
And we've reached out

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:45.972
to Iranian officials

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:46.906
for comment on this.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:47.874
But we know, of course,

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:48.842
that we heard yesterday

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.877
from Iran's supreme

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.479
leader vowing revenge,

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.279
saying that

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.114
Israel has, quote,

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.081
paved the way

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.317
for your harsh punishment.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.618
This assassination

00:01:58.618 --> 00:01:59.586
has put this region

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:00.520
on a knife's

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.688
edge, in addition,

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:02.856
of course, to

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.724
the Israeli strike in Beirut,

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.527
just hours before this, that

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:08.461
took out a senior

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.462
Hezbollah commander.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:10.530
There are now threats

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.631
of retaliation

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:12.765
not only from Iran,

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.067
but also from Hezbollah

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.101
and Hamas

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.169
putting this region

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:17.036
and this area

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:17.971
where I am right now

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.172
in northern Israel,

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:20.406
very much on edge

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.574
as the possibility

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:23.510
of retaliation now looms.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.545
Aaron, thank you very much.

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.647
Jeremy Diamond.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.048
Cedric Leighton joins me now.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.350
Colonel Cedric Layton,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.484
Colonel Jeremy's

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:32.819
reporting is really stunning,

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.720
and he mentioned this,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.587
but let's just emphasize

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:35.355
this again.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.556
He is reporting

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:39.559
that ostensibly,

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.194
some Israeli operatives,

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:41.528
although they

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:42.095
have not confirmed

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:42.996
their involvement,

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.465
planted an IED in Tehran

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.100
in a guest house controlled

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.101
by the Islamic

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.536
Revolutionary Guard Corps,

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:52.172
the elite IRGC,

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.173
two months ago,

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.741
and then remotely detonated it

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:55.542
when they knew that

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:56.409
the guy they wanted to get

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.277
was actually staying

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.978
in that house.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.413
Holy cow.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:01.881
Yeah. Holy cow is right, Aaron.

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:04.417
This is very classic operation

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:04.784
in, you know,

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:05.618
kind of in line

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:06.719
with the tradition

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.320
of Israeli

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.055
intelligence going back,

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:09.389
you know,

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:09.923
almost to the

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.090
founding of Israel

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.759
and what the Israelis say,

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.060
if they did this,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.361
what they were able to do was,

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.396
Jeremy pointed out,

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:17.630
was breach

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.398
security

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.867
in a really remarkable way.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:21.901
The IRGC,

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:23.336
the Iranian Revolutionary Guard

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.738
Corps, is very much in control

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:26.706
of a lot of different

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.741
aspects of Iranian life.

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:30.009
but they weren't in direct

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.711
control of this guest house,

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.779
which was ostensibly

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.047
their own guest house.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.015
And whoever breached this and,

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:36.449
you know,

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.650
the supposition is

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.985
that it was Israel.

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.086
But whoever did this did

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:41.454
a remarkable job.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:42.789
And the fact also

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:43.523
has to be

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:44.090
noted that

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.391
this was not detected

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.160
for probably over two months.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.262
If you know, if Jeremy's

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.363
reporting is

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:51.598
and his sources are accurate,

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:52.665
so that,

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:54.801
that really indicates that,

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.302
you know, people were,

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:59.305
quite frankly, overcome by,

00:03:59.472 --> 00:03:59.973
you know,

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.441
by their own sloppiness

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:03.543
in this particular case and,

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:04.944
this, this very fact

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.012
on the Iranian side

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.213
shows that Israel

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:09.482
has been able to penetrate,

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:11.317
their security apparatus

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.619
quite a bit.

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.988
and that, of course, signals,

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.155
some major weaknesses

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.857
in the Iranian structure.

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:18.391
I mean, Jeremy,

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:19.559
just to emphasize this

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:21.294
and I know, Abby,

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:21.628
I don't know

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:22.562
if your reporting is

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:23.329
is how detailed

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:24.430
is on the form of an IED,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.365
but you have

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.399
an improvised explosive

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:28.067
device inside a guest house,

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:30.303
which would presumably mean

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.337
no one was sweeping it

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:32.372
or checking it

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:34.040
before this Hamas leader

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.741
came in.

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:35.308
Or in fact,

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:36.409
any time in the past

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.976
two months,

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:37.644
which would seem to be

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.712
just a really basic,

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:42.715
basic point of protocol.

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:44.050
Yeah.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.451
Look, we don't know exactly

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.253
what kind of explosive device

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:47.820
this was.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.088
We don't know exactly where

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:49.889
it was hidden,

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:50.790
whether this was something

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.158
that could have evaded,

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:53.026
the typical checks

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:53.993
that the IRGC

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:54.961
would conduct on this.

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.463
But I think one clear,

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:58.898
failure of security here

00:04:58.898 --> 00:04:59.666
is the fact

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:00.900
that this guest house,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.434
the reason

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:02.702
why this bomb was planted

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:03.403
there is because it

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:04.404
was a guest house

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:05.505
where Ismail Haniyeh

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.140
was known to have stayed.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.608
And so this indicates

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:10.643
that Hania was a repeat guest

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.378
in this same location,

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.280
which is obviously a security,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.683
a major security vulnerability

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:18.151
that the Israelis appear

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.720
to have exploited here.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.988
and so we don't know

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.256
exactly how this happened,

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:24.691
but there's no question

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.592
that there will be,

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:27.427
major questions

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:29.028
asked within the IRGC,

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:31.164
within Iran's top political,

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.365
and military echelons

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.599
about how this could have

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.501
possibly, happened.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.303
And I also think it's notable

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:38.071
that yesterday,

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:38.738
Iranian state

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:39.739
media was reporting

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.541
that this was a rocket

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.609
that was fired from outside

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:45.778
into this, guest house

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.180
that actually killed Tania.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.880
But the fact that

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.781
it was actually something

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:49.382
that was planted

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:50.717
in the guest house suggests

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:52.318
even additional

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:53.953
layers of of failure.

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:55.788
It also makes clear

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:57.090
that this was not,

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.725
fired by a drone

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:00.360
or by a fighter jet

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.260
that would have violated

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.395
Iranian airspace.

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:03.696
So that also may factor

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:04.630
into how Iran

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.299
chooses to retaliate,

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.067
for this assassination.

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:09.302
And that's a significant point

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:10.636
as well.

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:11.971
Colonel, it also,

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:12.305
though what

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:13.373
Jeremy saying

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:14.640
does just make one thing

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.442
sort of unbelievably clear.

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:17.210
So let's just say in

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.744
black and white,

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.078
that means a human being

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:20.747
is involved, who's in Tehran,

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:21.781
who actually gets access

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:22.515
to this guest house

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:23.116
and plants something.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:24.250
At some point

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.218
there is a human

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.053
being infiltration,

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:27.820
which is different

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.855
than what Jeremy's saying.

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.556
They had originally been

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:31.057
put out there

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.191
about a rocket or a drone.

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:32.392
Right.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.393
Which could be completely done

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.293
remotely.

00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:35.161
That shows

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:36.362
actual physical human

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:37.830
involvement. Colonel.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.898
It does. Absolutely.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:39.232
And it's

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.033
really a classic case of,

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:41.534
in essence,

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:43.403
a clandestine operation.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:43.770
these are the

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.971
kinds of operations

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:45.905
you would have seen

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:46.806
the British conduct

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:47.640
in World War Two

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.808
with a special Operations

00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:50.009
executive.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.043
in Europe,

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:52.712
you would have seen the OSS,

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:53.913
the forerunner of the CIA,

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.214
doing stuff like this.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:56.616
Also in that conflict

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:58.050
and the Mossad

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.651
has a history

00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:00.853
of doing things of this type,

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:02.188
in various countries

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:02.989
around the world.

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:03.556
And, of course,

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:05.324
Iran is a prime target.

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:07.093
I, we know a lot about the,

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:07.460
you know,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.895
many of the nuclear scientists

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:10.396
who have been killed in Iran,

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.598
ostensibly by the Israelis,

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.634
that kind of operation

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:15.268
and the fact that

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.402
these things are continuing

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:17.136
and that there's such

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:19.071
a significant penetration

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.606
of IRGC security

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:21.541
at a guest house

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:22.241
that is frequented

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:23.876
by people like Hania.

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:25.711
that really shows that,

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:27.013
as Jeremy said,

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:28.648
there's a significant weakness

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:30.516
in their security apparatus.

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.018
And they,

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:33.085
you know, they really didn't

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:34.587
it didn't take care of things.

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:36.389
All right. Thank you very much.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.557
Colonel and Jeremy,

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:38.057
for that

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:39.392
incredible, insignificant

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:40.259
reporting on

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:41.994
that, assassination.
