00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
We have been trying for many,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.630
many weeks now to try to get into Gaza.

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:08.383
It has been impossible for us.

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:11.511
Up until Tuesday, we were able to travel

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.723
inside with some medical volunteers

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:17.559
who are working at a newly established,

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.393
newly built

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.770
field hospital that has been set up

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.731
by the United Arab Emirates

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.566
in the southern part of Gaza.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.608
As you know,

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:26.860
the southern part of Gaza

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.861
is now very much

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.821
the focus of Israel's

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.448
military operations.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.533
That is exacerbating

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.953
an already dire humanitarian catastrophe

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.414
and leading to record numbers

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.249
of civilian casualties.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.754
As we saw for ourselves,

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.380
you don't have to search

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.382
for tragedy in Gaza.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.760
It finds you on every street

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.094
strewn with trash

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.637
and stagnant water,

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:57.223
desolate and foreboding.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.017
So we've just crossed the border

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.643
into southern Gaza.

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:01.811
This is the first time

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:05.315
we've actually been able to get to Gaza

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.108
since October 7th.

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:07.692
And we

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:10.737
are now driving to a field hospital

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:14.240
that has been set up by the U.S.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.742
Up until now, Israel

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:16.242
and Egypt

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.243
have made access

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.828
for international journalists

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:20.705
next to impossible.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:22.540
And you can see why.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.875
Since October 7th,

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:24.542
the Israeli

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.879
military says that it has hit Gaza

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:32.258
with more than 22,000 strikes that

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:35.178
by far surpasses anything we've seen

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:36.471
in modern warfare

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:39.224
in terms of intensity and ferocity.

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:40.058
And we really,

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:41.101
honestly are just

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:44.104
getting a glimpse of it here.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.731
Despite Israel's heavy bombardment,

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:50.276
there are people out on the streets.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.570
A crowd outside a bakery.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.405
Where else can they go?

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:57.408
Nowhere is safe in Gaza.

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:00.036
Used to be a stadium.

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:02.622
Arriving at the Emirati Field hospital,

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:05.875
we meet Dr. Abdullah al Naqvi.

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.418
No sooner does our tour

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:11.756
begin when our ambulances.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.341
The battery life.

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:14.592
And this is what you hear

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:18.263
all the time now. Yes.

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.765
At least 20 times a day.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:21.808
At least 20 times.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:22.934
A day, maybe more.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:25.019
Sometimes

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.856
I think we refuse to it.

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:28.356
One thing

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:31.025
none of the doctors here have got used to

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:32.569
is the number of children

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.154
they are treating.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:34.696
The U.N.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:35.405
estimates that

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.574
some two thirds of those killed

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.284
in this round of the conflict

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.120
have been women and children.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.205
Eight year old Jinan was lucky enough

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:47.208
to survive a strike on her family home

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:48.918
that crushed her femur

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:51.462
but spared her immediate family.

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:55.425
She was shocked to hear no morphine.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.801
She says she's not in pain.

00:02:56.801 --> 00:03:01.347
So that's how I feel. That's what I.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:02.682
Her mother, Hiba, was

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.685
out when it happened.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.021
I went to the hospital,

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.356
she says, And I came here

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.400
and I found her here.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.735
The doctors told me

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.195
what happened with her,

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.156
and I made sure that she's okay.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:29.709
When she got,

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:32.420
I was sitting next to my grandfather,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.255
and my grandfather held me,

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.090
and my uncle was fine.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.676
So he is the one who took us out

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:41.304
that don't cry.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:41.804
But Dr.

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:45.266
Ahmed al Mazrui says it is hard not to.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:49.938
I work with all the people like I,

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.024
but the children.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:57.153
Something that changed.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.529
Touches your heart

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:01.741
and tests your faith in humanity.

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:03.785
As we leave Jinan, Dr.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.036
Al Naqvi comes back

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.704
with the news of casualties

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:07.997
arriving from the strike

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:11.000
just 10 minutes earlier.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:13.253
So just because they wouldn't send

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.131
snow to the that young

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.968
man from that.

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.094
Just from the

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.387
course of we just saw from the bomb,

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.014
we just heard. That is my understanding.

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:28.935
They will arrive to over two days to.

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:30.520
A man and a 13 year

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.438
old boy are wheeled in

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.398
both missing

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:37.235
limbs, both in a perilous state.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.237
With much less imagination.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.154
What's your name?

00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:41.072
What's your name?

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:43.157
The doctor asks.

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:45.159
Next, the notes provided by

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.162
the paramedics are smeared with blood,

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:53.251
a tourniquet improvised with a bandage.

00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:55.336
Since the field hospital opened

00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:57.046
less than two weeks ago,

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:59.799
but has been inundated with patients,

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.802
130 of their 100

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.430
beds are already full.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.806
So let me understand this.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:07.598
You are now

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:09.976
basically the only hospital around

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.894
that still has some beds.

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:13.187
I guess. Yes.

00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:14.564
Or maybe I'm very short of that

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.357
because they are telling me

00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:17.525
one of the hospitals

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.444
with a capacity of 200

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:20.778
and they are accommodating

00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:22.405
1000 right now.

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:23.406
And the next door

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.532
hospital, I'm not very sure.

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:27.535
They say like 50 to 200000,

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.330
maybe 400 to 500 patients.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.623
So when he called me,

00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:33.166
he said they have

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.209
the three patients in each bid.

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:36.419
Please take any of them.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.421
Send as many as you can.

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:41.090
I mean, we've been here 15 minutes.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.967
And this. Is already worse.

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:44.677
This is what you hear.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:47.680
You see.

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:50.808
In every bed another gut punch.

00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:52.769
Less than two years old,

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.354
Amir still doesn't know

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.106
that his parents and siblings were killed

00:05:57.106 --> 00:05:59.108
in the strike that disfigured him

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:00.943
and embarrassed of mother.

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:02.320
Yesterday, he saw a nurse

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.863
that looked like his father.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.032
His aunt, Inaaya tells us

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.325
he kept screaming.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.578
Dad, Dad! Dad.

00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:12.497
Amir is still too young

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:18.503
to comprehend the horror all around him.

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:19.337
But 20 year

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:22.340
old Lama understands it all too well.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:23.883
Ten weeks ago,

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:24.717
she was studying

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:26.844
engineering at university

00:06:26.844 --> 00:06:29.847
and helping to plan her sister's wedding.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:30.473
Today,

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:31.599
she is recovering

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.435
from the amputation of her right leg.

00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:36.187
Her family followed Israeli

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.438
military orders

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:39.941
and fled from the north to the south.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.442
But the house where they were seeking

00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:44.237
shelter was hit in a strike

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.905
by the Muslim and National.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.698
The world isn't listening to us,

00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:48.825
she says.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.535
Nobody cares about us.

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:53.413
We have been dying for over 60 days,

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.123
dying from the bombing,

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.959
and nobody did anything.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.919
Words of condemnation

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.923
delivered in a thin grass

00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:04.507
today.

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.259
But does anyone here.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.718
Even tell us?

00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:10.721
Like Grozny, Aleppo and Mariupol.

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.223
Gaza will go down

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.933
as one of the great horrors

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.602
of modern warfare.

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:17.979
It's getting dark.

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.481
Time for us to leave.

00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:21.399
A privilege

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:25.194
the vast majority of Gazans do not have.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.405
Our brief glimpse from a window

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:30.867
on to hell is ending as a new chapter

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:34.162
in this ugly conflict unfolds.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:37.457
All the help is needed.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.667
Now, the death toll in Gaza

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:41.711
as a result of Israel's

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:43.087
frenzied bombardment

00:07:43.087 --> 00:07:46.466
currently hovers at roughly 18,000.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.926
If you do the math, extrapolating

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:49.635
as the U.N.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:52.722
says, that two thirds of the casualties

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:53.931
roughly, are civilians.

00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:57.435
That is about 11,800

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.520
civilians who have been killed

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.022
in just over two months.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.065
To give you a comparison.

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:05.818
In the first year of the US

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:08.821
invasion of Iraq in 2003,

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.448
according to an independent

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.158
research organization,

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:15.453
some 7700 civilians

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:19.582
were killed by US forces in 20 years

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.042
in Afghanistan,

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.211
according to independent research groups.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:26.422
Some 12,000 civilians were killed.

00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:28.883
So in just two months

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:31.511
you're now approaching 12,000 civilians.

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:32.845
And that's the same amount

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.139
who were killed in 20 years

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:37.683
during the US war in Afghanistan.

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:39.977
So this is truly staggering

00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:41.729
and unprecedented.

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:43.189
PHIL Erica.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.025
US It's an extraordinarily powerful piece

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.068
because you're

00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:48.277
taking us one in

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:50.655
and two to the personal stories.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:51.781
I think I've been just difficult

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:52.990
to some degree to come by

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.158
because of the conflict

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:55.743
and the type of conflict this has been.

00:08:55.743 --> 00:08:56.369
Your reference

00:08:56.369 --> 00:09:00.248
in the piece to Grozny, Aleppo, Mariupol.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.166
You've covered so many conflict zones.

00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:03.000
You've covered

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.169
some of the worst conflicts

00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:05.711
that have happened

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:06.879
in the last several decades,

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.172
if not longer.

00:09:08.172 --> 00:09:12.927
How would you compare this to us looking?

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:13.970
It's always difficult

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.097
to compare conflicts,

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:19.058
but I would just say it is so striking

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.936
that the people of Gaza have nowhere

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.939
they can go, have nowhere that is safe.

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:27.525
They are literally being told to move

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:28.276
from the north.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:29.443
As the north gets bombed,

00:09:29.443 --> 00:09:30.653
they move to the south

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.113
and the south gets bombed.

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:32.905
Now they're expected

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.865
to move to a different area

00:09:34.865 --> 00:09:37.577
in central Gaza. And let's be very clear.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.121
It is not easy to move around right now

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:40.663
in Gaza.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:43.708
We saw almost no cars on the streets.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.418
People do not have fuel.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:48.337
People are afraid to try to make road

00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:50.381
runs because of the risks

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:51.591
that that incurs.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.300
And so,

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.426
of course,

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:56.053
you are seeing a horrific impact,

00:09:56.053 --> 00:09:57.221
not just in terms

00:09:57.221 --> 00:09:58.514
of the civilian casualties

00:09:58.514 --> 00:09:59.515
that we talked about,

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:02.059
but in terms of the humanitarian crisis.

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:04.061
You're talking about malnutrition.

00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:04.812
You're talking about

00:10:04.812 --> 00:10:07.064
the spread of preventable diseases.

00:10:07.064 --> 00:10:08.316
We talked to the doctors

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:08.774
who said that

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:10.985
they're treating cases of sepsis

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.070
and patients are nearly dying

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.904
where these should be

00:10:13.904 --> 00:10:16.490
straightforward operations

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.658
that can't be performed.

00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:19.327
They described one incident

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.370
where a man had worms

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.414
in a wound on his head

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:23.998
because there

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:27.793
is such a lack of a sanitary

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:29.420
and sanitary environment

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.047
in which to perform surgeries

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.256
or operations.

00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:35.051
So this is a crisis of epic proportions.

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:36.010
And the fact that

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.887
humanitarian aid workers

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.890
do not have the access that they need

00:10:40.931 --> 00:10:43.017
just makes it all the more staggering.

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:44.018
One extra point

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:45.645
that I really need to make here, Phil,

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.229
because I think it's important.

00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:48.606
This was our first time

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:51.192
being able to gain access into Gaza,

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.235
but the journalists in Gaza

00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:58.532
have been doing heroic

00:10:58.616 --> 00:10:59.742
work.

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:02.912
They have paid such a high price for that

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:04.955
deadliest conflict for journalists

00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:06.999
that we have seen in decades.

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:10.252
More than 60 journalists in Gaza alone

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:11.587
have been killed

00:11:11.587 --> 00:11:13.297
in the last two and a half months.

00:11:13.297 --> 00:11:15.007
That is according to the Committee

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:16.300
to Protect Journalists.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.511
So you have a perfect storm here

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.388
with massive bombardment,

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:22.181
an inability to create safe

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:23.516
zones, an inability

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.309
to get humanitarian access

00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:26.727
where it's needed,

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:29.021
and incredibly brave journalists

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:30.189
who are doing everything

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:31.190
they can

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.358
to tell the stories

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:34.568
and bring the reality to the world.

00:11:34.568 --> 00:11:36.070
But the frustrating

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.488
of international journalists

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:38.698
who can't get in

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.032
to try to complement

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:41.867
and supplement their efforts.

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.828
It is it is remarkable and such an.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:44.704
Important picture

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.997
that you paint of all of those challenges

00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:48.374
in this moment.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.291
I was struck by

00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.835
in that field hospital,

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:51.877
so much of what we've talked about

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:52.753
has been

00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:53.379
what is needed

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.463
in terms of medical supplies.

00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:55.965
As you just pointed out,

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.758
and what that can mean,

00:11:57.758 --> 00:11:58.884
but also the electricity.

00:11:58.884 --> 00:11:59.176
And there was

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:00.803
much talk about fuel in the beginning

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:01.512
and fuel being needed

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:03.264
to run generators at hospitals.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:05.558
How that field hospital that you were at,

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.309
how was it able to operate

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:08.686
and to run some of those machines?

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:12.648
And is it at risk?

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:13.315
So, Erica,

00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:14.066
because that

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:16.110
field hospital is operated

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.361
by the Emirates

00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:18.571
and because the Emirates

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.865
have a normalized relationship

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:22.283
with Israel,

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:25.286
they are able to get supplies

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.456
in, get fuel in in a way that the vast

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:31.417
majority of hospitals in Gaza are not.

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:34.712
And even they face very real challenges,

00:12:34.795 --> 00:12:37.673
endless bureaucracy, onerous waits

00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:38.716
at the border,

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.926
trying to get those supplies in.

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:43.888
But what the doctor said is

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:45.765
Gaza and hospitals are referring

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:46.515
their patients

00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:48.726
to the Emirati field hospital.

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.019
They're coming in

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:52.646
in a very bad state of shape.

00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:54.774
They don't have proper tourniquets even,

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.150
which are a crucial thing

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.777
in terms of stopping the bleeding.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:00.321
They don't have proper painkillers.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.363
The doctor told us

00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:01.864
they're needing

00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:03.657
to give vast doses

00:13:03.657 --> 00:13:04.617
of painkillers

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:05.117
to people

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:06.702
who are in extraordinary

00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:08.746
amounts of excruciating pain

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:10.456
because these hospitals have just

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:11.874
had to ration

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:14.668
whatever minimal supplies they have.

00:13:14.668 --> 00:13:15.586
Also, this field

00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:18.130
hospital is very close to that border

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.048
with Egypt.

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:19.715
And so

00:13:19.715 --> 00:13:21.967
really, they are not a microcosm

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.636
and they should not give you

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:24.804
any reflection

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:25.179
or idea

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:28.182
of what those Gaza hospitals look like.

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:30.643
They are a sort of island,

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.353
and that is why they are getting

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.646
so many referrals

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.231
from these other hospitals

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:35.940
that are

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.608
teetering on the brink of collapse.

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:37.983
In fact,

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:40.778
many of them just had simply collapsed

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:41.862
and are therefore trying

00:13:41.862 --> 00:13:43.781
to refer as many patients

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.157
to this field hospital

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:47.952
as perfect as possible to try to get them

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:52.039
some modicum of decent care.

00:13:52.122 --> 00:13:54.750
I will continue to be struck by the line.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.377
No one's listening.

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:57.753
It seems like every patient either

00:13:57.753 --> 00:13:59.588
wanted to say or was saying to you.

00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:02.049
Clarissa Ward It's remarkable work.

00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:02.675
And to your point,

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.301
there are dozens of journalists

00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:05.261
on the ground there

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.971
that have lost their lives covering this.

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:07.513
There are dozens

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:08.681
still there covering it

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.933
every day of lost family members

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:11.809
and your work coming in

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.018
and supplementing that

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:14.728
and adding to it is incredibly important.

00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:16.188
We appreciate your time, as always.

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:16.605
Thank you.
