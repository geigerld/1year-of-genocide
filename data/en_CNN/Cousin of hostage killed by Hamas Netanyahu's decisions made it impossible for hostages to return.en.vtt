00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.334
Now, the cousin of

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.103
Carmel Gat one of the hostages

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:05.105
found dead in Gaza on Saturday.

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.840
Penned an emotional tribute

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.708
to her on Sunday.

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:10.343
Gil Dickman posted on IG

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:12.145
saying sorry, I'm

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.346
sorry we didn't stop

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:14.647
when it was still possible.

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.983
Sorry we let them kill you.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:17.617
He also said

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:19.619
I wish you saw how your friends

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.755
fought to bring you back alive.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:22.622
You also wrote that

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:24.090
I wish that in your memory,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.392
thousands would come out

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.559
to demonstrate tonight,

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.828
just as I would have done

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.730
as you would have done.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.765
40 year old Gat

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:32.632
was taken hostage

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:34.267
by Hamas on October 7th

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:37.103
while staying at her parents home.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.172
And Gil Dickman

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:42.208
joins me now live from Tel Aviv.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.245
Thank you so much for your time.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.547
And can I first begin by saying

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.116
how sorry I am, Gil, for your loss

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:53.420
and sorry too, for the suffering

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.953
that your family

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:54.988
has been through for the past

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.756
11 months, only for it to end this way.

00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:58.958
Yeah.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.160
Thank you very, very much.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.162
we can't really believe

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.229
that this is how it ends.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.199
We didn't want it to end like this one.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.600
And another ending for this

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.102
horrible story.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.503
You know,

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:11.971
if Carmel wasn't

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.706
the only hostage from the family.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.708
Her mother was murdered on October

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.544
7th by the terrorists

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:19.546
and her sister in law.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.482
Yeah.
Then Ramon was also taken hostage,

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.384
and she was returned.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.952
She was brought back home

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:28.088
on the 54th day of the war,

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.722
thanks to a ceasefire

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.759
that was signed between Israel and Hamas.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.762
And we really hope that

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.530
a very similar ceasefire

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.433
would be signed between the two sides.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.103
But we found out that it was very,

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:43.536
very hard

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.606
to bring the two sides to sign the deal.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:48.641
Hamas is a terror organization.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.978
I have no expectations from this horrible

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.781
that this horrible figure

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.549
you have seen while to sign the deal

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.318
that will actually

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:00.353
bring my my cousin home.

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:02.155
But we know that

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.224
Hamas has agreed to a deal at some point,

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:06.092
and Israel was the one

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:07.927
putting on more and more terms

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.996
and actually postponing the deal.

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:10.763
And right now,

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.031
we know that the decisions

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.000
that our Prime Minister Netanyahu,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.601
is made

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.637
made it impossible for Carmel

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.472
and other hostages to return

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.808
and put their lives in grave danger.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.777
And that's what killed them.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:27.981
Hamas has said that the hostages

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:28.748
would be alive

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:29.949
if it weren't for the actions

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.851
of the Israeli government.

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.786
Who do you blame Gil

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:36.789
for the deaths of Carmel?

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:41.528
This blame game is a game to me.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.831
And when I'm here for life and death,

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:45.999
no game.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.434
It's both sides are to blame.

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:49.536
It's first of all,

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:51.437
that terror organization who took her

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:52.839
and all of the hostages.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:53.940
They shouldn't have taken her.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.278
She is an innocent and decent civilian,

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.580
and she wasn't supposed to be taken

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.115
in the first place.

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.616
A 40 year old woman

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.718
not related in any way

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:06.986
to not to the army

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.321
and not to anything else.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:09.856
She was supposed to be at home

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.024
with her family,

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.126
and she was taken just like

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:15.728
kids and and other innocent

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:16.763
people were taken

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:20.400
and I blame, of course they blame Hamas.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.803
And I also blame my government because

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.306
these are these are the

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.674
people that

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:31.044
should be in charge of the security

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.446
and the peace of,

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:35.748
of of people in Israel.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:36.816
These are the people

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:37.684
that were supposed

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:39.252
to be responsible

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.554
for the life of people here,

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:42.755
and they were responsible

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:44.924
for the lives of all the hostages.

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:47.026
And they decided cold bloodedly

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:49.362
they voted just a few days ago

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:53.299
that the Philadelphia, the border between

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.301
Gaza and Egypt

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.869
is more important

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.072
than the lives of the hostages.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:02.008
And that means that our government

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.811
decided that they're willing to sacrifice

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.446
the lives of the hostages.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.714
They all voted.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:09.983
The cabinet voted for it.

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:11.584
And we were shocked.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:12.919
And we said, me

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.587
and my sister and all my family

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:15.588
and all the families

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:16.956
of all the hostages, we said,

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:18.791
this is crossing the red line.

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:19.993
And that would mean

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:21.995
the death of hostages.

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:23.696
And saying this.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.032
I did not know how true it will be

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:27.600
and how specific and personal

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.636
it is going to become.

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:32.639
And and it was mainly

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.706
because been anyone else,

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:34.741
but it was Kamel,

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:37.176
and the lives of all the other hostages

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.344
are still in danger.

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:40.213
So we must act now.

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:41.180
The Israeli government

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.482
and the Israeli people,

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.050
these are the people chose to act.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.486
They came out to the streets last night,

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.855
and they're out in the streets right now.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:50.323
And it's very moving.

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:51.924
I'm sorry that we had to go

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:52.659
through this

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.327
horrible, horrible situation

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.762
in order for them to get out,

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:56.496
but they did.

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.631
And I really hope that the government,

00:04:58.631 --> 00:04:59.399
our government,

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.967
will make the right decision

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.202
and push for a deal

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:04.437
that'll bring the hostages home.

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:05.638
It's been too long.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:06.506
And and that was

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:07.507
what you were calling for

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:09.142
in your tribute to Kamal Gil.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.411
You what?
You are calling on people to come out

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.945
and demonstrate in her memory.

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:14.147
And they have done that.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.282
We've seen tens of thousands

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.483
and people take to the streets.

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:19.452
We're reporting on nationwide

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:21.754
protests, nationwide strike today.

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:24.624
Do you feel that this is a turning

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:25.825
point we're witnessing here?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.262
I really hope that this is

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:31.130
the turning point, or a breaking point

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.101
or some kind of a change in reality,

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.570
which may be maybe

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.237
help the government

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:39.739
make the right decision.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:40.473
But if

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:43.676
if it's just a one time thing, it's

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:46.479
it was supposed to be the largest protest

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.580
or demonstration

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.815
in the history of Israel.

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:50.283
This is very moving,

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:52.518
and I know that Kamal can see this,

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.953
but I know that's exactly what

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:55.088
you would have wanted

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:56.622
for people to come out.

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:57.757
And so

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.058
to demand the release

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:00.360
of the other hostages,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.494
it's too late for her,

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.363
but it's not too late for them.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.898
And I hope that they're not

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:06.499
the government

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.668
is not just going to look away

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:10.937
and to choose death over life,

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.405
because this is not what we believe

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:13.239
here in Israel,

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:14.741
and that's not what we believe

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:16.376
this war is about.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.412
You know, you're giving a lot of airtime

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:20.380
to this war

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.647
because of things that are going on

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:23.015
on both sides of the border.

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:25.451
People think it's Israel versus Palestine

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:27.019
or Jews versus Muslims.

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:30.123
This is and has always been a fight

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:31.891
between people who believe in life

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.159
and who choose life,

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.861
and who choose a ceasefire.

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:36.629
They'll bring the hostages home

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.865
over the people who believe in death

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:39.999
and choose death.

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:42.402
And they know that the organization

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.603
that kidnaped Kamal

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:46.539
and that murdered her mother chose death.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.641
They believe that death is sacred.

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:50.410
But I can't believe,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.711
I still can't believe that

00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:53.312
my government chose death.

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:55.915
And I urge you, Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.283
choose life.

00:06:57.283 --> 00:07:00.253
Please sign the deal, seal the deal,

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.320
go to ceasefire

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.522
and save the hostages that

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:03.389
you can still save

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.892
you.
I understand that

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:06.926
you, your family,

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.896
had a chance to speak to the president

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:10.897
over the weekend,

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:12.131
that he reached out to

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:14.500
you and wanted to to talk,

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.935
but you refused.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.136
Why did you do that?

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:17.804
And what is

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:19.939
what do you make of Benjamin

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.942
Netanyahu's actions in all of this?

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.745
Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:26.879
has made it public

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.048
that he's going to approach the families

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:30.650
in order to speak to them.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.753
Then he decided that he gave us

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:35.655
the message that he wants to speak to us.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:38.558
We don't want to be a part of this media

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:41.561
circus of the prime Minister Netanyahu,

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:45.331
who is now using the murder of the

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:48.334
of the hostages in order to justify

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:50.036
staying there

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:51.571
and not getting out

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:53.206
and going to to a cease fire

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.340
and signing a deal,

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.008
which is unbelievable to me.

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:58.277
He's trying to use this to say,

00:07:58.277 --> 00:07:59.912
if you murdered the hostages,

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.514
you don't want to deal.

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.983
And I didn't want to take part in this.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.751
We didn't want to take part in this.

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:06.953
The family comments.

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:08.087
Family believe

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:11.090
that the Prime Minister of Israel is

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:13.359
responsible for her death.

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:16.429
He is her killer.

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:17.597
That's the fact.

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:19.365
He didn't pull the trigger,

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:20.867
but he left her there

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:24.103
knowing that that means she sees

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.706
life, danger, death, danger,

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:29.208
and knowing these risks.

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:32.211
This is actually it's killing.

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:35.281
And we we don't want to talk to him.

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:38.284
And we I don't feel like

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:40.520
he he could be convinced

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.989
by a conversation. Heart to heart.

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:43.823
I spoke to him.

00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:44.891
I saw him

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:48.928
and how he reacted to two hostages

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:50.630
who came back from captivity

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.531
and spoke about what

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.266
they went through there.

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:55.601
It doesn't look like it moved him.

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:56.602
I don't feel like

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:57.970
his heart is open

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.805
to this kind of conversation.

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.607
I think we only understand

00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:03.276
the language of politics.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:05.077
That's maybe something that happens to

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:05.478
you after

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:08.915
so many, so many years in your job.

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:11.083
Everything becomes politics.

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.018
Even the life

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:15.021
and death of people becomes pure,

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:16.188
pure math

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:18.991
of whether it would bring me more support

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:20.393
or less support

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.562
would let him stay in power

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.063
or lose power.

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:26.332
And if that's what it is,

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:27.433
then that's the language

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:28.634
that we should speak to him.

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:30.503
We must go out to the streets

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.872
and protest in our democratic way.

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:35.441
And this is not an anti-Israeli thing

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:36.108
to do.

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:37.443
The exact opposite.

00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:39.478
This is the most Israeli thing to do.

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:42.148
We came out with Israeli flags

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:44.350
and with hostages, yellow flags

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.186
to tell him the Democratic thing to do.

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:48.955
If you want to stay in power,

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:51.958
if you want to have any legitimacy

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:55.361
to act in our name, save their lives

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:56.562
and sign the deal now.
