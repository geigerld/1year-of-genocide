00:00:07.851 --> 00:00:09.052
how does this activity that

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:09.853
we're now seeing from your

00:00:10.854 --> 00:00:12.856
Cara, not far from gaza, how

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:14.858
does this activity for us --

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:16.860
compared to what we have seen

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.929
over the past few nights.

00:00:20.196 --> 00:00:22.866
&gt;&gt; Wolf, the past few nights

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.868
it's not been as intense as

00:00:25.068 --> 00:00:26.002
this, we have not seen this

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.871
level of illumination, we've

00:00:28.137 --> 00:00:30.073
occasionally seen flares with

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.840
--

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:33.877
heavy debt to nations but as I

00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:34.878
look, there another missile,

00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:36.079
not sure what kind of missile

00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:37.881
it, was literally right from

00:00:38.147 --> 00:00:38.882
the start --

00:00:42.886 --> 00:00:44.888
these --
seem to be slightly smaller

00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:46.890
missiles, but the area here

00:00:47.156 --> 00:00:48.892
that's being illuminated by the

00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:50.026
flares is much bigger than

00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:50.960
we've seen recently.

00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:53.029
You just saw a flash come out

00:00:53.897 --> 00:00:54.898
there, I just saw on other

00:00:54.964 --> 00:00:56.900
missile come down and impact on

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.600
the ground.

00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:59.903
Possibly the way that the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.905
trajectory of that missile is

00:01:02.038 --> 00:01:02.906
possibly, coming from a

00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:03.907
helicopter, it's just not

00:01:04.107 --> 00:01:05.909
possible for us to say

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:06.475
precisely at the moment.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.913
There is a clear focus of fire,

00:01:10.113 --> 00:01:12.115
here this firepower and the

00:01:12.382 --> 00:01:14.918
illumination being fought on

00:01:15.184 --> 00:01:16.920
the edge of what we estimate to

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:18.988
be gaza city, I just saw a

00:01:19.255 --> 00:01:20.924
rocket fly to the right out of

00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:22.926
gaza, we watched the right

00:01:22.992 --> 00:01:23.492
towards --

00:01:23.927 --> 00:01:26.930
to see if there's any

00:01:27.063 --> 00:01:27.931
interceptions from I am bone,

00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:28.932
but there's a red tracer

00:01:29.065 --> 00:01:30.934
fearless really flying from

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.935
gaza to the right.

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:33.002
This is normally from our

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:34.938
experience here been Iraq it's

00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:35.939
coming out of gaza.

00:01:36.072 --> 00:01:37.941
I don't see any interceptions,

00:01:38.207 --> 00:01:40.009
I'm hearing interceptions, I'm

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:42.946
seeing the flashes from

00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:43.546
interception to missiles being

00:01:43.947 --> 00:01:45.949
fired out.
While this is going on, here it

00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:46.950
is clear to me from where I

00:01:47.216 --> 00:01:49.953
stand right now that hamas, or

00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:50.954
one of the other groups is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.956
firing rockets out of gaza even

00:01:53.022 --> 00:01:54.958
while they run this heavy fire

00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:57.961
right now, I heard at least two

00:01:58.094 --> 00:01:59.963
detonations from the iron dome

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:02.966
interceptor missile shield from

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:03.967
systems that are slightly to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.969
the north of us here,

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:06.970
intercepting those rockets

00:02:07.103 --> 00:02:07.971
flying out of the city.

00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:10.974
What this tells us right now is

00:02:11.107 --> 00:02:13.977
the battle is having an intense

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.979
moment, the troops are trying

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:17.981
to engage with hamas, as they

00:02:18.247 --> 00:02:20.984
try to have illumination,, they

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.986
try to use this light to get

00:02:23.052 --> 00:02:25.989
their way more safely into

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:26.990
combat with hamas.

00:02:27.123 --> 00:02:30.994
Hamas of course, hamas is

00:02:30.994 --> 00:02:32.996
fighting on its own territory,

00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:34.998
it has set, trumps it knows

00:02:35.064 --> 00:02:37.000
words tunnels are, it knows how

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:40.003
it can try to leak idf troops

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.004
entice them into a certain

00:02:41.137 --> 00:02:42.005
neighborhood so that they can

00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:44.007
bring fire to bear on them.

00:02:44.073 --> 00:02:46.009
All of this illumination here

00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:48.011
will give the idf troops on the

00:02:48.077 --> 00:02:50.146
ground, better visibility of

00:02:50.413 --> 00:02:51.214
the threats that are white.

00:02:52.015 --> 00:02:53.082
Them it won't mitigate against

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.018
him, Taliban it is an attempt

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.020
for them it appears to be able

00:02:57.086 --> 00:02:59.022
to at this moment penetrate

00:02:59.022 --> 00:03:02.025
some neighborhoods that until

00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:04.027
15 minutes ago were in complete

00:03:04.027 --> 00:03:04.527
darkness.

00:03:05.028 --> 00:03:06.029
You're just seeing another

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:07.697
flash of light on the ground

00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:09.032
there as something has

00:03:09.098 --> 00:03:09.598
detonated.

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:12.035
I'm watching another rocket

00:03:12.035 --> 00:03:14.037
system in multiple parts of

00:03:14.037 --> 00:03:15.038
second one coming down there

00:03:15.104 --> 00:03:16.039
into the city.

00:03:16.706 --> 00:03:19.042
It is this fire that is very

00:03:19.108 --> 00:03:20.043
concentrated, another rocket

00:03:20.243 --> 00:03:22.045
just came down, I'm seeing the

00:03:22.178 --> 00:03:24.047
arc of the tracers after it.

00:03:24.714 --> 00:03:27.050
This is a very intense amount

00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:29.052
of firepower that's going down

00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:31.054
on this confined location here

00:03:31.187 --> 00:03:31.687
wolf.

00:03:33.056 --> 00:03:34.057
Surprising, almost surprising

00:03:34.657 --> 00:03:37.060
that hamas was able to fire out

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.527
Iraq at there.

00:03:37.527 --> 00:03:39.062
I'm seeing flashes off to the

00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:41.064
north which is a hit to me,

00:03:41.064 --> 00:03:43.066
interceptors have been fired

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:45.068
from iron don't up there again,

00:03:45.068 --> 00:03:46.069
possibly another intercepting

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.072
anr rocket.
You're seeing the flares --

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.075
were watching flares that are

00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:55.078
dropped over gaza, you will see

00:03:55.078 --> 00:03:57.080
one flare drop to flares, maybe

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.081
create --

00:03:58.081 --> 00:03:59.082
and it will go to darkness.

00:03:59.682 --> 00:04:01.084
This is different.

00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:03.753
This is flare after flare after

00:04:04.087 --> 00:04:05.755
flare, illuminating this area

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:08.091
now for, we're looking at

00:04:08.157 --> 00:04:12.095
perhaps 15 minutes now wolf.

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:13.096
&gt;&gt;

00:04:15.098 --> 00:04:16.365
Just to remind our viewers of

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.101
what we're seeing, this is our

00:04:18.367 --> 00:04:20.103
camera instead wrote, just

00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:20.736
outside of gaza.

00:04:21.104 --> 00:04:23.106
We're seeing these live cameras,

00:04:23.172 --> 00:04:25.108
a massive Israeli airstrike

00:04:25.308 --> 00:04:26.109
campaign underway right now

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:28.177
towards various targets in

00:04:29.112 --> 00:04:30.113
northern gaza, as we can see

00:04:30.313 --> 00:04:30.813
right there.

00:04:31.114 --> 00:04:33.116
You see all the smoke, you see

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:34.117
the rockets coming down.

00:04:34.317 --> 00:04:37.120
This is a major new development.

00:04:37.186 --> 00:04:39.122
We also saw some rockets coming

00:04:39.388 --> 00:04:40.123
in from gaza towards Israel

00:04:40.323 --> 00:04:42.125
that appear to have been

00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:43.192
intercepted by Israel's iron

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:43.959
dome.

00:04:45.128 --> 00:04:46.128
System.

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:47.130
But, we are seeing this very

00:04:47.396 --> 00:04:49.132
intense system, Nick, standby

00:04:49.332 --> 00:04:49.832
for a minute.

00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:51.134
You are not too far away from

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.135
all this drama that is

00:04:52.268 --> 00:04:54.137
unfolding, it seems like a

00:04:54.403 --> 00:04:57.140
major new chapter in Israel's

00:04:58.141 --> 00:04:59.142
air campaign against hamas

00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:00.143
targets in gaza.

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:02.145
Ben wedeman, you know gaza

00:05:02.278 --> 00:05:02.612
well.

00:05:02.612 --> 00:05:03.146
You've been there.

00:05:03.412 --> 00:05:04.147
I've been there as well.

00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:06.215
But tell us a little, I know

00:05:06.482 --> 00:05:07.150
you are in Beirut right now,

00:05:07.283 --> 00:05:09.152
when you see these live

00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:10.153
pictures coming in of this

00:05:11.354 --> 00:05:12.155
massive Israeli air strike

00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:14.157
assault on northern gaza right

00:05:14.157 --> 00:05:15.558
now, what do you think?

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.163
&gt;&gt; Well, what I'm thinking is

00:05:20.163 --> 00:05:21.364
from looking at the pictures,

00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:24.167
Nick is in sderot, which

00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:26.169
overlooks a fairly open area

00:05:26.235 --> 00:05:27.837
that goes to the edge of the

00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:30.173
populated parts of northern

00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:30.640
gaza.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.175
That seems to be where much of

00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:35.178
this fire, the flares, are

00:05:35.578 --> 00:05:36.179
being focused.

00:05:37.847 --> 00:05:39.182
Obviously they are trying to

00:05:39.182 --> 00:05:40.183
make sure that those areas are

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.583
clear.

00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:42.185
But after those areas, you

00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:44.187
start getting into the very

00:05:44.187 --> 00:05:48.191
crowded urban parts of the gaza

00:05:48.257 --> 00:05:48.658
strip.

00:05:48.658 --> 00:05:51.194
The suburbs of gaza city.

00:05:51.194 --> 00:05:53.196
That's WHE there is going to

00:05:53.196 --> 00:05:54.864
be a real danger of high

00:05:55.198 --> 00:05:56.199
civilian casualties.

00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:59.202
Nick was quoting the Israeli

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:01.204
authorities, talking about

00:06:01.204 --> 00:06:02.872
precision strikes, precise

00:06:03.206 --> 00:06:03.706
information.

00:06:03.806 --> 00:06:06.209
But what we know is that

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:08.211
oftentimes, it's not as precise

00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:09.212
as it could be or should be.

00:06:10.213 --> 00:06:11.214
And already, what we've seen is

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.216
the death toll in gaza well

00:06:14.217 --> 00:06:15.218
over 9000 at this point.

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:18.221
So, as they move forward into

00:06:18.221 --> 00:06:21.224
this populated area, the death

00:06:21.224 --> 00:06:22.225
toll is likely to soar.

00:06:22.358 --> 00:06:24.894
Not just that, what we've seen

00:06:25.228 --> 00:06:27.230
is in the days since the ground

00:06:27.697 --> 00:06:29.232
incursion began on Friday, is

00:06:29.232 --> 00:06:32.235
that hamas is using maximum

00:06:33.236 --> 00:06:35.238
advantage its knowledge of the

00:06:35.238 --> 00:06:35.738
terrain.

00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:38.241
It's tunnels that it has been

00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:39.842
built, and booby traps, and

00:06:40.243 --> 00:06:40.843
whatnot.

00:06:40.843 --> 00:06:42.245
And therefore, this is going to

00:06:42.378 --> 00:06:44.847
be a very bloody fight all

00:06:45.248 --> 00:06:45.915
around.

00:06:45.915 --> 00:06:47.850
For civilians, for the Israeli

00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:51.254
military, for hamas and this is

00:06:51.254 --> 00:06:53.256
probably going to be a very

00:06:53.322 --> 00:06:54.257
long and difficult battle.

00:06:55.925 --> 00:06:57.260
Street by street, house by

00:06:57.326 --> 00:06:59.262
house, perhaps even room by

00:06:59.595 --> 00:07:00.095
room.

00:07:00.263 --> 00:07:02.265
But clearly, just looking at

00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:04.267
these pictures, they are laying

00:07:04.867 --> 00:07:07.270
down smoke, flares, there's

00:07:07.536 --> 00:07:08.036
incoming --

00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:09.272
looks like artillery.

00:07:10.273 --> 00:07:10.740
I'm just looking at the

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.240
pictures now.

00:07:11.874 --> 00:07:13.876
Artillery, rockets, and

00:07:14.277 --> 00:07:15.278
obviously there are ground

00:07:15.544 --> 00:07:16.279
troops in there as well.

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.281
Certainly, in all of my time of

00:07:18.414 --> 00:07:20.283
watching Israeli military

00:07:20.283 --> 00:07:22.285
action going into gaza, this

00:07:22.285 --> 00:07:24.287
looks like the most intense

00:07:24.287 --> 00:07:25.288
I've ever seen, wolf.

00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:28.291
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're making a very

00:07:29.292 --> 00:07:30.293
important point, this is a very

00:07:30.359 --> 00:07:32.862
in tense air assault on

00:07:33.296 --> 00:07:35.298
northern gaza right now not far

00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:38.301
away from sderot, Israel, where

00:07:38.334 --> 00:07:39.302
nic Robertson is just north of

00:07:39.402 --> 00:07:40.303
Israel right now.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.806
You see these rockets coming in,

00:07:44.307 --> 00:07:45.308
pounding and pouncing when

00:07:45.408 --> 00:07:46.309
Israel has undertaken a massive

00:07:46.475 --> 00:07:48.311
air assault like this it sets

00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:50.313
the stage for a ground invasion,

00:07:50.413 --> 00:07:51.948
that is about to come in, I

00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:53.316
suspect that's what's going to

00:07:53.316 --> 00:07:54.317
happen in this part of gaza as

00:07:54.483 --> 00:07:57.320
well as Israeli ground to rips,

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.955
tax, artillery will move in

00:07:59.322 --> 00:08:00.890
after this area is pounded with

00:08:01.324 --> 00:08:02.325
these heavy airstrikes that are

00:08:02.892 --> 00:08:03.392
ongoing right now.

00:08:03.426 --> 00:08:05.328
We are showing our viewers live

00:08:05.328 --> 00:08:06.963
pictures of what's going on in

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:07.830
gaza.

00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:09.332
[Sound of artillery]
It is really, really intense.

00:08:09.432 --> 00:08:11.901
Let's go back to Nick

00:08:12.335 --> 00:08:13.336
Robertson.
You are therein sderot, nic,

00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:14.337
you have a much better sense of

00:08:14.337 --> 00:08:14.837
what's going on.

00:08:14.904 --> 00:08:16.339
You say you've not seen

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:17.340
anything along these lines.

00:08:17.373 --> 00:08:18.975
Here comes some more rockets

00:08:19.342 --> 00:08:21.344
into gaza from, presumably,

00:08:21.978 --> 00:08:23.346
Israeli planes flying overhead.

00:08:23.446 --> 00:08:25.348
Go ahead and give us your sense

00:08:25.348 --> 00:08:27.717
of the enormity of this

00:08:27.984 --> 00:08:28.484
development right now.

00:08:29.352 --> 00:08:33.389
&gt;&gt; Wolf, I'm standing right

00:08:33.656 --> 00:08:35.358
next to our camera man, John --

00:08:35.925 --> 00:08:37.994
who is filming this.

00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:41.364
We have a high vantage point

00:08:41.464 --> 00:08:42.365
overlooking gaza.

00:08:42.932 --> 00:08:44.934
It looks to us as if this is on

00:08:45.368 --> 00:08:47.370
the northern edge, towards gaza

00:08:47.403 --> 00:08:47.903
city.

00:08:47.937 --> 00:08:50.006
As Ben said, there is open

00:08:50.373 --> 00:08:52.008
ground from the border fence

00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:53.376
that you saw, or you're about

00:08:53.476 --> 00:08:54.010
to see.

00:08:54.377 --> 00:08:55.378
I'm seeing it in realtime.

00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:56.379
There's a delay.

00:08:57.013 --> 00:08:58.014
A big flash coming out from the

00:08:58.381 --> 00:08:59.382
epicenter of that smoke.

00:08:59.415 --> 00:09:01.951
This is the biggest, most

00:09:02.385 --> 00:09:03.386
sustained use of flares.

00:09:03.552 --> 00:09:05.388
It appears, smoke as well on

00:09:05.488 --> 00:09:05.955
the ground.

00:09:05.955 --> 00:09:07.390
We have seen, in recent days,

00:09:07.423 --> 00:09:08.958
at the beginning of the

00:09:09.392 --> 00:09:11.027
incursion, how the idf used

00:09:11.394 --> 00:09:12.895
heavy smoke to blanket the

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:13.896
area.

00:09:13.896 --> 00:09:15.398
This is a military tactic so

00:09:15.398 --> 00:09:17.400
that they can move in unseen.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.401
We are seeing it again now.

00:09:18.968 --> 00:09:20.403
We are seeing big flashes at

00:09:20.503 --> 00:09:21.437
the southern end of that smoke.

00:09:21.904 --> 00:09:23.906
And what the idf is describing,

00:09:24.407 --> 00:09:27.043
this evening, is a very new

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.910
situation for them.

00:09:27.977 --> 00:09:30.413
A much stronger situation for

00:09:30.579 --> 00:09:30.913
them.

00:09:30.913 --> 00:09:32.915
Whereby they say they have

00:09:33.416 --> 00:09:35.418
encircled entirely gaza city.

00:09:35.584 --> 00:09:37.119
If they have encircled gaza

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.525
city, as they say, potentially

00:09:42.792 --> 00:09:44.460
cut the north off, the north of

00:09:44.727 --> 00:09:45.795
gaza strip off from the south

00:09:46.062 --> 00:09:46.562
of gaza strip.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.465
Potentially, meaning the

00:09:49.732 --> 00:09:51.534
Israelis now are blocking any

00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:53.536
hamas in the north of the gaza

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.438
strip from escaping to the

00:09:55.671 --> 00:09:56.171
south.

00:09:57.873 --> 00:09:59.875
You are now watching a battle,

00:10:00.443 --> 00:10:01.444
in some, ways one of the team

00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:02.445
here was just talking about it.

00:10:02.878 --> 00:10:05.881
In some ways, it is sort of

00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:07.083
medieval in that it is

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.951
surrounding a city.

00:10:09.452 --> 00:10:10.453
You are seeing the smoke, and

00:10:10.453 --> 00:10:12.822
the flares, and the flash is

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:14.023
all coming from an area that is

00:10:14.457 --> 00:10:16.959
now constrained and contained

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.027
within idf forces.

00:10:18.461 --> 00:10:20.896
As Ben was saying, the civilian

00:10:21.464 --> 00:10:21.964
casualties on the ground,

00:10:22.898 --> 00:10:23.833
people have been told to get

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.101
out of the way, they don't know

00:10:25.468 --> 00:10:25.968
how to get out of the way.

00:10:26.469 --> 00:10:27.470
They are stuck in their houses,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.471
they are stuck in their homes.

00:10:29.105 --> 00:10:30.840
They are getting caught up and

00:10:31.107 --> 00:10:32.041
killed, in high numbers.

00:10:32.908 --> 00:10:33.476
During this operation.

00:10:33.976 --> 00:10:35.911
But what we are witnessing now,

00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:36.979
our efforts by the idf to

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.115
mitigate against casualties for

00:10:39.482 --> 00:10:39.982
their own forces.

00:10:40.483 --> 00:10:42.485
Because they are operating in

00:10:42.485 --> 00:10:43.119
hamas territory.

00:10:43.986 --> 00:10:45.855
Territory that the hamas troops,

00:10:46.122 --> 00:10:47.990
hamas fighters, have been able

00:10:48.491 --> 00:10:49.925
to potentially lay booby traps,

00:10:50.493 --> 00:10:51.127
have been able to set areas

00:10:51.494 --> 00:10:52.995
where they want to draw the

00:10:53.496 --> 00:10:55.064
Israeli troops into, so that

00:10:55.498 --> 00:10:56.999
they can use these armored

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.067
piercing rocket propelled

00:10:58.501 --> 00:10:59.001
grenades that they've been

00:10:59.502 --> 00:10:59.935
using.

00:10:59.935 --> 00:11:01.070
Effectively, against Israeli

00:11:01.504 --> 00:11:03.139
armored tanks, and armored

00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:04.073
fighting vehicles.

00:11:04.507 --> 00:11:06.008
So, this is --

00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:07.510
this battle, really, that we

00:11:07.676 --> 00:11:11.514
are seeing now, kicked off 20

00:11:11.547 --> 00:11:12.515
minutes ago now.

00:11:12.548 --> 00:11:13.048
20, 25 minutes ago.

00:11:15.518 --> 00:11:17.520
And it is intense in this area

00:11:17.553 --> 00:11:18.053
around gaza city.

00:11:18.521 --> 00:11:21.524
You continue to see the rockets

00:11:21.624 --> 00:11:23.526
come in from above, the flashes

00:11:23.626 --> 00:11:24.527
at the southern end of the

00:11:24.527 --> 00:11:25.027
city.

00:11:25.528 --> 00:11:27.530
Underneath this, we don't know

00:11:27.763 --> 00:11:30.533
how many idf forces are

00:11:30.633 --> 00:11:31.534
actually on the ground.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.536
The boom that you are hearing,

00:11:33.636 --> 00:11:34.537
that's artillery going off

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.070
behind me as well.

00:11:35.538 --> 00:11:37.540
It's probably what is causing

00:11:37.573 --> 00:11:38.641
the flashes that you may be

00:11:38.908 --> 00:11:40.543
seeing on the left of your

00:11:40.543 --> 00:11:41.043
picture.

00:11:41.544 --> 00:11:42.545
I saw another flash, there at

00:11:42.545 --> 00:11:43.546
the northern end of gaza strip,

00:11:43.646 --> 00:11:45.648
just now, that looks like

00:11:45.915 --> 00:11:47.550
something coming up out of

00:11:47.583 --> 00:11:48.083
gaza.

00:11:48.184 --> 00:11:50.553
A rocket that didn't go far,

00:11:51.187 --> 00:11:51.687
perhaps it fell short.

00:11:52.555 --> 00:11:53.656
But anything that comes up from

00:11:53.923 --> 00:11:57.560
the ground is most likely, from

00:11:57.593 --> 00:11:58.561
a center, that's mostly fired

00:11:58.727 --> 00:12:00.563
up by hamas or another group

00:12:00.729 --> 00:12:01.564
inside of gaza.

00:12:01.597 --> 00:12:02.565
Anything that is coming out of

00:12:02.665 --> 00:12:04.567
the sky like this, rocket right
