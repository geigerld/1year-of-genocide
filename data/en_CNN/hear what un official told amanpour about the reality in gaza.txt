JUST SAID THAT YOU HAVE NOTIFIED THE ISRAELIS AND THEY KNOW VERY WELL THESE LOCATIONS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU BELIEVE, BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY, I'M AFRAID, CONTESTED TOPIC RIGHT NOW. WHY DO YOU THINK THESE CIVILIAN AREAS ARE BEING HIT. &gt;&gt; THE FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE IN OVERCROWDED AREAS, IN URBAN AREAS, WE KNOW THAT FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE IN GAZA CITY RIGHT NOW, BUT WE HAVE STILL, WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE STILL AROUND 3 TO 400,000 CIVILIANS IN THIS AREA, SO TO TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF THE JABALIA CAMP, IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST CROWDED CAMPS IN THE GAZA STRIP, BUT WE STILL BELIEVE THERE AROUND 40,000 PEOPLE REMAINING THERE. SO YES -- INCLUDING THE UNWASHED SCHOOL, UNFORTUNATELY, HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATELY ALSO HIT -- ARE MORE SAFE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU CATEGORIZE THIS, THEN? IS IT ACCIDENTAL? IS IT A WAR CRIME? IS IT DELIBERATELY NOT DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CIVILIANS AND HAMAS FIGHTERS? &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW, THERE IS A -- PROPORTIONALITY, AND ALSO OF DISTINCTION. WHEN I WAS BRIEFING THE SECURITY COUNCIL, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING KILLED SO FAR IS SO STAGGERING, THAT THIS CANNOT BE COLLATERAL ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; CAN I ASK YOU, BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING TO YOU, AND WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY, YOU HAVE BEEN INSIDE GAZA FOR THE FIT TIME SINCE OCTOBER 7TH, YOU'VE CALLED IT, I BELIEVE, THIS MOST SAD DAY IN ALL YOUR HUMANITARIAN WORK? TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT? &gt;&gt; I WAS FIRST TO GAZA 30 YEARS AGO. GAZA IS A SOCIETY I KNOW VERY WELL, IT WAS A VIBRANT SOCIETY. IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY SAD, BECAUSE I VISITED THE SCHOOL, AN OVERCROWDED SCHOOL, SHELTERING THOUSANDS OF DISPLACED PEOPLE, AND BASICALLY THE ONLY ASK THAT PEOPLE HAD AT THAT TIME WAS GIVEE WATER, PLEASE GIVE ME A LOAF OF BREAD, AND LATER ON, I WAS TALKING TO MY STAFF AND GAZA, AND THEY WERE CONFIRMING THAT TODAY THE GAZA STRIP IS RUNNING OUT OF EVERYTHING, RUNNING OUT OF FUEL, RUNNING OF FUEL, FOOD, RUNNING OUT OF MEDICINE, AND THE MARKET IS COMPLETELY DEPLETED. IT'S EXTREMELY SAD TO SEE HOW MUCH NOW THE POPULATION IS COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT -- DEPENDENT ON INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY -- WHICH IS NOT IN POSITION ANYMORE TO DELIVER AT THE SCOPE WHAT THEY NEED. WHAT I SEE RIGHT NOW IS I AN ENTIRE POPULATION BEING MOVED TO THE SOUTH, AND WHICH BASICALLY HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AVAILABLE. MANY OF THEM LEFT WITH VERY LITTLE THINGS. AND THEY ARRIVED IN THE SOUTH, WHICH IS COMPLETELY OVERCROWDED, TWICE AS POPULATION NOW, NO MARKET, NO GOODS AVAILABLE ANYMORE, AT THE MARKETS, SERVICES ARE COLLAPSING, AND THEY ALL DEPEND ON US RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; SO DO YOU UNDERSTAND, AND DO YOU ACCEPT, WHAT WE SAW, WERE INSTANCES OF LOOTING, AND THE INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITIES SAID THAT THE SOCIAL FABRIC IS STARTING TO BREAK DOWN IN GAZA. &gt;&gt; THE SOCIAL FABRIC IS INDEED BREAKING DOWN, THE CIVIL ORDER IS BREAKING DOWN, AND I UNDERSTAND, YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, QUEUING IN FRONT OF BAKERIES NOWADAYS, JUST WITH THE HOPE TO GET A LOAF OF BREAD, AND WE ARE NOW PUT IN SITUATIONS WHERE IT IS BECOMING ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO OFF OF BREAD FROM THE BAKERY THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING, TO BRING BACK TO OUR SHELTER, JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE 100 OF OTHER PEOPLE EXPRESSING THEIR HUNGER IN FRONT OF THIS BAKERY, AND I UNDERSTAND ALSO THAT THIS HUNGER IS TURNING INTO ANGER AND WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND -- AND THE UNWASHED IS THIS FACE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, IN THE GAZA STRIP. &gt;&gt; EVEN DESPITE WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS A HUMANITARIAN TRICKLE, I'M CALLING IT A TRICKLE, YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS, WHAT'S COMING THROUGH RAFAH? &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHRISTIANE, WE NEED MUCH, MUCH MORE. BEFORE OCTOBER SEVEN, THERE WAS AN AVERAGE OF 500 TRUCKS INTO GAZA, AND THIS WAS ALREADY DESCRIBED AS BEING A BLOCKADES, AND YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR THE POPULATION OF GAZA STARTED TO BECOME MORE DEPENDENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN COMMUNITY. WE WERE, FOR EXAMPLE, PROVIDING 50% OF THE CALORIC NEED OF 1.2 MILLION PEOPLE BEFORE THAT. TODAY, AFTER AN ALMOST TOTAL SIEGE, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A HANDFUL OF TRUCKS COMING IN TO THE GAZA STRIP AT A TIME WHEN THE MARKET IS ALSO COMPLETELY DEPLETED, AT A TIME WHEN THE LAST REMAINING PUBLIC SERVICES HAS COMPLETELY COLLAPSED. SO YES, THIS HANDFUL OF TRUCKS, BASICALLY DON'T DO ANYTHING TO REVERSE THE FACT THAT GAZA, THE GAZA STRIP, IS BEING STRANGLED BY THE SIEGE. &gt;&gt; FELIPE, CAN I ASK YOU THIS, THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OVER FUEL, FOR INSTANCE. AND REPORTS CITING ALL SORTS OF, ISRAELI, WESTERN, OTHERS, MIDDLE EASTERN, THEN OVER THE YEARS HAMAS HAS STORED AND HOARDED ALL THAT IT NEEDS IN ITS UNDERGROUND TUNNELS, WHERE THERE'S FOOD, MEDICINE, FUEL, FOR ITS WAR EFFORT. AND THAT IT COULD HAVE ENOUGH TO FIGHT FOR 3 TO 4 MONTHS. GAZA IS A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE AND WHEN HE WENT 30 YEARS AGO. OF WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE HAMAS AUTHORITIES, VIS-Ã€-VIS TAKING CARE OF CIVILIAN NEEDS? &gt;&gt; SO LISTEN, WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS, NO ONE RIGHT NOW IS TAKEN CARE OF THE CIVILIAN NEEDS. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUEL, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT HAS THE MILITARY BEEN BUILDING UP OF THE HAMAS, IN THE GAZA STRIP, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE AS AN ROY R. RESERVE A FUEL HAS COMPLETELY DEPLETED, AND WE ARE LOOKING AT WHERE AND WHAT OTHER FUEL IS AVAILABLE IN THE GAZA STRIP. THERE'S -- COMMERCIAL FUEL, THAT WAS AVAILABLE, AND THERE WAS ALSO FUEL THAT WAS BROUGHT IN BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, TO SUPPLY THE ELECTRIC PLANT. OVER THE LAST WEEK WE HAVE CONFLICTION WITH THE ISRAELI -- THEY'RE REMAINING FUEL, THE REMAINING COMMERCIALUEL, WHICH WAS AVAILABLE IN THE GAZA STRIP, WHICH MEANS, IN THE COMING DAYS WE WON'T BE ABLE ANYMORE TO SUPPLY BAKERIES, SUPPLY HOSPITALS, SUPPLY THE WATER STATION, BUT IN THE COMING DAYS WE MIGHT EVEN BE UNABLE TO MOVE OUR TRUCKS WITHIN THE GAZA STRIP, TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO 700,000 PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE, SHELTERING IN OUR PREMISES, BUT ALSO TO THE REST OF THE POPULATION. &gt;&gt; I HAVE TO SAY, IT STRUCK WITH ME WHAT YOU SAID AT THE BEGINNING, WITH ALL THE CHILDREN WERE ASKING YOU FOR ANSWERS OF WATER AND A PIECE OF BREAD. IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR THAT. AND ALSO YOU, YOURSELF, AS UNWRAP, HAVE LOSUR DOZENS OF WORKERS TELL ME WHAT'S THE SITUATIOTH YOUR OWN EMPLOYEES ON THE GROUND? &gt;&gt; WE HAVE LOST, AS OF NOW, 72 STAFF. THE LAST STAFF I JUST HEARD WAS DISABLED STAFFER, SHE WAS DOING COATING, WE ONE YEAR AGO PUBLISHED A VIDEO ABOUT WHAT SHE WAS DOING VERY PROUD OF, AND SHE'S THE LAST PERSON REPORTED KILLED AMONG 72 PEOPLE. I MET THE STAFF YESTERDAY IN GAZA, BASICALLY THEY ARE SHARING THE SAME DIFFICULTIES AS ANYONE. THEY WERE LIVING IN SHELTER, THEY'RE STRUGGLING ON A DAILY BASIS TO FIND BREATH, TO FIND WATER, TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN, AND DESPITE THAT, AND DESPITE THE HEAVY LOSSES WITHIN THIS ORGANIZATION, THEY REMAIN COMMITTED TO DO WHATEVER IS POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE PEOPLE IN GAZA. BUT IT'S A CONSTANT DAILY STRUGGLE, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT I TAKE A LOT OF INSPIRATION IN THE STRENGTHS AND THE DEDICATION. &gt;&gt; WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER WITHDRAWING STAFF, JUST LIKE SOME WOUNDED PALESTINIANS ARE BEING EVACUATED? DUAL NATIONALS ARE BEING ALLOWED TO LEAVE. &gt;&gt; WE ARE -- SCALING UP OUR OPERATION, I HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR WE, NEED TO SCALE OUR OPERATION, WE SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT 50, 60, 70, TRUCKS. THIS OPERATION NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT UP AT SCALE, IF WE WANT TO RESERVE AN ONGOING, CIVIL BREAKDOWN, BUT IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DO NOT START TO DIE BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF THE SIEGE, BECAUSE OF OUR DIFFICULTIES TO BRING OUR SUSTENANCE AT SCALE, TO THE GAZA STRIP. &gt;&gt; FELIPE, I WANT TO ASK YOU ATTACH A QUESTION. EVERYTHING IS DISPUTED, NUMBERS ARE DISPUTED, DEATH TOLLS, WHO'S A CIVILIAN, WHO'S A FIGHTER. THIS PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, IS A HAMAS-RUN AUTHORITY IN GAZA, AND THE OFFICIALS IN RAMALLAH, SAY THAT NOW OVER 9000 PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE THE WAR BEGAN, AFTER OCTOBER 7TH. I SPOKE TO FORMER ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER A HOOD ALMOST THIS WEEK. HE SAID THESE NUMBERS ARE EXAGGERATED, AND I QUOTED YOU, BASICALLY SAYING THAT IN THE PAST SIX CYCLES OF CONFLICT, HAMAS FIGURES HAD BEEN CONSIDERED CREDIBLE, BY ALL SIDES. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID. &gt;&gt; THE U.N. NUMBERS ARE AS CREDIBLE AS HAMAS NUMBERS. -- I DON'T TRUST YOU ARE NUMBERS, THEY ARE NOT RELIABLE. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE 72 STAFF MEMBERS OF ON WHAT ALL ARE RELIABLE, THEY HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED, THESE ARE OUR FIGURES, AND IF I COMPARE IT TO 72 WITH OUR 13,000 STAFF IN THE GAZA STRIP, WITH A 9000 BEING MINISTRY OF HEALTH, AND THE 2.2 MILLION INHABITANTS IN THE GAZA STRIP, WE HAVE MORE OR LESS THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF
