00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.502
Israel has struck a displacement camp

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:04.437
where civilians were sheltering,

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.906
killing at least 45 people in Rafah

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.208
in southern Gaza.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.209
That is according

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.744
to the Gaza Health Ministry.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.212
We must warn you

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:14.414
that you are about to see in

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.248
this segment is going

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:18.251
to be very difficult to watch

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.987
out.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.990
For.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.464
All these are

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.767
the scenes overnight of the camp in Rafah

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.536
set ablaze Israeli military claim

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:37.871
to CNN Hamas

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.106
officials were killed in the strike

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.742
with what they called precise munitions.

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:43.610
Local officials

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.678
say most of the casualties

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.480
were women and children.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.050
Now you can see the location of the camp

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.017
on this map,

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:52.018
and it's a reminder

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:53.253
that over a million

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:56.022
people have been sheltering in Rafah

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:56.689
as the war

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.691
forced people further south,

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.560
though many have fled yet again

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.127
as Israel

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.897
ramps up the operations in that area.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.899
The strike came just two days

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.834
after the International Court of Justice

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:08.668
ordered Israel

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:10.603
to halt its offensive in Rafah.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.005
On Sunday, Hamas fired

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.773
rockets at Tel Aviv,

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:16.409
the first attack of its kind into Israel

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.644
since January.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.611
CNN's Not Bashir

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.313
Following developments for us,

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:21.981
he's standing by in London,

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.751
but a distressing video out of Rafah.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:25.518
A lot of that video

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:27.153
we actually cannot share

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:29.289
because it is so disturbing.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.290
Help us understand the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.758
impacts of this strike.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:33.827
Well, a colony,

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:34.160
as you

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.728
mentioned, many of those

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.497
who were sheltering in this

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.765
Talal Sultan neighborhood

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.533
in Rafah have been displaced.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.302
Time and time again,

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:43.970
they have been pushed south

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.005
into the southern city of Rafah

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.941
by the Israeli military, told

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.843
that this would be a safe zone.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.144
And in fact, over the last month,

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:52.812
we have been hearing warnings

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:53.580
from the IDF

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.614
telling civilians now

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.616
to evacuate parts of Rafah

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.719
to Gaza's coastal area for their safety

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:00.320
and protection,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.589
ahead of a looming

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.457
full scale ground operation.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.226
This was not one of those areas.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.060
This was not an area

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.461
that received an evacuation order.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.997
This was supposed to be a safe zone

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:11.698
for civilians.

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:13.433
Clearly, that is not the case.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.368
And seen this incident overnight.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:17.570
Airstrikes targeting an area

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.404
that is densely

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.807
populated by civilians filled with tents,

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.675
makeshift tents sheltering civilians.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:23.643
And we have seen

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.446
graphic, disturbing, horrifying video

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.781
emerging from the scene last night.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:31.818
Tents completely engulfed in flames,

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:32.986
charred bodies

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.687
being pulled from the burning

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:35.388
shelters,

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.423
including the bodies of children.

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:38.324
Now, as we have heard

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:38.892
from the

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:40.126
health authorities in Gaza,

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:41.327
the majority of those casualties

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.562
were women and children.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:45.098
More than 240 people have

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:47.800
so far said to have been badly wounded

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.234
and injured.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:50.170
We've heard from health authorities

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.504
saying they simply do not have

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:52.805
the capacity

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:55.408
in the remaining hospitals in the area

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:58.244
to care for that number of casualties.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.279
So this is an overall

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.281
disastrous situation

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.349
for many of those civilians

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.785
in the southern city of Rafah.

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:07.187
Huge amount of concern.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:07.487
Of course,

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:08.521
we've been hearing widespread

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.323
condemnation and warnings

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.292
against further military action in Rafah.

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:13.159
Clearly,

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.628
those warnings have not been heeded. So,

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:17.797
yeah, and

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:18.231
you know

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.033
what is, of course, you know,

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.534
getting a lot of attention as well.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:21.968
Is this

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:25.038
just a few days after the ICJ ruling

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.241
for Israel to halt operations in Rafah?

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:31.411
We have seen some reaction, firstly,

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:32.245
to whether Israel

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:34.547
is going to be adhering to that ruling

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:35.181
and of course,

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:37.317
the criticism of the way that Israel

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:39.619
is conducting this operation in Rafah.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.221
What more do we know?

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:41.888
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.523
We've been hearing fierce criticism,

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:45.391
of course, from European leaders.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:46.659
We heard earlier this morning

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.728
from the EU's foreign affairs chief,

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:49.429
Josep Borrell,

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:50.263
saying that Israel

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:53.333
must adhere to the ICJ ruling that

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.335
it must immediately halt

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.237
military operations in Rafah.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.571
We've heard from the German

00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.239
foreign minister

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.306
saying earlier today

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:01.174
that the international Court

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.275
of Justice order

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:02.809
for Israel

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.477
to halt its military operation

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:07.780
in the southern Gaza City is binding

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.349
and has to be followed.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.750
And in fact, President Macron.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.253
France has also issued a statement.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.988
He said that he was outraged

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.156
by last night's attack on Rafah,

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.992
that these operations must stop.

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.127
There are no safe areas in there

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:23.062
for Palestinian civilians.

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:24.364
I call for full respect

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.665
for international law

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.867
and for an immediate ceasefire.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:28.368
And of course,

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:29.869
there is huge amount of concern

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:30.637
around the potential

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:33.139
for further military action in Rafah.

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.674
We've had previously from one of Israel's

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:37.010
closest allies, the Biden administration,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.910
President Biden himself

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.245
speaking to CNN, saying

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:40.713
that if Israel were

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:43.016
to fully go into Rafah, than the U.S.

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:44.584
would not be able to support

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.085
in the form of arms

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:46.753
and weapons, that

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.154
that would not be the case.

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:49.055
It remains to be seen

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:51.057
whether this latest incident is in fact,

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.059
a red line for President Biden.

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.060
This has certainly drawn

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.495
outrage amongst many

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:56.663
in the international community,

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:57.664
particularly, of course,

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:58.731
from the United Nations,

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.199
which has repeated,

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.968
he warned, against a full operation

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:02.535
in Rafah

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:04.804
and continued airstrikes in Rafah.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.473
This is an area that is densely populated

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.475
still with civilians, the vast

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:11.811
majority internally displaced.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.546
And of course, there is simply nowhere

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:16.015
safe left for civilians to turn.

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:16.482
And of course,

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.317
there are questions around

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.618
how this will impact ongoing

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:20.019
ceasefire negotiations.

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.321
That is another point of concern.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.155
We heard today

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.256
from Qatar officials

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:24.157
saying that they are worried

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.491
that this could hinder

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:26.693
the ongoing discussions

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:27.694
around a potential truce

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:29.529
between Israel and Hamas. Only

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.298
that.

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:32.565
Nada.

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:33.199
Bashir, thank you

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.934
so much for that update.

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:36.536
Well, the Palestinian Authority

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.471
is calling on the United States

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:39.439
to put more pressure

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.607
on Israel to stop the violence

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:44.377
and said the US bears responsibility

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:47.046
for these crimes that shames humanity.

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:48.848
We have not heard from the Biden

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.183
administration yet

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.618
regarding the attack on the refugee camp.

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:54.287
Just a few weeks ago,

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:54.620
the US

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.189
president seemed to put forward

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.357
a red line

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.658
when it came to targeting

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:01.427
civilians in Rafah.

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:02.962
If I go into Rafah,

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:04.497
I'm not supplying the weapons

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:06.432
that have been used historically to deal

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.201
with a deal with the cities,

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.269
a deal with that problem.

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:10.970
We're going to continue

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.305
to make sure

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:15.108
Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:15.708
and their ability

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:17.076
to respond to attacks

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.778
that came out of

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:21.781
the and Middle East recently.

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:24.684
But it's it's just wrong.

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:25.518
We're not going to

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:27.286
we're not going to supply the weapons

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:28.721
and artillery shells used.

00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:32.492
Well, we are closely

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:33.559
following the response

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:34.360
from the Americans,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.495
and we will bring it to

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:36.963
you when we get us.
