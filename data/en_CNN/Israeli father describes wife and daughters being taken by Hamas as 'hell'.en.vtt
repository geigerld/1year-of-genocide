00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.625
One of the family

00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:03.712
members desperately holding out hope that
some of these hostages will be rescued

00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:04.963
is the only Asher.

00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:07.716
He is missing
his wife and his two young daughters.

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:09.759
They were taken
while visiting his mother in law.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.136
Near Gaza.

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:12.303
Our viewers will remember that

00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:15.515
we first spoke
to Yoni on the day of the Hamas attack,

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:19.561
just hours after he first saw his family
in this viral video.

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.437
Online.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.064
You can see a gunman
placing a cloth over his wife's head.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.484
His mother in law and his two daughters
are huddled in the back of the truck

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:28.278
after seeing this video.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.447
Yoni tried to track his wife's location.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.615
It said her phone was in Gaza.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.535
We have been checking in
with Yoni ever since then.

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.080
And I was able to meet him in person
over the weekend.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.875
Traveling to his home north of Tel Aviv.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.418
Here is our conversation

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:46.629
Well, Yoni,

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.966
the chance to see each other
and see you in person

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.387
How are you doing now?

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:56.973
Well,

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.186
eight days

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:04.355
since my wife and two
daughters got kidnaped

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:09.152
I am realizing that

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:10.820
I got to see

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.618
the gates of hell.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.537
I got to see how

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.248
Hill looks like

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.000
I don't know if there are

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.044
any more tears left in me,

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:29.589
but it became real.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.301
I became it became clear to me
that I saw her.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.513
I saw what her looks like. And,

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.390
you know, it's not only the phone call
that I got from my wife.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.141
10 a.m.

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.770
telling me that
they're entering the house shooting and

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.648
that we got disconnected.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:49.025
And it's not even the video.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.320
9 seconds long video, which I saw

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:55.323
my wife getting taken

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:57.450
with my two daughters,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.161
recognizing them just like that.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:05.542
After a few hours of nerve wracking time,
which I tried to get information,

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:08.086
the hell

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:11.089
was the images.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.258
I didn't watch them.

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:14.300
I heard.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.178
I understand very quickly

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:19.848
that when I saw that when I knew

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:24.310
that there is a possibility

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.896
that I get held by such.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.733
I don't know how to call

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:33.278
that they are held by them.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:40.285
It was even worse than the video

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.745
because you think about what I mean
in every moment.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.666
I don't know what they're going
I only saw them kidnaped.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.669
I only saw them
get in on some kind of vehicle.

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:54.007
You can see from that video,
it's really familiar.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:58.303
My wife getting covered by her head,
Alawite, were screaming all around that.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:01.472
That was the image I saw last Saturday,

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:03.766
seven of October.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.812
And I tell you,

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:10.565
I don't know if I can explain yet.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.652
But like I said, I don't know

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:18.615
if you ever thought about it,
but sometimes we think,

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.160
what is the apocalypse scenario
or what is that

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.330
what hell looks like

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:31.044
when I saw the images there in

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.758
every minute is forever.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.384
Well, you're living it

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.844
forever.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.306
You mean what have you heard about them?

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:46.184
Is the government are they updating you?

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.560
Are they telling you anything

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.606
about what they're doing
or where they think they may be?

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.024
I mean, even things like

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:55.985
are they even able to tell you
whether they think they're there together?

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:58.071
Well,

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:04.327
you know,
there is the channel that the authorities

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:08.831
are in contact with me

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:14.128
but as you know,
these things are not simple.

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:17.715
They're sometimes
can be extremely complicated.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.260
I'm not diplomacy.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.763
I have no diplomacy or security training.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.015
I have no understanding
in this kind of matters.

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.226
It's not my area.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.436
But they are in touch with me.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:33.690
And I only know what I knew last Saturday.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.234
That's the only thing I knew.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:39.445
And I live here in uncertainty and it's

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:43.616
I'm hanging between the earth and heaven.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:48.246
And I move in between the desperation
sometimes hope.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.999
But I don't know

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.542
I know the time is critical.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.043
I know they they need medicine.

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:55.878
I know they have babies.

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:58.172
My little baby
daughter of five is not yet three.

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.967
In January, she will be three the same.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.845
In the same month,
the same month, January.

00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:07.348
Also, my older brothers will be five.

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:10.727
They are celebrated together
in the same month.

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:13.980
They are good friends.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.024
They love each other.

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.234
I hope that they are alive
and they are well.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:21.362
And I hope that they are
take care of each other

00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:24.615
with their mother.

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:27.327
What happened to this house?

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:29.704
How it became

00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:33.583
a media and an office to save them.

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:35.168
I just want them to be here

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.423
I can start to explain to you what

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.926
smart, beautiful girls they are.

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.722
I can't even start We sit here.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:50.892
I think that you sit here.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:55.063
This is you have so many visions
of when you and Jerome

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.857
may be in the kitchen and they were here
where they were playing.

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:01.235
This is their special area.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.280
But they know area.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.407
I don't allow myself to know

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.535
I have.

00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:14.248
I can't profound in this visions.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:18.127
I want to remember
the sound of their voice,

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:20.421
the smell of their hair.

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.049
But it's hard.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:25.510
I know that I have to be strong for them.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.223
I can't look at a video of them.

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:32.183
Not even one.

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:35.186
I know that
many videos were published by us.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:39.148
Me and my family and friends who are
helping me I didn't watch single one.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:42.068
Go through your phone and watch.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.736
I can't.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:46.781
You asked me about

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:50.535
the last few days.

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:51.285
Something.

00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:55.415
It was something that
the body and the mind is very hard to.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:07:00.044
I don't have any psychology training also,
but I guess it's

00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:04.298
something that takes the spirit
out of the body of something because

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:06.676
there is a

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:11.472
I can't I can't even process

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:16.394
You wanted us to look at their shoes

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.315
why their shoes, Yoni?

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:24.569
How, you know, they are currently girls.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.696
They they like shoes.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:27.447
I see pink.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.408
They like are willing to wear
only dresses.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.494
So it's you need to convince them

00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:37.081
to wear a shirt and pants and dresses.

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:40.626
Yes, they like they like girly stuff

00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:45.798
making us food in this toy
kitchen, bringing me that food.

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:46.132
Thank you.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.595
I can
talk with you about it right now with

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:54.557
I guess

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:58.352
something happened to the mind
and spirit in situation like this.

00:07:58.352 --> 00:08:00.730
And for me anyway,

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:03.900
and your wife,

00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:05.234
you know,

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.946
you must be thinking of her

00:08:08.946 --> 00:08:12.617
and how strong she is.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.036
She is.

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:15.786
She's.

00:08:15.786 --> 00:08:19.332
You know,
since I have two little daughters,

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:22.835
I learned that
what is the power of of a woman?

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:26.506
What is how strong a woman is

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.052
a lot more than us men.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:31.928
You know,

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.223
she sacrificed so much.

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.517
It took us three years
to bring to the world.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.477
Was her older

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:43.481
my first born? Yes.

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:47.443
Women

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:49.779
are strong.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.950
And my wife
particularly, it's a very strong person.

00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:57.286
But the situation is impossible

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.580
and the uncertainties are there

00:09:00.581 --> 00:09:04.418
are there things you think about in your
head or things you you would say to her

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:06.504
can only imagine?

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:08.005
There are things now that you say, ah,

00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:10.424
if I if I could say them
or if I could talk to her

00:09:10.424 --> 00:09:14.428
now, if I could have said
you said anything you would

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.056
you want to say to her right now
that I'm sorry

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.395
I'm sorry

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:27.775
sorry that I never not always

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:30.611
appreciated her

00:09:32.363 --> 00:09:33.781
and I and I did.

00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:37.285
But, you know, in these moments,
you think about all the times

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:42.039
before you were on the phone or busy,
the girls would say, to me, Daddy, come

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:44.917
sit with the the wife, my wife, the wrong

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:53.593
um, I just wanted her to know
that I love her with all of my heart.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.845
And I'm sorry

00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:58.347
and you know, the worst thing as a father

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.726
or have three girls, wife,

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:04.520
two little babies is killed

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:07.732
is this give life.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:11.485
Why are you not coming to get us?

00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:14.113
I thinking about them. Sit there.

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:19.827
Maybe if they're alive and thinking why is
that is not coming and it can.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.830
I want to

00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:27.918
I pray that they will forgive me, but

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:31.756
they were recognized.

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.133
You know, for children, it's a day.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:35.885
It's like a month for us. And those.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:38.179
Oh, they will remember you

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.599
I want

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.604
I will be in their mind

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:50.107
like they are in my mind.

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:55.571
I have to be strong for them.
