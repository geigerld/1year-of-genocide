00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.968
As there is breaking news tonight

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:03.203
about two hostages

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.972
being freed from Hamas by Hamas.

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:06.806
Other families

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.975
are watching this news tonight with hope.

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:10.510
It has been two weeks

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.178
since Omer Shem Tov said

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.180
parents have seen their son,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.750
a 21 year old, which was with his friends

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.351
at the Noah Music Festival

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.620
when Hamas attacked on that day.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.788
Amir was eventually

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:22.889
handcuffed, placed

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.491
in the back of a pickup truck

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:25.825
and kidnaped.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:26.593
That morning

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:27.694
was the last time

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.896
that Amir's family heard his voice,

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:34.701
as he called them frantic and terrified.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:35.035
Phone.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.103
Phone call to another phone call.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.205
You sound much more panicked,

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.307
much more hysteric.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.443
And even then,

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.778
one of the phone calls say

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:46.312
that they are running away.

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:47.914
They are carrying a lot of friends,

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:48.982
but they start to run.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.484
So they he lost some of his friends.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.553
And while he was running,

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.587
he's saying that

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.056
they are shooting all over.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.591
And he say that even see some dying

00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:59.826
people.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:00.660
And I love you.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.429
I love you

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.897
from you must have been so panicked

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.432
to hear your 21 year old son

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.867
telling you it's not just rockets,

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:09.235
it's there's gunfire.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.004
People are running and being killed.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.439
Yes. Yes.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.973
It was like

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.609
we could understand from his voice

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.011
that this is something

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.080
that we could not understand,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.916
even what he's experienced over there.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.884
He told me he was panicked.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.086
He was afraid.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.755
He said that they got into the car

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:32.992
and they're trying to escape from there.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.794
My daughter and

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.630
I told him, send us a live location.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.299
He said, Alive location.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.669
And then the phone was stopped.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.638
And then we started to see that

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:49.342
the the the point is moving like

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.145
not in the right way, Not coming home.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.913
Not coming home at all.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:57.350
It's it's moving to the border.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.586
And my daughter start to cry.

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:00.787
And she told us,

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.489
listen, it's it's not the way.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.490
It's not the way.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.861
And I called him to say,

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:10.430
Olmert, It's not the way.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.699
And

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.300
he didn't answer.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.668
The phone was ringing

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:19.539
and he didn't answer.

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.575
And then we saw that he's

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.711
getting into

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.613
who was behind the lot of it.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.448
It was the border.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:32.418
And then in the evening, we got the video

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.754
that was published by the Hamas,

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:37.957
that Omer, who is

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.559
he's a hostage, is over there.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.562
We saw we saw Omer and Croft in a

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.230
in the back of pickup.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.599
We think he's handcuffed in a truck. Yes.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.201
With his friend.

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:49.769
There were alive

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:50.870
there was no blood

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.906
or something on his glove.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:57.443
And and that's was the only

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.945
the only

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:02.115
single signal that we got for him.

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:04.551
And it's been

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:05.385
almost two weeks.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.853
Tomorrow have been two weeks.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:07.587
I mean,

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:08.555
what have these two weeks

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.558
been like for both of you?

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:12.091
We didn't.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.860
We are not sleeping.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.362
We.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.064
We are not eating.

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:20.767
We

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.101
all of of

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:24.537
of the things that we are doing now.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:25.672
It's just

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:30.510
to to to shout all over the world

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:34.647
our pain

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.349
that

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.918
no mother in, in all over

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:41.254
the world needs to feel like mother

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:42.488
and father needs to feel

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:45.258
like we are feeling. Now

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.093
imagine that

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:50.830
your son is going to a party

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:54.100
and the next day

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.501
people

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:58.137
murders, kidnaped him

00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:59.372
and, you know, know

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:02.775
if he's eating, sleeping,

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:06.746
if they are beating him.

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:07.880
The basic

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.252
thing of the mother is to

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:15.755
protect, to protect

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:17.824
her son.

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:20.827
And I cannot protect my son.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.528
And

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:24.731
it's driving me crazy.

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.299
And

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:29.602
it's I'm talking not only

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:33.239
for myself, I'm talking

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:35.341
for a lot of families.

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:39.212
You must understand that

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.815
people were in the safe place.

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.917
Their whole

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:47.520
their were sitting, eating breakfast.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.056
Some of them was sleeping.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:53.493
And then these terrorists came in

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:57.363
through their house and murder

00:04:57.363 --> 00:05:00.633
and took them from their house,

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:01.601
from the place

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:05.171
that it's the most safe place.

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:08.141
And they took him babies,

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.843
children,

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:12.145
teenage

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:15.481
mothers, fathers,

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:17.350
grandmothers.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.653
And he's he's 21, but he's your baby.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.255
I mean, what is what's he like?

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:23.589
What's his personality?

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:24.924
What is he

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:25.391
you were saying

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:26.025
he kisses you

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:28.561
three times on the cheeks all the time.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:29.696
Are you the amazing guy?

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:31.197
He's a party guy.

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:33.299
He's by himself.

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:36.302
He's a deejay and he likes very much

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:38.404
all these kind of festival

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:39.706
music festivals.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.941
So that's Omer.

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:43.810
Very, very happy guy.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.280
Very happy, very funny, funny, very cool.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.881
He marries.

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:49.749
So cute.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:54.020
We call him Sunshine because they

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.121
like the sunshine.

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:58.725
Everybody wants to be next next to him.

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.860
The last time Amir's family saw

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.796
him was at Shabbat dinner two weeks ago.

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:05.498
He was there like he always is.

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:07.200
He's always the life of the party.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.103
As they talked about his big personality.

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.170
And that night was the night

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.773
that he went to the Nova Music Festival.

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.041
The next time his parents heard from

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.175
him was in a series

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:17.377
of panicked phone calls.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.511
The next day,

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:19.779
when they realized that

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:20.847
the festival he was at

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:23.216
was being attacked by Hamas.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:26.285
The ceremony tonight in this huge table

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.121
that you see is for all the families

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:29.889
whose loved ones are being held

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.090
hostage tonight,

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.691
whose loved ones

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.960
won't be at Shabbat dinner tonight.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.228
And Amir's family is hoping

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.963
that he will be back

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:39.532
at their Shabbat dinner at their table

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:40.700
very soon.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.101
Can you show me the video

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:43.803
that you were showing me a moment ago?

00:06:43.803 --> 00:07:02.422
Yes.

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:12.365
I'm losing.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.400
And that was a picture of your family?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.001
Yes.

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:15.701
How many times

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.003
have you watched that video?

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:19.172
Oh, my God.

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:20.072
I saw it,

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:20.940
you know, at the beginning

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.442
when Dana posted.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.977
I saw it, I don't know, maybe 100 times.

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:27.246
And each time I'm crying

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:29.315
and I get very emotional.

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:30.783
Even now, when I see that,

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.452
you get very emotional.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.387
And also the song say

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:37.290
you're going to get out from this.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.692
Don't be afraid from here.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:42.061
Yes, you are going to get out of it.

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:43.429
If you could talk to him right now,

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:44.797
what would you say to him?

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:46.699
Come back. Enough's enough.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:47.700
You did enough trouble.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.037
Just come. Come back.

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:52.638
And

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:53.940
that I love him.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.608
That I miss him.

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:58.110
That I want every.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.278
Every day

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:02.815
when he is going, he is coming to

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:04.150
me, is telling.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.918
He's hugging me, telling me, Mom,

00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:07.286
I love you.

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:09.555
He's kissing me three times.

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:12.992
And he's going. So

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:17.797
I

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:20.466
hug the and

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:21.300
that's what I want

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.270
very much to walk him and smiling

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:25.471
for relief to hear

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:26.772
what the IDF said today

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:28.074
that they do believe

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:33.613
most of the hostages are still alive.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.682
You know, for us, it's a

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:40.086
it's give me some light.

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:43.990
But until we don't see them,

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:47.560
I want to say something about that.

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:50.096
My son have asthma.

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.931
He cannot breathe. Well.

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:55.835
And I also every day when I'm come,

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:59.705
when I'm waking up and I don't have

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:01.040
I cannot breathe.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.678
I'm taking my Valium

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:08.447
and I'm thinking about all

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:10.082
that is there.

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:12.118
And you've done this.

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:14.820
He's

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.456
whatever you call it.

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:20.459
And it's the minimum thing

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:24.997
that the monetary thing

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:27.733
that they need to do.

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:33.005
First of all, it's it's unbelievable

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:34.740
my to be there

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.311
for my own needs at that moment.

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:41.480
Has he ever left one of

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.615
his pylons

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:45.618
and all of this stuff again,

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:49.755
or the emotion that

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:50.489
it's all for?

00:09:50.489 --> 00:10:02.101
That is what the and I

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:03.269
want to thank Amir's

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.304
parents, Shelly and Marcus.

00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:06.439
They were so gracious

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.807
with their time today,

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.075
despite being so clearly

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:11.510
filled with grief for their missing son.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.145
These families are devastated.

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:13.779
Their lives

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:16.782
have been completely uprooted.

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:19.051
Amir stood at one point,

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:20.820
had a small smile on his face

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.253
when he told me

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:23.222
he can't wait for his son to come home

00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:24.924
so you can tell him to go and clean

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:26.659
his messy room.

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.628
My heart is heavy for them tonight

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:29.762
and for every family

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:30.930
who had an empty seat

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.264
at their Shabbat dinner table.
