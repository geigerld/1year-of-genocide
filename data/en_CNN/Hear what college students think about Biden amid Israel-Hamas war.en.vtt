00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
81.

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.201
Today, he

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.569
made a few jokes about his age

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.304
during the annual Thanksgiving turkey.

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.005
Pardon?

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:05.739
And late tonight,

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:06.873
this picture was posted

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.808
on the president's Instagram account.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.076
It's a birthday cake ablaze

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.745
with candles, the comment reads.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:12.746
Thanks for the birthday

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.247
well-wishes today, everyone.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:16.649
Turns out on your 146th birthday.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.053
You run out of space for candles.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.254
The White House tonight

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:22.188
leaning into

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.056
what is considered

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.124
one of Biden's biggest

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.326
political liabilities his age.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:26.893
Right now,

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:28.895
he is showing poorly in the polls,

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:30.397
particularly among younger voters.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:31.498
They backed him in 2020

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:33.033
by about 20 points.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.468
Polls now show that support collapsing.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:36.636
A new one from NBC

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:38.238
shows the former president,

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:39.873
the former president Donald Trump,

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.574
leading President Biden

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:46.079
46 to 42% among 18 to 34 year olds.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.014
What's more, 70% of young voters

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.516
disapprove of Biden's

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:52.085
handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:52.786
The White House press

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:53.586
secretary was asked

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:54.788
about that disapproval today

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:59.426
by our MJ Lee. This is what she said.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:00:59.826
But what

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:00.960
I'll be very clear about

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.394
is we

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.296
going to not going to govern by polls

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:03.630
here.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.332
We're going to our poll numbers.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.434
We're going to focus on delivering

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:08.334
for the American people.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:11.304
That's going to be our focus on the war.

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:12.105
And young voters

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:12.806
are the focus

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.007
of John King's latest

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.842
installment of his series for 360

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.010
All Over the Map.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.877
The series tracks

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:18.912
the presidential campaign

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:19.579
through the eyes

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.814
and experiences of voters

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.782
who live in key battleground states.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:23.783
Tonight,

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.319
Michigan and John King joins me here now.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.653
So, John,

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.687
what did you find out this time?

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:29.189
Look, imagine you're back in college,

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.091
you're 18 or 19, you're 20.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.625
81. Seems pretty old.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:33.827
And it's not just the number.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:34.928
They think he's just far away

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:35.829
from them on the issues.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:36.463
They think he doesn't

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:37.664
understand their issues,

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:38.364
even though he's tried

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.432
to do some things on college debt,

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.233
they think they don't get it.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.001
So age was an issue anyway

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:42.869
with this bedrock

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:43.970
piece of the Biden coalition.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.737
And now, John,

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:45.672
when you go to campus,

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:46.473
you see the protests

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.875
about the Israel-Hamas war on both sides.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:49.876
People raise questions

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:56.983
about how the president's handling it.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.084
Midterms are done.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.452
Final's just ahead.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.488
There is a rhythm to life on campus.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.723
And this fall, a raw divide.

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:04.757
I am an Israeli,

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.092
Jewish, Israeli American.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:07.560
My segment is a sophomore

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.329
at Wayne State in Michigan,

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.830
studying social work,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.098
chatting with friends here

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:13.066
at the Jewish campus

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.068
organization Hillel or Hillel

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.769
as a police officer down the hall.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.871
That's not normal.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:18.771
It is now.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.039
Siegman traveled to Washington

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.407
last week to join thousands

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.609
in support of Israel.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.944
Now back on a campus divided,

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.046
the divisions are very clear.

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:30.750
The tension on campus is very high.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.851
Wayne State spans

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:34.053
200 acres in downtown Detroit.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.221
Ibrahim Ghezzal

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:37.590
among the 24,000 students.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.459
I'm Muslim. I'm American.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.593
I'm Palestinian.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.362
Ghezzal calls anti-Semitism

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.130
horrible and disgusting.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.932
Do you feel the flip side of it,

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.635
or is there more of Islamophobia?

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.637
More Islamophobia? And people just say.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:53.173
I think it's I think it's

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.008
disgusting that

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:58.011
standing up for children dying

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:58.611
and women

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:01.214
dying and civilian infrastructure

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:02.615
being destroyed

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:05.618
is being compared to supporting Hamas.

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:06.786
I mean, holding up

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:07.921
a Palestinian flag

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.889
does not support Hamas.

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.191
Hamas has their own flag.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.792
Nobody's carrying their flag.

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.427
This coffee shop is in Dearborn,

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:15.895
where about half of the residents

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:17.630
are of Arab ancestry.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.365
Jocelyne, his friends say a president

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.301
they supported in 2020

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.536
is now greenlighting an Israeli response

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.071
they see as indiscriminate.

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:26.940
And I don't think our country

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.908
should fund that type of reaction.

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:31.644
You feel this way

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:32.712
To an extent, yes.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:35.014
I feel as though

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.817
President Biden doesn't value

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:42.622
my life as a muslim American

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.058
as much as he values other lives.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:45.592
Young voters

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:46.793
were a giant part of the Biden

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.228
2020 Coalition,

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.863
and this urban campus tilts deep blue.

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.166
If it's Biden Trump next November,

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.200
you would.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.867
I'd go Biden.

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:55.201
Some are.

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.936
Malkin is just 18,

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:59.672
a theater major, an E-sports enthusiast,

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.074
and an LGBTQ voter

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.308
who wishes President Biden

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.977
would yield to someone younger.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.478
I think that weird

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:06.980
generational gap is something

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.983
that is very, very hard for young people.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.384
So when there's certain things

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:13.319
that we want to be heard as young people

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.021
with not only

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:16.456
the conflict out with Israeli

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:17.423
and Palestine people,

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.992
but we also have like student loan

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.426
forgiveness and all of these different

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.128
financial problems

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:23.463
that aren't being handled

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.365
when there are very much capable

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.399
of being handled.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.567
Malkin isn't ruling out

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:28.468
voting third party,

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.036
but feels like a weird

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.170
kind of throwaway vote.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.273
Joseph Fisher used to think that way,

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.574
but right now he favors

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:35.708
a socialist party.

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:38.278
In 2020, Fisher was just 17,

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.579
but he helped the ACLU

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:41.681
register voters back home in Georgia.

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:42.882
So you helped Joe Biden get elected?

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.183
I did, yes.

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:45.218
What about 2024?

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:46.419
I will not vote for Joe Biden.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.420
Not this time.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.554
This is Ann Arbor,

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:50.556
the University of Michigan students

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.325
writing the names of Palestinians

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:53.259
killed in Gaza.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.627
One of our demands that we're pressuring

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:55.595
Adnan for right now

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:56.562
is complete divestment

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:57.463
from the state of Israel.

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:58.631
You say genocide?

00:04:58.631 --> 00:04:59.432
Yes.

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:00.566
The prime minister of Israel

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.302
or the president of United States

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.103
would say response to terrorism.

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:05.004
Absolutely.

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:06.973
It's and it's absolutely essential

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:07.407
that we call it

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:08.441
for what it is a genocide

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.242
and also say

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.277
that it doesn't start on October 17th.

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:12.478
It started in 1948

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:13.680
with the creation of the Saudi

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.814
colonial state of Israel.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.983
Some Jewish students say talk like that.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.217
Beliefs like that

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:19.819
are stoking an alarming rise

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:20.953
in anti-Semitism.

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:22.055
I wish it wasn't like this,

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.490
but this is what we live right now.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.958
50,000 students here

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:26.993
in Ann Arbor

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.161
and interest in the college

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.729
Democrats is up.

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.799
We've had 50, 40, 30

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:34.233
consistently for meetings.

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.501
And in the past

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.969
it has been closer to maybe

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:37.870
ten, 15,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.772
20 seniors and co-presidents

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:40.907
of the College Democrats,

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.208
Anoushka Jala, Saki

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.209
and Jade Gray helped

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.544
generate big turnout here

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:47.113
in 2020 and again in 2022.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:48.014
They have weekly meetings

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.283
now to plan 2024.

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:51.551
Should we have somebody younger?

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:53.519
Does that come up much?

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:54.320
Absolutely.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.954
It comes up.

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:56.322
And I think that that's a

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.257
you know, it's a real point to make.

00:05:58.257 --> 00:05:59.959
It's a real conversation to be had.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:00.993
The immediate challenge,

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:02.161
though, is seeing students

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:03.062
who agree on things

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:03.930
like abortion rights

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.131
and defending democracy

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:06.265
at odds over

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.133
the Israel-Hamas

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:10.136
crisis and President Biden's response.

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:10.870
You know, Mr.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.771
President,

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:13.773
I've seen you take key

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.274
humanitarian steps,

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:17.610
but I think the next step is a cease fire

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.012
and I think that that would go a long way

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:20.646
with voters.

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:21.514
I don't know what's happened

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:22.682
next week or next month,

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:25.051
but if the election were tomorrow,

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.019
do you think that it is more likely

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:29.555
some of your members would sit out

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:32.125
or look for another option, third party,

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:32.625
because they're mad

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:33.793
at the president about this?

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:34.927
Some of them, yes.

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:35.962
They have shared with us

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:38.297
that maybe this is making me reconsider.

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:39.098
Is it fair to say you're glad

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:43.202
the election is not tomorrow? Yes,

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:43.469
sir.

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.304
John, we saw in the latest poll

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:46.339
where former President

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.039
Donald Trump

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.041
is now ahead of President Biden

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.176
with younger voters.

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:50.977
Where does that fit with

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:51.944
the data you're seeing?

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:54.180
We didn't see John either at Wayne State,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.648
which is a very remember in downtown

00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:56.682
Detroit, a blue campus

00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:58.751
or even at Ann Arbor, a rush to Trump.

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.386
But you do see a lot of hesitation

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:01.020
about the president.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.988
So let me just bring up those numbers

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:02.455
as we go through.

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:03.723
And you see the Michigan map here

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:04.390
from 2020.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.391
Here's that new national poll

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:05.958
you talked about.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.460
One key distinction I want to make.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.828
NBC polled voters ages

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:10.930
18 to 34 in the exit polls.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.265
It's 18 to 29.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.000
We do know as voters start to get older,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.034
they're more likely

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.269
they're not rushing to the Republicans,

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.036
but they're more likely so.

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:18.471
But still, if you look at this

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.238
and then if you go back

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:20.306
and look nationally

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:22.275
at 2016 versus 2020,

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.610
President Trump got 36% of 18 to 29.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.479
He got 36% again in 2020,

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:27.914
both in 2016 and 20.

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:29.048
President getting 36.

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:30.249
So if he's above 40,

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:32.151
that's a big gain for President Trump.

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:32.919
So what is the issue?

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:33.986
Look at President Biden.

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:37.323
He got 60% in 2022, 55%

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:37.990
for Hillary Clinton.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.658
It was a key

00:07:38.658 --> 00:07:39.759
piece of the Biden coalition.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:40.059
And, John,

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:40.493
when you asked

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:41.160
voters on

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.962
campus, number one, the age

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.897
they see the president, they don't

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:46.098
they don't see him enough.

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:46.999
And so they think, wow,

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.134
he doesn't understand us.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.101
He doesn't get us.

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:50.503
Those college Democrats presence.

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:51.671
They were trying to deal with that issue,

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:52.505
saying you're not just voting

00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:53.072
for the president,

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:53.372
you're voting

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:54.941
for who he puts on the Supreme Court.

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:56.042
You're voting for abortion rights.

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:57.310
You're voting to protect democracy.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.511
They were just trying to start

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.012
that conversation on campus.

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:01.380
And then October 7th happened.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.683
And you see this divide on campus

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:04.650
where the Jewish students say

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.585
they feel afraid

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:06.986
and the progressive students saying

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:07.720
the president should call

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.721
for a cease fire.

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.122
They say if he doesn't,

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:11.524
they might not vote at all

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:13.059
or they might go third party.

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:15.161
And if you look how close Michigan is,

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.562
that would be a problem.

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:18.030
And again, the Biden reelect campaign

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.031
certainly knows all this.

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:19.665
It'll be interesting

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.033
to see how they choose to address it

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.201
over the coming weeks and months.

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:24.237
John King, great to have you. Thank you.
