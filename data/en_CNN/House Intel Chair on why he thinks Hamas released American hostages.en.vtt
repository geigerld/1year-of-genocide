00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.501
The Biden administration

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.627
is asking Israel

00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:05.588
to delay its ground incursion into Gaza.

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:05.797
That's

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:07.090
according to two sources

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.216
briefed on discussions

00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:09.676
who say that the delay

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.136
would potentially allow

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:13.304
for both more negotiations

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:14.848
over the hostages

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.559
that Hamas took on October 7th

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.811
and also would allow for more

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.229
aid to be allowed

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:22.564
to be delivered

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.607
to innocent civilians in Gaza.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:25.775
The sources say that Friday's

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:27.736
release of two American hostages,

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.946
Judith and Natalie Ronan

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:31.614
from outside Chicago,

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.116
signaled that negotiator

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.117
negotiators believed

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:35.410
they could make progress

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.161
on freeing

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.913
some of the more than 200 hostages

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:40.749
believed to be currently held by Hamas.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.333
Joining me now to discuss

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.835
is the chairman of the House Select

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.545
Committee on Intelligence, Congressman

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.797
Mike Turner of Ohio.

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.507
Congressman, thank you so much

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:50.300
for joining us.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.259
So two

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:54.262
American hostages were released by Hamas.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:55.805
This is obviously a brutal

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.307
terrorist group.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:58.725
They didn't release the hostages

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.310
out of the goodness of their hearts

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.728
or for humanitarian reasons.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.355
So why did they release the hostages?

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:08.151
What did they get in exchange?

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.069
Well, certainly there continue

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.321
to have negotiations and discussions.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.614
But what we're very aware of,

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:13.031
which, as you

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.157
just noted, is, you know,

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:15.825
Hamas is a franchise of Iran,

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:17.243
that the brutal terrorist attacks

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.453
that have occurred in

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:21.164
Israel are going to result in an Israel

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:24.709
entering into Gaza and in taking

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:27.462
this conflict to Hamas itself

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.047
in order to diminish their ability

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.091
to continue to to threaten Israel

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.093
as we see that unfold.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.260
Certainly getting humanitarian

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.928
aid is important.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.346
Getting the hostages back are important.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:37.680
And as their opportunities

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.391
that those break, you know, certainly

00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:41.643
they need to be pursued.

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:42.727
But if the United States

00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:44.145
should not be dictating to Israel

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:47.107
the prosecution of this conflict,

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.525
they certainly are on the ground.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:49.317
They know the risks.

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:51.945
They know the consequences.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:55.281
And certainly the United States supports

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.534
their efforts to diminish this

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:58.701
this terrorist threat.

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.829
How involved were American officials

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.080
in securing the release

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.456
of these two American hostages?

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:04.874
And are you optimistic

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:07.043
more hostages might be released?

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:07.293
You know,

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.253
how do you know

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.546
how many more Americans

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:10.797
are currently being held

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:14.050
hostage in Gaza by Hamas?

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.802
You know, I would certainly

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:16.511
say that, you know,

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.721
Hamas needs to release all hostages

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:20.932
and certainly all American hostages.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:21.099
You know,

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.225
there are some reports

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.476
that have been public now

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:24.727
that perhaps all of the Hamas

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:26.187
leadership was not aware

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.605
of the brutal terrorist attack

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.566
that was going to occur into Israel,

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:30.859
that maybe some surprise

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.318
and leadership of Hamas that they now

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.278
find themselves

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.530
with tanks on their borders

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.826
and a conflict going to ensue.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:40.869
And they may see that

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:41.578
these hostages

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:44.706
are an important opportunity to

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.791
to return them back to Israel

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.251
and the United States

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.544
so that they can get out of the way

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.880
and hopefully address this issue of

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.006
how will they move

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.257
from a terrorist organization

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:54.674
and state

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.593
a franchise of Iran

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.469
to an area where there can be peace.

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.137
So obviously,

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:00.013
as the chairman of the House

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:00.722
Intelligence Committee,

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:01.806
you're a member of the Gang of Eight,

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.725
you get to see the very top

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:06.019
classified intelligence

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.228
who is responsible

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:08.980
for the explosion at the Baptist

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.567
Hospital in Gaza Tuesday, which

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.444
the Palestinian health ministry,

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.529
which which is obviously controlled

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.574
by Hamas, blamed on the Israelis.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:20.533
But U.S.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:21.910
intelligence seems to have concluded

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.285
it was

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.203
it was

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.495
actually more likely

00:03:24.495 --> 00:03:25.288
to have been caused

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.832
by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:28.750
Who is responsible,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.043
according to the evidence you've seen?

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:34.464
And how conclusive is that intelligence?

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:36.841
Well, my my counterpart,

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:37.508
ranking member

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:38.760
Jim Himes from Connecticut,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.595
the two of us received a briefing

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:41.095
that included

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:42.388
not just the conclusions

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:43.264
by the administration,

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:44.474
but also the assessment.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.392
What was the process undertaken

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.977
in order to determine

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.897
that this was not the fault of Israel?

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.607
And both of us concluded, in fact,

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:53.983
we released a statement

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:54.859
that we concur with

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.778
the administration's conclusion

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:57.946
that this was not a result

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.281
of Israeli action.

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.992
There are there is a Democratic member

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:04.202
of Congress who is out there

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:06.329
still blaming it on Israel.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.081
And I've heard some members

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.084
say that she should be briefed.

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.044
And I'm wondering,

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.921
is there an intelligence briefing

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.090
being offered to members of Congress

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.342
so that everyone can be informed

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:24.472
as to what the the latest information is?

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:24.764
Sure.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:25.390
William

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.140
Tracey has actually done

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.934
a very good job of pulling together

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.060
both the leadership in the House.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.645
We've been to the

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:31.187
meeting with Jake

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.481
Sullivan and National Security Council

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.024
and

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:36.317
getting their information

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.735
and get a briefing directly from him.

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:40.029
Plus all of the House of Representatives.

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:41.948
We're called into a briefing

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.449
where we both had

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.242
the Office of Director

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.326
of National Intelligence

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:46.869
and the Department of Defense.

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:47.912
So there's been a tremendous

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:48.454
amount of effort

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.081
to get information to members.

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.416
And I think this is very important,

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.584
as it has been in the Ukraine conflict,

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:55.253
especially as the administration moves

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.547
forward to look for an aid package

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:58.506
to get through Congress

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:01.175
for both the conflicts in Ukraine and

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:02.218
and Israel.

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:03.303
Based on what you know,

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.679
do you think the Israelis

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.306
are doing enough

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:09.309
to protect the innocent civilians

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:10.893
in Gaza?

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.729
I'm sure you've heard Israeli

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.981
leadership say that

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.566
Palestinians are victims

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:19.652
of Hamas as well.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:20.570
And then they are.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:21.988
I mean, there is no question, you know,

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.991
there was an election in which Hamas

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.368
came to power in Gaza

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:28.995
and then suspended all elections

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.663
and certainly the people in Gaza

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.290
are captive to them.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.832
And they're certainly

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.876
a brutal terrorist organization

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.252
that that is is ruling that.

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:37.295
And I do think

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.921
that the people in the Palestinians

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:41.299
in Gaza are victims of them as well.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:42.717
Israel has done

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:43.551
a great deal of effort

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:44.385
to try to get people

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:46.012
to move out of the way

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:49.098
as they go in to try to remove Hamas

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:50.433
and its

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.853
ability to execute terrorist acts.

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:55.021
This certainly is going to be very,

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:55.605
very difficult.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:56.022
I don't

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.565
do know that the United States is working

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.442
both on the intelligence side

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:00.360
and the strategy side

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.027
with Israel

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:03.696
to try to determine ways to increase

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:06.366
the the the security

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.909
of Palestinians in the area

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.036
who are not involved in Hamas.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.746
But this is obviously going to be

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:12.914
be very, very difficult.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:15.875
And it it goes both to the

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:16.793
the security

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:17.960
and safety of the Palestinians

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.380
and the Israelis that must be removed.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.547
President Biden just announced

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:24.550
a $105 billion aid package

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.843
for Israel, Ukraine,

00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:27.261
Taiwan and the southern border.

00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:28.763
Obviously,

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.056
the legislative branch

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.182
of the United States government

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:32.600
can't do anything

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.603
until House Republicans pick a speaker.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.897
A Do you support the package?

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:38.981
B.

00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:40.149
At what point does

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:43.778
the dysfunction of House Republicans

00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:47.907
jeopardize national security?

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.199
Right.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.158
I do support the package.

00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:50.368
I think it's incredibly important

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.160
that we move forward

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.829
to make certain that we stand up

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.414
against the authoritarian regimes

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.499
that are trying to undermine democracies

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:57.792
that are our allies.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.836
I think also that we should be more

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:00.795
focused on Russia

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:02.046
as a threat to the United States

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:03.089
than we've have been,

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:03.798
because this is not

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.967
just an issue of Ukraine or not Ukraine.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.176
This is an issue of

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:08.594
Russia's our adversary,

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:09.846
and they intend to do us

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.472
and our allies harm.

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:13.141
And of course, with Israel,

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.101
this is one that has great clarity.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:18.980
We've all seen and have just

00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:20.481
been saddened by the atrocities

00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:20.940
that we've seen

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.775
and the need for

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.485
addressing the issue of Hamas

00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:25.945
with respect to the national security.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.155
Clearly, having a house

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.239
that's not function is

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.240
is certainly a security

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.075
threat for our country.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.076
The this

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:32.743
aid package,

00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:33.953
though, is not being delayed

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.913
as a result of the House.

00:07:35.913 --> 00:07:37.540
At this point, the Senate has taken up

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.458
this aid package.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:38.833
It looks like

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.251
it will be about two weeks before

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:40.835
that package

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:42.462
comes out of the Senate itself.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.421
And certainly we all hope

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.381
we'll have a speaker by that.

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:46.841
There are seven candidates

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.676
so far for speaker.

00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:48.968
Is there

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.845
one that you particularly

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:52.054
are leaning towards

00:07:52.054 --> 00:07:52.763
and do you think that

00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:56.809
that person can get 217 votes?

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:57.935
You're getting 217

00:07:57.935 --> 00:07:59.437
is obviously going to be very difficult.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.230
And is his the sort of Rubik's

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.774
cube of of the answer to all of this?

00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:04.984
I supported Kevin McCarthy.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.068
I supported Jim Jordan.

00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:07.612
I supported Scalise.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.947
I supported Jim on the floor also.

00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:11.240
I think we need to find someone

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.575
who hopefully can get to

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:13.701
to 17 before

00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:14.660
we're all poised

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.079
and very drama fashion on the House floor

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:19.790
trying to determine how this will unfold.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.418
I really hope in the next several days

00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:23.294
as we come together

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:24.879
as the Republican caucus,

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.631
that we're able to resolve that

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:27.256
so that we go

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:28.633
unified to the House floor

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.384
and deliver a speaker.

00:08:30.384 --> 00:08:31.552
I hope you don't take this personally,

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:32.553
but do you guys have any

00:08:32.553 --> 00:08:36.182
idea how clownish you look?

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:37.058
Well, you know,

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:37.767
Jake, I'm

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.560
very fond of saying that

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.103
Congress is a lot like high school,

00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:41.896
but even more so.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:44.232
So hopefully we'll get past this.

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:45.399
And, you know,

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:46.275
I certainly have been part

00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:47.443
of the governing majority,

00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:49.445
and I'm going to stay part of that

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:51.072
and look forward to

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.406
those who are on the fringes,

00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:53.407
hopefully coming together.

00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:55.618
So that we can get as speaker.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:56.619
I said that to Congressman

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:57.954
Womack last week in high school,

00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.080
and he said that that's an insult

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.789
to high school students.

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.123
It's more like junior high.

00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:01.874
Congressman Turner,

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:03.251
Chairman Turner, good to see you.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:04.627
I hope you guys pick the speaker

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.296
sometime soon.

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:07.672
Thanks, Jake.
