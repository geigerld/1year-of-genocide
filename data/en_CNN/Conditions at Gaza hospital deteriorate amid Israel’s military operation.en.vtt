00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.001
Israel attempts

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:01.801
to justify

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.770
its raid of the al-Shifa hospital.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.838
Conditions inside

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.306
the complex are growing

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.941
more dire by the day.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.843
CNN's Dana Bash here has an update

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.745
on the humanitarian crisis

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.714
unfolding all across Gaza.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:15.949
Right.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:16.683
It's a scene

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.552
should be filled with innocents.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.555
But these drawings, sketches of houses

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.791
paint a picture of all these children

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.093
have lost

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.862
hope for the displaced.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.532
Now, makeshift shelters in central Gaza

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.703
live in limbo with nowhere to go

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:39.973
in the south as more children are buried.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.409
Another warning,

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.977
leaflets dropped by the Israeli

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.512
military on Thursday,

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:46.413
telling civilians

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:47.714
in southern Gaza

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.417
to move and find shelter.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.851
A foreboding signal

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.620
that Israel's ground incursion

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.291
could soon extend its punishing reach.

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.293
Now they are asking us to leave.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:01.294
Where do we go?

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.396
And we want to understand

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.965
where exactly we should go.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:08.168
It should Denia,

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:08.768
the U.N.

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:10.470
rights expert on Thursday

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.272
warned that grave violations

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.407
committed by Israel point,

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.475
in their words,

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:18.478
to a genocide in the making.

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.013
As darkness encompasses

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:21.481
doctors in the South

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.515
already grappling

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:23.783
with the impact of Israel's

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.152
intensifying bombing campaign.

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:28.021
There are growing fears over

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.923
what could come next.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.258
Desperate scenes from the north of Gaza,

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.094
almost entirely destroyed

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:37.130
by Israel's unrelenting airstrikes, show

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.598
just how dire

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:42.635
the situation can quickly become in the.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:45.105
We have lost contact with our colleagues,

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.372
patients

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:47.907
and everyone inside the al-Shifa

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.309
medical complex.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:50.510
What stopped it?

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.411
Israeli forces

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:53.513
say they are still active in

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:55.648
and around the al-Shifa hospital.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.150
Gaza's largest,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.218
claiming to have found

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.552
an operational tunnel

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.988
saw at the hospital complex

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.690
with no access to the complex.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.326
CNN is unable to verify either

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.727
side's claims.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:08.595
Israel says its

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.530
military operation at al-Shifa

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.031
will take time,

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.733
raising fears over the safety

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.034
and security of more

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:16.202
than a thousand patients

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:19.205
and medical staff now trapped inside.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.341
We are looking at options

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.877
for full medical evacuation,

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:26.212
but there are a lot of security concerns.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:29.015
There are a lot of logistics constraints.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.917
Our options are rather limited.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:31.818
There were

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.019
allegations of people

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.221
at al-Shifa being interrogated

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.523
and even stripped

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:38.391
are beginning to emerge.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:39.792
While doctors are detailing

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.161
the harrowing decisions

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.929
they are being forced to make,

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.531
including amputating limbs

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:47.066
to stop the spread of infection,

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.168
who, with the communications

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.336
blackout, cutting northern Gaza off

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.505
for much of the outside world.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.974
CNN has no ability to verify

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.042
these accounts

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:56.643
and has reached out

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:58.711
to the IDF for comment.

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.980
No videos have emerged from Stone

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.282
Shifa Hospital

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.983
since the raid began in the early

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:07.554
hours of Wednesday morning.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.254
These are

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:09.756
some of the last pictures

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:12.091
to have been shared with the world.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:15.962
Premature babies in intensive care.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.697
There is no way to tell

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.700
if all are still alive.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.869
Their cries,

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.605
some of the last heard heard

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.307
the voices of those inside.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:32.312
And Shifa the silence when it came.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:32.779
Look, Wolf,

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.013
there is still mounting concern

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:35.114
for the safety and security

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:35.848
of those patients

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:36.649
and medical staff,

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:37.750
as well as other civilians

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.819
inside the al-Shifa complex.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:40.520
As you heard there,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.021
it is extremely difficult

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.290
to even begin to think about evacuating

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.191
some of these patients

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.426
who require specialist

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.127
medical evacuations.

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:50.063
And as we know, of course, already

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.865
there are some 1.5 million Palestinians

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:53.700
who have been displaced

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.702
within the Gaza Strip.

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:56.069
And, of course,

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.170
while that has been an intense

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.771
focus on the al-Shifa complex,

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:00.373
what we are seeing across the Gaza

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.975
Strip is continued

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:04.577
aerial bombardment, continued concern

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:05.612
over the mounting death

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:06.713
toll that we are seeing,

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:07.847
Wolf, not of Bashir

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:09.182
reporting live from Jerusalem.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:10.450
Thank you a very much.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.317
Let's get some more

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.585
on all of these developments.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:13.386
Joining us now,

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:14.254
a spokesperson

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.822
for the Israel Defense Forces,

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:16.589
Lieutenant Colonel

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.324
Amnon Scheffler Scheffler.

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:18.992
Lieutenant Colonel,

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.159
thank you so much for joining us,

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.760
first of all.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.828
What more can you tell us

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:22.795
about this, quote,

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.764
operational tunnel shaft

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:27.300
that Israeli forces say they found inside

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.668
al-Shifa complex?

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:30.003
Is that the extent of what

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:33.172
the IDF has found at al-Shifa so far

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:34.274
when it comes to tunnels,

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:38.044
or is there more?

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.946
This is one of

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.181
the piers that we found in the area

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.182
that we are continuously

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.684
also looking for other.

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.953
And this shows that clearly

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.222
there is a tunnel infrastructure

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:51.224
underneath the al-Shifa hospital.

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.692
We found also today

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:53.860
a lot of explosives

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.128
and other ammunitions

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:55.528
right

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:58.665
in that courtyard of the al-Shifa

00:04:58.665 --> 00:04:59.499
hospital.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.501
Also together with what we found

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.436
yesterday in the MRI room.

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:04.404
We also found the car

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:05.538
that you just showed

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:06.873
that is similar to the cars

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:07.607
that were used

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:10.543
on the October 7th massacre.

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:13.112
And it was booby trapped once again

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:16.015
showing how Hamas did not care

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.050
and was looking forward

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.217
to explode a car

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.253
inside the Shifa hospital

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:20.620
that would

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.521
surely have killed

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:24.524
also patients and staff of that hospital.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:25.325
Lieutenant Colonel,

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.126
can you say unequivocally

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.328
that what's been found

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.696
at the hospital shows

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:32.365
this was a major Hamas command center?

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.866
What exactly do you defined

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:36.769
as a command center?

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:38.538
Yes, we can say that now, clearly.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:40.406
And now we're also showing it

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:41.774
on top of the evidence

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.076
that we knew from the intel

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.577
and that they are U.S.

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:46.713
counterparts have also verified.

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:47.780
What we're seeing here

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.783
is a place where Hamas can gather.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.418
We saw the communication tools

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:52.952
that they had.

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:54.554
We saw the intel tools

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:55.355
that they need

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.589
in order to facilitate

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.458
any kind of terrorist activity

00:05:58.458 --> 00:05:59.292
and carry it out

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.561
from that infrastructure that they used.

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:04.030
Again, another civilian infrastructure.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.366
Similarly, like they used schools,

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.101
like they used mosques,

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:08.835
and also like

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:09.535
they used this

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:10.903
hospital, Al-Quds

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:12.872
hospital, the Rantisi Hospital,

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.574
to carry out and plan

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.576
and execute terrorist activity.

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.378
The director of al-Shifa hospital

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.712
there says patients

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:21.347
there are going untreated,

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:23.449
including a lot of children.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.084
Doesn't Israel have an obligation

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:27.053
to deliver critical supplies

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:30.590
to to at least the patients there?

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.758
We have an obligation,

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.693
a moral obligation, and we wish to.

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:34.260
That is why

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.263
today we brought 4000 liters of water

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.264
to the hospital.

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:39.399
That is why we brought today

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.535
1500 prepared meals to the hospital.

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:44.570
That is why we are continuously talking

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.472
to the administration of the hospital

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:47.140
and the doctors

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.374
and to see what is needed.

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:49.742
And based on what they said,

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.344
we brought in the incubators.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:53.012
We brought in baby food.

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:54.180
We have designated

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.548
an area of the hospital,

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:56.983
the eastern side of it,

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:58.317
that civilians and patients

00:06:58.317 --> 00:06:59.018
that can leave

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:00.453
should leave

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:02.355
through the humanitarian corridors

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:04.557
that we are continuously protecting

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:06.392
and allowing those civilians to leave.

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:07.093
And that is why we are in

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.261
continuous communication

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.362
to find the best way

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:10.830
that we can alleviate

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.431
the suffering

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.031
that Hamas

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:14.634
is bringing on the people in Gaza.

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:15.802
Are you planning to deliver

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:19.238
fuel to the hospital?

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:21.908
We have offered fuel, 300 liters

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:23.743
that our soldiers brought

00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:26.679
while taking a risk to the hospital.

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:27.814
Sadly,

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.582
the hospital did not take it in,

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:31.517
probably because the Hamas

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:32.852
was threatening

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:34.921
what would happen to them if they do.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:36.055
And as I mentioned,

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:37.557
we are in continuous communication

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:38.157
and whatever

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:39.592
the hospital says that they need,

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:42.595
we will try to facilitate that.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.764
The body of an Israeli hostage,

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.032
a woman, was found

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:47.600
near al-Shifa hospital.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.501
The IDF says

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:50.102
she was killed by terrorists.

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:52.605
Can you explain the exact circumstances

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:53.339
of her death?

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:57.343
65 year old grandmother,

00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:59.212
65 year old died.

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:01.314
Vice was found right

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.015
next to the al-Shifa hospital

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:04.383
and brought back to his

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:05.351
to Israel

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:07.453
to be buried next to her husband

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:08.754
that was also murdered

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:11.757
on the 7th of October by Hamas.

00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:13.826
We have two goals in this war

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.261
that Hamas launched.

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:17.296
One is to dismantle Hamas.

00:08:17.296 --> 00:08:18.030
And the second

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.199
is to bring back the hostages.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.435
Now, on the day 41

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:24.070
are still being held by Hamas.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.105
And I want to remind everyone,

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:28.307
the safest and fastest way

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.209
for these hostages to come home

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:32.078
is for Hamas to release them

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.379
and the international community

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:36.449
to continue pressuring Hamas to do so.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.850
So do you know exactly how

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:43.356
this 65 year old grandmother died?

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:45.324
We know that she, on October

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:46.893
7th, was alive

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:48.628
in her bed in Kibbutz

00:08:48.628 --> 00:08:49.729
Berri,

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:52.665
and Hamas came in and brutally massacred

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.667
10% of that kibbutz

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:56.702
and took her as hostage together

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:58.538
with a nine month old baby,

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.973
children, women and elderly.

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:02.308
And now we know

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:05.478
that she has sadly passed away.

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:07.480
As you know, Israel has dropped leaflets

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.682
in the largest city in southern Gaza

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:11.651
warning civilians there to leave.

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:12.184
The IDF

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:13.352
previously told people

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:15.021
to move south for safety.

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:16.422
So where are they supposed to go?

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:19.325
Lieutenant Colonel,

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:20.960
where are the ones that are actually

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.461
continuously communicating

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:23.596
with the people of Gaza,

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:25.031
looking for the safer areas

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:26.132
where they can be?

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:27.099
Because we knew that

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.901
Hamas has its headquarters,

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.069
mainly in the Gaza City.

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.404
That is where operationally

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.772
we chose to start.

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:33.773
But sadly,

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:35.541
as we know, Hamas is operating

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:37.176
all over the Gaza Strip.

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:40.112
More than 10,000 rockets have been fired

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.380
from the Gaza Strip

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.782
towards Israeli civilians.

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:43.983
And this includes

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:46.152
coming from the southern part of Gaza.

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:47.753
So Hamas is not operating

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:48.721
only in Gaza City.

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.289
It's operating also in the south.

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:50.790
And in order

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.291
to reach our number one goal,

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.960
which is to dismantle Hamas,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.928
we will go them wherever they are.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:57.563
Yet we are

00:09:57.563 --> 00:09:59.432
looking for the safest places

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.634
for the civilians of Gaza.

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:02.902
And that is why we've asked them

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:03.703
initially to move

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:05.037
to the southern part of Gaza,

00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:06.706
south of the border of Gaza.

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:07.573
And now we're telling them

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:08.841
specifically where to move

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:10.409
within that area.

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:11.210
And also,

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.211
while doing so,

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:14.380
we're continuously in communication

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.082
with any international organization

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:17.383
that wants to aid

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:21.320
the Gazans, bring in any international

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.956
medicine facilities, food

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:25.725
that can be help, including field

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:28.060
hospitals that we're inviting any country

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.729
that wants to donate them, to bring them

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:31.263
to the southern part of Gaza

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:33.232
so we can help the Palestinians,

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:35.067
as we said,

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:37.637
reaching the goal of dismantling Hamas

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:38.671
will not only bring it

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:40.106
to be safer for Israelis,

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:41.774
it will also bring it to be safer

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:43.943
for the Palestinians living in Gaza.

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:45.411
Lieutenant Colonel Amnon Scheffler,

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:49.181
thanks so much for joining us.

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:50.182
Thanks for having us.
