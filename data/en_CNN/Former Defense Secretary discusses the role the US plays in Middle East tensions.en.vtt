00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.126
International pressure

00:00:01.126 --> 00:00:02.460
is clearly building

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.254
on both Israel and Hamas

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:06.047
to return to negotiations

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:07.841
to end the war in Gaza

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.093
and to release the remaining hostages.

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:12.345
This new push, underscored

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.139
by a grave global concern

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.640
right now, that the region,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.766
this region in the Middle East

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.642
where I am,

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:18.852
is inching closer

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.228
and closer to the threat

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:22.981
of a much wider scale conflict.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.816
Israel is bracing for strikes

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:27.652
from Iran and its heavily armed proxies

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:28.987
after it killed Hezbollah

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.448
and Hamas leaders just last week.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:32.365
The source familiar

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.450
with the discussions

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.411
tells CNN that the talks are scheduled.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.204
The mediator talks are scheduled

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.832
for next Thursday, August 15th.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:41.499
The Israeli Prime

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:42.959
Minister's office says

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:45.045
Israel will send the negotiations

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.546
team to the talks.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:47.255
The U.S.,

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.757
Qatar and Egypt

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.467
have issued this joint statement.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.052
They're leading this effort,

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.095
the trio of mediators say.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.430
And I'm quoting now,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.766
there is no further time to waste,

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.768
nor excuses from any party

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.311
for further delay.

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.147
It is time to release the hostages, begin

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.191
the cease fire and implement

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:06.983
this agreement.

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:08.735
That's the end of the quote

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.445
from those three mediators.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.113
Let's dig deeper right now.

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:13.865
Joining us, Leon Panetta.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:14.866
He served as U.S.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.034
defense secretary

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:18.828
and CIA director under President Obama.

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:19.746
Mr. Secretary.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.498
Always good to have you join us

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.666
here on CNN. Thanks very much.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.667
And as you heard that,

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:25.919
as, you know, Egypt,

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.712
Israel and cutter,

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:30.006
they want both Israel and Hamas to resume

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.009
cease fire and hostage negotiations

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.177
this coming week.

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:35.678
In your opinion, Mr.

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:38.139
Secretary, how likely is that to happen?

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.936
Well, one thing we know for sure,

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.438
and you're there, Wolf, is that

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.233
this is a very dangerous moment,

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.943
in which,

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.362
without question, if,

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:53.738
the wrong steps are taken

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:55.865
by Iran and Hezbollah,

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:58.868
we can have a larger war on our hands.

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.664
on the other hand, because, there are

00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:04.207
a number of nations,

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:06.543
that you mentioned that are working,

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.546
diplomatically to try to get, Iran

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:12.632
and Hezbollah and others to back down,

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:15.552
and hopefully be able to engage,

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:16.761
in negotiations,

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.764
get back to the negotiating table.

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:20.098
I'm,

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:23.143
I'm sure that it's having some impact.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.478
but right now,

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:28.481
I think the situation is one

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:31.609
that is a crisis situation.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.654
And I think that I worry,

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:37.448
frankly, that,

00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:38.908
that this could result

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:40.243
in an escalated war.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.579
There.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:42.912
Yeah.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:43.705
All of us

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.373
are worried about that possibility,

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.207
especially those of us

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:48.126
who are here in the region.

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:48.459
Mr.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.336
Secretary, the Biden administration

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.589
says it will defend Israel

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.090
if it comes under attack.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.592
What should the Biden administration

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:56.551
be doing right now,

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:57.343
do you think,

00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:00.388
to potentially not further inflame

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:02.682
the regional tensions that are underway?

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:05.935
Well, look, I think

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:06.936
the most important thing

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:08.980
that the United States is doing right now

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.233
is deploying our military capabilities

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.568
to the region

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.445
in order to make sure

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.322
that we have in place

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:20.033
everything we need in order to defend

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.036
against airstrikes in Israel.

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.873
you know, Iran crossed the line,

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.292
in April in sending,

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:32.545
almost 300 missiles into Israel itself.

00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:35.173
Unfortunately, because,

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.675
our allies, Israel,

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:40.094
others were able to knock down

00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:41.095
a lot of those missiles,

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:43.681
almost 90% of those missiles.

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:44.432
what happened

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:47.143
did not escalate the situation there.

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:50.146
Whether or not that can happen again,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.189
I think is

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.192
what what we're all looking at.

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:56.361
but having the United States

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.528
having the time

00:03:57.528 --> 00:03:58.196
to be able

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:01.449
to deploy our destroyers, to deploy our,

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:05.286
our air capabilities there as well,

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.705
and to prepare for that possibility

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:09.624
is probably the most important thing

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.668
that the United States can do right now

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:14.629
and also hopefully urge Israel

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.546
and the parties

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:17.632
to get back to the negotiating table.

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:20.969
You were the U.S.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:21.928
defense secretary.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.096
You know the region well.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:26.099
You know the issues, very, very closely.

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:28.268
how would you be handling

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.394
what's going on right now

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.604
if you were still the defense secretary?

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.731
And I asked the question specifically

00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:35.024
because Israel is now

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:35.984
a member of the U.S.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.902
military's Central Command,

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:39.404
which is in charge of the whole

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.822
Middle East, as opposed to

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.490
when you were defense secretary

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.617
as part of the European Command.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:45.618
What's the what?

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:46.369
What does that

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.204
what what does that suggest to you

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:51.207
about the potential difference?

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.127
Well, what it what it means

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.463
is that there's, a larger direct focus,

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:02.302
on Israel and, on Israel's enemies.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.595
and that means that,

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:06.014
the United States

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:09.309
plays a much more important role in terms

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.312
of trying to defend Israel.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.397
and that's that's as it should be.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:18.067
the issue then becomes,

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:21.195
if in fact, Iran or the proxies

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:24.198
decide to conduct a massive attack,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.867
in which,

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.870
a lot of innocent Israelis are killed.

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:30.830
it leaves the United States

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.332
very little option

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.418
but to go in and help defend Israel

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.588
in that kind of war.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.008
And not just with, military equipment,

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.301
but with troops as well.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:46.095
Is that what you're saying?

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:47.555
Well, you know,

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:49.057
you'd like to believe that,

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:50.141
we could provide

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.768
the military capabilities

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.686
as we have been.

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:56.105
in order to be able to ensure

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:57.440
that Israel,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.524
can do the fighting

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:00.318
and do the fighting effectively,

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.612
I think we'll try to exhaust that option.

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:05.865
But when you're in an escalated war,

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.744
everything is on the table.

00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:11.954
Yeah, that's what I'm hearing as well.

00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:13.122
let me return

00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:14.082
to the Israeli prime

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:15.792
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:17.919
he gave an exclusive

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.670
interview to time magazine.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.004
Mr.

00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:22.006
Secretary, and Netanyahu,

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:25.009
pushes back against claims that he's,

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.346
drawing out the Gaza campaign

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:29.722
to ensure that he remains

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:31.349
in political office.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.226
He calls that accusation against him

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.185
a canard.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.520
Do you feel that Prime Minister

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.313
Netanyahu has resisted

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:38.856
a cease fire deal

00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:40.900
for personal political reasons,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.903
as some are alleging?

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.406
You know, I, I've known,

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.990
Netanyahu for a long time,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.993
going back to the Clinton administration.

00:06:51.452 --> 00:06:54.580
he's he's committed to two things.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.792
He's committed to the survival of Israel,

00:06:58.584 --> 00:06:59.919
but he's also committed

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.922
to his own survival in office.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:05.633
and that combination,

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:08.636
means that while he's a fighter,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.472
he's not much of a peacemaker.

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:13.015
And that is the Netanyahu

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:16.018
that we're dealing with now.

00:07:16.477 --> 00:07:18.771
In that same time magazine interview,

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.314
Netanyahu was asked

00:07:20.314 --> 00:07:23.109
about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.611
He denied that Israel has failed

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.654
to do enough

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:28.030
to aid civilians,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.158
saying this, and I'm quoting him now.

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:31.784
We've gone out of our way

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:33.828
to enable humanitarian assistance

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.621
since the beginning of the war.

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.832
Clearly, the Biden administration, Mr.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.750
Secretary, doesn't necessarily agree

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.377
with his assessment. Do you?

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:45.798
Well, I you know, I

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:49.093
not Netanyahu sees the situation

00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:50.845
through his eyes.

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:52.597
and, that's not necessarily

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.765
what's really happening.

00:07:54.765 --> 00:07:56.309
you know, he he will

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.895
he will make the case that somehow,

00:07:58.895 --> 00:07:59.812
Israel bears

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.063
no responsibility

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:04.150
for the humanitarian crisis, in Gaza.

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:05.735
but that's not the

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.862
that's not really the facts.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.113
anybody who's been there,

00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:09.989
anybody who's seen

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:13.242
that situation, knows very well that,

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.578
yeah, Israel is

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.581
obviously focused on fighting a war,

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.459
and not really doing very much

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.462
with regards to humanitarian assistance.

00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:27.215
and so, right now,

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:30.510
the continuing fighting in Gaza, the,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.678
the threat of an even larger war

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:35.681
with Iran, and its proxies.

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:38.684
I think I think what you're going to see

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:40.478
is a very hard line.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.730
Netanyahu,

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.525
trying to confront a very hard line.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.108
Iran.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.445
Would you be surprised, Mr.

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:50.655
Secretary?

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:52.907
if Israel launched a preemptive strike

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:53.574
right now

00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:54.825
against his Hezbollah

00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:56.953
forces in Lebanon for, for example,

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:57.954
and maybe even against

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:00.957
Iranian forces inside Iran?

00:09:01.749 --> 00:09:03.793
Well, I'm sure that kind of thinking

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.002
is on the table.

00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:07.421
If they if they determined

00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:09.090
that they have intelligence

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.426
on a potential attack against Israel,

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:15.555
my sense would be that they would take

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.014
the opportunity,

00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:17.890
to, to

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.268
to do a precipitous attack

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.144
in order to stop,

00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:24.730
that kind of, of confrontation.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.731
So, yeah,

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.316
I think they're looking at all

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:29.318
the options right now.

00:09:29.318 --> 00:09:31.696
but clearly what is happening

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.657
now is that it's a wait and see game.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:38.119
to determine just whether or not,

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.746
Iran and Hezbollah

00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:44.083
are going to take a major step

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:47.712
that will, in fact, escalate the war.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.506
look, the record here is that

00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:53.593
everybody is pushing now to try to

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:57.638
to try to hopefully reduce the chances

00:09:57.638 --> 00:09:59.473
for that kind of escalation

00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:01.142
that's worked in the past.

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:04.145
I think the hope is that it can work now.

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:06.105
Let's hope it does.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:06.731
Leon Panetta,

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.024
the former defense secretary,

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.900
former CIA director, as usual,

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.694
thank you very much for your analysis.

00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:12.445
We appreciate it.
