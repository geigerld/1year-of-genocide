00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.770
The beginning of the pause will be 7 a.m.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.639
Friday, the 24th of November,

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.174
and it will last of course,

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.443
as agreed for four days.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.014
And the first batch of civilians

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.315
to be released from

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.517
Gaza will be around 4 p.m.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.219
of the same day.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.453
They will be 13

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:23.356
and no all the women and children

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.192
and those hostages from the same family

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.227
will be

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.195
put together within the same patch.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.330
CNN's Becky Anderson,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.398
who is in that press

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.866
conference, asked multiple

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.600
great questions.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.867
Becky,

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:34.067
I think

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.902
one of the key ones that you asked was

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:36.770
what happens

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.172
if one side breaches of this agreement

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.740
what is the result of that?

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.675
What stood out to you about the answer

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.612
from from the Qatari official

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.481
It was an interesting answer, wasn't it?

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:52.152
He said this has to be a cessation

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:56.056
of hostilities completely on both sides.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:59.092
On the ground and for periods of time

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:00.460
in the air.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.961
And he made it very clear

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.830
when asked about drones

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.197
in the air,

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:05.732
surveillance drones in the air,

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:06.933
he said specifically

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.935
during the period of the hostages

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.070
being released,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.705
there would be no surveillance

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:14.541
drones flown.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.309
And we know

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.811
because we've had to what we

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.679
might call proof of concept

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.048
episodes where

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:25.251
we've seen two sets of hostages released.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.220
Of course, the American mother

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.021
and her 17 year

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.222
old daughter some weeks ago

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:31.724
and then two elderly Israeli citizens.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.793
We know that they were drones in the air

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:34.561
at the time.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.062
And what he suggested is

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.665
that can be very confusing.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.800
It can make people feel that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.002
there may be some hostile

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.437
activity in the air.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:47.407
So certainly during the periods of time

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.542
when the hostages are being released,

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.245
the air the skies will be clear.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.013
The air space over

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:55.782
those hostages will be clear.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.051
Let's just be very specific,

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.420
I think, about what we learned today.

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:04.557
This truce starts at 7 a.m.

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:06.092
local Gaza time.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:10.029
That is 12 a or midnight Eastern time.

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:13.199
And at some point after 4:00

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.302
in the afternoon, so 9 a.m.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:18.671
Eastern Time,

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:22.775
we will see the first 13 hostages.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.978
The names of those 13 hostages

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:28.882
have now been shared with both the

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.684
with the Mossad on the Israeli side

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:34.220
and the reciprocal arrangement,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.854
as it were.

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:38.258
The release of Palestinian prisoners

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:41.561
into the Palestinians

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.830
hands will happen around the same time,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.531
although

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:45.532
most Italians

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:46.533
are the spokesperson

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.168
for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:48.768
I couldn't say

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:51.137
exactly how many hostages

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.173
would be exchanged.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.042
And then after that, every day

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:57.911
there will be a list

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:01.381
and shared with both sides on those

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:02.882
who will be released

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:06.019
every day at around the same time.

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.421
So let's assume for it to be around

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:11.424
4:00 in the afternoon Gaza and time

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.526
for four days,

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.562
that would take us up to effectively

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:19.732
50 hostages, women and children.

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:20.967
After that,

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.101
much of our sorry

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:24.671
reminded us that the proposal the

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:28.441
the deal includes a an opportunity

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:33.279
for Hamas to come good on its agreement.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:37.817
And for every ten extra hostages release

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:39.018
and the understanding

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.086
is that they are holding

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.055
as many as 70 to 80.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:45.124
There will be an extra day of this pause

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:46.392
this cessation

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.027
of hostilities

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:50.096
for this brief period of time.

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:52.098
So you know lots of good detail

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:54.801
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:55.501
here today

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:56.903
an important detail

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.771
because although we knew

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.241
that this deal had been agreed to

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:02.342
there were lots

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.477
and lots of things that were that

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:08.014
that was still unclear until we heard

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:09.115
from Majid

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:10.850
al-Ansari at this press conference today.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.217
Kaitlin

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.788
Yeah, that was key there, Becky.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.957
A sense of optimism that

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.192
from the Qataris at least,

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.627
that this could potentially go on

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:22.428
for longer than the planned four days.

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:22.862
We'll see.

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:23.196
Of course,

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:24.797
there is a good reason to be skeptical

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:24.964
here.

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:26.099
We'll see what this looks like

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.800
once it's actually put into effect.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.402
Thank you, Becky Anderson.

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:29.769
And Kate,

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:30.236
obviously,

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:31.104
this is the news

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.372
that so many of these families

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:33.473
have been waiting for that

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:35.041
at midnight Eastern tonight,

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:36.242
this temporary truce

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:37.677
is going to go into place.

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:39.612
And that based on what we just heard,

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.447
if everything goes according to plan.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:42.615
24 hours from now,

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:43.082
we will see

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:45.685
13 women and civilian hostages

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:48.221
released by Hamas in Gaza Kate.

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.124
Caitlin, thank you so much.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.292
And to remind everyone,

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.159
of the breaking news,

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.494
which is this is a big moment

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:55.828
that we're looking at right now

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:58.898
as as of midnight, the news is midnight

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.401
tonight, Eastern Time, 7 p.m.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:04.270
local the truce sets in. 4 p.m.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.638
local 9 a.m.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.340
eastern around.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.374
The hostages

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:10.510
will be begin to be released.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.010
And is

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.245
Israel has confirmed

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:14.180
and then that they have a list

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.114
in hand

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:18.117
of the 13 hostages to be first released.

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:19.319
13 women

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.754
and children are now just hours away

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:22.955
hopefully

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:26.693
from ending a weeks long nightmare.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.394
Joining us now on this news.

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:29.629
Finally some more detail

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:30.697
that we have gotten about

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:32.298
what this exchange will look like

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:32.732
is for me.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:33.900
The former deputy

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.168
director of national intelligence,

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.235
Beth Sanner.

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.104
CNN global affairs analyst Kim Dozier.

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:40.173
And retired Army Brigadier General

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.007
Mark Kimmitt.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.542
Thank you guys for being here.

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:44.110
Beth, what's your reaction

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.777
to all of what

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:46.112
we just heard laid out

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:47.547
by Qatari officials

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:48.781
of what this process

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:49.816
is going to look like now?

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:52.285
Well, I guess

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:53.553
we'll skip ahead a little bit,

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:55.588
because I think that, you know,

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:59.025
tomorrow looks very good, but as each day

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.927
progresses, it gets harder

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.462
and more challenging.

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:04.597
And it's clear from the way

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:06.999
the Qataris laid out this plan

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.203
that their goal is very, very divergent

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.205
from where the Israeli goal

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.473
is in the end.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.641
The Qataris want to extend this

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:17.577
indefinitely and lead

00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:19.679
this lead to a peace agreement

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:20.680
or full cease fire.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.247
And Israel

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:23.149
is absolutely in a different place.

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:24.517
And so I think that,

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:25.251
you know, this does

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.420
become much, much more complicated

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:29.555
as it goes by.

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:30.556
And it's an excellent point,

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:31.391
because we just heard

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:31.891
from the prime

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:32.792
minister himself

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:35.762
definitively saying the war continues

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:36.896
last night,

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:40.299
the mission remains to demolish Hamas.

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:41.100
And general

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.701
in terms

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:44.337
of what this truce means

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:45.905
and how it holds.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:46.839
So midnight tonight,

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.674
Eastern is when the truce is to set in.

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:50.243
And our Becky Anderson, our colleague

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:52.478
over there, she asked Qatar officials

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:53.513
what would constitute

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:55.214
a breach of this agreement,

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:57.817
a break in that truce by either side.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.152
And the visual

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.788
definitely did not answer the question.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.256
What do you think would.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:03.856
Is it clear

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:04.991
what would constitute a breach?

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:07.693
And what happens if if they do

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:10.196
Well, I think

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:10.463
what would

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:11.097
happen is

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.799
there would be some undisciplined

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.100
fire from

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.836
perhaps a individual Hamas soldier

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.172
that may or may not agree with

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:20.640
what is what what is going on.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.942
He may be trying to lure

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:24.610
the IDF into firing back.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.178
That happens

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:26.179
so often

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:27.213
in these tentative

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:29.949
cease fires around the world.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.084
I think that that would not return

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:35.288
the situation to a full combat operation.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:38.791
But as they said in the press conference,

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:39.559
they would do everything

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:41.694
they could to contain

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:42.962
that type of violation.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.464
I think at this point,

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.632
both sides want this

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:49.836
this pause to stay in place

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:51.137
during the duration

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.406
of the hostage exchange

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:56.042
and what the pause does.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.776
But does it

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:57.610
pause B, get

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.612
a pause is kind of a question,

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.414
Kim, because

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:02.748
a former head of Mossad told me

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:06.752
last night that it will be for the IDF

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:08.020
much harder

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.222
to start the fighting

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:10.389
in the military operation

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:13.593
back up once this truce sets in for one,

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:15.461
because he believed

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.430
the mounting international pressure

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.798
that would start building

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:20.833
to at least bring about a slowdown.

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:22.702
The IDF and the prime minister

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:23.703
have assured, though,

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:25.438
that they are going to return

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:26.672
to operations.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:28.641
The mission continues

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:30.843
What do you think of these

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:33.045
Well, Israel has said that

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:36.148
this agreement expires after ten days.

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:38.384
And the White House really

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:41.120
hoping that if the first four days

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.821
go well,

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.457
each of those additional days could

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:45.992
lead to more hostage

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:48.561
exchanges, possibly up to ten days.

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:51.430
But turning the war back on

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.165
is going to be really hard

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:55.668
for the Israeli government

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:57.303
because there will be pressure

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.005
from the hostage families

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:00.706
to keep this going

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:02.842
to keep the exchanges going,

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:04.777
because the Hamas militants,

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:05.945
they're not going anywhere.

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:07.413
They're stuck inside Gaza.

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:08.481
So what's the difference

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:09.515
between waiting

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:10.283
another ten

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:12.552
or 20 days to prosecute the war

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.888
versus earlier

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:20.526
And Beth Netanyahu,

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:24.063
the role of the Red Cross was brought up

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:25.164
in this press conference

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:27.233
with Qatari officials and

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.534
and he essentially said

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:31.170
that the Red Cross has a role in

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:33.639
accepting the hostages

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:35.741
and kind of facilitating that.

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:36.909
But there is also

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:39.178
then Netanyahu saying yesterday

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:40.546
that the Red Cross,

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:41.581
he said

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.481
the expectation is

00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:44.016
will be allowed to visit

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:45.117
the hostages

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:47.887
who remain behind, remain in Gaza

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:48.654
and even offer

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:51.390
medical support to those hostages.

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.092
But the Red Cross,

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:54.393
you know, the confusion sets in

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:55.861
because the Red Cross says this morning

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:57.129
they aren't aware

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:58.264
of that agreement

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.000
at all, though, ready to help in any way.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.934
Do you see Hamas

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.135
letting the Red Cross in?

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:04.537
What do you see as the role here?

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:07.406
Well,

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.142
Hamas will do what

00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:14.113
it sees in its interests and how it views

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:16.415
that in terms of its broader

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:17.950
interests of extending the cease

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.486
fire indefinitely,

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:23.456
giving itself time to regroup,

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:26.892
trying to present itself as the

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:29.862
the good guys here, you know,

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:32.999
which is very hard for us to see. Right.

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:35.801
But I think when you are looking at it

00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.570
from the Arab world, it looks different.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.838
So, yeah,

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:39.805
I can see it

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:41.707
actually happening in a way

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:42.942
that Hamas tries

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:43.542
to twist it

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.578
into something positive for them

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:46.379
in the end.

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:47.380
You know,

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.914
getting in

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:51.117
there is absolutely the right thing

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:52.718
and the good thing to do. So we'll see.

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:53.886
Have to see how this goes.
