00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:06.680
&gt;&gt; This is CNN breaking news.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, happening right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.480
the U.S. National security adviser Jake&nbsp;
Sullivan is speaking at tel aviv after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.065
meeting with Israeli leaders. Let's&nbsp;
listen in. &gt;&gt; President Biden, on his

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:13.077
[3:49:03 AM]

00:00:13.077 --> 00:00:19.880
&gt;&gt; President Biden, on his visit on October 18th&nbsp;
and our message then is the same as my message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.840
today. But just that the United States stands with&nbsp;
Israel. As president Biden has said many times,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.880
Israel has a right, indeed a duty to defend&nbsp;
itself against hamas. A terrorist group that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.560
committed the worst massacre of the jewish&nbsp;
people since the holocaust. That used and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.640
sexual violence to terrorize Israeli&nbsp;
women. That continues to hold hostages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.520
women, the elderly, the sick, the wounded&nbsp;
and heightened tunnels they purposely built&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.400
under infrastructure. And I'm here today,&nbsp;
on president Biden's behalf to emphasize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.240
our continued commitment to support Israel&nbsp;
in its fight against hamas. Yesterday and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.560
today I met with Israeli prime minister&nbsp;
Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.400
and president her sock and arrangement of&nbsp;
senior officials. We discuss the ongoing war,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.452
the military operations and we discussed our&nbsp;
shared objective of ensuring the hamas will

00:01:14.452 --> 00:01:14.464
[3:50:03 AM]

00:01:14.464 --> 00:01:18.800
of ensuring the hamas will never again pose a&nbsp;
threat to the state of Israel. While minimizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.040
harm to civilians, while ensuring the increased&nbsp;
and sustained flow of humanitarian assistance into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.320
gaza and while working day in and day out, hour by&nbsp;
hour to secure the release of all of the remaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.520
hostages so that they could return home to their&nbsp;
loved ones. We consulted on a joint efforts with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.760
the united nations, with Egypt, and other regional&nbsp;
partners to deliver the humanitarian aid. We did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.840
not do a great job of putting the podium sign on.&nbsp;
And I describe the U.S. Efforts in coordination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.720
with allies and partners to deter attempts to disk&nbsp;
spend the conflict regionally including in the red&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.560
sea and expressed president Biden's commitment&nbsp;
to express income on the blue line through a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.120
combination of deterrence and diplomacy. Later,&nbsp;
today in, fact I will visit from all of to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.320
with president abbas and discuss ongoing promotion&nbsp;
to stability he west bank. Including efforts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.922
confront terrorist attacks him to support&nbsp;
the Palestinian authority security forces

00:02:14.922 --> 00:02:14.934
[3:51:04 AM]

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.680
authority security forces through the U.S.&nbsp;
Security cordon either through Israel and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.800
the Palestinian authority. And their ongoing&nbsp;
efforts to revisit and revitalize the Palestinian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.800
authority. And their initiatives to hold extremist&nbsp;
settlers against Palestinians. I have and will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.000
continue to stay president Biden in the United&nbsp;
States commitment to preserving space for, peace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.120
for a two-state solution where Israel security is&nbsp;
guaranteed. The Israeli people need and deserve to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.960
live in peace and security with their neighbors in&nbsp;
the region that is integrated, dynamic and stable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:54.240
That is what we're working to court. That is what&nbsp;
I discussed with my counterpart here in Israel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.960
Kim. This will be for the future, and will that&nbsp;
will be happy to take your questions. With that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.800
I'll start with Alex on CNN.
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much Jake. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.600
administration has made it clear that you are&nbsp;
hoping that this vital transition at some point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.848
from the science entity face to a lower&nbsp;
intensity face. What does this tell you in

00:03:14.848 --> 00:03:14.860
[3:52:04 AM]

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.360
What does this tell you in terms of the conditions&nbsp;
that need to begin for that to happen? And how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.360
does that sink up with your preferred timeline?&nbsp;
Tim the administration has insisted that they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.120
the attempt to keep the civilian safe. And, we&nbsp;
have CNN and others reporting that almost half of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.240
the 30,000 bombs have been dropped on gaza, from&nbsp;
so-called gun bombs and precise and if there was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.920
a real intent to protect civilians wouldn't they&nbsp;
be using much more precise smaller I munitions?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.520
Tim &gt;&gt; I really appreciate the questions&nbsp;
of the conflict, and I think that there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.000
been some misunderstanding in the reporting.&nbsp;
Not for me. But from others thin when Israel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.600
launched this campaign to rule out the terrorist&nbsp;
threat that hamas poses to the state of Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.098
it may clear from the beginning that this world&nbsp;
will proceed. We are now in the middle of a high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:15.300
intensity phase with ongoing operations,&nbsp;
military operations and in the southern

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.600
[3:53:05 AM]

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.000
operations and in the southern half of gaza.&nbsp;
But there will be a transition to another face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.600
in this world. One that is focused in more&nbsp;
precise ways on targeting the leadership,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:36.320
an intelligence driven up that continues to deal&nbsp;
with the ongoing threat that hamas poses. Tim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.160
so it was obviously a subject of conversation&nbsp;
that I had with the prime minister Netanyahu,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.760
with the war cabinet and with the leadership&nbsp;
on the idf and the defense minister. Tim and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.400
it's important that this conversation is, first&nbsp;
we're not here to tell anybody that you must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.120
be, -- this is our perspective, our, partner as&nbsp;
your. From this is what we believe is the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.160
way to achieve both tactical and strategic goals.&nbsp;
And then second, it has to take place in private.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.560
Because we can't telegraph for the enemy what&nbsp;
the plan is. Tim so I have to speak to timelines,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.511
I have to speak to conditions here from&nbsp;
the podium. But we have very constructive

00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:15.668
[3:54:05 AM]

00:05:15.668 --> 00:05:20.569
But we have very constructive conversation&nbsp;
yesterday. About the transition about the high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:26.720
intensity face forward. And I expected that would&nbsp;
occur, in the future. When exactly that happens an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.680
exactly under what conditions, will be continuing&nbsp;
intensive discussion between the united States and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.240
Israel. Tim I will make sure that conversation,&nbsp;
it least us far as I can do it is going to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.520
and take place behind closed doors. Love when&nbsp;
it comes to the issues to the bombs, the type of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.680
bombs that Israel was using what I would say is&nbsp;
that different types of ammunition, it requires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.720
different types of military operations. Which&nbsp;
means the method by which the bombs delivered,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.400
they don't have the tell kicks on it it's&nbsp;
different in terms of how the planes fly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.040
all the targets have selected. And&nbsp;
they all go through the same process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.871
A process by which it selects processes&nbsp;
and tried to distinguish targets that hit

00:06:13.871 --> 00:06:14.240
[3:55:05 AM]

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.520
distinguish targets that hit hamas, that might&nbsp;
take the lives of innocent civilians. At the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:30.400
end of the, day Israel has the intend that&nbsp;
it strong this distinctions clearly and in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.240
sustainable way. But we want to see the results&nbsp;
matchup to. That that's a conversation that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.720
had in full with them today and yesterday&nbsp;
as well. And we will continue to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.840
Including on the type of ammunitions they&nbsp;
used and when they used a certain type of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:51.200
those are delivered to ensure that from the&nbsp;
United States perspective they are fulfilling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.960
their obligations, their responsibilities&nbsp;
as to international humanitarian law.
