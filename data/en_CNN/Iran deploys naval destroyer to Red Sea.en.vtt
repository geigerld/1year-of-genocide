00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.735
As tensions soar in the Middle East,

00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:04.004
the Iranian navy has deployed a warship

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.238
to the Red Sea.

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:06.139
This movement comes

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.574
just a few days after the US

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:08.508
military sank

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.477
three boats belonging to the Houthis.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.479
The Houthis are an Iranian backed group

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.546
from Yemen

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.381
who have been targeting

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.082
commercial vessels in the Red Sea.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:16.883
Let's bring in CNN's

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:17.617
Natasha Bertrand,

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:19.586
who was following all of this for us.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:20.353
From the Pentagon.

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.388
So Natasha,

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.290
how is the Pentagon responding to this?

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.758
Well, Rachel,

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:25.792
a defense official tells us

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.460
that they are monitoring the situation

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.529
closely, of course, because it comes amid

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.930
all of the rising tensions

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.665
in the Red Sea with the Houthis,

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.267
which are an Iran backed group.

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:34.768
Iran does

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.036
provide support

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.470
and intelligence to the Houthis,

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.305
according to the White House.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.807
And so the US is monitoring

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:41.641
this very closely.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.276
However, it is important to note

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:44.677
that this is not the first time

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:45.812
that Iran has deployed

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:46.846
assets to the Red Sea.

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:49.349
They operate there pretty regularly.

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:51.985
But the US, of course, is eyeing this

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.120
because of the fact that they say that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.955
Iran has been providing the Houthis

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:58.191
with the kind of maritime intelligence

00:00:58.191 --> 00:00:59.826
that they need to select

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.996
targets in the Red Sea as they are hit

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.431
commercial vessels there.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:05.398
There have been

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:06.866
over 100 attacks

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.568
by these Iran backed Houthi militants

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.937
on commercial vessels in the Red Sea

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:13.573
since really in the last month,

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:14.474
a month and a half.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:15.141
And so

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.443
the uptick that we have seen

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.377
is really remarkable

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.845
and it has really ensnared

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:20.480
international shipping and commerce.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.382
The fact that Iran is now there

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:25.785
just a day or two after the US shot down,

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.188
fired on small boats

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:29.656
that contained Houthi militants,

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:30.990
sinking them and killing

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.791
all of those Houthi

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.927
militants on board could be seen

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:34.561
as a sign

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.296
that Iran is trying to present

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.198
a show of force to the Americans.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.500
Of course, who are operating in the area

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.668
because if you'll recall,

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:42.735
the US also set up

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.104
a multinational maritime

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:44.838
task force

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.272
to bolster security

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.006
in the Red Sea,

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.942
to try to prevent the Houthis

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.243
from launching these attacks

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.045
and to escort vessels

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.546
that are transiting the areas

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.515
that they feel safe are going up

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:56.649
and through the Suez Canal

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.884
so that international shipping

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.352
can kind of get back on track here.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:00.920
So this is not right now

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.388
being seen by the Pentagon

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.524
as a direct threat to the US

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:05.959
or any of its allies.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:06.993
Instead, they are watching it

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:07.594
very closely

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:09.062
they do not necessarily think

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.730
that Iran is going to conduct

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.931
any kind of provocations here,

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.199
but both sides

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.701
obviously trying to send a message

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:15.702
to the other there that they are

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:16.636
in the region.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:17.670
They can respond

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.339
if and when they deem it is necessary

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.073
for help.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.508
Now, with huge implications

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:22.775
that that region is

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:23.810
that channels an area

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.178
12% of global commerce

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:25.745
travel through

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.380
Israel has huge implications

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.815
Natasha Bertrand live for us there

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.984
at the Pentagon. Natasha, thank you.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:31.217
All right.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:31.985
Joining us now, CNN

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:32.852
military analyst,

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.354
former NATO supreme allied

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.022
commander General Wesley Clark.

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:38.258
General, this is the Iranian naval vessel

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.259
that is being deployed.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:40.927
I can show you where it's going.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:41.961
It's going in the Red Sea,

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:44.397
particularly down in this area right here

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.366
where there's been a lot of activity

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.734
the last several days.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.202
What is the presence of this

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:50.637
Iranian vessel change?

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.306
Sure it is.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.807
First of all, it's going to collect

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.142
intelligence on U.S.

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:57.977
activities in the area.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.880
It's going to serve as a deterrent

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.017
or they believe it will deter U.S.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.552
actions against the Houthis.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:07.554
It will certainly inhibit us

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:09.556
in the sense of maneuvering.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.991
It's one more factor

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:13.793
for us to consider it.

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:15.995
It raises tensions in the region.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.298
It shows Iran's hegemonic

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.466
aspirations, demonstrates those.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.435
And we'll just have to see where

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:24.237
this goes, John.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:26.005
If the Houthis say okay,

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:26.973
we got the Iranians here

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.041
now, we're not going to interfere

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.677
with the shipping. Fine.

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:31.477
So who do you say now?

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:32.879
We got the Iranians here.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.715
We can do more to interdict the shipping

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.518
Iran has got to get its destroyer

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:39.452
out of the way

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:41.087
as we protect the shipping.

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:43.022
If that destroyer gets in the way,

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:44.624
if it interferes with the shipping,

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:46.392
if it supports the Houthis,

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.027
then that is a challenge

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:49.829
that will have to be met

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.398
by the United States militarily.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:52.932
Well,

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:53.833
if the watches develop

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.201
over the next several days,

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:55.602
let's talk

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.103
about what's happening in Ukraine,

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.672
because Russia has continued its air

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:00.840
assault on this nation,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.575
including the capital of Kiev,

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:03.876
where we have seen

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:06.312
the destruction inside the capital city.

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:06.646
Now, it's

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.481
believed that these attacks carried out

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:09.315
with a number

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.617
of different types of weapons.

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:13.119
But one thing that the Russians are using

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.855
are these airborne hypersonic missiles,

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.691
which can deliver quite a blow

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.561
certainly to civilian areas here.

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:22.662
Talk to us about what

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:23.529
these weapons

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.833
in the fact that Russia is using them.

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:29.302
Well, first of all, these weapons can be

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:31.904
shot down by Patriot missiles,

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:34.507
but the Russians are using them

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:37.277
in combination with other

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.245
devices, with ballistic missiles,

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:41.581
with the Iranian supplied drones

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:42.615
and other things.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.284
And they're coming at such a way

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.351
from such directions

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.387
as to basically overwhelm

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:50.256
the Ukrainians defense management system.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.025
If you could get the Patriots

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:52.959
in the right position,

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:53.693
if you could

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:55.295
choose them at the right time,

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.729
they could stop these missiles.

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:57.964
But there aren't enough Patriots

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.466
to handle all of the requirements there.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.735
So this is an ongoing struggle.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.171
It's going to cause a lot of pain

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.773
and grief in Ukraine.

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:08.541
And the United States and the West

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.842
have got to provide

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:13.012
the assets, more assets to enable Ukraine

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:13.946
to handle this.

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.315
And that's very difficult

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.949
because we're not producing

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.217
and we don't have any excess

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.453
Patriot batteries right now

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.355
as long as we're talking about air power.

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:23.856
We've learned now

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.525
that since this latest

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:27.660
round of air attacks from Russia began,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.128
the polls have said in Poland,

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:30.863
they've said that some of the missiles

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:33.866
have flown over Polish airspace

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.169
And now Poland says it's going to deploy

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.938
some of its warplanes over its country

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:40.740
in its own defense.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.375
Is this posturing, General?

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:43.176
What's going on here?

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:46.279
I think it is posturing.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.780
I think it's a political move

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.116
by the government in Warsaw.

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:52.352
I don't think that the Russians

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.253
intend to strike Poland,

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:57.323
as that's an entirely different scenario

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:58.624
if they're going to do that.

00:05:58.624 --> 00:05:59.525
But on the other hand,

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.227
Poland is showing its concern

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:02.261
and assuring it to shore

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.397
not only its domestic population,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.666
but to the other members of NATO

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.501
and particularly to Germany, France

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:09.769
and the United States.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.738
It's part of Europe asking

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:13.439
the United States to lead.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.509
Do more, get reinforcement equipment

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:20.146
to Ukraine to help Ukraine fight Russia

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.781
in Ukraine.

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:23.916
It's all part of the diplomatic

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.918
signaling going on right now.

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:27.420
General Wesley Clark, as always,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.421
we appreciate your time.

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:29.389
Thank you so much for being with

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.156
us today. Happy New Year.
