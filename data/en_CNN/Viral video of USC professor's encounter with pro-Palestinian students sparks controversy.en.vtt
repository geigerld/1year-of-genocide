00:00:01.019 --> 00:00:02.854
Nick watt has more on the

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:03.855
divisions at another major

00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:06.592
school in California.

00:00:06.592 --> 00:00:08.594
&gt;&gt; I hope they know.

00:00:08.627 --> 00:00:11.163
Look at it.

00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:12.164
&gt;&gt; Reporter: Those five seconds

00:00:12.598 --> 00:00:14.666
have been reposted by national

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.934
influencers, viewed millions of

00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:18.604
times on Instagram.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.938
Watch again.

00:00:20.072 --> 00:00:22.174
&gt;&gt; I hope they all are.

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:23.675
&gt;&gt; Look at the news.

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:25.677
&gt;&gt; Reporter: The caption

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:28.146
attached, this usc professor,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.616
John Strauss, threatened these

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:30.849
students.

00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:32.250
Hope you get killed, and I hope

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:33.619
they all are.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:36.622
During a campus rally for gaza.

00:00:36.622 --> 00:00:39.057
We call on usc to terminate this

00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:39.891
professor immediately.

00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:41.994
The college paper claimed

00:00:42.094 --> 00:00:43.629
tenured economics professor

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:44.963
says, I hope they all are

00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:46.999
killed, walking by an event

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:48.100
mourning Palestinian deaths.

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.701
Is that really what he meant or

00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:51.637
even what he said?

00:00:51.637 --> 00:00:54.706
Strauss, who is jewish and

00:00:54.873 --> 00:00:55.907
pro-Israel appeared on the

00:00:56.074 --> 00:00:57.876
campus news.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.648
&gt;&gt; Media spoke with a usc

00:01:02.648 --> 00:01:04.650
processor who was put on leave.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.786
&gt;&gt; I started getting emails,

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:11.657
very, very nasty emails, things

00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:17.329
from, I hope you die you fascist

00:01:17.663 --> 00:01:21.667
pig, to, palestine forever.

00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.335
&gt;&gt; Reporter: While an actual war

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:25.003
rages thousands of miles away,

00:01:25.137 --> 00:01:29.775
this video and its fallout tip

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:31.677
identified the conflicts on so

00:01:31.677 --> 00:01:32.944
many American college campuses.

00:01:33.078 --> 00:01:35.681
&gt;&gt; We have an atmosphere that's

00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:36.682
hostile to free speech is the

00:01:36.782 --> 00:01:37.683
key problem.

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:38.684
The people who are going to

00:01:38.684 --> 00:01:39.951
college are adults, but a lot of

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:41.887
them are acting like children.

00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:44.189
They want to see people punished

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.690
for their speech.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.058
&gt;&gt; Reporter: So, what actually

00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:48.694
happened that day here in L.A.?

00:01:48.694 --> 00:01:50.095
Well, here is a longer version

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:53.298
of that video, 21 seconds, not

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:54.699
5.

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:59.705
&gt;&gt; People are ignorant.

00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:09.014
&gt;&gt; Professor Strauss, I believe.

00:02:09.114 --> 00:02:11.750
&gt;&gt; Everyone should be killed.

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:13.151
&gt;&gt; And that they should all die,

00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:14.720
everyone one of them, referred,

00:02:14.753 --> 00:02:15.721
of course, to hamas.

00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.323
&gt;&gt; The longer video of professor

00:02:18.724 --> 00:02:20.726
Strauss was shot and posted by

00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:24.396
this student, founder of trojans

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.963
for palestine.

00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:27.733
She asked that we obscure her

00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:29.935
identity for fear of reprisals.

00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:32.037
Your identity is hidden, but you

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.739
exposed the identity of

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:34.072
professor Strauss.

00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:35.741
How do you reconcile that?

00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:37.743
&gt;&gt; Professor Strauss, first of

00:02:37.743 --> 00:02:41.346
all, like, he is, a grown man,

00:02:41.747 --> 00:02:43.014
tenured faculty who harassed

00:02:43.148 --> 00:02:43.915
students.

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:44.750
&gt;&gt; Reporter: He said Strauss

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.185
stepped on the names of the

00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:47.753
dead.

00:02:47.753 --> 00:02:50.989
He said that must have been an

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.757
accident, emotions, she said,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.391
were high.

00:02:52.758 --> 00:02:53.825
&gt;&gt; They were filming the names

00:02:53.992 --> 00:02:55.193
and laughing at them.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.762
&gt;&gt; Reporter: We spoke to a

00:02:56.762 --> 00:02:58.163
jewish student who was there,

00:02:58.296 --> 00:02:59.765
remembering their own dead.

00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:01.767
He did film the names, and he

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.769
was disrespectful.

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.405
He apologizes for any offense

00:03:06.772 --> 00:03:08.039
caused but told CNN he does not

00:03:08.173 --> 00:03:10.242
know for sure that all those

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.377
names are innocent dead

00:03:12.778 --> 00:03:13.779
Palestinians because the source

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.781
is the gaza health ministry,

00:03:15.914 --> 00:03:18.049
controlled by hamas.

00:03:18.216 --> 00:03:19.785
And that's a basic problem on

00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:20.419
these campuses.

00:03:20.786 --> 00:03:23.088
The two sides barely agree even

00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:26.124
on any basic facts.

00:03:26.224 --> 00:03:27.793
&gt;&gt; Trojans for palestine.

00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:29.795
Why did you feel moved to create

00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:30.061
that?

00:03:30.162 --> 00:03:32.130
&gt;&gt; We have a very large jewish

00:03:32.297 --> 00:03:33.131
population on campus.

00:03:33.298 --> 00:03:35.167
We have obviously the --

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:35.801
foundation.

00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:37.469
I've seen a lot of

00:03:37.803 --> 00:03:38.804
misinformation being spread.

00:03:38.937 --> 00:03:40.272
&gt;&gt; Reporter: And the two sides

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:42.974
cannot even agree on the meaning

00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:44.810
of what actually comes out of

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.812
mouths at the many

00:03:46.812 --> 00:03:51.116
pro-palestinian rallies.

00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:51.817
[ Crowd chanting ]

00:03:51.817 --> 00:03:52.818
&gt;&gt; Reporter: Many

00:03:52.818 --> 00:03:53.819
pro-palestinians say it's just a

00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:55.120
call for freedom.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.123
Many Jews say it's a call for

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.225
genocide, for the destruction of

00:04:00.392 --> 00:04:01.393
Israel, which right now lies

00:04:01.827 --> 00:04:02.828
between the river and the sea.

00:04:02.828 --> 00:04:05.831
&gt;&gt; Is there a way back from

00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:08.366
where we are right now, where

00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:12.270
both sides feel similar things

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.840
in terms of their voices being

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.073
suppressed?

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.076
&gt;&gt; On a personal level, no.

00:04:18.176 --> 00:04:21.947
What I know about someone is unequivocally going to support

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.883
Israel, I will cut them out of

00:04:24.983 --> 00:04:25.183
my life.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.185
&gt;&gt; And Nick watt joins us now

00:04:27.352 --> 00:04:27.853
from Los Angeles.

00:04:27.853 --> 00:04:29.988
What more is usc saying about

00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:30.288
this?

00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:31.356
&gt;&gt; Reporter: Well, that's very

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.857
interesting.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.892
What they're saying basically

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:35.093
gives us the other slice of the

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.895
story, which is how college

00:04:37.062 --> 00:04:37.863
administrators across this

00:04:37.996 --> 00:04:39.364
country are struggling to deal

00:04:39.498 --> 00:04:39.865
with this.

00:04:39.865 --> 00:04:42.868
They're trying to not offend,

00:04:42.868 --> 00:04:44.002
and they're making mistakes in

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:45.871
the process, as we've seen on

00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:46.304
capitol hill.

00:04:46.404 --> 00:04:48.173
Here at usc, they say Strauss

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:49.875
was never placed on

00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:50.308
administrative leave.

00:04:50.408 --> 00:04:52.310
He says he was, on November

00:04:52.477 --> 00:04:52.878
10th.

00:04:52.911 --> 00:04:55.280
So, I kept on pushing.

00:04:55.413 --> 00:04:57.916
Eventually they told me, our

00:04:58.016 --> 00:04:58.884
statement discusses his status

00:04:58.917 --> 00:05:00.886
since November 13th.

00:05:00.886 --> 00:05:02.387
Not exactly clear and candid.

00:05:02.521 --> 00:05:04.122
They now say that -- they have

00:05:04.222 --> 00:05:05.891
said all along that they are

00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:08.894
shocked by the comments attached

00:05:08.927 --> 00:05:09.227
to those videos.

00:05:09.394 --> 00:05:10.295
And they now say all

00:05:10.428 --> 00:05:11.196
restrictions are lifted.

00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:13.131
He's allowed back on campus.

00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:14.332
Also worth noting classes for

00:05:14.432 --> 00:05:17.903
the semester have finished.

00:05:17.936 --> 00:05:18.904
They also say he has not been

00:05:18.904 --> 00:05:19.905
punished in any way.

00:05:19.905 --> 00:05:21.406
Last I heard from his lawyer,

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.207
he's still under investigation

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.441
and still could be punished.

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:25.343
As I say, they don't appear to

00:05:25.443 --> 00:05:26.912
know how to deal with all this
