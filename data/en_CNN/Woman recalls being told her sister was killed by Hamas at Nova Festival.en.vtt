00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.583
We're learning much

00:00:00.583 --> 00:00:01.876
more now about the lives

00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:03.169
lost in those brutal Hamas

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.839
attacks on Israel two weeks ago.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:06.673
Among them,

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.676
23, 23 year old Sheera Ayalon.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:10.552
She and a friend

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:12.345
were killed by Hamas terrorists

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.514
at that Nova music festival.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.307
Sheera, sister Adaa Ayalon

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:17.976
joining us now from Tel Aviv.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.936
Eldar, thank you so much for joining us.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:21.271
I wish we were just talking

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.814
under different circumstances

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:23.773
and let me express

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.984
our deepest condolences to you

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:27.569
over your sister's death.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:28.028
First of all,

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.112
what can you tell us about

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:32.574
what happened to her?

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:33.158
SESTERO

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:37.120
Thank you for having me.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.621
Two weeks ago, Sheera

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:42.500
and two of her friends went to their

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:45.045
Nova music festival

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:49.340
and Saturday morning at 7 a.m.,

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:52.260
she recalled my dad telling him there was

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.471
a bombing over there,

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:55.388
which

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:59.476
sadly become a regular thing in here.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.686
She told him that she's scared

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:03.688
and she's going to wait for the panic

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:06.149
to come and come home.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.776
But 30 minutes

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:08.359
up there,

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:11.321
she didn't answer her phone anymore.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:14.866
She was missing for five days.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.409
And after five days,

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.662
we got a message from the army that

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:22.707
they recognized her body.

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:24.876
Her body

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:28.838
lay down in the forest for five days.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.925
Apparently literally

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.676
surrounded the party.

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:35.220
The been planning that

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.305
for a while, apparently.

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:40.308
And they just came inside, started to

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:44.479
automatically shoot everybody over there

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:47.357
stealing the stuff from the bodies.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.192
Nothing.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:52.028
After they done over there,

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.738
they went to the nearest CDs

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:55.240
and people came, just broke

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.577
into houses, steal family babies,

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:01.287
kidnap

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.957
200 people, 200 people,

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:07.710
killing thousands of people.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.755
And

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:12.966
for the state, while she was missing,

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.801
I tried to find some information

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.096
and watch the videos in Telegram.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:21.307
Apparently the Hamas cleared themselves

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:22.600
killing people,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.311
then upload it into romantic dark.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.813
So I watched

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:31.317
all the horrible things that they did

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:32.735
and

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:35.113
we were managed just to locate her phone

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.240
the first day we saw it in Gaza.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.577
So if they kidnap her,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.496
but apparently she was murder,

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.499
they shoot her in the back at around

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:48.251
8 a.m..

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.170
It took to a lot of her friends.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.796
It was driving the party

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:54.674
while I was looking for her

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:57.093
and the stories were the same.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:58.011
They said that once

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:58.928
the shooting was started

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:01.931
and it was a complete chaos,

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:04.601
they hide in the forest for hours.

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.602
They describe it

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:06.936
like they are running

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.355
away from the Nazis.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.356
They tried to

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.149
call for help

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.026
from help from the army and the police,

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.110
but nobody came

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.446
because that there were hundreds

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.113
of tourists

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.657
just shooting cars and the streets

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.659
so nobody can get

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.662
over there to help them.

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:27.081
And apparently there were so many dead

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:30.919
bodies over there that

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.795
it took them like they couldn't

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:34.881
get the bodies to the hospital anymore

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.758
because all of the hospital were full.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.593
So they bring the bodies

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:39.510
to collect the bodies

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.513
and bring them to the near armory,

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:45.600
which is why they it took them six days

00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:48.811
to recognize her and bring her through,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.230
to bury her.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.233
And

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:53.983
she, like

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:54.984
she lay in the forest

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.237
for six days before we buried her.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.030
So said DA.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.864
Tell us a little bit

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:01.157
about your sister, Shira.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:05.245
What was she like?

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.747
She just started her life.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:08.873
She was 23.

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:11.251
She just came back from India.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:14.462
She was very peaceful and kind.

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:18.174
She was about to start university

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:22.804
psychology degree

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:24.222
and she was very gentle

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.015
and very, very dedicated.

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:29.269
And she had nothing to do with this war.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.311
Like,

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:34.315
I can even imagine what kind of monster

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:36.693
tends to hit innocent kids.

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.320
Not not soldiers,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.947
civilians, innocent civilians.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.699
It just came to party

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.952
and to celebrate life.

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:48.329
And we are heartbroken

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.873
like we were devastated about her.

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:56.296
She was so delicate and so peaceful and

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.172
very nonviolent.

00:04:58.172 --> 00:04:59.924
She had nothing to do.

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.384
I don't think that she

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:05.847
could have survived the attack.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.517
No way that she could have made it.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.893
So, so awful.

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.228
The IDF, as you know,

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.355
says more than 200 people are being held

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:16.357
hostage in Gaza right now.

00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:18.401
I know your family tracked your sister's

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.235
phone there

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:20.486
thinking she was perhaps

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:21.946
one of the hostages.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.781
What was it like for your family

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:27.910
during this awful, awful time?

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.955
My parents actually said that

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.958
they prefer her to be that

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:38.296
than to get kidnaped because they know

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.465
that a terrorist, they abuse

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:41.674
the people that kidnap,

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.718
they abuse the dead bodies.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:46.179
They write the woman over there.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.014
So

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.475
they were hoping for her to be dead

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:51.601
on the spot.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:54.437
And yeah, they shut her from the organs,

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:57.440
so she was dead on the spot.

00:05:57.523 --> 00:06:00.526
I guarantee

00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:03.488
I had hope that maybe she got kidnaped

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:07.575
and maybe we can create those those pigs

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:08.201
someday.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.577
I don't know that it's time

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:10.745
that they kidnaped the soldier.

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:11.079
It took

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:14.832
us five years to find his location,

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:19.003
but I have hope that at least we can free

00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:19.545
those two.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:22.507
Had kids and a lorry and baby.

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.634
Those people don't deserve

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:25.635
and deserve for this.

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.179
They're probably in a very bad situation,

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:29.263
like psychologically

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:33.017
and have very bad health situation.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:36.521
I know that most of them

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:37.855
been held

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:41.109
after they already got shot, so

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:44.237
they're dying there in a cell.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.571
Some videos of the Hamas.

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:46.531
They came

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:47.407
like while I was

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.533
when I was looking for her,

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:52.036
I watched hundreds of videos on the mom.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.788
And I think the people that they

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:54.372
they feel

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:56.582
count them little babies in front of them

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:58.209
are very old people.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.044
And most of them were injured,

00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:01.462
like very badly injured,

00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:03.756
like with wound on their legs

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:04.799
and in the stomach.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.676
So

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:10.138
I really hope that we can free them

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:12.890
as best as we can, because we have

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:13.683
we have.

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.686
And I

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.438
as a country, we

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.065
we have responsible for them like we have

00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:22.733
we have responsibility for them

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:25.528
to keep to save them.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:26.654
Adara, I alone.

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:27.655
Thank you very much

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:29.115
for spending a few moments with us.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.825
Our deepest, deepest condolences

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:31.367
to you

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:32.326
and to your family

00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:34.579
and the loss of your loving sister.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.622
And as we say, the finale of Russia.

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:38.416
May her memory be a blessing.
