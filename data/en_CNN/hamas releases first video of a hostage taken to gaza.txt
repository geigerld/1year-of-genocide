WITH BLINKEN, OBVIOUSLY, THEY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING A LOT. ALEX, CLARISSA, NICK, BEN, THANK YOU. MORE ON THE HOSTAGE OF HAMAS RELEASED VIDEO OF BETWEEN -- MIA SHEM'S MOTHER, ALSO HER BROTHERS. &gt;&gt; KAREN, HOW DOES YOUR DAUGHTER LOOK TO YOU? &gt;&gt; I SEE THAT SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH PAIN, SHE IS IN PAIN. . SHE IS INJURED, AND SHE LOOKS A BIT TERRIFIED. BUT, SHE IS ALIVE, AND STABLE. &gt;&gt; DOES IT HELP TO SEE HER? &gt;&gt; OF COURSE, BECAUSE UNTIL NOW EITHER KNOW SHE WAS THAT ARE ALIVE. IT HAS BEEN TEN DAYS, UNTIL SATURDAY SHE W MISSING ON SATURDAY, THIS SAID THAT MAYBE SHE HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED THAT IS ALL. SO, I DID NOT KNOW IF SHE IS ALIVE, ORDERED. EVERY DAY, THE NUMBERS OF THE MISSING AND THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING UP AND CHOIR AND HIGHER. SO, IT'S REALLY TOUGH. &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE WAS TAKEN FROM? WHERE WAS SHE WHEN THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE? &gt;&gt; SHE WENT TO A FESTIVAL Y. &gt;&gt; ALL I KNOW, IT'S SATURDAY MORNING, IT'S 7:00. SHE SENT TEXT MESSAGE TO ONE OF HER FRIEND WHO WAS AT THE PARTY AND SHE WROTE, THEY ARE SHOOTING AT, US PLEASE COME SAVE US. THAT IS THE ONLY THING I KNOW. THE OTHER THING I KNEW WAS RUMORS. CHEVY WAS SHOT, NO I CAN SEE IT'S TRUE BECAUSE SHE IS INJURED, YOU CAN SEE SHE HAD THE OPERATION IN HER HAND, AND WENT TO THIS PARTY WITH HER FRIEND, THEY WENT TOGETHER AND, WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM. IT'S NOT IN THE MISSING LIST, NOT IN THE KIDNAPPED LIST. HE'S ON THAT LIST. WE STILL HAVE BODIES THAT WE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE, BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY. &gt;&gt; WE ARE INTERVIEWING WITH YOU, INTERVIEWING WITH SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE HEARING US AND HOLD VIDEOS AROUND THE WORLD THAT CAN SEE THIS INTERVIEW, TO COME AND STAND WITH US AND STAND WITH HUMAN RIGHTS, AND HELP US GET ME AND ALL THE OTHERS TO 200 IN THE INSOLES, TO HOSTAGES IS GIVING THE GAZA STRIP TO COME BACK HOME. THAT IS ALL WE WANT, JUST TO GET ME BACK TO US. &gt;&gt; WE ARE BEGGING THE WORLD TO BRING BY BABY HOME. SHE IS ONLY 21 YEARS OLD SHE JUST WENT TO A FESTIVAL PARTY AFTER MONTHS THAT SHE DID NOT GO ANYWHERE, SHE HAS MEDICAL PROBLEMS, SHE JUST WANTED TO HAVE SOME FUN. SHE SHOULD NOT BE THERE. SO, WE ARE BEGGING THE WORLD TO INTERFERE AND BRING HER HOME. ALL OF THE OTHERS WE HAVE LIKE 200 MORE HOSTAGES, CHILDREN, BABIES, OLD PEOPLE, HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE ALIVE, IF THEY ARE THE, IF THEY GIVE THEM FOOD. WE DON'T KNOW WHICH CONDITIONS THEY ARE IN. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT SHOWING THE VIDEO THAT HAMAS HAS PUT OUT. BUT, WE ARE SHOWING OTHER PHOTOS OF HER. CAN YOU JUST TELL PEOPLE WHAT SHE IS LIKE? WHAT YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT HER? &gt;&gt; MY DAUGHTER IS VERY MATURE. I'M A SINGLE MOM. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT, AND SHE IS ONLY 21. SHE IS LIKE A 60-YEAR-OLD SMART WOMAN. SHE IS VERY STRONG. THAT IS WHY WE ALL BELIEVE IN OUR HEARTS THAT SHE'S ALIVE.  KNEW THAT SHE'D NEVER GIVE UP. I REALLY KNEW IT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERY TIME WE OPEN THE TV AND THEY SAW THE NUMBERS, IT WAS VERY HARD TO STICK TO THIS. SHE IS A SURVIVOR, AND SHE IS VERY TALENTED, AND I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN. I HAVE A SMALL DAUGHTER, TEN YEARS OLD, AND IS LIKE A MOTHER TO HER. SHE IS VERY CLOSE TO HER SHE COOKS FOR THEM, SHE TELLS THAT THEY'RE TALKING WITH HER ABOUT EVERYTHING. SHE IS JONATHAN CONRICUS A MOTHER LIKE ME RAFAH, AND MY BEST FRIEND. SHE IS VERY CREATIVE, SHE PAINTS, SHE COOKS. SHE MAKES THE FOOD. SHE IS THE HEART OF THE MIA SHEM FAMILY. &gt;&gt; KEREN SCHARF SCHEM, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO US. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD WANT HER TO KNOW, IF FOR SOME REASON SHE COULD SEE THIS? &gt;&gt; I WANT HER TO BE STRONG, AND I WANT HER TO BE SURE THAT THE WORLD WILL DO EVERYTHING TO BRING HER HOME. &gt;&gt; MIA, IF YOU CAN SEE US, WE WANT TO TELL YOU FROM ALL THE FAMILY AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN ISRAEL, WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; WE LOVE. YOU WERE WAITING FOR. YOU &gt;&gt; WILL DO ANYTHING TO BRING YOU BACK HOME. WE WILL NEVER STOP, AND AFTER YOU WE WILL BE HERE. WILL CONTINUE UNTIL ALL OF THE 200 HOSTAGES WILL BE HOME. WE NEVER STOP, AND THE WORK IS WITH US AGAIN. I'M SURE. IT IS NOT OUR WAR. IT'S A VERY BIG WAR. &gt;&gt; KAREN, THANK YOU, I WISH YOU THE BEST. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. &gt;&gt; ON THE TAKING OF HOSTAGES, JOINING ME IS -- FORMER DIVISION CHIEF OF THE HOSTAGES IN M.I.A. UNIT OF THE MUSCLE. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. 199 HOSTAGES, THAT'S THE NUMBER ISRAEL SAYS HAMAS, OTHERS SAY AS MANY AS 250. WHAT LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED FROM HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN ON, THAT HAVE HAPPENED HERE IN THE PAST? &gt;&gt; ISRAEL'S BIGGEST MISTAKE IN THE PAST WAS NEGOTIATING FOR PRISONERS. &gt;&gt; A SOLDIER WHO IS HELD FOR YEARS, EXCHANGE FOR 1000 PERCENT. &gt;&gt; ALL THE TOP IN THE GAZA STRIP ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN RELEASED. &gt;&gt; ALL THE PEOPLE RUNNING HAMAS WERE ISRAELI? THEY GOT OUT. &gt;&gt; THEY GOT OUT. THE HEAD OF HAMAS TODAY, THE OPERATIONAL HEAD OF HAMAS WAS ONE OF THESE PEOPLE RELEASED. THESE PEOPLE HAVE AN OBLIGATION FOR THEIR PRISONERS IN ISRAEL. PART OF THE REGION FOR THIS WHOLE THING IS THE RELEASE OF THEIR PRISONERS. &gt;&gt; PART OF THE REASON FOR THE TERROR ATTACK WAS TO GET PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE. &gt;&gt; TO EXCHANGE. &gt;&gt; THEY NEED IS A HISTORY OF ISRAEL MAKING A DEAL. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; ISRAEL CANNOT AFFORD HAVING ANOTHER SITUATION LIKE THIS. WE CANNOT LIVE WITH HAMAS. YOU COULDN'T, IF THE HAMAS EVER RETURNS TO THE GAZA STRIP, WE ARE FACED WITH A SITUATION. PEOPLE CANNOT LIVE IN AND AROUND THE GAZA STRIP, BUT ALSO IN TEL AVIV. AS YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF. YOU WANT THE SHELTER, AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULD RUN AS A CIVILIAN. WE ARE LOOKING AT AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS FUNDAMENTALIST AND IS PRIMARILY EVIL. IT IS NOT ONLY HERT IS ALL OVER THE WORLD. LOOK AT THE TALIBAN. LOOK AT HIS BALL. A LOOK AT MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THIS THAT HAVE A PURPOSE, AND THEIR PURPOSE IS TO HAVE A JIHAD WITH US. CIVILIZATION IS FACING THE SORT OF SAYING, AND OUR OBLIGATION I THINK IS THE WESTERN WORLD IN THE AMERICAN OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE SHOWN THIS, IS TO GO INTO THE GAZA STRIP AND ERADICATE THE. HAMAS &gt;&gt; SUCH A HORRID LESSON YOU SAY TO NOT NEGOTIATE. ON PAPER, PEOPLE CAN SAY, YES THAT MAKE SENSE, EMOTIONALLY -- &gt;&gt; TERRIBLE. &gt;&gt; IT IS TERRIBLE. 199 FAMILIES AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE RELATED TO THEM WHO ARE DESPERATE. &gt;&gt; IT'S TERRIBLE, EMOTIONALLY, IT'S A TERRIBLE DECISION. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRACTICAL SIDE OF CONDUCTING WAR IN THE GAZA STRIP, WITH ISRAEL WILL DO ALL IT CAN ORDER TO RELEASE THE SOME OF THEM WILL, OR MAYBE ALL OF THEM WILL BE RELEASED, BUT, BY FORCE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ONLY. WAY &gt;&gt; THE ONLY WAY TO RELEASE PRISONERS IN THE SITUATION IS FORCE. NEGOTIATION, WHAT THE HAMAS HAS COME BACK TO US AND SAID, TWICE ALREADY. WE SAID, ALL RIGHT, WE'RE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE THE RELEASE OF THE PRISONERS. WE WANT FIRST OF ALL, I'M CEASE-FIRE. SECOND OF ALL, MEANING STOP KILLING US. STOP ERADICATING US. SECOND, WE WANT ALL OUR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS
