00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:01.789
&gt;&gt;&gt; Top of the hour.

00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:05.850
I'm John Berman with Kate Bolduan and Sara
Sidner.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.009
We just learned Israel has a government in
the war cabinet, this is Benjamin Netanyahu

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.380
who made the announcement moments ago all
of this as hundreds of thousands Israeli reservists

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.810
are staged outside Gaza.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.400
Let's get right to become Anderson who is
in tel aviv who can explain this shift inside

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.250
the government and what it means.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.250
Becky?

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.500
&gt;&gt; This is really important.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.830
What we understand is that these discussions
have now being on for some days, and I have

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.000
to say there was some speculation.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.079
We got this news yesterday, but clearly, these
negotiations on who is in this unity government

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.811
and particularly in what will be this war
cabinet have been very, very difficult, but

00:00:56.811 --> 00:00:57.811
as we

00:00:57.811 --> 00:00:58.811
[10:02:06 AM]

00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:03.180
very difficult, but as we understand it now,
this is Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.240
in unity now in a coalition government in
a car cabinet with Benny Gantz who is the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.880
leader of the national unity party and opposition
leader and former defense minister, of course,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:26.640
and the defense minister Yoav Gallant this
is an emergency situation that is being addressed

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.660
now by those who have experience of war in
government here.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.790
What isn't clear is what the makeup of this
wider group will be and sources have been

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:48.030
telling me that there has been much discussion
and demands made by those in opposition that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:57.100
the right wing ministers, the finance and
security ministers being veer, will not be

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.100
part of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.100
[10:03:09 AM]

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.100
being veer, will not be part of it.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:09.810
All we know at this time is that Benjamin
Netanyahu is now in unity with Benny Gantz

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.349
and the defense minister here gallant to to
address what happens next and the sense is

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:25.190
here that what you didn't have in the cabinet,
in the government until Saturday morning was

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.190
experience.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:37.610
And what you need is Spencer and authority
of characters in position who reflect the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.050
unity of -- of the Israelis.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.541
I am being told now, I am just getting reporting
on this.

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:51.109
This is an emergency cabinet, a war cabinet
at this point.

00:02:51.109 --> 00:03:00.050
&gt;&gt; Becky, for those who -- I mean, who aren't
familiar with the players within Israeli politics

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.239
so much, just some

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.239
[10:04:10 AM]

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.310
politics so much, just some background here
of what a G deal this is as you describe it

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.400
because these are political parties and these
are men who are until now, deeply hostile

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:24.860
with each other and it does underline the
scale of the crisis and how much has changed

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.000
in Israel since Saturday.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.760
Just the background, if you can offer kind
of -- Earth shattering is what Saturday was

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.220
with the hamas terror attack and this as a
response to it.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.129
Just the perspective on that.

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:50.909
&gt;&gt; If we step back and consider what's going
on for months and months as being this deep,

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.930
deep division and reflected on the streets
of tel aviv and reflected in this country

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.920
with hundreds of thousands of Israelis demonstrating
and

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.920
[10:05:11 AM]

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.170
Israelis demonstrating and protesting against
what has been Israel's most right-wing government

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.190
ever.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:18.630
This sense now that there is an absolute need
to bring those who are running this country

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:28.190
together in a war cabinet that can now address
the security concerns that Israel now face

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.880
Wes experience.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.750
There has been much talk around the judicial
reform about how Benjamin Netanyahu and his

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:46.220
right wing have want been focused on what
Israelis themselves believe is important for

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.730
them and on Saturday morning, you know, that
was revealed.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.410
Security and protection.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.190
Where was -- why was there such a failure
of intelligence?

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.550
Why is it now that Israelis feel such a sense
of insecurity and

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.550
[10:06:12 AM]

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.550
such a sense of insecurity and vulnerability?

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:15.080
And it was to the prime minister, to organize
around him, to ensure now the fingers of blame

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:24.880
are pointed to him squarely on what happens
going forward and now the crucial nature of

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.360
what is in play here.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:36.199
The complexity of what happens next with regard
of any incursion, ground incursion into gaza.

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:42.790
The sense now that the decisionses that are
made here in Israel about what happens in

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:49.509
the days and weeks ahead should not be left
to a government that, frankly, didn't have

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:54.240
the experience in cabinet to address these
issues.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.240
So that now looks like the makeup that we
have in what is this new war cabinet, if I

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.450
can describe it as such with the current defense
minister, the

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.450
[10:07:13 AM]

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.740
current defense minister, the former defense
minister Benny Gantz and Benjamin Netanyahu

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.980
and heading up the decision making for the
state of Israel to address, as I say, the

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.580
complexities of what happens next.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.680
Let's just consider those.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.470
They have a ground incursion on the table.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:32.669
They have described by the idf saturated the
southern border with troops no in anticipation,

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:36.040
one assumes, of a ground incursion.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:43.040
We're not seeing that as of yet, but the complexities
we've been reporting now for hours in that

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:50.169
you have these hostages being held in various
locations as described by hamas around gaza

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:55.910
and then the wider story which is the plight
of the Palestinians who are in gaza.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:04.319
We have a thousand dead and a total siege
of gaza and hospitals being bombed and no

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:05.319
fuel now to the palace station

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:06.319
[10:08:17 AM]

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.490
fuel now to the palace station there.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.470
Palestinians do work with H generators in
gaza.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:18.530
So there will be some generation of electricity
and provided by generators, but you know,

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.690
considering what it is that Israel faces is
decision making now and it has been clear

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:30.080
for some time that there was a need for -- I
don't want to call it levelheadedness, but

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:38.120
experience, and this will be -- this will
be demands from the outside -- from the international

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.330
community, from capitals around the world,
particularly from Washington demands that

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.840
this war cabinet
