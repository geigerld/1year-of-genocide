&gt;&gt; CNN'S OREN LIEBERMANN ENTERED GAZA WITH THE ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES TO SEE THE TUNNEL SHAFT NEAR AL-SHIFA, AND WHAT LIES BENEATH. CNN REPORTED FROM GAZA UNDER IDF ESCORT AT ALL TIMES, AS A CONDITION FOR JOURNALISTS TO JOIN THEM. THE MEDIA OUTLETS HAVE TO SUBMIT FITTED FOOTAGE FILMED IN GAZA TO THE IDF FOR REVIEW. CNN RETAINED EDITORIAL CONTROL OVER THE FINAL REPORT, HERE IS ORANGE REPORT. &gt;&gt; WE GO UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS, AS WE CROSS THE BORDER FENCE IT'S LIGHTS OUT ACROSS THE GAZA STRIP. ESCORTED BY THE TANK, SWITCH INTO PERSONNEL CARRIER FOR THE FINAL STRETCH. EVEN THROUGH A NIGHT VISION SCREEN, YOU CAN SEE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DESTRUCTION ON THE STREETS OF GAZA CITY. WE OFF-LOAD AT THE AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL, MAKE OUR WAY ACROSS -- OR WHAT'S LEFT OF IT. WE NEED TO KEEP OUR LIGHTS OFF MOST OF THE TIME OR RISK EXPOSING OUR POSITION. ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES ESCORT AT ALL TIMES. AS A CONDITION FOR JOURNALIST TO JOIN THIS WITH THE IDF, THEY MUST SUMMIT FOOTAGE FELL TO THE ISRAELI MILITARY CENSORS FOR REVIEW. WITH THE HOSPITAL COMPOUND WE WAIT INSIDE A STRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE THE AREA IS SECURE BEFORE MOVING A SHORT DISTANCE TO THE EXPOSED SHAFT. &gt;&gt; HERE IS THE ENTRANCE, YOU SEE WHAT'S A LADDER ACCESS, AS I STEP OVER HERE, IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW DOWN IT GOES. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A CENTRAL SHAFT OR STAIRCASE. AND THE SHAFT THEN DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; WE MOVE AROUND THE OPENING FOR A BETTER LOOK AT THE SHAFT, IT'S CLEAR FROM HERE THAT THIS IS MEANT TO GO DEEP UNDERGROUND. &gt;&gt; WHICH DIRECTION WAS THE TUNNEL GOING IN? &gt;&gt; WE ASSUME THE TUNNEL GOES OUT, IT HAS ANOTHER ORDER THIS WAY, TOWARDS THE HOSPITAL. YOU EXIT THE HOSPITAL TO OUTSIDE [INAUDIBLE] THE WAY HAMAS IS WORKING AS IT'S GOING OUT SOMEWHERE, SHOOTING TO THE FORCES AND GOING BACK INSIDE TO THE SAFE PLACE. &gt;&gt; WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO ENTER THE SHAFT, ISRAELI MILITARY HAVE SPECIAL GEAR DOWN TO SEE WHERE IT LEADS. INSIDE THE VIDEO SHOWS A SPIRAL STAIRCASE AS THE CAMERA ORIENTS ITSELF IT MOVES FORWARD INTO A TUNNEL. THE TUNNEL MAKES A SHARP LEFT TURN AND THE END OF ANOTHER PATH -- AND ARCH CONCRETE TOP. THERE WAS A METAL DOOR THAT THEY HAVE NOT YET OPENED AS THEY FEAR IT'S BOOBY TRAPPED. THE IDF SPOKESMAN, DANIEL HAGARI, SOME OF THE HOSTAGES TAKEN WERE ALSO BROUGHT TO THE HOSPITAL. HE SAYS THE BODY OF NOAH MARCIANO WAS DISCOVERED 50 METERS FROM THE COMPOUND. &gt;&gt; WE HAD EVIDENCE THEY WERE HOLDING HOSTAGE HOSTAGES, AND THEY WERE BRINGING THEM TO THE AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL, THE PLACES THEY MAY HAVE HELD THEM. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT PROOF OF A HAMAS COMMAND CENTER, WITH HEADQUARTERS OF ME AT THE HOSPITAL, BUT THEY CONTINUE TO BUILD ITS CASE THAT HAMAS USES THE SANCTUARY THE HOSPITAL -- HAVE DENIED. THE IDF'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE ITS OPERATION IN GAZA, THE CREDIBILITY OF ISRAEL AS THE NUMBER KILLED IN THE FIGHTING SURPASSES 12,000. ACCORDING TO THE HAMAS MINISTRY OF HEALTH. THE IDF AS ONE OF ITS SYSTEMS HAVE DESTROYED HAMAS BUT WITH INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM MOUNTING, ISRAEL NEEDS TO SHOW THE TEAR ORGANIZATION USING GAS AND CIVILIANS AS COVER TO JUSTIFY AN ONGOING WAR. OR LIEBERMAN CNN, IN GAZA. &gt;&gt; OREN GOES INTO MUCH MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT HE SAW IN GAZA, AND YOU CAN READ ABOUT IT ON CNN.COM. CNN'S CLARE SEBASTIAN IS FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS, AND JOINS US LIVE FROM LONDON. GOOD MORNING CLAIRE, WHAT MORE ARE YOU LEARNING ABOUT THE IDF VIDEOS THAT CLAIMS TO SHOW A VIDEO OF A TUNNEL. AND THE CCTV FOOTAGE THAT REPORTEDLY SHOWS HAMAS HOSTAGES BEING BROUGHT INTO THE HOSPITAL ON OCTOBER SEVEN. &gt;&gt; YES ROSEMARY, THEY HAVE BEEN PUTTING OUT PIECES OF EVIDENCE, IMAGES, VIDEOS CENSUS TARGETED AND PRECISE OPERATION AT AL-SHIFA BEGAN OVERNIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY LAST WEEK. THEY ASSURED US ON WEDNESDAY, WHAT THEY SAY WAS AN EXPOSED TUNNEL SHAFT. WE'VE SEEN A REAL EXPANSION OF THIS THE LAST 12 HOURS OR SO. THE VIDEO SHOWS THE CAMERA BEING LOWERED, ALLOWING INTERNATIONAL JOURNALIST LIKE OUR OWN OREN LIEBERMANN TO SEE THE TUNNEL SHAFTED SELF. NOW, WE HAVE THE CCTV FOOTAGE, WHICH THE IDF CLAIMS HOSTAGES BEING BROUGHT INTO AL-SHIFA, ON THE VERY DAY OF THAT HAMAS MASSACRE IN ISRAEL ON OCTOBER SEVEN. WHICH WOULD SHOW, ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT VERIFY THE AUTHENTICITY, OR IDENTITY. BUT IT WAS SHOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN USING THE COMPLEX SINCE THE BEGINNING. WHAT THE IDF SIZES AND INJURED HOSTAGE, BEING BROUGHT IN, CLEARLY STILL BLEEDING. ONE IS NEPALI, AM ONE IS. TY HAHN LAST MEANWHILE IS QUESTIONING THE HEALTH MINISTRY, RATHER THAN QUESTION THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS. SAYING ALL IT REALLY SHOWS IS THAT ANYONE WHO NEEDS MEDICAL TREATMENT AT AL-SHIFA WAS GIVEN THAT MEDICAL TREATMENT. AND WE SEE ONE HOSTAGE THAT WAS NOT INJURED. WE SEE THIS CAMPAIGN FROM INJURY AL TO REALLY TRY TO PROVE ITS CLAIM, AS IT HAS BEEN CLAIMING FOR WEEKS NOW, THAT HAMAS IS OPERATING A COMMANDING CONTROL NODE UNDER THE AL-SHIFA IF THEY CAN CONCLUSIVELY PROVED, THAT THEY HAVE NOT CONCLUSIVELY PROVEN IT YET. THEY HAVE NOT WITH THE TUNNEL, THEY HAVE NOT GONE THROUGH THE BLAST PROOF DOOR, THEY ASSUME IT LEADS TO THE HOSPITAL, BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW YET. IF THEY CAN PROVE, AMID MOUNTING CRITICISM, THAT THE HOSPITAL IS BEING USED FOR MILITARY PURPOSES AND IT LOSES ITS PROTECTIVE STATUS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW. PRESSURE IS MOUNTING INTERNATIONALLY, MEANWHILE WE ARE HEARING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THAT HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS ARE PROGRESSING CLOSER THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. THOSE CCTV VIDEOS ADD EXTRA URGENCY TO, THAT IN PARTICULAR. ROSEMARY? &gt;&gt; CLARE SEBASTIAN JOINING US LIVE FROM LONDON, MANY THANKS. LET'S BRING IN RETIRED COLONEL  CEDRIC LEIGHTON. COLONEL, IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU, I WANT TO BRING US BACK TO  SOME OF THAT VIDEO WE SHOWED AT  BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE VIDEO, WE SEE A CLOSED METAL DOOR. AND THE IDF SAYS THAT THAT DOOR  UNDER THE HOSPITAL HAS NOT BEEN  OPENED OUT OF FEAR OF IT BEING  BOOBY-TRAPPED. WHAT COULD BE BEHIND THE DOOR  THAT WE SEE IN THE IDF VIDEO? &gt;&gt; YEAH, GOOD MORNING, KASIE,  THERE COULD BE A LOT OF THINGS  BEHIND THAT DOOR, ONE  SUPPOSITION IS THAT IT'S AN  ARMED STORAGE FACILITY BY HAMAS. THAT THEY HAVE A LOT OF WEAPONS  STORED BEHIND THAT DOOR. MORE LIKELY, THOUGH, GIVEN THE  TYPE OF DOOR THAT IT IS IT'S A  BLAST DOOR THAT'S DESIGNED TO  WITHSTAND EXPLOSIONS, IT'S  POSSIBLE THAT IT CONTAINS  COMMUNICATIONS GEAR FOR HAMAS  AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, THAT  COULD BE IN LINE WITH THE GEAR  THAT THE ISRAELIS HAVE REPORTED  THAT THE COMMAND AND CONTROL  CENTER FOR HAMAS. THERE ARE ALL OTHER KINDS OF  POSSIBILITIES, BUT THOSE ARE THE TWO MOST LIKELY. AND IT COULD BE A COMBINATION OF THOSE TWO. SO, THAT'S THE KIND OF THING  THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT, CLEARLY,  THEY WANTED TO PROTECT THIS  AREA, HAMAS DID. IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THERE  MAY BE OTHER ELEMENTS THERE OF,  YOU KNOW, ACTUAL TROOPS THERE. AND ACTUAL HAMAS FIGHTERS THERE. SO, THAT'S, YOU KNOW, THAT'S  ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY. BUT OF COURSE, THE ISRAELIS ARE  WORRIED THIS MIGHT BE A  BOOBY-TRAPPED AREA SO THEY'RE  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET  THERE WITHOUT DESTROYING  THEMSELVES OR DAMAGING THE  EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT BE BEHIND  THAT DOOR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. OKAY. SO, WE ALSO SHOWED AND THE CCTV  FOOTAGE THAT THE IDF RELEASED OF HAMAS MOVING TWO HOSTAGES ONE IS NEPALL  NEPALI, THE OTHER IS THAI. WHERE MIGHT THOSE HOSTAGES BE  NOW? AND WHAT DOES THE FACT THAT THEY CAME THROUGH THE HOSPITAL TELL  YOU? &gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE  THEY MIGHT BE NOW. THE SUPPOSITION WOULD BE THAT  THEY WOULD BE IN THE TUNNELS  SOMEWHERE ELSE, PERHAPS, WITHIN  GAZA. OF COURSE, ONE OTHER  POSSIBILITY, YOU KNOW, THEY  COULD BE BEHIND THAT GLASS DOOR  WHICH I DON'T THINK IS LIKELY. BUT YOU NEVER KNOW IN A CASE  LIKE THIS. AS FAR AS THE FACT THAT THEY  CAME INTO THIS HOSPITAL, IF  EVERYTHING CHECKS OUT IN TERMS  OF THE ACCURACY OF THIS VIDEO  AND THES REALLY ASSERTION THAT,  ACCORDING, YOU KNOW, TO THE IDF. THAT TELLS YOU THAT, CLEARLY,  HAMAS HAS SOME KIND OF ACTIVITY  AT THE AL SHIFA HOSPITAL. NORMALLY, HOSTAGE TAKERS WILL  BRING THEIR HOSTAGES TO A PLACE  THAT IS SAFE FOR THEM. AND IT COULD ALSO BE A MAJOR  NODE FOR THEM, EITHER A  HEADQUARTERS TYPE ELEMENT OR  SOME OTHER INSTALLATION THAT  THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER, THAT'S  WHY THIS IS PARTICULARLY  NOTEWORTHY. &gt;&gt; RETIRED GENERAL CEDRIC  LEIGHTON, THANK YOU FOR GETTING  US STARTED.
