00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.736
Yesterday, families all across America

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.939
gathered together their loved ones

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.041
and to to give thanks.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.710
We must be thankful for an America

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.379
The food in our tables, the family

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.680
and loved ones in our homes.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.448
And the many blessings

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:16.249
that come from living

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.318
in the greatest nation on earth.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:18.852
Today,

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.720
we can also be thankful of families

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.322
being recruited

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.656
and reunited

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:24.457
with loved ones

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:26.426
who have been held hostage

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.561
for nearly 50 days.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.829
Beginning this morning,

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.132
under a deal reached by extensive U.S.

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:34.200
diplomacy, including numerous calls

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.803
I've made from the Oval Office to leaders

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.371
across the region

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.974
fighting in Gaza will halt for four days.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.144
There's still also a structure to allow

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:45.211
a pause

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.346
to continue

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:49.015
for more than 50 hostages to be released.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:51.818
That's our goal this morning.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.853
I've been engaged with my team

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:54.587
as we began

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.256
the first difficult days of implementing

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.390
this deal.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:59.059
It's only a start

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.394
but so far it's gone well.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:02.996
Early this morning, 13

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:05.065
Israeli hostages were released,

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.433
including an elderly woman,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:07.500
her grandmother

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.636
and mothers with their young children.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.205
Some under the age of six years old.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.207
Separately, several

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.309
Thai nationals and Filipino nationals

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.244
were also kidnaped by Hamas

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:18.978
on the seventh.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.146
They were released as well.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:21.648
All of

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:22.615
these hostages have

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.918
been through a terrible ordeal.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:25.919
And this is the beginning

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.621
of a long journey of healing for them.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.790
The teddy bear is waiting to greet

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.093
those children at the hospital

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.961
are a stark reminder of the trauma

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.796
these children have been through

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:39.232
and at such a very young age.

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.934
Jill and I are Jill's with me here,

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.536
keeping them all in our prayers today.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:44.604
Today

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:45.705
today has been a product,

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:46.773
a lot of hard work

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.975
and weeks of personal engagement.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:49.576
From the moment

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.578
Hamas kidnaped these people,

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:52.712
I, along with my team,

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:53.713
have worked around the clock

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:55.648
to secure their release.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.417
We saw the first results of this ever

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.486
with the release of two American hostages

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.287
in late October,

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.655
followed by the release of two

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.491
Israeli hostages.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.493
I've consistently pressed for a pause

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.727
in the fighting

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:08.895
for two reasons

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:09.662
to accelerate

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.431
and expand humanitarian assistance

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:12.866
going into Gaza

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.467
and to to facilitate

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.436
the release of hostages.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:17.670
And over the past several weeks,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.172
I've spoken repeatedly

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:20.740
with the emir of Qatar,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.408
the President Sisi of Egypt,

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:23.309
and Prime Minister

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.111
Netanyahu of Israel

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.412
to help secure this deal,

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.248
to nail it down.

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:29.716
And I want to thank all three leaders

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:30.950
for their personal partnership

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.552
to get this done.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.554
I spoke with the emir and President

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:36.289
el-Sisi, the prime minister

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.057
Netanyahu again on Wednesday

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:38.725
to confirm

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.660
the elements of the engagement.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.861
As I said,

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:42.996
today's release

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.632
are the start of a process.

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:46.900
We expect more hostages

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.368
to be released tomorrow

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:48.735
and more

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:51.404
the day after, more the day after that.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:52.539
Over the next few days,

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.072
we expect

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:54.440
that dozens of hostages

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.342
will be returned to their families.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.644
We also remember all those

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:59.245
who are still being held.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.647
And renew our commitment to work

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.582
for their release as well.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:05.852
Two American women and 14 year old child,

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.621
Abigail who remains among those missing.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:10.723
We also will not stop

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:13.026
until we get these hostages brought home

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.662
in an answer to their whereabouts.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.397
I remain in personal contact

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:18.898
with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:19.899
and Israel

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.135
to make sure this stays on track

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.603
and every aspect

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:24.604
of the deal is implemented.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:26.673
You know,

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:27.707
this extended pause

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:28.775
in the fighting

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.543
brings a critical opportunity to deliver

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.844
much needed food,

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:32.912
medicine, water

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:35.448
and fuel to the civilians in Gaza.

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:38.384
And we are not wasting one single minute

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:41.221
since my trip to Israel last month.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:41.854
I've been focused

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:42.622
on accelerating

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:43.156
the delivery

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:45.692
of humanitarian assistance to Gaza

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.560
in coordination with the United Nations

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.229
and the Red Cross.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.130
I just spoke with my special envoy

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.898
for the Middle East

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.000
humanitarian issues, David Satterfield,

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.668
for an update.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.136
And I've asked him to monitor

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:58.538
our progress hour by hour

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:00.940
and keep me personally informed.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.141
From the beginning.

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.743
We put in place mechanisms

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:04.777
to prevent Hamas

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:07.113
from diverting these supplies.

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:09.182
And we're continuing that effort

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:10.149
to make sure

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.218
aid gets to the people who need it.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.153
More than 200

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:14.887
trucks arrived

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:15.822
at the crossing point

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:17.924
in Egypt into Gaza today.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.926
These trucks carry food and medicine

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:22.895
as well as fuel, fuel and cooking gas.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:24.631
The fuel will be used

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:25.999
not only to power the trucks

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.501
delivering this lifesaving supplies,

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:30.570
but for desalinization,

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.072
for water wells, for hospitals,

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.841
and for bakeries.

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:35.575
And hundreds

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:36.776
more trucks are getting them

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.111
positioned as well,

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.212
ready to enter Gaza

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:41.281
over the coming days to support

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.482
the innocent Palestinians

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.816
who are suffering greatly

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.151
because of this war

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:47.287
that Hamas has unleashed.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.622
Hamas doesn't give a damn about them.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.157
We also look to the future.

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:52.191
As we look to the future,

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:54.460
we have to end this cycle of violence

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.528
in the Middle East.

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:56.996
We need to renew our resolve

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:59.165
to pursue this two-State solution,

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:00.667
where Israelis and Palestinians

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:01.334
can one day

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:04.170
live side by side in a two-State solution

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:06.606
with equal measure of freedom and dignity

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.875
to states for two peoples.

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:12.045
And it's more important now than ever.

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.347
Hamas unleashed this terrorist attack

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:15.315
because they fear

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.582
nothing more than Israelis

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:17.650
and Palestinians

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.853
living side by side in peace

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.655
in order to continue down the path

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.957
of terror and violence and killing war.

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:27.660
Did you give Hamas what they seek?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.462
We can't do that.

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:30.730
So today,

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.632
let's continue to be thankful

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:34.701
for all the families who are now

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:35.668
and those

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:37.737
who will soon be brought together again.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:40.273
And I want to once again

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:41.808
thank the emir of Qatar.

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.176
President Sisi of Egypt

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.210
and Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.411
for their partnership

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:46.512
to make what we've done

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:47.947
so far and possible

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:50.316
and for their continued leadership

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:51.517
as we all keep working

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.686
to implement this deal.

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.321
And over the coming days,

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:56.923
I'll remain engaged with leaders

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:58.391
throughout the Middle East

00:05:58.391 --> 00:05:59.592
as we all work together

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:01.661
to build a better future for the region.

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:04.664
A future where this kind of violence

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:05.898
is unthinkable,

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:07.800
a future for all children and region.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.901
Every child,

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.536
Jewish, Muslim, Christian,

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.538
Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.340
Grow up knowing only peace.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.175
That's what we do.

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:17.710
We're waiting now.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.711
We have just a matter.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.179
I thought maybe even as soon

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:22.081
as by the time I got here,

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:23.015
but in the next hour

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:23.916
or so, we'll know what

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:26.018
the second wave of releases are.

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:28.488
And I'm hopeful that is sensible

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:29.756
as we anticipate.

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:31.424
So thank you all for listening.

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:32.658
I'll take a few questions.

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:32.859
Mr.

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:34.527
President, when will that first

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:36.262
American hostages be released

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:38.331
and so were included today?

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.966
We don't know when that will occur,

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:42.135
but we're going to be expected to occur,

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:44.070
and we don't know what

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.972
the list of all the hostages are

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:47.373
and when they'll be released.

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:48.841
But we know the numbers.

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.309
They're going to be released.

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.543
So it's

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.712
my hope and expectation would be soon.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.380
And other ten Americans either

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.314
unaccounted for

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:56.749
or do not all of our conditions.

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:57.884
Are they all alive?

00:06:57.884 --> 00:06:59.886
We don't know all the conditions.

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:00.153
Mr.

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:01.521
President, how long expected

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:02.855
this war is going to take?

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:03.856
Have you heard

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:05.191
Prime Minister Netanyahu's

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:06.592
exact timeline to say

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:10.563
I have encouraged

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:13.566
the prime minister to

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.472
to focus on

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:23.142
trying to reduce the number of casualties

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:25.378
while he is attempting

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:26.679
to eliminate Hamas,

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:28.281
which is a legitimate objective.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:31.150
Yes, that's a difficult task.

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:34.420
And I don't know how long it will take.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.455
My expectation

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.591
and hope is that as we move forward,

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.493
the rest of the Arab world in the region

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:41.694
is also

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:43.796
putting pressure on all sides

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.198
to slow this down,

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:46.899
to bring this to an end

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:48.134
as quickly as we can.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:48.401
Mr.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:48.901
President,

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.736
what are the chances of a truce

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:53.039
could be extended by a few days?

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:53.940
Or more?

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:56.209
I think the chances are real.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:56.442
Mr.

00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:56.943
President,

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:58.177
there are members of your party

00:07:58.177 --> 00:07:59.011
who would like to see

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:01.514
conditions placed on aid to Israel.

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:02.882
What is your view on that?

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:03.816
They would like to see

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:06.052
the adoption

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:11.357
Well, I think that works well for it.

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:12.325
But I don't think

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.326
if I started off with that,

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.561
we haven't gotten to where we are today.

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:16.329
We have to take this

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.030
a piece of the time Mr.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.066
President, you trust Hamas, but

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:23.035
I don't trust Hamas to do anything right.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.639
I only trust Hamas to respond to pressure

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:28.641
from the center,

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:29.909
hoping to get cooperation

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:30.843
from Arab leaders.

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:31.744
What are you hearing from them

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:32.512
when you talk to them?

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.113
What do you want to see?

00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:35.648
I'm hearing a lot,

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:36.816
but I'm not going to speak to it

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:37.650
right now.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.085
There's an overwhelming desire

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:41.287
on the part of the region

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:43.623
to let me back up.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.393
I cannot prove what I'm about to say.

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:49.195
But I believe one of the reasons

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.330
why Hamas struck when they did

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.064
was they knew that

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:52.798
I was working

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.901
very closely with the Saudis

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:56.836
and others in the region.

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:58.471
To bring peace to the region

00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:00.806
by having recognition of Israel

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.109
and Israel's right to exist.

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:04.010
You may recall

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.378
when we did the G-20

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.179
about a little while ago,

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:08.614
I was able to get a resolution.

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:11.050
I made a statement passed through there

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:13.185
saying we're going to build a railroad

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:13.986
from Riyadh

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:14.420
all the way

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.254
through the Middle East

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:18.324
into into Saudi Arabia, Israel, etc.,

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:19.892
and all the way up to Europe,

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.260
not the not the railroad,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.029
but being an underground pipeline

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:24.463
and then railroad.

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:25.331
The whole idea

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.933
is there's overwhelming interest.

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:29.402
And I think most Arab nations know it

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.370
and coordinating with one another

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.573
to change the dynamic in their region

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.708
for a longer term peace.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.143
And that is

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:38.711
what I'm going to continue to work on.

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:40.112
Thank you all very, very much.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.881
I appreciate it. Thank you.

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:45.718
Happy Thanksgiving to all

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:46.552
I hope you enjoy.
