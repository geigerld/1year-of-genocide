00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.585
Tonight, a senior Hamas leader is dead

00:00:02.585 --> 00:00:03.795
amid serious concerns

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:05.171
the war in the Middle East

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.256
is about to get bigger.

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:08.049
Salah al-Hariri, a top official

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.176
in Hamas's military and political wings,

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.344
killed in Beirut.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:12.595
Hamas says the leader was killed

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:13.722
by an Israeli airstrike.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:14.806
Israel, however,

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:17.017
is not taking responsibility.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.101
And this is all happening

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.269
as Iran has dispatched

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.229
a naval destroyer to the Red Sea.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:22.731
Tensions there escalating

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.149
following a series of attacks

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.317
by the Iranian backed Houthi militia,

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.361
including against the United States.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.280
And now the US Navy has killed Houthis

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.239
for the first time

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.907
since this conflict broke out,

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:33.742
sinking three

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.368
the boots at boats, rather,

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.328
after being attacked in the Red Sea

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.455
this weekend.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.206
Oren Liebermann is OUTFRONT tonight.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:40.957
At war in the U.S.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.584
really getting drawn further

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.335
and further into this conflict.

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:46.755
Iranian involvement clearly evident.

00:00:47.338 --> 00:00:49.049
What is the U.S. going to do next?

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:50.425
Eric, the

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:51.676
Biden administration's

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:52.218
position is

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:52.635
they don't

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:54.345
want to see a regional escalation.

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:54.763
They don't want to see

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:56.264
a widening of the war.

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:58.224
But clearly, it's not just up to the U.S.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.684
to make a unilateral decision

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:00.518
in this case.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:01.478
The events we've seen over

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.188
the course of the past couple of days

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.231
make a widening of the war,

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.233
an escalation, a growing possibility,

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:08.318
not only, as you pointed out

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:09.402
over the weekend,

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.779
the US military and U.S.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.155
attack helicopters sinking

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.115
three fast attack boats

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:14.616
that were going

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:15.825
after a commercial vessel

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:17.535
and killing the cruise of those

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:18.661
for the first time

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:19.537
since the war,

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:20.121
but also

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.831
now the killing of such a brewery,

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.626
a senior Hamas militant in Beirut.

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.961
So the US has to watch all of this.

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:27.337
The U.S.

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:28.254
does have the backing

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.506
of an international coalition

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:30.173
in the Red Sea,

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.716
and that gives it essentially

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.760
some weight here in its actions. The U.S.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.970
monitoring that Iranian Navy vessel

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.597
that's in the Red Sea from the U.S.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:38.306
is a position.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:39.933
It is an international waterway,

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.142
a critical one

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:42.852
that so they're allowed to be there.

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:43.269
But the U.S.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.771
military will keep a very close

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:45.563
eye on them

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:47.857
as it watches where this all goes.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.275
For the killing of Saleh

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.568
al-Hariri, who you saw there

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.821
with the Ayatollah, the leader of Iran.

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:54.447
We've seen promises

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:55.240
of revenge

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.199
and condemnation

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.326
from the Iranians, from Hamas,

00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:00.286
Hezbollah and even some others.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:00.745
The question

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.247
now, of course, what do they do?

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.623
And they have a number of options.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.000
All of these Iranian proxies attack U.S.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.752
forces in Iraq and Syria.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:08.503
Go after U.S.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.088
vessels in the Red Sea with the Houthis

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:12.382
there from Yemen, attack Israel.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:13.424
Iran doesn't really see

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:14.968
much of a difference between the U.S.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:15.635
and Israel.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.595
So this is all possibilities

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:18.763
that we have to watch out for

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.765
and that the U.S. is watching out for.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:21.641
Now, as you know,

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:22.267
Israel hasn't

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.852
officially taken responsibility

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:24.769
for the killing of Salah

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.146
al-Hariri in Beirut.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:26.855
Israeli officials

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.606
have been a bit coy about this,

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:29.858
but it is worth pointing to this

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:31.484
tweet from Danny Danon,

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:32.694
a current member of Knesset

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:33.611
and the former Israeli

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:35.113
ambassador to the U.N..

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.281
He said on Twitter,

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.073
I congratulate

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:38.700
the IDF, the Shin Bet, the Mossad

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.285
and the security forces for killing

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:41.703
senior Hamas official Salah

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.121
al-Hariri in Beirut.

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.164
Anyone who was involved

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.373
in the October 7th

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.124
massacre should know

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:46.833
that we will reach them

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.042
and settle the account with them.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:49.669
So Eric are pretty clear there.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:50.170
It's also worth

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.546
remembering that Benjamin Netanyahu

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:52.630
promised Israel would go

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.591
after Hamas leaders wherever they are.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:55.758
Yeah, that's for sure.

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:56.968
And appreciate the reporting as always.

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:57.427
Thank you.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.387
OUTFRONT now, retired

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:01.306
Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.307
Good to see you tonight.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.808
So let's pick up right there where

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:04.893
we're often left off.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:05.768
The senior Hamas

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:06.311
leader, general,

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.104
who was killed by this strike

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:08.938
in southern Lebanon.

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:10.231
Also a long time

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.609
military political leader in Hamas.

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:13.943
How likely

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:14.277
do you think

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:15.403
some sort of retaliation

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.655
is in the next 24 to 48 hours?

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.158
This is what Oren's reporting.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:21.910
First of all, Erica, is

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.827
it was phenomenal.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.078
But this is the kind of thing

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:25.205
that the Biden administration

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.331
has been worried about.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:27.749
They have been trying to repress

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.043
any kind of expansion of this conflict.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.712
And this strike in Beirut against

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:33.963
the Hamas leader is

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:36.216
is not going to help that at all.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.300
You also have to consider

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.052
that the Hezbollah leader,

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.470
Nasrallah, has said

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.346
that any strikes

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.723
inside of Lebanon by Israel,

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.058
especially in Beirut,

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.434
will cause serious

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.186
repercussions for the Israelis.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.687
This is the Hezbollah leader.

00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:51.898
What Israel has been trying to do

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.650
is not allow this

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.818
to come into a multi-front war

00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:57.070
but we're already seeing that

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.988
they are fighting hard in Gaza.

00:03:58.988 --> 00:03:59.322
They are

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:00.615
they have been fighting hard

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:03.409
in northern Israel against the Hezbollah

00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:05.828
terrorists coming out of

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:07.705
southern Lebanon.

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:10.166
They've now struck in Beirut and Beirut.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.417
They've had these

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.002
missile attacks from Yemen.

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:15.964
We've seen PMF forces in Iraq and Syria

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:17.257
continue to try and attempt

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.967
to influence this operation.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:19.592
This is a

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.136
this is a tinderbox right now, Erica.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.264
And as we look at this

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.390
tinderbox, too, as we

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.015
look at the broader

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:27.183
region here,

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:28.309
the Iranian naval destroyer

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.936
now heading to the Red Sea.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:30.937
Days after the U.S.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:31.604
sunk, three U.S.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.523
ships killing all on board.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:34.190
Can the U.S.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.607
at this point

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.151
avoid getting drawn in deeper?

00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:39.070
It's going to be challenging.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.739
It's going to depend on what that Iranian

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.992
naval vessel does in the Red Sea.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.078
Those are international waters.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.123
There's a lot of transportation and

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.251
elements going through that

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:55.211
that are noncombatant

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:55.920
You know, the strike

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.130
against the three Houthi

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.089
rebel boats

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.799
that have tried to attack that attack

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:00.466
the Maersk

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.635
carrier the other day is an indicator

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.304
of what the Iranians are attempting

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.013
to do

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.056
by putting a naval destroyer

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:10.059
in this area, confronting an entire

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:11.769
carrier strike group

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:13.146
from the United States.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:16.065
It's just it has the potential

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:17.734
for explosive activity

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.569
and it's going to be very dangerous.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:20.862
The naval forces in that area

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:22.447
are going to have to watch their step

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.699
and be very careful about what they do.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.992
I'd also like to get your take on

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.785
what we're seeing in Ukraine.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:29.287
I mean, this really astounding

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:30.413
number of Russian missile

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.498
and drone attacks on Ukraine,

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:35.335
at least 500 over the past five days.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.378
That's according to President Lenski.

00:05:37.378 --> 00:05:38.046
We know at least five

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.298
people killed today, at least 53.

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:41.090
The number stands out

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.426
now killed from Friday's massive attacks.

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.136
We are nearly two years

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:47.180
now into this war.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.306
How do you read the message

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.516
that Putin is sending to Ukraine?

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:50.808
Well,

00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:51.309
first of all,

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.810
from the tactical perspective,

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.395
what Russia has been trying to do

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:56.230
is I use a basketball term,

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.523
flood the zone.

00:05:57.523 --> 00:05:59.150
They are trying to put as many missiles

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.777
in the air as they can.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:02.236
And there are all different types

00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:03.863
coming from multiple directions

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:04.447
and multiple

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.616
platforms, air, sea and ground.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.453
They are some of the types of missiles.

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:12.246
The hypersonic

00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:14.415
missiles are very advanced.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.959
But Ukraine has been very successful

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.586
in shooting most of them down.

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:19.629
Today's

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.006
activity, Ukraine was very successful.

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:23.716
But what I would say is two

00:06:23.716 --> 00:06:24.425
things are happening.

00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:26.677
First of all, Russia is continuing

00:06:26.677 --> 00:06:28.388
their strategic approach

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.555
to try and affect

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:32.975
Ukrainian infrastructure to make it

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:35.144
a harsh winter for Ukrainian citizens

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:36.521
to continue to say,

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:37.814
even though the United States

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.482
and others may be balking,

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.692
we're still going to attack. Great.

00:06:41.984 --> 00:06:42.944
And what's happening from

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.320
the Ukrainian side

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.613
is they just don't have

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:47.865
enough air defense to cover everything,

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.076
you know, air defense or points weapon

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.244
systems, Erica.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.495
That means they have to be placed

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.789
in a location to guard a specific target.

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:56.165
So that means you can't

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:57.625
defend everywhere.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.460
So the reason Russia is attacking

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.129
so many different targets

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.756
is they are trying to figure out where

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.049
Ukraine is soft

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:06.884
and where they have their defenses.

00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:08.219
And I think that's going to continue

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.304
on for the next couple of days.

00:07:10.304 --> 00:07:12.014
And it just shows the importance

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:13.641
of the United States

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:15.518
getting the Congress back and passing

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:16.686
this bill, which will give

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:20.857
more ammo and arms to Ukraine

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:21.858
during this period of time.

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.776
And this is a critical period.

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:24.861
Lieutenant General Mark Hertling,

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:25.945
always appreciate your insight.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:26.362
Thank you.
