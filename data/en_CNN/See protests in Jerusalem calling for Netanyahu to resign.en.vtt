00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.435
Well as Netanyahu was speaking on Sunday.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:03.636
Thousands were again

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:05.805
taking to the streets of Jerusalem

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.374
and other Israeli cities

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.042
calling for his resignation

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.611
and the release of all hostages in Gaza.

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:14.547
Now, the protests are still ongoing.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.081
The Israeli

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.082
prime minister met

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.050
with the family

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.052
of one of the hostages on Sunday.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.856
The father of 19 year old Naama Levi

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.492
told Israel's Army radio that they

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.828
left the meeting, quote, disturbed

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.798
and with no good news.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.268
Nadav Salsburg from the Change

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.403
Generation Movement

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.638
is leading the Tel Aviv protests.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.374
And he told the UK's Telegraph newspaper

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:42.342
on Sunday

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:44.310
that the protests over the weekend

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.547
were, quote, an eruption of underground

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:48.314
currents

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.884
that have reached the boiling point.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.920
And he joins us now live from Jerusalem.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.255
Great to see you, Nadav.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.222
Thank you so much

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.725
for taking the time today.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.194
Look, over the weekend, we saw

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.930
an eruption of anti-government

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.300
protests across many parts of Israel.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.302
But your specific movement

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.672
is calling for something very specific.

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:13.873
I want you to take me through

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.876
what you and your members want.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.044
Thank you.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.045
So, first of all,

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:19.712
I want to start

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:23.450
by mentioning the 134 hostages still held

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:25.351
captive in Gaza,

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.854
including women, elderly and children.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.923
We are fighting and praying

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.325
for their immediate release.

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.493
We are a movement

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.528
called the Change during the Nation

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:36.863
after October 7th.

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:37.831
We realized

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.165
that Netanyahu and his coalition

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:41.468
have no intent of taking responsibility

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.503
over the worst disaster

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.271
in Israel's history.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.873
So we have taken to the streets

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:47.674
and we formed

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:48.641
a young movement

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.677
comprised of young Israelis,

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:52.545
reservists and students

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.279
with the goal

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.881
of replacing the current government

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.616
with a responsible government.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.952
One deserving of the Israeli people.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.453
That is our goal.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.857
So you're calling for elections

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.792
and a change in government, essentially?

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.660
Yes,

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:09.395
Yeah.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:10.296
We're calling for

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.265
over and above, of course, importantly

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.933
and the release of hostages,

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:14.901
which is important.

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:15.535
But you've also said

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:16.402
something interesting

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:17.237
and just reading up

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.372
about what your movement is about that,

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:20.440
that Netanyahu hasn't

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.041
prioritized hostages.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.010
So what do you think he has

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.247
prioritized instead?

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:31.151
I think that Netanyahu has prioritized

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:31.951
the survival,

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:32.919
his own

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.020
political survival

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.589
and the survival of his coalition.

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.692
I think that while many people, including

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.728
politicians, are doing their best

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:43.796
to try and bring back the hostages,

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.565
it simply isn't enough.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:46.799
I think that we,

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.868
as the young generation who grew up

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.571
under Netanyahu,

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.773
have witnessed rotten leadership.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.775
And it's time for us to step up

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:57.677
and demand better leadership

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.779
for all Israelis.

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:04.384
So Netanyahu has rejected calls

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:05.652
for elections, saying

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:05.919
that it's

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.921
going to dismantle the talks

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.355
that are currently underway,

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.791
specifically for hostage release.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.860
We also know that Hamas has said that

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.029
all hostages will be released

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.198
if there's a sustained cease fire.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.066
So so what are your views

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.101
on the current negotiations

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:24.270
and importantly on a cease fire?

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:27.240
We believe that the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.243
war against Hamas is a just war.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:31.311
We believe that

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:32.579
Hamas is a threat

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.846
not only to Israelis,

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:35.682
but also to Palestinians.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:38.318
And that Israel must triumph over Hamas.

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:40.486
That is why we are not calling

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:41.921
for a cease fire.

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.556
We believe that the war needs to be

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.858
fought until the end, but we also believe

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.594
that we should prioritize

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:49.562
bringing back the hostages,

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.431
even if it means pausing.

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.265
The same way.

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:53.099
We paused

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.667
a couple of months ago

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.603
to bring back hostages.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:57.971
And we also believe

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.174
that the clearing schedule for elections

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.309
a couple of months from now

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:06.045
will not hurt or damage neither

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.680
the war efforts or the efforts

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.382
to bring back the hostages,

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:11.851
but rather allow the current government

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:15.355
to act without being dependent

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:18.925
on the politics or its own survival.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:21.761
Yeah,

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.496
I mean, and of course,

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:24.631
families of hostages.

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:27.066
We've heard just harrowing stories of,

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:28.067
you know,

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:30.370
the uncertainty that they're experiencing

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.738
I want to turn now

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:33.906
to the UN Security Council resolution

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:34.440
that within

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.907
it had said

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:37.810
that famine is setting in in Gaza

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.845
right now.

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:39.112
You know,

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.146
from what we've been seeing

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:42.348
and Netanyahu's policies essentially

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.149
of not

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:44.117
allowing enough

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:44.617
aid into

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.686
Gaza has gotten a lot of criticism

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:47.954
from aid organizations.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.123
They're describing dire realities

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.292
From your perspective,

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.294
how are you viewing this?

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.194
And does this worry

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:58.531
you and your members importantly?

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:00.400
Again, I think we are worried

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.635
for our future in Israel,

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:04.637
for the future of the region.

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.839
I think that what we have seen yesterday

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:07.740
in Jerusalem

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.443
are hundreds of thousands of patriots

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.078
going to the streets

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:14.514
and demanding a better future.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.015
I think we are done

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.450
waiting for politicians

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.818
to make things better.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.120
I think that we need to make them better

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:23.823
and that we, the young people in Israel,

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.358
are the generation

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:27.393
that will bring change to the region

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:30.196
and to Israel. And

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:33.266
and I think that where

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:34.967
I don't think I know

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:37.337
that we plan on continuing our approach

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:41.040
All right.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.608
Nadav Sulzberger, great to have you on.

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:44.143
Thank you for taking the time.

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:46.979
CNN is also learning that senior US

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.914
and Israeli

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:49.582
officials will meet virtually

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:50.450
today

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.285
to discuss Israel's proposed ground

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:53.653
offensive in Rafah.

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:55.121
A US official says the two

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:55.888
sides are still

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:57.924
working towards an in-person

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:59.759
meeting on the issue.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.526
Face to face

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.862
talks were abruptly called off last week

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:04.664
by the Israeli prime minister

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:05.465
after Washington

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:06.766
refused to block

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:08.067
a UN resolution

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:10.203
calling for a cease fire in Gaza.

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.238
Benjamin Netanyahu says US

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.873
pressure will not stop

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.542
an Israeli ground operation in Rafah.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.112
And I hope he can.

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:20.012
We will go into Rafah

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.481
and eliminate Hamas battalions

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:23.182
there for one simple reason.

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:24.050
There is no victory

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.151
without entering Rafah

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:26.152
and there is no victory

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:27.887
without eliminating Hamas battalions.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:28.187
There

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:32.825
will talks back on then.

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:34.894
I want to head to Washington now

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.996
and bring in CNN's Natasha Bertrand.

00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:40.500
Natasha, I want to get into

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:43.136
what the US has repeatedly said

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:44.337
and it's warned Israel

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:46.205
about a siege into Rafah

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:47.640
in this virtual meeting aimed

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.442
at this on Yahoo!

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:50.843
Do you think

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:52.111
he's going to be able

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:53.679
to convince the US

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.882
that they have a workable plan?

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:56.616
Can the US

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:59.118
be convinced of a Rafah operation

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:01.421
Well, the answer is that

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.622
it really depends

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:03.556
because as of right now

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:05.491
the US is extremely skeptical

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:06.692
and they have been urging Israeli

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:08.528
officials, including in talks

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:09.395
with the Israeli defense

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.496
minister last week,

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:12.765
to come up with an alternative plan, one

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.400
that is not

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.002
what the Israelis have been planning,

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.170
such as a Large-Scale

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.971
Ground operation into Rafah

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.239
that could endanger the over

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:21.774
1 million Palestinians

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:22.842
that have sought shelter there

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.010
over the last few months.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.611
And what the Israelis are saying

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.012
is that, look,

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.447
we need a way

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.548
to eliminate these

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:30.183
remaining Hamas battalions

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:32.151
and the US is responding well.

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:33.119
You could go after them

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.554
with a more targeted approach,

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:35.822
something that

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:37.924
targets more senior figures in Hamas

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:39.125
rather than going in

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.893
and doing an all out assault.

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:42.028
And so I think what the US is

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:43.496
still waiting to see from

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:44.931
the Israelis is

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:47.767
a concrete plan to move those civilians

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:48.668
out of the area.

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:49.535
And that is something

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:50.970
that Israel has not been able

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.171
to provide them with yet.

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:53.639
And until they do,

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:54.807
until they provide

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.042
some kind of blueprint

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:56.709
for how they're going

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.444
to get those people out of that area,

00:07:58.444 --> 00:08:00.713
perhaps allowing them to move back north,

00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:01.814
then the US is really not

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.249
going to be on board with this.

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:04.417
Now among the proposals

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:05.885
the US has given to

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:06.552
the Israelis

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:09.255
is to ramp up talks with the Egyptians

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.756
to try to seal that border

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:12.391
so that Israel can conduct

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:13.626
these more precision

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:14.794
operations, targeting

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:15.895
these senior Hamas leaders

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:17.763
without the possibility

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:19.699
that they are just going to then escape,

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:21.801
of course, across the border into Egypt.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:22.201
Of course,

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:23.903
another aspect of this is,

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:26.072
is that really targeted

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:27.907
operation that the US says

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:29.375
that the Israelis should try

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:29.942
and that's something

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:31.043
that they have been pushing them

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:32.311
to do for months and months.

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:33.279
Instead of doing

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.580
these large scale operations

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.648
that really do endanger

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:36.916
the civilians, there

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:39.018
But the Israelis are going to do

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.019
what they're going to do.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.454
And that is the message that we got

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:42.922
last week in talks with Israeli

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.724
officials, is that they are going to do

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:47.426
what they believe is best for

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:48.895
eliminating the remaining

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:50.630
Hamas battalions in that area.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.498
Now, whether there are any consequences

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:54.667
for the Israelis ignoring

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:55.868
the Americans

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:57.470
advice, that remains to be seen

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.138
because we have seen that

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:01.173
the US has continued to provide them

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:02.241
with weapons,

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:03.242
with intelligence

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:04.911
to help them prosecute

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:06.012
this war against Hamas.

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:06.913
And so the question now

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:08.514
is, are there any red lines here?

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:09.849
If the Israelis do move forward

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:10.983
with this operation in Rafah,

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:12.919
how is the US going to respond,

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.121
especially if it's in a way that the U.S.

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.923
has explicit advised against?

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:20.660
Well, Ivan, it's great to have you on.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.127
Thank you.
