I'M DANA BASH IN WASHINGTON  WHERE THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS LOOKING OVERSEAS.  &gt;&gt; AFTER EIGHT LONG MONTHS FOR  ISRAELI HOSTAGES ARE BACK HOME  SAFELY. FAMILY REUNIONS AND  TEARS OF JOY AFTER THEY WERE  RESCUED FROM HAMAS CAPTIVITY BY IDF FORCES IN A SPECIAL  OPERATION SATURDAY MORNING.  &gt;&gt; THE RATE OF TWO SEPARATE  APARTMENTS AND CENTRAL GAZA,  REFUGEE CAMP TOOK MONTHS OF  PREPARATION AND MILITARY  SPOKESMAN SAID, SINCE HAMAS  MOVES HOSTAGES FREQUENTLY AND  EMBEDS THEM IN AREAS PACKED  WITH CIVILIANS LIKE THIS  REFUGEE CAMP FOLLOWING REPORTS  OF HEAVY SHELLING AND ARTILLERY FIRE, GAZA HOSPITAL SAID MORE  THAN 200 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN  THE OPERATION. CNN HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO VERIFY CLAIMS ABOUT THE EXACT NUMBER OF CIVILIAN DEATHS IN WHAT WAS THE FIRST  SUCCESSFUL HOSTAGE RESCUE SINCE FEBRUARY HERE WITH ME NOW FROM  PARIS WHERE HE IS TRAVELING  WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN IS  NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, JAKE SULLIVAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH ME. LET'S START, OF COURSE, WITH THE NEWS ABOUT THE RESCUE OF FOUR ISRAELI HOSTAGES INSIDE GAZA. HOW SPECIFICALLY  DID THE US ASSIST IN THE  MISSION WELL DANA THE UNITED  STATES HAS BEEN PROVIDING  SUPPORT TO ISRAEL FOR SEVERAL  MONTHS IN ITS EFFORTS TO HELP  IDENTIFY THE LOCATIONS OF  HOSTAGES IN GAZA AND SUPPORT  EFFORTS TO TRY TO SECURE THEIR  RESCUE OR RECOVERY I'M NOT  GOING TO GET INTO THE SPECIFIC  OPERATIONAL OR INTELLIGENCE  RELATED MATTERS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BECAUSE WE NEED TO PROTECT THEM I CAN ONLY JUST SAY THAT  WE HAVE GENERALLY PROVIDED  SUPPORT TO THE IDF SO THAT WE  CAN TRY TO GET ALL OF THE  HOSTAGES HOME, INCLUDING THE  AMERICAN HOSTAGES WHO ARE STILL BEING HELD SO I UNDERSTAND THAT INTELLIGENCE U.s.  &gt;&gt; INTELLIGENCE ASSISTED BUT  WHAT YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT  U.s. PERSONNEL, US WEAPONS?  &gt;&gt; WELL THE ONE THING I, CAN  SAY IS THAT THERE WERE NO US  FORCES. NO, IT'S NO US BOOTS  ON THE GROUND INVOLVED IN THIS  OPERATION. WE DID NOT  PARTICIPATE MILITARILY IN THIS  OPERATION.  &gt;&gt; JAKE, A MOSQUE CLAIMS THAT  OTHER HOSTAGES THAT THEY ARE  HOLDING INSIDE GAZA WERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF THE IDF'S  MISSION. IS THAT TRUE?  &gt;&gt; WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT  VERIFIED OR CONFIRMED. I  BELIEVE THAT THE ISRAELIS HAVE  SAID THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY  INFORMATION TO THAT EFFECT. BUT OF COURSE, THAT IS ALWAYS A  RISK WITH ALL OF THESE NOTES  TERRY OPERATIONS HOSTAGES HAVE  BEEN KILLED OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS. DANA, THE BEST WAY TO  GET ALL OF THE HOSTAGES HOME  AND TO PROTECT PALESTINIAN  CIVILIANS IS TO END THIS WAR.  AND THE BEST WAY TO END THIS  WAR IS FOR HAMAS TO SAY YES TO  THE DEAL PRESIDENT BIDEN  ANNOUNCED AND THAT ISRAEL HAS  ACCEPTED WHICH LAYS OUT A  ROADMAP TO AN ENDURING  CEASEFIRE AND THE RETURN OF ALL HOSTAGES. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE  DRIVING FOR, AND THAT'S WHAT  WE'RE ASKING THE WORLD TO CALL UPON HAMAS TO ACCEPT ARE YOU  CONCERNED AT ALL?  &gt;&gt; ALL?  &gt;&gt; GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST SAID  THAT THE BALL IS IN HAMAS'S  COURT RIGHT NOW, THAT THE  RESCUE THAT HAPPENED ON  SATURDAY WILL MAKE IT SO THAT  HAMAS MIGHT?  &gt;&gt; WALK AWAY FROM THE  NEGOTIATING TABLE IT'S A  LEGITIMATE QUESTION.  &gt;&gt; I IT'S HARD FOR ME TO PUT  MYSELF IN THE MINDSET OF A  HAMAS TERRORISTS. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. BUT THE BASIC  BOTTOM LINE HERE IS  STRAIGHTFORWARD. TO BRING IT  INTO THIS WAR, TO GET THE  HOSTAGES HOME, TO GET THE FULL  SCOPE OF HUMANITARIAN AID TO  THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE IN A  SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WAY, WE NEED THIS DEAL AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THE  UNITED STATES AND IN COUNTRIES  EVERYWHERE WHO BEEN CALLING FOR A CEASEFIRE, THEY NEED TO  TRAIN. THEIR ATTENTION ON HAMAS AND PUT THE PRESSURE ON BECAUSE THIS IS THE WAY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. AND WHATEVER THE  CALCULUS IS OF HAMAS COMING OUT OF THIS WEEKEND THE REALITY  REMAINS THE SAME. THIS IS THE  ONLY CREDIBLE PATH FORWARD AND  HAMAS SHOULD SAY YES ANY WORD  EITHER FROM HAMAS OR THROUGH  HAMAS'S INTERMEDIARIES ABOUT  THEIR STANCE VIS-A-VIS THE  CEASEFIRE DEAL THAT THE  PRESIDENT ENDORSED.  &gt;&gt; A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN A  WEEK AGO SINCE WHAT HAPPENED  YESTERDAY?  &gt;&gt; WELL, WE'VE HEARD A LOT  PUBLICLY FROM HAMAS OVER THE  LAST WEEK. WE'VE NOT SEEN ANY  OFFICIAL STATEMENTS SINCE WHAT  HAPPENED WITH THE HOSTAGE  RESCUE OPERATION. AND THE TWO  KEY ERROR OF MEDIATORS THERE'S WHO ARE STANDING ALONGSIDE THE  UNITED STATES IN THIS PROCESS.  QATAR AND EGYPT HAVE NOT YET  RECEIVED ANY OFFICIAL WORD FROM HAMAS REPRESENTATIVES AS TO  THEIR STANCE ON THE DEAL. HERE, SO WE ARE WAITING THAT WORD AND IT SHOULD COME TODAY. IT SHOULD COME THIS, OUR HAMAS SHOULD SAY YES WHICH WOULD IMMEDIATELY PUT IN PLACE A CEASEFIRE AND  IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE PROCESS  OF BRINGING HOSTAGES HOME. THIS IS THE ANSWER THAT THE WORLD IS LOOKING FOR. AND IT'S TIME TO  ACT JAKE, I WANT TO ASK YOU A  LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT  MISSION.  &gt;&gt; AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS  WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM GAZA  TO DIFFERENT HOSPITALS IN GAZA  SAY AT LEAST 236 PEOPLE WERE  KILLED AS A PART OF THE ISRAELI OPERATION TO RESCUE HOSTAGES  WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF  HOW MANY PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS, NOT MILITANTS, BUT CIVILIANS  WERE KILLED IN THAT RESCUE  MISSION?  &gt;&gt; WE'VE UNITED STATES ARE NOT IN A POSITION TODAY TO MAKE A  DEFINITIVE STATEMENT ABOUT  THAT, THE ISRAELI DEFENSE  FORCES HAVE PUT OUT ONE NUMBER, THE HAMAS-RUN GAZA HEALTH  MINISTRY HAS PUT OUT ANOTHER  NUMBER, BUT WE DO KNOW THIS.  DANA INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE  TRAGICALLY KILLED IN THIS  OPERATION. THE EXACT NUMBER FOR WE DON'T KNOW, BUT INNOCENT  PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND THAT IS  HEARTBREAKING. THAT IS TRAGIC  THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS SAID  IN RECENT DAYS THAT THE  PALESTINIAN PEOPLE ARE GOING  THROUGH SHEER HELL IN THIS CONFLICT, BECAUSE HAMAS IS  OPERATING IN A WAY THAT PUTS  THEM IN THE CROSS-FIRE THAT  HOLDS HOSTAGES, RIGHT IN THE  HEART OF CROWDED CIVILIAN AREAS THAT PUTS MILITARY IN PLACE  THAT'S RIGHT IN THE HEART OF  CROWDED CIVILIAN AREAS. BUT  EVERY DAY THAT WE SEE MORE  INNOCENT PEOPLE LOST IS ANOTHER HORRIBLE, AWFUL TRAGIC DE AND  OUR HEARTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS THE WORLD, BREAK FOR THAT. BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE  ANSWER TO STOP THAT FROM  HAPPENING GOING FORWARD AND  THAT IS A CEASEFIRE AND HOSTAGE DEAL THAT ENDS THE MILITARY  OPERATIONS BRINGS THE HOSTAGES  HOME AND PUTS US IN A POSITION  TO GIVE THE PALESTINIANS AND  OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEIR PEOPLE AND LAST JUST  ABOUT THE MISSION. WE'RE YOU  DON'T WANT TO SPECIFICALLY SAY HOW THE THE US WAS INVOLVED,  WHICH I UNDERSTAND.  &gt;&gt; BUT JUST BROADLY, BIG  PICTURE NO ONE CAN DENY THE  AMAZING NEWS OF SEEING THESE  INNOCENT CIVILIANS WHO WERE  FINALLY BROUGHT BACK TO THEIR  FAMILIES FROM GAZA AFTER BEING  HELD THERE FOR EIGHT MONTHS.  BUT IS THE US COMFORTABLE WITH  THE WAY THAT THE ISRAELIS  CARRIED OUT THE MISSION LOOKED  IN A WHY IS PRESIDENT BIDEN  GOING OUT?  &gt;&gt; PUBLICLY AND CALLING FOR A  CEASEFIRE AND HOSTAGE DEAL?  IT'S BECAUSE HE THINKS THE  BEST WAY TO GET ALL OF THE  HOSTAGES HOME IS IN A DEAL  WHERE THEY'RE BROUGHT OUT  DIPLOMATICALLY, WHERE THERE'S  NO NEED FOR MILITARY DURATIONS  TO GET EVERY LAST HOSTAGE OUT.  SO THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE THE  BEST SOLUTION TO THIS IN THE  ABSENCE OF THAT WITHOUT HAMAS  SAYING YES TO THE DEAL ON FOUR  FORTUNATELY, WE ARE GOING TO  CONTINUE TO SEE ONGOING  CONFLI A AND MILITARY  OPERATIONS IN WHICH ISRAEL  MAKES EFFORTS TO RECOVER ITS  CITIZENS AND FRANKLY TO RECOVER AMERICAN CITIZENS WHAT WE WOULD MUCH PREFER TO SEE IS A  CEASEFIRE WHERE THE HOSTAGES  COME OUT PEACEFULLY. THAT IS  AVAILABLE. ISRAEL HAS SAID YES  TO IT NOW HAMAS NEEDS TO SAY  YES TO IT. THAT'S WHERE  PRESIDENT BIDEN'S FULL EFFORT, ENERGY, AND ATTENTION IS. AND  YOU HEARD YESTERDAY FROM THE  FRENCH PRESIDENT HERE IN PARIS  THAT FRANCE STANDS BEHIND THAT  THE WORLD STANDS BEHIND THAT,  AND HAMAS SHOULD COME TO THE  TABLE AND SAY, YES, YOU  MENTIONED THAT YOU ARE IN  PARIS.  &gt;&gt; I HAVE TO BEFORE I LET YOU  GO ASK ABOUT THE TRIP THAT YOU  AND OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT IS  MAKING TO EUROPE, MARKING THE  80th ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY. YOU  ARE SOON GOING TO BE PART OF  THE G7 IN ITALY AND THE  PRESIDENT GAVE A VERY BIG  SPEECH ON DEMOCRACY AS HE'S  TRYING TO FRAME THE 2024  PRESIDENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HERE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AS A  DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FATE OF  DEMOCRACY. DO YOU THINK  DEMOCRACY IS IN JEOPARDY?  &gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT SAID IN HIS  SPEECH THAT DEMOCRACY,  DEMOCRACY IS AT RISK ALL OVER  THE WORLD FROM WITHOUT AND FROM WITHIN. TO A GREATER EXTENT NOW THAN IT HAS BEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME. AND WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN  WAS ARGUING IS THAT THOSE BRAVE MEN WHO STORMED THE BEACHES AT  NORMANDY WHO SCALED THE CLIFFS  AT POINTE TO HOC WHO LIBERATED  EUROPE AND LITERALLY SAVED THE  WORLD. THEY ARE CALLING US TO  STEP UP TO DO OUR JOB IN OUR  TIME, WHICH IS TO DEFEND  DEMOCRACY STAND WITH ALLIES, TO REFUSE TO BOW DOWN TO DICTATORS TO PUSH BACK AGAINST AGGRESSION THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS SEEKING TO DU, THAT'S
