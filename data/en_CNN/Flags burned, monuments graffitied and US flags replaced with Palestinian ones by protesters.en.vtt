00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.169
Jonathan, you came from this address.

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.271
You were in the hall in the,

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:06.673
the House chamber.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.676
What was your impression of the speech?

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.879
Knowing that he had multiple audiences

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:13.380
there?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.748
Yeah, it was pretty extraordinary,

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:15.181
Deanna.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:15.949
I mean, to be there

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.283
in the chamber watching

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:18.752
Prime Minister Netanyahu deliver

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:19.919
those remarks were few things

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.054
that stood out for me.

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.356
Number one, it was a unity message.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:23.990
Like, literally,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.159
you had Democrats and Republicans

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.994
standing up and applauding.

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:28.261
You know,

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.262
I thought there was going to be

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:30.230
lots of empty seats.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.364
There simply weren't.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.500
It was a pretty full house.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.035
And he complimented President Biden

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.003
and praised him as Jamie, said Andy

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.038
Kaufman of President Trump

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:38.671
of the Abraham Accords.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.508
So he was sort of finding a way to praise

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:42.108
both sides.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.143
That's number one.

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:43.743
Number two,

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:45.812
he talked about anti-Semitism.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:46.946
He talked about what's happening

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:47.881
on our college campuses,

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.449
what's happening in the streets,

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.518
and how that is not just about protesting

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.019
policies of the government.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.020
You're seeing people going

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.622
after Zionists and Jews.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:56.423
And literally

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:58.758
while he was speaking outside

00:00:58.758 --> 00:00:59.592
of the Capitol,

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:00.260
you had people

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.861
burning American flags

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.230
in front of Union Station.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.432
I saw signs

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.200
as they came over here to the studio,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.401
people saying things like,

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.104
any resistance is justified.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:12.839
I mean, comparing that

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.574
those kind of that kind of language,

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:15.842
when you think about the babies

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:16.543
who were burned

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.078
and the women who were raped.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.145
So he talked about that.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.380
That was important.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.114
And then thirdly,

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:22.982
I think he laid out a path forward.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:24.184
He talked about hostages

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:25.351
and needs to get them home.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.553
They talked about what a future

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:27.654
could look like for Israel

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:29.656
and a demilitarized Gaza,

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:30.857
like a vision of peace.

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.258
That, to me was really quite welcome.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.226
But there are a lot of

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:35.295
dozens of Democrats boycotted the speech,

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:36.129
didn't show up.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.063
A lot of those seats

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:37.931
where the Democrats

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.232
would have been seated

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.500
were congressional staffers

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.367
just showing up.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.035
They're sitting there.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:42.302
You know,

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:43.436
there may have been some empties,

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.004
but I watched Hakeem Jeffries

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:45.939
stand and applaud.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.040
I watched Chuck Schumer

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.041
stand and applaud.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.076
I watched almost every Democratic senator

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:51.077
stand and applaud.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:53.146
So I hear what you're saying.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:53.947
But I got to say,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.882
I saw unity in that room.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.750
I saw him try to appeal to both sides,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.084
and I saw

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.786
people from both parties respond.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.955
What you do at the ADL

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.990
is try to stamp out hate.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.993
Of course, anti-Semitism, hate against

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.696
phobia, Islamophobia, racism, all of it.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.932
How do you think that

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.668
Netanyahu's attempt to do that in

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.971
his speech is going to play?

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.973
I mean, I was getting a text from,

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.307
one American Jew

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.308
who said, okay,

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:22.742
it's fine

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.311
to call people useful idiots,

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:25.979
but how about,

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.380
like, a slight nod to people

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.383
who are genuinely upset about the,

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.385
what's happening in Gaza?

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:33.253
Well, I, I'm not.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:34.154
And understanding

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.522
that you're also saying

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.157
the signs that you just described,

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.691
which is just plain hate.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.160
And he talked about the director

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.594
of national intelligence

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.129
acknowledging a few weeks ago

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.598
that Iran is involved in these protests,

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:46.799
something we've been seeing NATO

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:47.467
for a long time.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:48.168
But he did something

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:48.968
very interesting, Diana,

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:51.604
before the speech really got started.

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:52.972
He called out some of the folks

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:53.873
that he had brought over

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.341
as part of his delegation,

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.910
including, for example,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.645
a Bedouin soldier.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:02:59.512
Which was interesting, cause

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.580
I think most Americans

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.981
don't realize there

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:04.717
Israeli Muslims in the IDF.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.186
And then he had an Ethiopian

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.253
Israeli soldier

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:10.056
who ran eight miles on October the 7th.

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.057
So I point this out

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:12.358
because he demonstrated

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.260
the diversity of Israeli society.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.595
I think you pointed this out earlier

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:17.430
in a way that surprised a lot of people.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.531
He could have come with

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.166
just decorated Jewish veterans.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.602
He didn't do that.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.204
He brought a more diverse delegation.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.905
And I think that sends a message.

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:27.173
I just

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:27.907
to push back

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:28.775
just a little bit

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:31.277
about about all the unity,

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:31.811
you know,

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:33.379
several Israelis

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.747
from both sides of the aisle

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:36.516
were texting me during the speech.

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.084
And what I heard from them

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.620
is that that was, in effect,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.323
a very celebratory speech.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:46.226
that really does not fit

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.727
and that there is an alternate

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.629
reality on the ground

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.463
that's going on

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:52.265
both in Gaza and in Israel.

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:52.832
As we know,

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.634
in the north, 60,000

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:57.637
plus Israelis, are displaced.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.739
There has been an extraordinary impact

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:00.940
on the economy.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.808
And then, of course,

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:04.777
there is the devastating reality

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:06.512
of the number of deaths

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:07.280
in Gaza,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.283
Palestinians, the humanitarian disaster.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.586
So, he had a welcome

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.157
audience there today, but he did ignore

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.693
what I'm hearing from Israelis

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:24.564
is a very dire reality on the ground.

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:24.897
Look,

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:26.199
there is no question

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.500
that that is an incredibly

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.968
difficult situation.

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:30.470
And every civilian life

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.038
lost is a tragedy.

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:33.139
Every Palestinian

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.440
woman or child

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.242
who was killed inadvertently,

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:37.910
no matter what the IDF tries to do,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.012
that is a tragedy.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.313
We should mourn every

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:41.914
one of those deaths.

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:44.017
But he talked about, for example,

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.918
the dire situation in Gaza

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:46.886
and how they are trying

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:48.221
to bring in supplies.

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.455
He talked about the situation

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:50.923
in the North, like you're pointing out,

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.558
and the need to bring those people back

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:55.561
to their homes, 60 or 80,000 Israelis.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:56.629
And he talked about the need

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.564
to bring the hostages home.

00:04:58.564 --> 00:04:59.866
I know at ADL

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:00.500
and we're folks

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.900
at fighting

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.501
aid here at home,

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.169
but we all wear the dog tags

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.904
because we want these civilians,

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:06.139
these innocent people back,

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.308
including, by the way, dozens of them.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:08.741
I think

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.943
maybe it's eight Americans at this point.

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:12.612
So I think he tried to address

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:13.112
that, Jamie.

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.448
But look, if you've lost a child,

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:16.883
if you're I think about my friends,

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:17.550
the Polands.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.619
I was with the Nazis before we came on.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:22.221
Their. Their sons are both held in Gaza.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:24.891
I can't even begin to grasp

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:25.858
the unspeakable pain

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:27.060
they deal with every day.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.062
We have got to get those kids home.

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:31.831
So I hope they get a deal very fast.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.100
So we can see on air.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.002
And we can see Hersh back

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.303
home, safe and sound.

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:38.971
And all the hostages, once and for all.

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:39.972
Hope there is a deal

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:41.541
that will bring those hostages

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.142
home as quickly as possible.

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:44.777
Jonathan Greenblatt, thanks very much.

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:47.380
Jamie, thanks to you as well.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.181
I want to go see this,

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:48.781
began Mark,

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:49.549
as he's

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.150
been covering the demonstrators

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.919
out there in the streets of Washington.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.320
Jamie, give us a sense

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.388
of what's been going on.

00:05:58.958 --> 00:05:59.959
lots and lots of

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.160
demonstrators and protesters

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.061
throughout the Capitol

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.496
around the Capitol building.

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:04.831
But I won't say it all ended here

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:06.099
at Union Station.

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.800
This is the remnants of one U.S.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.268
flag that was burned here

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:10.036
over in the distance.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.938
So you can see the the ashes there.

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:14.006
That's the remnants of another flag.

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:14.640
I want to show you

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.942
sort of the bell over here, though.

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:18.111
The liberty, the copy of the Liberty Bell

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:20.146
that's out in front of the station

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:22.014
that's been covered in graffiti.

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:23.282
And then the Columbus Memorial

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:25.852
has also been covered in graffiti here.

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:26.285
And, Jonathan,

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.187
if you can show all three U.S.

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:29.555
flags on the three flagpoles,

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.057
massive flag poles out in front of Union

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.592
Station have been pulled down

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:34.260
and Palestinian flags

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.295
have been put up in their place.

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:37.730
Most the protesters

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.798
a few dozen,

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.900
maybe 100 or so, still gathered here.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.735
Most of the protesters have left,

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:43.703
but you can see the number

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:44.637
of police officers

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:46.339
in front of Union Station.

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.241
And I'm looking over across the way here,

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.009
and there are lots of

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.911
police with shields now

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.079
and heavy vehicles.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.547
So it looks like most

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:55.681
protesters are leaving

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:57.216
and police will come back in

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:59.085
and bring this place back to order.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.553
Well all right media,

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:01.888
let's hope it's peaceful over there.

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:03.322
Bigo Marquez reporting for us.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.891
Thanks very much. Now.

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:05.792
Thank you so much.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:06.292
And with us

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:07.794
now is Republican Senator

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:10.062
John Thune of South Dakota.

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:10.596
Senator,

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:11.931
thank you so much for being here.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:12.899
Really great to see you

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:14.400
and to have you here.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.236
first, generally speaking, your reaction

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:19.372
to Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks.

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:21.374
strong speech.

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:23.109
And, as as is

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.243
usually the case with,

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:25.044
the Prime minister,

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:27.447
very well articulated.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.414
and I thought he

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:30.049
he hit all the right points.

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.584
I think the one thing that he needs

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:32.985
to do for people in this country,

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.687
and for that matter, people,

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:35.254
all around

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:36.122
the world is connect

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.824
the dots back to Iran.

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:39.492
And the fact that Israel

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:40.827
is the only thing standing

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:42.829
between Iran and the United States,

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:43.596
which they consider

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:44.964
to be the great Satan.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.732
And so Iran is behind

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:49.168
all the mining activities in that region.

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:50.336
whether it's Hezbollah in the

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:53.339
in the north or the Houthis in Yemen,

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.641
or Hamas, right there in the Gaza Strip.

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.977
But I thought he was really effective in

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.011
in that in particular,

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:00.379
and also articulating a vision

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:01.781
of what it could like,

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:03.015
could look like in the future

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:04.784
if you had an integrated Middle East

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:08.721
and a direct allies demilitarized, Gaza.

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:09.555
And that, of course,

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:10.323
means that you've got to get

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.491
rid and eliminate Hamas.

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:14.193
I want to get back to

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:15.728
what you were just talking about.

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:16.562
Back to the Prime

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:17.730
Minister speech in a second.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.731
I'm not sure if you were able

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:21.067
to hear our reporter, Miguel Marquez,

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:22.435
who was talking about

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:23.970
the protesters outside.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.671
Specifically, he was reporting on

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.973
and showing,

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:28.541
the American flag being lowered,

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.810
the Palestinian flag being raised.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.646
We even saw some red triangles.

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.081
we're showing it now.

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:36.182
I don't know if you can see it,

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.150
but we even saw some red triangles

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.453
on some of the statues.

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:42.121
what's your reaction to that?

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.924
Well, I think it's it's disgraceful.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:46.425
It's, shameful

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:48.060
and the kind of thing that we shouldn't

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.761
see in this country.

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:49.262
But again,

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:51.063
as the Prime Minister pointed out

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:52.899
today, a lot of these activities

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:53.599
that are happening here

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:54.333
in the United States,

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.135
Iran is behind them.

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:57.637
They are trying to create

00:08:57.637 --> 00:09:01.407
tumult and instability and chaos and,

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.143
use in fueling all these protests

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:05.578
and the violence, particularly

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:06.712
the anti-Semitic violence

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:07.980
in this country.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.615
that's Iranian activity.

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:11.751
And that's why they have to be stopped,

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:12.051
and that's

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:12.852
why it's so important

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:14.820
that we continue to support Israel,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.156
including, as the Prime minister said,

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:18.591
give us the tools faster

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:20.526
and we will finish the job.

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:22.028
they've got to get this, this thing

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.030
over with and,

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.932
and send a clear statement to the world

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.500
that this kind of behavior

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.200
and the kind of thing

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.602
that we're seeing right here in the U.S.

00:09:29.602 --> 00:09:31.671
and right here in this city today,

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.205
just can't be tolerated.

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:33.573
Senator,

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.208
one of Prime Minister Netanyahu's

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:38.411
predecessors, Ehud Barak,

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.112
who we understand

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.047
and we should tell our viewers

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:41.714
who might not know,

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:43.316
is not from the same party

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:45.518
as Prime Minister Netanyahu.

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:47.553
and but nonetheless, he has somebody he's

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:49.689
somebody who has been intimately involved

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.390
in trying to get to peace.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.858
He almost got there,

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:53.559
when Bill Clinton

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:54.093
had him

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:55.728
and Yasser Arafat in 2000,

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:57.330
here in the United States.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:57.997
He said

00:09:57.997 --> 00:09:59.599
very, very strongly

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.901
and very clearly to Wolf,

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:03.703
that he does not believe

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:05.438
that Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.039
actually wants to end the war

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.341
because it would mean

00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:11.077
the end of his own political viability

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:11.911
at home.

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:13.479
And that might even mean,

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:16.048
that hostages stay longer.

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:17.750
Are you concerned about

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.784
I mean, you're a politician.

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:21.187
You understand what's going on in Israel?

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:24.090
Are you concerned about the notion

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.925
that Bibi Netanyahu

00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:26.859
isn't trying as hard

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:30.663
as he can to get this deal because of

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:34.467
his own concerns about his own future?

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.434
I don't think that

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:36.669
I've met with him in Israel.

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:39.105
I've met with, Ehud Barak in Israel,

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.206
previously as well.

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:41.540
And obviously they have

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.742
political differences there.

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.310
But those aside,

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.412
my sense coming out of this was is

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:48.114
he is desperate to end this

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:50.516
because this is putting the lives

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:51.751
of Israeli citizens at

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.352
risk every single day.
