00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.169
We recently learned from the national

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.238
security director, a director of U.S.

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.340
Director of National Intelligence,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.641
that Iran is funding

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.143
and promoting anti-Israel

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:11.311
protests in America.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.980
They want to disrupt America.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.949
So these protesters burned

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.952
American flags even on the 4th of July.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:20.820
And I wish to salute

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.988
the fraternity brothers

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.157
at the University of North Carolina

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.893
who protected the American flag,

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.462
protected the American flag against these

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.465
anti-Israel protesters.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.491
For all we know,

00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.926
Iran is funding

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.327
the anti-Israel protests

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.263
that are going on

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:05.065
right now outside this building.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.933
Not that many, but they're there

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.135
and throughout the city.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.170
Well, I have a message

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.072
for these protesters.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.607
When the tyrants of Tehran

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.509
who hang gays from cranes

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.444
and murder women

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:18.211
for not covering

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.813
their hair are praising,

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.481
promoting and funding you.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.016
You have officially become

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.918
Iran's useful idiots.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.545
Some of these protesters.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.513
That's amazing.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:54.347
Absolutely amazing.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.282
Some of these protesters

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:59.719
hold up signs proclaiming gays for Gaza.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.287
They might as well hold up

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:04.290
signs saying chickens for KFC.

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.065
These protesters chant

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.567
from the river to the sea.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:16.569
But many don't have a clue what river

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.572
and what sea they're talking about.

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.242
They're not only good enough

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.409
in geography,

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.412
they've got enough in history.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.248
They call Israel.

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:31.251
They call Israel a colonialist state.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.987
Don't they know that the land of Israel

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.655
is where Abraham, Isaac,

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:36.990
and Jacob prayed,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.225
where Isaiah and Jeremiah preach,

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:42.228
and where David and Solomon ruled?

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.911
For nearly 4000 years.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:00.113
The land of Israel has been the homeland

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:01.481
of the Jewish people.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.049
It's always been our home.

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.052
It will always be our home.

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:27.974
It's not only the campus protesters

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:29.275
who get it wrong.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.443
It's also the people

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.745
who run those campuses.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.414
80 years after the Holocaust.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.718
80 years after the Holocaust.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:41.554
The presidents of Harvard, Penn.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:42.855
And I'm ashamed to say,

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:45.592
my alma mater, MIT,

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.393
couldn't bring themselves

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:48.127
to condemn

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:51.130
the calls for the genocide of Jews.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.933
You remember what they said?

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:57.937
They said it depends on the context.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.440
Well, let me give these

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.443
befuddled academics a little context.

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:10.750
anti-Semitism is the world's

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.719
oldest hatred.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:13.953
For centuries.

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:16.422
The massacre of Jews was always preceded

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:18.491
by wild accusations.

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.892
We were accused of everything

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.861
from poisoning wells

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:23.763
to spreading plagues,

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:24.764
to using the blood

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.366
of slaughtered children

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:29.369
to make Passover martyrs.

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:32.372
These preposterous anti-Semitic lies

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:34.874
led to persecution, mass murder,

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:36.843
and ultimately to history's

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:39.646
worst genocide. The Holocaust.

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.814
Now, just as malicious lies

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:43.216
were leveled for centuries

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:44.851
at the Jewish people.

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:47.353
Malicious lies are now being leveled at

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:48.321
the Jewish state.

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:52.458
No, no, don't applaud.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.360
Listen.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.629
The outrageous slanders that paint Israel

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.831
as racist and genocidal

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:01.200
are meant to delegitimize Israel.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.269
To demonize the Jewish state

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:06.239
and to demonize Jews everywhere.

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:07.440
And no wonder,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.708
no wonder we've witnessed

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.943
an appalling rise of anti-Semitism

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.379
in America and around the world.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.114
My friends,

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:17.550
whenever and wherever

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.553
we see the scourge of anti-Semitism,

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.855
we must unequivocally condemn it

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.757
and resolute to fight it.

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:27.760
Without exception.

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.486
And don't be fooled.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.554
When the blood libels

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.889
against the Jewish state

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.591
come from people who wear

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:01.561
fancy silk robes and speak in lofty tones

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:04.697
about law and justice.

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:06.699
Here's a case in point.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.600
The prosecutor

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.635
of the International Criminal Court

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.738
has shamefully accused Israel.

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:14.440
He continued to bring back to Iran,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.676
the country that is,

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:19.679
by all accounts, funding and supporting

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:22.682
not just Hamas in Gaza, but Hezbollah

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:26.252
in the north, in Lebanon and the Houthis.

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:27.253
So this is

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:27.787
this was

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:29.122
another really important

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:31.624
overarching theme.

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:32.125
You know, that

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.693
Netanyahu, understandably,

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:35.161
has been obsessed with the

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:36.763
the growth and the strength

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:39.031
and the determination of Iran

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:40.433
to eradicate Israel.

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.268
And what he did here

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:43.736
was to continue to connect

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:44.837
for an American audience

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:45.972
and an Israeli audience.

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:46.639
But Israel

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.207
doesn't need to be educated on this,

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:50.343
but more for an American audience

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:53.279
that Iran isn't just out for Israel.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.947
Iran is out for Americans

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:56.349
to topple American democracy.

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:57.016
No. That's right.

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:59.218
And he called the protesters

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:01.354
Iran's useful idiots.

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:02.255
Relish going

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.457
after the protesters,

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:06.192
saying that they didn't

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:08.761
realize, did not know the history,

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:09.529
know the context,

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:11.431
know how oppressive

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.499
the Iranian regime is.

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:14.400
And he relished it.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.134
I mean, this was,

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:16.202
you know, he was going

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:17.737
after these protesters,

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.605
going after the leaders

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:20.373
of some of these schools.

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:23.042
He called them befuddled academics.

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:24.677
We're ten months into this conflict.

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:25.812
We're 100 days out

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:27.480
from a presidential election.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.381
In some ways,

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:30.616
the conflict has fallen off the radar

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:31.584
of many Americans.

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:32.985
It's going to start back up, right.

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.654
If you think about what's happening

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:35.521
in the context

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.156
of some of these campus protesters,

00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:39.192
they're going to go back to school.

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:41.327
There's going to be a DNC convention

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:42.061
in Chicago

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:43.830
expected to be a lot of protesters.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.363
There.

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:45.498
So this is very much

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:47.066
going to be top of mind

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:48.734
heading into this election.

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:49.836
And we don't quite know.

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:50.636
We don't have,

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:51.370
you know, an idea

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:51.871
yet of what

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:53.673
Trump would really do in office.

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:55.575
It's something he hasn't really detailed.

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:57.276
And we also don't know,

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:58.711
what a Kamala Harris

00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:00.012
administration would do

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:01.080
and how that would be different

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.148
from a Biden administration

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.182
to think of that reception

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:04.750
he received in the Congress.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.651
So that was powerful.

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:06.385
It was powerful.

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:08.254
Listen, and these are Republicans

00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:10.122
mostly, a lot of the Democrats income,

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:11.390
although some Democrats were there

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.459
and they were standing up and cheering.

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:15.461
And listen, there is a sense,

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:16.362
that Americans do

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:18.030
need to be more educated

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.098
on what's going on

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:20.766
there, on the history of anti-Semitism,

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:21.868
on the ways

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:22.668
in which,

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:25.171
antisemitism tropes led to the Holocaust.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.639
And so there was a teachable

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:27.907
moments, right?

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:29.509
when he was trying to educate people

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.543
in terms of the history.

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:33.513
Jeremy Diamond is in Israel, and Jeremy,

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.849
I wanted to ask you about the hostages.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:40.620
And I talked to right before this speech

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.389
to the parents of one of the,

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:45.791
Israeli and American hostages,

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:47.894
Don Alexander.

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:49.028
And there were

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.429
they the parents were there

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:52.598
other family members of hostages?

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:53.366
Were there?

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.000
We didn't.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.903
We did see the Prime minister,

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:58.471
call out some of them,

00:08:58.471 --> 00:08:59.906
acknowledge some of them.

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:00.806
And then when it comes

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.009
to the big question that they all have,

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:04.544
when are my family members

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.046
going to come home? He did promise that.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.614
But just like David

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:11.851
and Barack were saying, not a lot knew

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.185
that we heard from him

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:15.221
about getting to that point

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.356
with a deal with Hamas,

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:20.359
with the help of Qatar and America.

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:23.596
Yeah, that's right,

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:24.030
that I think

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.664
the Israeli prime

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:26.232
minister paid a lot of lip service

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.900
to the issue of the hostages.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.634
He talked about it

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:30.303
during a section of his speech.

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:30.870
But if you look

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.139
at the overall context of the speech,

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:34.473
the overall content of what

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:36.175
the Israeli prime minister said,

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:37.343
he talked far,

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:39.679
far more about achieving victory

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:40.346
in this war

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:41.147
against Hamas,

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:42.315
about destroying

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:45.318
Hamas's military capabilities and,

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:46.619
vowing

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:48.721
we will fight until we achieve victory.

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:52.458
He said some, a phrase, like that

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:53.793
a few different times

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:54.694
throughout the speech,

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:55.561
he talked about that

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:57.029
far more than he did.

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:59.131
This ceasefire agreement, which U.S.

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:01.300
officials, as well as Israeli officials

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.868
have indicated to me in recent

00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:05.504
days, is very much within reach.

00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:07.406
One official actually told me

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:08.641
that it's now up to Israel,

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:09.775
and it's now up to the Israeli

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:11.611
prime minister, effectively to decide

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.013
whether or not he actually wants a deal.

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:15.381
And as Barack was saying there,

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:16.048
the Israeli prime

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:17.917
minister has told his delegation

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:19.952
to hold off on traveling,

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.054
to, meet with the mediators

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.189
and share Israel's

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:24.357
latest response

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:25.124
until after

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:27.293
he meets with President Biden tomorrow,

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.428
effectively pushing off,

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:30.997
that trip by the delegation

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:32.732
most likely until after Shabbat.

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:34.900
So that would probably be on Sunday.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.235
But I think beyond that, Dan,

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:37.903
I think what we also need to do here

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:38.404
is fact

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:39.105
check a few key

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.206
things that the Israeli Prime

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:40.940
Minister said,

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.875
because he made several claims here

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:43.442
that attempted

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:44.944
to not only defend the Israeli

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:46.679
military's conduct in Gaza,

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:48.481
but that also flew in the face of

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.949
many of the facts on the ground

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:52.652
when he was talking about the ICC's claim

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.820
that Israel is starving people of Gaza.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.321
You know, he

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.056
he talked about big numbers of aid

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:57.556
getting in,

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:58.791
but there is just very,

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:00.059
very clear evidence.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:02.495
You talk to any humanity, an organization

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.030
that actually works on the ground

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.098
in Gaza, the United Nations.

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:08.200
And even when you look at Israel

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:08.701
in the way

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:09.835
that they have turned on

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:12.238
and back off the faucet of aid to Gaza,

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:13.272
there is clear evidence

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:15.708
that Israel has not always allowed enough

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:16.375
aid in that.

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:17.943
They have not done enough

00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:19.512
to conflict militarily,

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.713
to provide safe routes

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:22.381
for that aid to get in.

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:24.116
And you also have to remember that

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:25.818
ministers, members of his

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.353
of Netanyahu's own government

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.555
called for starving the people of Gaza

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:31.457
in the earliest days of the war.

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:32.692
Then he also made this

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.126
frankly laughable claim

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:35.561
that there are practically

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:37.430
no civilians who were killed in Rafah.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.698
I can think of several strikes

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.166
in which civilians were killed.

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:40.900
So that just doesn't

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.301
even pass the smell test.

00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:44.103
And then he once again cited,

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:44.704
this West Point

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.272
expert, John Spencer, claiming

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:47.406
that Israel has the lowest

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:48.741
civilian casualty ratio.

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:50.576
You talk to any other expert

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:52.411
on the conduct of militaries in warfare,

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:53.646
including how the United States

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.147
has carried out its campaigns.

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:56.315
And they will all say that

00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:58.284
Israel has not taken,

00:11:58.284 --> 00:11:59.819
nearly as many precautions

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:02.288
as most modern militaries do,

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:03.689
in warfare in Gaza.
