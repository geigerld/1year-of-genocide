00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.468
International calls for restrain

00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:02.802
are growing this morning

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:05.005
after Israel has continued to pr

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.873
to continue its war against Hama

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.174
for many more months.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:09.843
Recently surfaced video appears

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.011
to show Palestinian men

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.379
and at least two children

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.780
stripped down to their underwear

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.182
and detained by the IDF in Gaza.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.450
CNN is unable to verify

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.852
when the video was shot, but

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.553
geo location data shows

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.922
it was filmed in a stadium of Ga

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.324
The IDF has not responded

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.125
to CNN's request

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.659
for comment on that video.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.927
The incident, though, resembles

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:28.595
an account shared

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.296
by a Palestinian poet and writer

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.098
Moussa Abu Butt Abu toA.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:32.866
In a new piece

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.467
published in The New Yorker,

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.135
which claims

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.836
he was forced to completely undr

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:37.470
at gunpoint

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.638
before being detained

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:39.406
and interrogated

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.508
by the IDF earlier this month,

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.443
he was trying to cross the Rafah

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.878
with his wife and three kids,

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:45.512
including his three year

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.148
old son, Mustafa, who is a U.S. 

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.949
Abu Tor said he was terrorized

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.451
and beaten while being questione

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:53.386
about whether he had ties to Ham

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.120
Well-known poet

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.789
and writer has studied at Syracu

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.190
and Harvard and denies

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.425
repeatedly any ties

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:00.193
to Hamas or terrorism.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:02.162
The IDF gave a statement to CNN

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.663
noting that it's a partial respo

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:04.431
and that they are still

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.232
looking into the allegations,

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.201
saying in part, during IDF opera

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.102
in the Gaza Strip,

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.136
a number of individuals

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:10.737
were detained

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.105
on the basis of intelligence

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.007
indicating significant communica

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:14.941
between them

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:16.176
and terror organizations

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.977
in the strip, out of suspicion

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:18.812
of affiliation

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.914
with terror organizations there.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:21.681
Saab Abu

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:23.116
Tova was found to be

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.385
mistakenly identified in this re

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.454
and was thus released after ques

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:28.888
The individuals detained

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.190
are treated in accordance

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.724
with international law,

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.059
the Saab Abu told joins us

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.894
now live from Cairo, Egypt.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.196
We appreciate your time.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:36.896
And I want to start

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.665
with what the IDF says

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:39.466
in their statement,

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.767
because what they don't

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.168
discuss in the statement

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.503
is what transpired between

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.105
when you were detained

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.372
and when they realized

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:47.407
or came to the conclusion

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.709
it was a mistake. And you were r

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:50.210
You describe it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.712
in visceral detail in your piece

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:56.749
Can you tell people what happene

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.051
Well, I was

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.153
evacuating the north of Gaza, wh

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.754
which Israel has been repeatedly

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.289
asking people to evacuate.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.390
And I was going to the north,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.092
to the southern part of the Gaza

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:07.861
in the hope of reaching the Rafa

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.196
crossing with my wife and three 

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.265
But when I arrived at the checkp

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.366
that Israel

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.001
created on the Salahadin street,

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.569
which was called a safe passage

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.339
for Palestinians trying to evacu

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.273
to the southern part,

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:21.908
I was called by a description

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:23.243
by an Israeli soldier

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:24.210
who was about

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.713
150 meters away from the line.

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:27.113
He was

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.081
he was asking me

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.818
to drop my son and drop my my ba

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.019
and join the line of the

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.020
other people who were called

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.022
who will call before

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.891
I was later called by name.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.026
And then I was taken to another 

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:41.561
with two Israeli

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.730
soldiers pointing their guns at 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.632
and they were asking me to undre

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.100
I took off all my clothes,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.401
my sweater and pants,

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.004
and then I only had my boxer sho

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.272
And then the two soldiers

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:53.439
were looking at each other

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.841
and shouting in Hebrew.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.876
And then he said, Continue.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.145
Take off the boxer shorts.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.847
And then I looked at the other p

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:01.314
next to me,

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.282
the Palestinian

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.116
person next to me,

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:06.119
who was also detained with me.

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:07.820
And we were surprised

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.822
that they are asking us to

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.824
to strip of all our clothes.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.593
So we had nothing to do

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:16.162
but to take off our boxer shorts

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:18.298
And then when I was naked

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.266
for the first time in my life

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.534
in front of strangers,

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:25.004
I was asked to turn around.

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:26.506
So I.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.241
I did what they asked for.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.542
And then I was handcuffed

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.844
and I was blindfolded.

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:35.048
And then I was taken to a very c

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.382
and I was interrogated.

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:37.517
I introduced myself in

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:40.520
English and I asked them to

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:41.921
to listen to what I'm saying.

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.223
I was just returning to that.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.124
Took to Gaza

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.860
ten days before October seven,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.562
and I told them about everything

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.698
and he said, You are a Hamas act

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:53.166
And we stopped your wife and

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:53.800
three children.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.835
So he was threatening me with my

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:57.537
They stopped my wife and three c

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.572
at the next checkpoint.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.206
I told him,

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.374
Do you have any evidence,

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.243
any proof that I am Hamas activi

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.978
or a photograph,

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.412
a video, a satellite image

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.046
showing anything?

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.615
And then he slapped me across th

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.516
He said, You give me a proof.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:11.317
And I was wondering,

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.385
I mean, how could I

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.353
how could they give you a proof

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:15.455
that I am not Hamas?

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:17.523
And then I was taken, I was beat

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:21.361
I was violently treated

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.730
along with other young people li

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.697
And there was one

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:25.465
someone next to me

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:26.733
who was crying and said, please,

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.801
I want to go back to my pregnant

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:32.572
wife and my little daughter.

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:34.874
So that that was part of the

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:37.210
the May of my day during the fir

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.311
the first day.

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:39.045
And then I was

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:39.846
I found myself

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:43.182
in an Israeli detention center.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.851
Later I knew it was Beersheba

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:47.186
or a better suburb.

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:49.622
And later I was interrogated

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:50.790
by an Israeli captain.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.859
I told him about myself, everyth

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:55.495
And it was not a tough day for m

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:57.630
but for other people. It was tou

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.998
And then he said, okay, we will 

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:00.199
We are going to verify

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.801
the information you give us.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.903
And then 2 hours later,

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:05.104
an Israeli soldier said,

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.372
We are sorry about the mistake.

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:08.341
You are going home.

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:09.275
And then I said,

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:10.610
Are you serious about that?

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.478
I mean,

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.314
I'm going to be with my family a

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.748
And he said, I'm serious.

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.684
And then I later thought to myse

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:18.251
I mean,

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.252
how many mistakes

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:20.286
have the Israeli army

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:22.588
committed against other Palestin

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.223
And I thought that

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:26.726
my my quick release was, I think

00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:28.995
was a result of the pressure

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:31.097
that was put by measures.

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:33.399
News outlets,

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.401
The New Yorker and other medias.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:36.302
But I'm thinking about

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.337
there are many hundreds

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.404
other people like me

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:39.305
who are innocent,

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:41.708
who have been living in Gaza,

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:43.042
who have been

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.677
unable to leave Gaza to study

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:47.046
or to visit their relatives, etc

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:49.649
who have been born, you know, in

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:52.085
for during a hellish situation.

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:52.752
Right.

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:54.487
And these people do not have the

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.756
they had. So

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.291
So this has to end.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.225
This is what I think.

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:00.493
To that point, you

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:01.527
you published a public letter

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:02.395
to President Biden

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:03.596
on Christmas writing, quote,

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:05.365
I'm not asking you in this lette

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.199
to impose a two state

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:06.899
solution, nor

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.534
am I asking for the bringing bac

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.469
the lives of the children

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.069
and their families.

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:11.437
I'm asking you as a power

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:13.506
to impose a cease fire for peace

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.274
and for children and for humanit

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:16.576
When you look at the responses

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.044
of world leaders up to this poin

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:22.248
what do you think has been missi

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:23.316
Well, I

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:24.450
I mean, what is missing

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.952
is that they are not listening t

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:27.053
what the people in the world

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.321
are asking for.

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:29.956
Many people went out in the stre

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:31.290
and they asked for a cease fire,

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.725
not because they want Hamas,

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:34.060
but because they want to save

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.828
the lives of the children in Gaz

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:37.663
I think this war is not against 

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:38.131
and Hamas.

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:39.232
It's it's

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.033
it's a war between Israel

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.635
and the people in Gaza.

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:45.004
If you look at their numbers,

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.038
there are about

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:48.074
21,000 people who have been kill

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.275
Half of them are children.

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:50.343
And there is one thing

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:52.245
that is missing in this discours

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.679
Half of the population in Gaza,

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:56.115
there are more than 2 million pe

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:57.517
Half of them are children.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.152
So after each airstrike,

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.654
after each artillery shelling,

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:02.221
half of the

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:03.723
people who are killed are childr

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:06.292
not to mention the mothers, etc.

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:07.727
So they need to stop this war

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:09.162
to protect the children

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:10.430
and then to try to find

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.532
a just solution to the Palestini

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:14.400
It's not only about October 7th.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.370
I was wounded when I was 16 in 2

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:19.205
and no one ever talked about tha

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:22.942
And there are I lost a lot of fr

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:24.277
in my childhood. Right.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.545
But no one talks about this.

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:26.312
I mean, it didn't

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:28.381
start two months ago or three mo

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:30.049
It's been going for a long time.

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:32.552
And we need to find a just solut

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:34.520
to the Palestinian case.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.255
There's a there's a line in your

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:37.023
that really stood out to me.

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:37.623
You wrote

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:38.691
that is details

00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:40.059
began to emerge on October 7th.

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:40.293
Quote,

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.561
Some Gazans seemed excited

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:42.962
and happy about the attack,

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.264
but many of us were perplexed an

00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:47.099
Although Gaza has been devastate

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:47.967
by, in your words, Israeli

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:48.634
occupation,

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:50.269
I could not justify the atrociti

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:52.071
committed against Israeli civili

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.773
There's no reason to kill anyone

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:54.440
like that.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.108
When you look to the future,

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.610
you've been talking about it.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.213
What is your sense of what Gazan

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:00.646
the future?

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.381
Do people want Hamas to be invol

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:03.616
in governance going forward?

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:08.921
What is the future?

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:09.455
Well, the

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:10.690
future I mean, the problem,

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:11.157
I think, with

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.792
the Gaza is not about only Hamas

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:13.359
I mean, it's

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:14.594
there are there are lots of issu

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:16.963
There is the Palestinian

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:20.132
local rift between Hamas and Fat

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:20.800
itself.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.334
And Israel

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.368
has been benefiting

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:24.537
from this political rift.

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:26.372
I mean, what people in Gaza real

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:28.207
They want to have peace.

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.476
They want to have their own airp

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:32.011
their own seaport.

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:33.846
They need to travel when they wa

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.014
wherever they want.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.782
They need to be respected outsid

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:38.451
who are not respected inside Gaz

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:39.385
because we are being killed

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:41.187
every time from the sea, from th

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.989
from the sky, from the land.

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.423
But we are not even respected

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:45.658
outside of Gaza.

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:47.460
When you are trying to go to an 

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.094
I, for example,

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:49.428
I tried to go to the American Em

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:50.129
in Jerusalem

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:50.897
multiple times

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:53.299
and the Israeli side, my permit.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.367
And they want they don't

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.968
want us to live in Gaza

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:56.936
and they do not want us

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:57.970
to leave Gaza to study

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:58.471
or to to

00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:00.573
learn about other people outside

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:01.474
So people

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:02.375
I mean, people in Gaza

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.776
are asking for jobs.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:05.344
They are asking for a decent lif

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:07.346
They are asking to have their ow

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:09.215
crossing to control the border

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.316
crossings in Gaza.

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:11.317
They need to to.

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:12.151
I mean,

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:12.752
this has been

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:14.587
one of my dreams as a child.

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:16.989
I still have dreams of seeing Ga

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:20.993
from a plane window and I still 

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:21.928
dreams of seeing Gaza

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:24.196
from a distant ship.

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:25.865
I need to see all these things.

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:26.632
But you are.

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:28.768
I mean, Israel continues to kill

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:30.937
Not during this war,

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:32.405
but even before that.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:33.940
So why people were concerned?

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.641
Because Israel has killed

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:36.776
thousands of Palestinians

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:37.543
without Hamas

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:38.945
invading Palestinian

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:41.347
neighboring towns and cities.

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:42.982
But now, with the scenes

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:45.318
that we have seen on October sev

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:47.887
I thought that Israel would have

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:49.021
an excuse,

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.289
an excuse to kill more

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:52.191
and more people and mostly child

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:53.225
So children

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:56.762
and civilians have been the vict

00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:58.598
for a long time.

00:09:58.664 --> 00:09:59.298
Yeah.

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:00.132
Obviously, the IDF

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:00.967
says that they're responding

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:01.734
in the October 7th

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.469
attack and Hamas is intermingled

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:04.770
with the civilian population.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.172
But the scale of the death toll

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:07.440
is certainly something

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.441
that is not in dispute.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.743
The IDF also saying they made a 

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:11.777
when they detained you.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.779
It is a very important personal 

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:14.880
in The New York Times, your baby

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.982
Sara, we appreciate your time.

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:18.551
Thank you.

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:19.352
Thank you so much.

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:19.719
Thank you.
