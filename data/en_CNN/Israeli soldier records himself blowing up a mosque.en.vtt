00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:04.004
Inside Israel, people are
seeing a very different picture of the war

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:08.608
from the rest of the world and from from
what you've just heard with IDF soldiers

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:11.311
documenting their military offensive
in real time.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:15.382
Correspondent Jeremy
Diamond reports on this trend unfolding

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.584
on social media.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.254
This is a how to video

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.523
on how to blow up a mosque in Gaza.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.561
Format is internet fluent.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.897
The content is very real.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:35.101
Filmed, edited and posted on Instagram
by an Israeli soldier

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.605
It's one of dozens reviewed by CNN.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:43.243
For many in 2024, social media is everyday
life.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:46.913
Israeli soldiers are no different,
except they're fighting

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:50.683
Israel's largest
and most brutal war in decades.

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.019
In video

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.289
after video

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.491
after video, U.S.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:03.296
soldiers document the destruction of Gaza
and rejoice on this.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.167
They filmed detonations
to use as wedding invitations

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:14.507
Among them are would be comedians

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:18.978
whose videos satirizing the war
show the devastation in Gaza.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.782
Air you get to see the

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.150
satellite lands.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.118
And now

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.254
up to five soldiers

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.790
have always documented themselves.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:32.792
It could be in journals.

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:37.097
It could be with you taking pictures.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:41.367
Avner Carvajal who served in the IDF
during the second intifada.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.704
He leads the group Breaking the Silence,
which encourages

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:48.141
soldiers to speak out
about the realities of occupation.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:53.012
Even if we do find,
you know, the why we went to this war

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:56.583
important, significant and a necessity,

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.321
we have to ask ourselves
how we're conducting ourselves in wartime.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:05.191
The videos often
end up on the social media channels

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.260
of Right-Wing Political Commentators.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.465
They boast to the Israeli public of
the tactics used to defend them by going

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:20.340
the IDF told CNN that it has acted
and continues to act to identify

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.078
unusual cases that deviate from
what is expected of IDF soldiers.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:29.149
Those cases will be arbitrated
and significant command measures

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.718
will be taken against the soldiers
involved.

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:35.788
Images from Gaza of Israel's war injured

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:39.959
are rare on Israeli television,
but they're there on tick tock.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:43.329
The overarching theme is that,
you know, we're here.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.798
We're going to win. We're powerful enough.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:50.103
And I think that what these soldiers
are doing with these these rips

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:54.240
that we see on social media
is part of an attempt

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.677
to regain a sense of agency,

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:03.216
regain sense of power, reclaim,
you know, the sense of positive self

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:08.288
image, the way we talk about ourselves
before October seven, 09.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:14.060
At times, they openly defy their military'

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.097
in their own right

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.832
and film themselves, destroying

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:22.135
civilian shops

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.372
because Israel

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:29.676
is under increasing scrutiny
over the war in Gaza.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:33.479
These videos may well be adding
fuel to that criticism.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:41.354
Just in to CNN, the IDF says it's detained

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:45.825
more than 20 people suspected
of taking part in the October 7th attacks

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:49.596
as its raid of the largest
functioning hospital in Gaza continues.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:53.433
The Israeli military also says
it found weapons inside the facility

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:57.136
but CNN hasn't been able
to independently verify that photograph.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.374
The IDF, though, says the mission inside
the hospital is still ongoing.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:05.011
I want to get to CNN's Nic Robertson
who is live in Tel Aviv for us.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:07.780
So, Nic, what more are you learning

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:11.050
Well, there's a couple of things
about the hospital.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.285
We're learning from.

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:16.522
The World Health Organization say
they are trying to work with the Israeli

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:21.894
authorities to get access to the hospital
and stabilize the situation there.

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:25.798
According to hospital
authorities, electricity

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:30.370
and the ICU unit and possibly oxygen,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.073
oxygen supply there as well as well
are in critical condition.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:34.907
And this could threaten

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:38.678
the lives of several patients and infants
that are within the

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:42.282
within the ICU, the critical care unit
at the hospital there.

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:47.620
But to the what the IDF is saying
that they have now rounded up 20 suspects

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.257
they say, who were involved
in the October 7th attacks.

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:54.460
They've released photographs
of a few of them

00:04:54.894 --> 00:05:00.733
that we cannot independently verify
were involved in the October 7th attacks.

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:04.170
The IDF described one of them
as an ambulance driver.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.672
Again, something we can't verify.

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:09.742
The IDF originally went into the hospital,
they said, because they had credible

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:14.447
intelligence that there were possibly
the bodies of hostages, that they had this

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:17.884
intelligence, they say, from their sources
and from other hostages.

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:22.922
The IDF point to the fact that hostages
have been held in hospitals before.

00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:26.025
And according to hospital officials
at the National Hospital,

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:30.229
the IDF were digging up bodies and some of
the temporary graves that have been done

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.298
get inside the hospital
to check those bodies.

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:35.902
But later in the day yesterday, Thursday,
the IDF said

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:40.039
that they were becoming aware
that they could be terror operatives

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.876
hiding among the displaced people
within the hospital.

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:47.080
And they began to filter out
the displaced people from the hospital,

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:49.849
taking into custody those suspects.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:50.750
And now they say.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.853
20 suspects involved, October 7th,

00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:56.889
have now been rounded up from that
hospital Yeah.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.325
Nic Robertson
going to continue to follow those updates.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:00.026
Thank you so much.
