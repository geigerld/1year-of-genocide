STORY. &gt;&gt; OUR THANKS TO HIM. WE ALSO HAVE OUR TEAMS ON THE GROUND IN MAINE RIGHT NOW. THEY WILL HAVE UPDATES FOR US SURROUNDING THE MORNING. &gt;&gt; WE ARE ALSO FOLLOWING ANOTHER MAJOR STORY, THIS MORNING, EARLIER THIS MORNING. SMOKE BILLOWING OVER GAZA AFTER AN AIRSTRIKE IS SEEN FROM SDEROT, ISRAEL. ISRAEL SAYS THEY CONDUCTED A TARGETED RAID OF THE TANKS INSIDE NORTHERN GAZA BEFORE WITHDRAWING, YOU CAN SEE IN THIS VIDEO PUBLISHED BY THE IDF, ARMORED VEHICLES, INCLUDING A BULLDOZER ISRAEL SAYS IS PART OF THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE NEXT STAGE OF COMBAT. IN THESE NEW SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW SIGNIFICANT DESTRUCTION ACROSS GAZA ON THE L AN IMAGE FROM OCTOBER 10TH, AND ON THE RIGHT, JUST 11 DAYS LATER. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH IS FLATTENED THERE, THIS COMES AS PRIME MINISTER SPOKE YESTERDAY FOR GROUND INCURSION. HERE'S WE SAID. &gt;&gt; WE ARE RAINING HELLFIRE ON HAMAS. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE PREPARING FOR A GROUND INCURSION, I WILL NOT DETAIL WHEN, HOW, OR HOW MANY. OR THE OVERALL CONSIDERATION THAT WE ARE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. MOST OF WHICH ARE UNKNOWN TO THE PUBLIC, THIS IS HOW IT NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THE LIVES OF OUR SOLDIERS. &gt;&gt; ERIN BURNETT JOINS US FROM JERUSALEM. AIR, AND THAT WAS A BIG SET OF MOVEMENTS OWNED THE GROUND OVERNIGHT, I'M WONDERING HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT WAS. AND THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE JUST HEARD THE PRIME MINISTER SAY. &gt;&gt; VERY SIGNIFICANT, POPPY. IN FACT IN THIS WAR THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSAULT ON GAZA SO FAR. THAT MIGHT BE A GROUND ASSAULT ON CARS OVER THE PAST DECADE. IT DOES VERY MUCH MOVE TO THE NEXT STAGE. THE FORCES WENT IN, THEY DID COME OUT AFTER CONDUCTING OPERATIONS. THEY SAID THEY KILLED NUMEROUS TERRORISTS. THEY DID NOT GIVE AN EXACT NUMBER. ALSO ANTI TANK MINE SEARCHING. AS THEY WENT THROUGH THAT RUBBLE IN NORTHERN GAZA. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN AN SIGNIFICANT WAY, COULD BE THE BIGGEST IN A DECADE. WE DO KNOW SPECIAL FORCES OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN AND GAZA, THAT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT OVERNIGHT AND THE REALITY OF IT IS OF COURSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE IMAGES BEFORAND AFTER, IT HAS BEEN REDUCED TO RUBBLE. WE COMPARED IT TO WHAT EVEN YOU SEE IN A PLACE LIKE BAKHMUT. BUT THE REALITY IS THE PRE-IMPOSED, YOU COULD SEE IT ALREADY WHAT ISRAEL HAS ACCOMPLISHED IN ITS WAR AS IT SEES IT THROUGH THE STRIKES. THOUSANDS OF STRIKES JUST OVER THESE PAST THREE WEEKS THAT WE HAVE BEEN COVERING THIS WAR. THEY DIDN'T RELEASE THAT VIDEO. OF COURSE WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE WHEN YOU GET A FEW OF THE FRONTLINE THAT VIDEO IS COMING FROM THE IDF. THEY HAVE NOT PROVIDED THE ACCESS FOR JOURNALISTS TO ACTUALLY SEE THAT AND WITNESS THAT OURSELVES THE POPPY. &gt;&gt; AARON, THE SPLIT SCREEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. OF THE TWO DIFFERENT TIMELINES FOR GAZA. UNDERSCORES THE ACUTE NATURE OF THE BAIT, THE ONGOING INTENSIVE DEBATE FOR HUMANITARIANS. THE U.N. IS ALMOST RUNNING OUT OF FUEL, SCALING BACK HUMANITARIAN RELATIONS. WHAT IS THE LATEST EFFORTS TO TRY TO EXPAND IT AND TO CONTINUE TO RUN INTO ROADBLOCKS? &gt;&gt; YOU USE THE WORD ACUTE. I THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT WORD. THE ONE SAID THEY WOULD RUN OUT ALL NECESSARY SUPPLIES FOR ANY HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE OVERNIGHT. WE ARE NOW IN THE AFTERNOON IN ISRAEL, THEY SAY THEY ARE NOW RATIONING FUEL. THAT IS GIVING THEM A BIT MORE TIME, BUT THEY ARE RATIONING. THAT MEANS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING WHAT THEY MADE. HOSPITALS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SHUT DOWN. MANY OF THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. THE U.N. USES THE WORD PARALYZED TO DESCRIBE THE SITUATION THEY'RE FACING ON THE GROUND. I WAS TALKING TO A PEDIATRICIAN, UN-AMERICAN, THE EXHAUSTION IN HER VOICE. SHE SAID ONE TOILET FOR 800 PEOPLE. AND JUST THAT IMAGE OF COURSE IS HARD TO DESCRIBE. YOU CAN DESCRIBE THE LINES. YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT THAT MEANS AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DISEASE AND THAT IS WHAT AN AMERICAN PEDIATRICIAN IS EXPERIENCING AMONG THAT RAFAH BORDER CROSSING. IT IS OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE IN THE NORTH. THE ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES AS YOU KNOW WHILE THEY HAVE DECIMATED THE NORTH. ALSO STRIKE AREAS CLOSER TO RAFAH IN THE ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES.
