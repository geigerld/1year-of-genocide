breaking news in the Middle East Hamas&nbsp; has announced it has agreed to a ceasefire&nbsp;&nbsp; agreement proposed by Egypt and cutter we're&nbsp; waiting to see if Israel will accept the deal&nbsp;&nbsp; as well Beth Sanner is a former deputy director&nbsp; of National Intelligence for us she's joining&nbsp;&nbsp; us on the phone so what's your reaction Beth&nbsp; let me just read to you a little bit from the&nbsp;&nbsp; statement that Hamas released the statement said&nbsp; that uh Ismael hania the head of the political&nbsp;&nbsp; Bureau of Hamas quote made a phone call to&nbsp; the Cuttery prime minister shik Muhammad B&nbsp;&nbsp; Abdul Rahman Alani and to the Egyptian minister&nbsp; of intelligence Mr AB abas Kamal and informed them&nbsp;&nbsp; of hamas's agreement to their proposal regarding a&nbsp; ceasefire agreement what's your reaction Beth well&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that um first we have to hold our breath&nbsp; here but I do think that the um Israelis are&nbsp;&nbsp; likely to sign on since this is the same terms as&nbsp; far as we know to what they had signed on earlier&nbsp;&nbsp; so I'm actually pretty hopeful I think that the&nbsp; military pressure and this idea that the Rafa&nbsp;&nbsp; operation was about to go forward may have made&nbsp; the difference the last framework proposal that&nbsp;&nbsp; uh we know about Beth had the release of 20 to 33&nbsp; Israeli hostages over several weeks in exchange&nbsp;&nbsp; for a temporary ceasefire and the release of&nbsp; Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel uh&nbsp;&nbsp; and that was supposed to result in ARR restoration&nbsp; of sustainable calm during which the remaining&nbsp;&nbsp; hostages captive Israeli soldiers and the bodies&nbsp; of hostages would also be exchanged for the&nbsp;&nbsp; release of more Palestinian prisoners that was an&nbsp; earlier proposal that was clearly discussed with&nbsp;&nbsp; both cter and Egypt uh if that is the plan right&nbsp; now and if ifas has agreed to that that would be&nbsp;&nbsp; a huge development an absolutely huge development&nbsp; and I think that you know part of the issue here&nbsp;&nbsp; is that Yaya senoir who is as far as we know still&nbsp; holed up in southern Gaza um and the political&nbsp;&nbsp; leadership hania who is the one who said publicly&nbsp; that they were a go you know they have trouble&nbsp;&nbsp; communicating uh it's hard for them to do that but&nbsp; also they're not completely on the same page and&nbsp;&nbsp; they don't have the same interests in some ways&nbsp; given that senoir you know is potentially staring&nbsp;&nbsp; down the barrel of a gun and also the party who&nbsp; wants to walk away from this and survive so you&nbsp;&nbsp; know it could be a very big deal and I think that&nbsp; this delay may have been uh part of the discussion&nbsp;&nbsp; and trying to hear back from sinir inside of Gaza&nbsp; Beth standby I want to go to Jeremy Diamond he's&nbsp;&nbsp; joining us live from Jerusalem right now Jeremy&nbsp; has there been any reaction from the Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp; government to what the Hamas has just announced&nbsp; uh wolther has not yet and so we are applying a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of caveats to this this news that is just&nbsp; breaking at this hour and that is wolf that we&nbsp;&nbsp; have now heard from Hamas in a statement that&nbsp; they posted to their telegram Channel saying&nbsp;&nbsp; that they have agreed to the proposal regarding a&nbsp; ceasefire agreement isma hania hamas's political&nbsp;&nbsp; leader speaking to the kaderi Prime Minister as&nbsp; well as the Egyptian intelligence Chief to relay&nbsp;&nbsp; that message but as you uh said wolf we have yet&nbsp; to hear from the Israeli government officially&nbsp;&nbsp; we have yet to hear from the Americans from the&nbsp; Egyptians from the cutteries and so we do have&nbsp;&nbsp; to caveat this this news which does carry with&nbsp; it uh quite a bit of promise and hope here hope&nbsp;&nbsp; of course for the hundreds of thousands of people&nbsp; in Gaza who have endured unspeakable Horrors over&nbsp;&nbsp; seven months of War as well as for the families&nbsp; of those hostages Who Remain captive in Gaza who&nbsp;&nbsp; have hoped and prayed for the day that they&nbsp; will get to hold their loved ones in their&nbsp;&nbsp; arms once again uh but what we do know wolf is&nbsp; that there has been an Egyptian framework on the&nbsp;&nbsp; table over the course of the last week which uh&nbsp; officials on all sides had had a lot of hope that&nbsp;&nbsp; it could potentially uh bring these two sides&nbsp; together in particular because Israel did make&nbsp;&nbsp; uh several key concessions including allowing the&nbsp; return the unrestricted return of Palestinians to&nbsp;&nbsp; Northern Gaza as part of this latest framework&nbsp; something that they had resisted for some time&nbsp;&nbsp; and had been a major sticking point this framework&nbsp; agreement that was on the table last week would&nbsp;&nbsp; see the release of some 20 to 33 Israeli hostages&nbsp; over several weeks uh of of a ceasefire and then&nbsp;&nbsp; ultimately leading to a longer term ceasefire&nbsp; perhaps a one-year ceasefire between Israel and&nbsp;&nbsp; Hamas Israel had not agreed to every point in this&nbsp; framework but it had uh it did have significant&nbsp;&nbsp; input in this framework as it was then presented&nbsp; to Hamas we've watched wolf over the last uh few&nbsp;&nbsp; days as that optimism around those negotiations&nbsp; had quickly soured it appeared that Hamas was&nbsp;&nbsp; sticking to its demand that an end to the war&nbsp; altogether that Israel commit to that as part&nbsp;&nbsp; of this agreement something that Israel has&nbsp; refused to do but now hours after the Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp; military began dropping evacuation leaflets on&nbsp; Eastern Rafa ordering a 100,000 civilians to&nbsp;&nbsp; flee Hamas now putting in a statement hours later&nbsp; that they have agreed to this initial proposal&nbsp;&nbsp; we don't know whether that uh evacuation order in&nbsp; Rafa was the key factor that changed hamas's mind&nbsp;&nbsp; we also don't know whether any major changes to&nbsp; this Egyptian framework have been made in order&nbsp;&nbsp; to get Hamas to agree to it and and like I said&nbsp; we have yet to hear from all of the other parties&nbsp;&nbsp; involved so as much as there is a promise&nbsp; and hope in this statement from Hamas there&nbsp;&nbsp; is certainly not certainty at this stage wolf&nbsp; Jeremy I want you to stand by MJ Lee our White&nbsp;&nbsp; House correspondent is getting more information&nbsp; us reaction I take it MJ the president President&nbsp;&nbsp; Biden had a conversation a phone conversation with&nbsp; prime minister Benjamin nanyu earlier today is&nbsp;&nbsp; that right that's right we know President Biden&nbsp; and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;&nbsp; spoke earlier today and of course these ongoing&nbsp; hostage uh deal negotiations was one of the many&nbsp;&nbsp; topics that the two leaders discussed as has&nbsp; been the case for all of their recent phone&nbsp;&nbsp; conversations uh but what we are waiting for right&nbsp; now is an official White House and US reaction to&nbsp;&nbsp; this news that Hamas has apparently agreed to&nbsp; a temporary ceasefire deal so we'll bring that&nbsp;&nbsp; to you whenever we have word of that uh but&nbsp; I heard Jeremy in his last conversation with&nbsp;&nbsp; you really leaning into the various caveats that&nbsp; are at play here and I do think that uh kind of a&nbsp;&nbsp; note of caution from here in Washington is wise as&nbsp; well that is just to say that we have had moments&nbsp;&nbsp; like this before in the months of negotiations to&nbsp; get to a temporary ceasefire and hostages release&nbsp;&nbsp; deal where we appear to be on the brink of a&nbsp; deal and other moments where we appear to be&nbsp;&nbsp; on the brink of these talks completely falling&nbsp; apart so again as we wait for official US word&nbsp;&nbsp; and reaction from the Israeli side to this news&nbsp; from Hamas that they are agreeing to this deal I&nbsp;&nbsp; do think again just uh leaning into that note of&nbsp; caution uh is is definitely uh worth doing uh but&nbsp;&nbsp; uh what US officials have been doing of course in&nbsp; recent weeks is very much uh pushing hard for this&nbsp;&nbsp; deal to get done because uh the administration&nbsp; believes that this is really uh the only clear&nbsp;&nbsp; way to eventually getting to an end to this War&nbsp; uh but I can't underscore enough how important it&nbsp;&nbsp; is for us officials to try to get to that point to&nbsp; try to get to the point of uh hostages coming out&nbsp;&nbsp; and this uh this conflict that has been going&nbsp; on for so many months to come to an end and of&nbsp;&nbsp; course a big part of that is avoiding a major&nbsp; Rafa incursion from taking place and of course&nbsp;&nbsp; the Israelis have been warning for weeks and weeks&nbsp; now that they are getting increasingly prepared&nbsp;&nbsp; to go ahead and take that step if this deal does&nbsp; not come together wolf is the White House still&nbsp;&nbsp; planning a press briefing at the bottom the hour&nbsp; in about 15 minutes or so from now MJ yeah that&nbsp;&nbsp; press briefing has actually been pushed back&nbsp; to 2:00 so that is when we will hear uh from&nbsp;&nbsp; National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby&nbsp; and where we will get an opportunity to press&nbsp;&nbsp; him on all of these latest developments and of&nbsp; course we'll be bringing that to you as well wolf
