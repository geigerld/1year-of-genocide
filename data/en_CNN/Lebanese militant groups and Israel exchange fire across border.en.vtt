00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:00.533
The Israel

00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.634
Defense Forces say

00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:03.837
it is seeing a significant escalation

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.071
on the border with

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.873
Lebanon and has been striking back

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.141
after some 20 rockets

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.310
or so were fired toward Israel.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.612
Today, the Iran backed militant group

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:14.381
Hezbollah says it also attacked

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.683
five Israeli military post.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.585
A spokesperson for the IDF

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.053
says that tells CNN

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.389
that Hezbollah is trying to drag Lebanon

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:23.189
into the conflict,

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.291
certainly something people in the region

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.259
have been worried about.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.561
CNN's Ben Wedeman is in southern Lebanon

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:29.929
for CNN. Right now.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.998
Ben, what have you been seeing as there

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:32.866
is this concern

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.501
that if Israel does, if

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.636
and when embark on this ground invasion,

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:37.871
that the fighting could increase

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:38.605
and then Lebanon

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:41.107
could get pulled into this war

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:42.909
Now, Caitlin,

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.310
we're hearing a lot of this

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.212
cross-border fire

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.680
today wasn't just Hezbollah.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.314
There was

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.650
focusing mainly on Israeli

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.152
military positions

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:52.952
along the border,

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.421
but also the military

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:55.989
wing of Hamas got involved

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.690
and they claimed to have fired

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.461
30 rockets into the upper Galilee region.

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.531
But it's important to keep in

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:05.465
mind that

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:06.666
even though certainly

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.968
we are seeing more cross-border

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:12.138
fire on this in this area, than perhaps

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:15.475
2006 during that war back then.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:19.112
But Hezbollah is being very careful

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:19.879
to keep it

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.614
within certain limits

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.850
to avoid a full scale war.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.652
It seems to be wanting to show

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:28.922
that it is supporting Hamas by doing some

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.659
action here without going all the way.

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:33.626
Keep in mind

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.161
that this just a few months ago,

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.230
the Israeli defense minister said that

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.598
if Hezbollah decides

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.968
to launch a war on Israel, Israel will

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:46.172
bomb Lebanon back into the Stone Age.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.575
So there is a certain hesitance

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.743
and certainly in this area where we are.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:51.945
There is nervousness

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.179
about the possibility

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.914
of a full scale war.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.883
We spoke with a shopkeeper here

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.051
who told us that

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.354
he has his bags packed in his car

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.124
ready to go in the event that things

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.392
go really south.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.627
So there is nervousness.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:08.495
But at the moment,

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:08.862
I think

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:11.865
a certain level of violence without going

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.067
too far is being maintained here.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:15.468
Caitlin.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.670
Yeah.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.771
And that's really interesting

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.106
given the idea that I mean,

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:21.207
if you see these strikes

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:21.908
going back and forth,

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:22.442
something you say

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.344
we haven't seen in 20 years.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:24.844
And I should note

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:25.345
we're hearing

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.180
a little bit of activity here right now

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.681
in Tel Aviv. We'll be monitoring that.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.682
But but you're saying

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:30.817
what Hezbollah is doing

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.819
is maybe a little bit, but not enough

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.754
to provoke Israel.

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:35.955
And that is not the sense

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:36.689
of what's

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:37.690
actually happening on the ground,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.127
what their decision making is

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:42.495
Yes.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.763
I mean,
they are doing

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:45.498
I mean, what we're seeing really in terms

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:46.566
of Hezbollah's

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:47.700
capabilities

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.903
is really just the tip of the iceberg.

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.138
These are very localized attacks.

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:54.541
They're not lobbing missiles into that

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.376
in the direction of large

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.278
Israeli population centers.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.612
We're getting

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:00.914
Hezbollah is putting out

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:02.682
videos every day.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.416
They're

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:04.651
they seem to be focusing

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.519
on communications,

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.123
surveillance and observation equipment.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.025
On the Israeli side, occasionally

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.460
hitting tanks and troops as well.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.429
But it's really very military

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:17.363
in its focus,

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.232
not what we're seeing,

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.668
for instance, in coming out of Gaza.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.236
This is very specific

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:26.439
Caitlin.

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:27.807
Yeah.

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:29.809
And clearly the best,

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:30.877
though, seems worried

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.612
that it could go from the state

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:33.947
of where it is right now

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:34.847
to something bigger

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.216
because this warning

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.350
came out from the State Department

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.152
telling Americans who are in Lebanon

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.120
leave the country as soon as possible.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.521
They're worried

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:43.356
there may not be commercial options

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.457
to do so.

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:47.427
As soon or in the near stage, I guess.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.195
I mean, have you sensed a change

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:50.430
in how people feel?

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.664
Are they going about everyday life

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:52.865
or do you think

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.200
do you sense something different

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.102
since you've been on the ground

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.938
Well, certainly in this area

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:01.007
along the border, there is nervousness.

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:02.942
Some people have already left.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:04.410
Others have left and come back

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.944
because

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:05.612
they can't afford

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.281
to hang out in hotels in Beirut.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.550
But certainly in general,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.918
if you're talking about Lebanon,

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.186
there is nervousness.

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:15.488
And it's not just the US government,

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:18.992
the UK Germany, Australia, Saudi Arabia

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:19.792
and others

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:23.062
have told their nationals in Lebanon

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.964
that it's a good time to leave

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:26.566
now while they're still flights

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.200
keep in mind

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.801
that in 2006

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:30.136
at the beginning of the war

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:31.371
between Hezbollah

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:32.372
and Israel,

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:34.774
one of the first things Israel struck

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.377
was the airport in Beirut.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.411
It's also important

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.246
to keep in mind that when we're talking

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:41.547
about nationals

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:42.448
of the US,

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:45.285
Australia, U.K., Germany, Canada

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:46.552
and whatnot,

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:47.220
there are

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.656
hundreds of thousands of Lebanese

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.658
who have dual passports.

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:53.092
So it's not just tourists

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:55.094
who are here or businessmen.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.929
There are a lot of Lebanese

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:59.198
who hold these passports as well.

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:02.802
And in 2006, all of these countries

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:04.170
had to send ships

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.472
to take their nationals out

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.207
And so we're talking about

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.542
not just a few thousand,

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:10.243
we are talking about

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:12.178
hundreds of thousands of people

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:14.080
who in theory should leave.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.449
But many of them are obviously connected

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.518
to their land, to their homeland,

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:19.819
and won't be leaving.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.055
But we're not talking about a small

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.057
number of people. Caitlin.

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:26.025
Yeah.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.194
A difficult decision for a region that is

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:29.562
certainly on edge.
