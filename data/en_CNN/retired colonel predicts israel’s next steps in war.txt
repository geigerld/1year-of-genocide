Joining me now is CNN military analyst colonel&nbsp; Cedric Leighton. Colonel, thank you for your&nbsp;&nbsp; time this morning. First off, I want to get your&nbsp; reaction to secretary of state Antony blinken in&nbsp;&nbsp; ramallah. He with was just there meeting with&nbsp; Mahmoud abbas, the Palestinian authorities&nbsp;&nbsp; president. What does that tell you, especially&nbsp; that he is engaging once again in shuttle&nbsp;&nbsp; diplomacy. Weighs at the summit Saturday meeting&nbsp; with the foreign ministers of Egypt and Qatar and&nbsp;&nbsp; Jordan. What do you make of of this? &gt;&gt; Yeah, good morning, Amara. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think what secretary blinken is doing&nbsp; is trying to shore up support among the&nbsp;&nbsp; Palestinian authority as well as the Arab&nbsp; nations for a two-state solution. He would&nbsp;&nbsp; like the Palestinian authority also to take over&nbsp; the administration of gaza once Israel achieves&nbsp;&nbsp; its goals of destroying hamas. Whether or not&nbsp; Israel can achieve the goals is, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp; another matter. I think the goal of&nbsp; the secretary of state is very much [6:10:46 AM] secretary of state is very much to get&nbsp; the Palestinian authority represented by&nbsp;&nbsp; Mahmoud abbas in on his side and make that&nbsp; work for him from a political standpoint.&nbsp; &gt;&gt; What are your thoughts on this four-hour window&nbsp; for this safe corridor? That window is about to&nbsp;&nbsp; close at 2:00 P.M. Local time. It's a little after&nbsp; 1:00 there. And Elia brought up these issues. How&nbsp;&nbsp; do you get the messages to the civilians dealing&nbsp; with power outages and internet outages in gaza,&nbsp;&nbsp; and let's say they do get the message.&nbsp; Of course, resources is a huge problem,&nbsp;&nbsp; right, because no fuel, as we heard from the U.S.&nbsp; Special envoy, David Satterfield, no new fuel has&nbsp;&nbsp; gone into gaza since the war began. How helpful do&nbsp; you think this safe corridor that idf is opening&nbsp;&nbsp; will be for the civilians to move south? &gt;&gt; I think it's too short a time period. [6:11:47 AM] period. Four hours is not enough time to get&nbsp; people out, especially those that have special&nbsp;&nbsp; needs or are in, you know, in a place where&nbsp; they can't really get transportation. So far,&nbsp;&nbsp; to my knowledge at least, we have not seen&nbsp; a stream of refugees on foot marching down,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, the highway there. So Elliot is right.&nbsp; If you don't have any internet connectivity,&nbsp;&nbsp; if you don't have power, there is a risk that you&nbsp; might not get that message. The Israelis have in&nbsp;&nbsp; the past distributed flyers. They air dropped&nbsp; flyers into the Palestinian areas to get them&nbsp;&nbsp; that kind of a message. Whether or not they&nbsp; did that in this case, I'm not sure. But they&nbsp;&nbsp; are definitely -- the Israelis are definitely&nbsp; trying several ways to get the message to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoblem that they have is it's not coordinated&nbsp; with other aspects of their military operation&nbsp;&nbsp; or doesn't seem to be, at least. &gt;&gt; You know, there is a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; aid still at the border that needs to get in. [6:12:47 AM] needs to get in. Of course, we are still&nbsp; talking about hostages that the U.S. And&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel are quite involved in trying to get&nbsp; released. But there is also what seems to&nbsp;&nbsp; be a public split that's forming between the&nbsp; U.S. And Israel. That how you see it? Because&nbsp;&nbsp; you have Netanyahu who is saying there will&nbsp; not be any kind of ceasefire or a pause until&nbsp;&nbsp; all hostages are released. But then you also&nbsp; have the secretary of state blinken publicly&nbsp;&nbsp; stating there needs to be a humanitarian pause. &gt;&gt; Yeah, the secretary of state is trying to very&nbsp;&nbsp; much bridge the gap between the dezur for&nbsp; a complete ceasefire and Israel's public&nbsp;&nbsp; stance at least on the issue of either a&nbsp; ceasefire or humanitarian pause. In fact,&nbsp;&nbsp; they are doing some humanitarian pauses&nbsp; like the one that's in existence right now,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the fact of the matter is that Israel has&nbsp; its war aims and it believes it can't be seen to [6:13:49 AM] it believes it can't be seen to be deviating from&nbsp; them, and they think this kind of a humanitarian&nbsp;&nbsp; pause may be a slight deviation or a large&nbsp; deviation in their minds, perhaps R from their war&nbsp;&nbsp; aims. So the secretary has a bit of a problem here&nbsp; in the effort to kind of bridge that that gap.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a difficult needle to thread in this case. &gt;&gt; What is your sense of what is happening on&nbsp;&nbsp; the ground? Last we heard Friday is that&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel encircled gaza city. What happens next? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm not sure that the encirclement&nbsp;&nbsp; has been completed but may have been by this time.&nbsp; You know, the encirclement is designed to besiege&nbsp;&nbsp; or starve out the hamas fighters. When they do&nbsp; that and we see the map of gaza right there,&nbsp;&nbsp; gaza city in particular, that's in the center of&nbsp; the gaza strip. And the idea there is not only to&nbsp;&nbsp; encircle that area, but also to make it possible&nbsp; for Israeli ground forces to enter a certain [6:14:52 AM] ground forces to enter a certain zone within&nbsp; that city and then be able to go in and,&nbsp;&nbsp; in essence, clear that zone. That's going&nbsp; to be difficult for the Israelis to do. I&nbsp;&nbsp; think that might be the next step,&nbsp; but they have to watch the tunnels,&nbsp;&nbsp; they are going to have to make sure that they&nbsp; don't get ambushed and, you know, also watch for&nbsp;&nbsp; improvised explosive devices. So those are the&nbsp; kinds of challenges that they have right now.&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of risks&nbsp; going in there on the ground.
