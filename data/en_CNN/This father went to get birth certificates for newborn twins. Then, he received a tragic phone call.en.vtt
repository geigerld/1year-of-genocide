in Gaza, a peace deal

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:03.458 line:71%
cannot come soon enough.

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:04.291 size:84% position:42% line:71%
Just in the past

00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:05.125 size:75% position:38% line:71%
24 hours,

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.750 line:71%
we have seen more than 30

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.666 position:56% line:71%
people killed in Israeli strikes,

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.875 line:71%
including three day old twins

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:12.458 size:88% position:44% line:71%
and their mother.

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:15.416 position:59% line:71%
CNN's Jeremy Diamond has this report.

00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:18.291 size:84% position:42% line:71%
All of us have.

00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:19.875 line:71%
How do you console a man

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.291 position:59% line:71%
whose whole world has been shattered?

00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.625 line:71%
I'm not a man who, hours

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.416 line:71%
earlier, was locked in the warm

00:00:26.416 --> 00:00:29.375 position:61% line:71%
embrace of his wife and newborn babies,

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:32.500 line:71%
but now cries out in agony,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.125 position:56% line:71%
begging to see them one last time.

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:36.500 size:78% position:39% line:71%
Oh, let us.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.291 size:72% position:36% line:71%
His new

00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:40.208 position:59% line:71%
horrific reality is too much to bear.

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:42.416 size:81% position:41% line:71%
I almost lost

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:45.000 position:56% line:71%
his wife and twin babies are dead.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.500 line:71%
Killed in an Israeli strike

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.583 position:58% line:71%
on their apartment in central Gaza,

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:50.666 line:71%
according to hospital officials.

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.291 size:69% position:34% line:71%
I saw

00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:52.416 line:71%
and her brother Oscar

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:54.666 line:71%
were just three days old.

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.458 size:84% position:42% line:71%
The Palestinian

00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:56.375 size:88% position:44% line:71%
ministry of Health

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:59.666 position:58% line:71%
says they are among 115 infants born

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.666 position:56% line:71%
and killed during the war in Gaza.

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.833 position:58% line:71%
Hours earlier, their mother, Jumana,

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:05.750 size:81% position:41% line:71%
a pharmacist,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.208 line:71%
was blissfully responding

00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:08.375 size:88% position:44% line:71%
to congratulations

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.458 line:71%
and well wishes on Facebook.

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:11.916 line:71%
I feel like it was a miracle.

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:13.416 line:71%
Alhamdulillah sister,

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:15.375 line:71%
everything is going well.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.000 line:71%
I don't know Jumana.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.208 position:59% line:71%
I saw an usher now lie here in a room

00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:21.791 line:71%
consumed with Mohammed's

00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:23.291 line:71%
inconsolable grief.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.333 size:88% position:44% line:71%
That's for us to.

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.958 position:56% line:71%
These are the birth certificates,

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:28.791 size:72% position:36% line:71%
he says.

00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:29.916 line:71%
While I was getting them,

00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:31.458 position:56% line:71%
I received a phone call telling me

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.125 line:71%
our apartment was targeted

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:34.416 line:71%
and that my wife and children

00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:36.500 line:71%
were at Al-Aqsa hospital.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.125 line:71%
Neighbors are still sifting

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:40.416 position:59% line:71%
through the aftermath of that strike.

00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:42.125 position:56% line:71%
Hospital officials say an Israeli

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:43.750 line:71%
shell hit the building.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.750 position:58% line:71%
The Israeli military did not respond

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.791 line:71%
to CNN's request for comment.

00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:50.833 position:58% line:71%
The victims of several other strikes

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:51.916 size:84% position:42% line:71%
in central Gaza

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:54.875 position:61% line:71%
also pour into Al-Aqsa martyrs hospital,

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.166 line:71%
and more parents grieve

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:59.208 line:71%
the deaths of their children.

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.583 position:56% line:71%
How can I live after you, my son?

00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:03.791 size:88% position:44% line:71%
This mother cries

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:04.500 size:84% position:42% line:71%
amid the grief.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.333 position:59% line:71%
There is also anger and exasperation,

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:08.375 line:71%
including from the dead

00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:11.041 line:71%
man's father, Adam.

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:12.458 line:71%
The entire unjust world

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:13.750 line:71%
does not care about this.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.041 position:56% line:71%
That's all I can say, Hassan says.

00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:16.833 size:81% position:41% line:71%
Just numbers.

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:17.791 line:71%
We are just numbers.

00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:19.375 line:71%
But for God, we are martyrs.

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:22.000 size:78% position:39% line:71%
One by one.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.833 size:84% position:42% line:71%
Their bodies are

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:23.958 line:71%
brought out of the morgue

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.208 position:58% line:71%
so the living can pray for the dead,

00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:27.333 line:71%
including nine month

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:30.375 position:58% line:71%
old Jamal and his father, Uday Amar.

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:33.958 position:61% line:71%
Mohammed is performing the same rituals

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.375 line:71%
for his wife and twin babies,

00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:37.500 size:88% position:44% line:71%
but prayers offer

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.041 line:71%
little comfort for a man

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:40.833 line:71%
who has lost everything

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:41.916 size:84% position:42% line:71%
for a new father

00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:44.291 line:71%
with no children to raise.

00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:47.250 position:58% line:71%
Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Haifa, Israel.

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:49.833 line:71%
Israel-Hamas cease fire

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.208 line:71%
talks are set to resume

00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:52.583 size:84% position:42% line:71%
Thursday in Doha

00:02:52.583 --> 00:02:54.625 line:71%
and a lot is riding on them.

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:56.416 line:71%
There has been some speculation

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:57.500 size:75% position:38% line:71%
that Iran

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.083 position:61% line:71%
might hold off on plans to attack Israel

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:03.083 position:59% line:71%
if a Gaza cease fire is reached soon.

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:05.791 position:63% line:71%
But some have cast serious doubt on that.

00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:07.833 line:71%
Iran has vowed to retaliate

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:09.291 line:71%
for the assassination of Hamas's

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:09.916 size:84% position:42% line:71%
political leader

00:03:09.916 --> 00:03:11.125 size:75% position:38% line:71%
in Tehran,

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.750 position:58% line:71%
an attack that it blames on Israel.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.875 size:88% position:44% line:71%
Meanwhile, sources

00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:15.625 size:72% position:36% line:71%
tell CNN

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:17.041 line:71%
Hamas is taking a position

00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:18.583 size:81% position:41% line:71%
of intentional

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:20.500 line:71%
ambiguity and ambiguity

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.083 position:56% line:71%
about appearing at the Doha talks.

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:25.291 position:63% line:71%
Representatives from Israel, Qatar, Egypt

00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:27.666 position:56% line:71%
and the U.S. are all taking part.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.083 line:71%
Nic Robertson joining us now

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:31.041 line:71%
from Tel Aviv with the details.

00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:32.208 size:81% position:41% line:71%
Hi there, Nic.

00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:33.291 size:72% position:36% line:71%
So Hamas

00:03:33.291 --> 00:03:34.833 line:71%
being very non-committal

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:35.541 size:84% position:42% line:71%
about the talks

00:03:35.541 --> 00:03:37.916 line:71%
that are set for Thursday.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.375 line:71%
What are you watching for?

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:40.625 line:71%
And if they don't show,

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:42.083 size:88% position:44% line:71%
are the talks off?

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:45.666 size:66% position:33% line:71%
No.

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:47.083 line:71%
There's a part of the talks

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:48.291 line:71%
that's going to happen there.

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:49.375 size:84% position:42% line:71%
Proximity talks.

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:50.375 size:78% position:39% line:71%
So the U.S.

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:51.500 size:75% position:38% line:71%
and Israel

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.583 line:71%
and the intermediaries,

00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:54.583 line:71%
Qatar and Egypt can meet

00:03:54.583 --> 00:03:56.625 line:71%
and are expected to meet in Doha

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.458 size:75% position:38% line:71%
tomorrow.

00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:02.291 line:71%
we do sort of see this strategic

00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:04.250 line:71%
all this ambiguity,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.083 line:71%
by Hamas as, as a potential way

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:09.583 line:71%
to try to put pressure on

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.041 line:71%
the Israeli government

00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:13.083 position:58% line:71%
because they're being very specific

00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:15.833 position:58% line:71%
about why they have this ambiguity.

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:16.500 size:84% position:42% line:71%
They are saying

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.458 line:71%
these are not negotiations

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.708 line:71%
from that point of view,

00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:21.041 line:71%
that the meeting in Doha

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.500 line:71%
should be about implementing,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.666 size:81% position:41% line:71%
the framework

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:27.666 position:56% line:71%
that President Biden put forward,

00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:30.833 position:56% line:71%
in, over the past couple of months

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:32.083 size:81% position:41% line:71%
that they say

00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:33.208 line:71%
that the Israeli government,

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:34.416 line:71%
Prime Minister Netanyahu,

00:04:34.416 --> 00:04:37.208 position:56% line:71%
who has added on additional things

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:38.625 size:78% position:39% line:71%
like control

00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:40.791 line:71%
and veto over prisoner exchange,

00:04:40.791 --> 00:04:43.583 position:61% line:71%
prisoner release, says about the control

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:45.208 line:71%
of the Philadelphia Corridor,

00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:47.625 position:63% line:71%
the control of the Rafah border crossing,

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:50.416 position:59% line:71%
all of which are huge issues for Hamas

00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:51.583 size:81% position:41% line:71%
that they say

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.666 position:63% line:71%
were not part of that original framework.

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:55.750 line:71%
So from their perspective.

00:04:56.625 --> 00:04:59.875 position:61% line:71%
you know, and speaking to other sources

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:02.375 line:71%
who are informed about the talks

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:04.750 line:71%
and about Hamas's position,

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.625 position:59% line:71%
it seems clear through this ambiguity

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:08.916 line:71%
as well, very clear

00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:11.125 line:71%
that if the talks were to go

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:13.250 line:71%
in Doha between the U.S.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.500 line:71%
and and Israel and Qatar

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.375 position:56% line:71%
and the Egyptians, as Hamas wants,

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:21.208 position:61% line:71%
then they would have somebody available

00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:24.208 position:58% line:71%
to have a follow on discussion with,

00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:26.458 position:56% line:71%
but I don't think expectations are

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:27.333 size:81% position:41% line:71%
at that point.

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:28.833 line:71%
I think the expectations

00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:30.541 line:71%
really at the moment,

00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:32.875 position:63% line:71%
questioning what is going to be different

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.375 position:56% line:71%
about these talks than any other,

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:35.708 line:71%
how much or has there

00:05:35.708 --> 00:05:37.250 line:71%
been any substantial change

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.791 position:59% line:71%
on the negotiating position of either

00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:40.458 line:71%
side, either Hamas or Israel?

00:05:40.458 --> 00:05:41.541 line:71%
And that's where things stand.

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:42.916 line:71%
And of course, that's what

00:05:42.916 --> 00:05:44.750 line:71%
Iran is waiting to see.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.041 line:71%
And the expectation is,

00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:48.125 position:63% line:71%
regardless of the outcome of these talks,

00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:49.625 size:88% position:44% line:71%
Iran will strike.

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:50.375 line:71%
It's just a question

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:52.875 line:71%
of how big that strike would be.

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:53.541 size:75% position:38% line:71%
And, Nick,

00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:54.791 line:71%
if you want to talk to us about,

00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:55.166 size:81% position:41% line:71%
you know, what

00:05:55.166 --> 00:05:56.750 line:71%
you're hearing there in Israel,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.125 size:88% position:44% line:71%
because obviously,

00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:58.791 size:81% position:41% line:71%
Israeli Prime

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.166 line:71%
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:02.083 position:56% line:71%
has been facing a lot of pressure.

00:06:02.083 --> 00:06:02.541 size:78% position:39% line:71%
And it seems

00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:03.541 line:71%
there seems to be a difference

00:06:03.541 --> 00:06:05.791 position:58% line:71%
between what the public wants versus

00:06:05.791 --> 00:06:06.666 size:88% position:44% line:71%
the political will

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:09.333 position:61% line:71%
and what the government, is aiming for.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.416 size:69% position:34% line:71%
Yeah.

00:06:12.416 --> 00:06:14.208 line:71%
The latest polling,

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:16.083 line:71%
on some of the channels here

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:17.333 line:71%
in Israel indicates

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:19.291 position:56% line:71%
about two thirds of the population

00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:21.583 line:71%
would go for a hostage deal.

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:24.333 position:58% line:71%
as it's been outlined already, which

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:26.541 line:71%
which is a significant number.

00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:27.791 line:71%
But that's not the position

00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:28.875 line:71%
of prime Minister Benjamin

00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:30.125 line:71%
Netanyahu that we know.

00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:32.125 position:58% line:71%
And it's certainly not the position

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.666 line:71%
that the hard right

00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:36.625 position:58% line:71%
members of his coalition government,

00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.166 line:71%
are willing to tolerate.

00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:39.625 position:61% line:71%
They threatened to get out of the talks

00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:42.083 position:56% line:71%
if he went for that kind of deal.

00:06:42.083 --> 00:06:44.041 position:63% line:71%
I think there's been a lot of expectation

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:45.708 line:71%
in the region, particularly,

00:06:45.708 --> 00:06:47.666 position:63% line:71%
you know, in trying to get these talks up

00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:49.041 line:71%
and running tomorrow,

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.750 position:56% line:71%
that there would be a lot of U.S.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.125 line:71%
pressure on Prime Minister

00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:54.416 position:56% line:71%
Netanyahu to change his position,

00:06:54.416 --> 00:06:56.000 line:71%
not to have these add ons

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.625 line:71%
that, Hamas talks about,

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:58.958 position:58% line:71%
although his office says they don't

00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.208 line:71%
they haven't put any add ons

00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:02.500 line:71%
to President Biden's framework.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.208 line:71%
and when we had the announcement

00:07:04.208 --> 00:07:08.375 position:61% line:71%
yesterday, that, that the United States

00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:09.541 size:88% position:44% line:71%
was going to clear

00:07:09.541 --> 00:07:12.541 line:71%
$20 billion worth of military,

00:07:13.458 --> 00:07:17.208 position:58% line:71%
of military equipment to Israel, not

00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:19.541 line:71%
this is part of a long process,

00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:21.375 position:58% line:71%
and it's only part of that process,

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:23.125 line:71%
and it's only provisional,

00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:24.333 size:88% position:44% line:71%
the timing of it,

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:25.875 line:71%
because it's been a long process

00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:27.083 line:71%
that seemed to indicate

00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:28.708 line:71%
that the United States

00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:30.416 line:71%
potentially potentially

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:31.375 size:75% position:38% line:71%
trying to

00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:34.000 position:61% line:71%
trying to give Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.583 position:59% line:71%
something in return for what they may

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:37.833 line:71%
hope comes out of these talks.

00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:39.208 size:88% position:44% line:71%
But I would say no

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:40.500 line:71%
one is holding their breath

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.541 position:63% line:71%
that that would be the outcome from this.

00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:44.375 position:59% line:71%
Yeah, they understand the complexities

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:45.833 size:84% position:42% line:71%
and reality of,

00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:47.083 line:71%
all that is taken into account.

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:47.750 size:81% position:41% line:71%
Nic Robertson,

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.708 line:71%
appreciate your reporting there

00:07:48.708 --> 00:07:49.958 line:71%
from Tel Aviv. Thank you.
