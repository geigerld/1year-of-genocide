00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.633
During a

00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.935
testy meeting with

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.803
hostage families Monday,

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.205
Israeli Prime Minister

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:06.806
Benjamin Netanyahu

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:09.075
appears to have strained his one

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.176
regional relation

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:13.179
ship with Qatar that matters most

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:16.683
to those very families moving.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.351
You don't hear me thinking Qatar,

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.919
because Qatar is essentially

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.221
no different from the U.N.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:22.589
or the Red Cross.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.592
And in some ways, even more problematic.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:26.793
They have leverage

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.862
because they're financing them.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.031
These comments caught off mic,

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.000
triggered a rapid and barb diplomatic

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.270
put down from Qatari officials

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:38.371
who helped negotiate

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.140
the release of almost 100

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.308
Israeli hostages in November,

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:43.977
saying in a tweet,

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:46.613
We are appalled by the alleged remarks

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.915
attributed to the Israeli prime minister.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:51.684
If validated, are irresponsible

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.319
and destructive

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.222
to the efforts to save innocent lives,

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:59.893
but are not surprising.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:01.561
Just days earlier,

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.430
Qatar had been talking up

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.065
relations with Israel

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.099
and the pretense

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:09.035
for Hamas to release more hostages.

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.970
We are engaging in serious discussions

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.671
with both sides.

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.240
We have presented ideas to both sides.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.708
We are getting

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.576
a constant stream

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.578
of replies from both sides.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.279
Qatar's

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.547
frustration now

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:22.982
seems personal, with Netanyahu.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.485
Qatar concluding their criticism

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:26.419
with a view

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:29.889
increasingly suspected by some Israelis.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:33.493
Netanyahu wants to keep the war going,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.295
saying in a tweet,

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:36.796
The Israeli prime minister

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:38.465
would only be obstructing

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:41.067
and undermining the mediation process.

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.602
For reasons that appear to

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:46.005
serve his political career,

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.640
hostage, families who were

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.409
in the meeting with the prime minister

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.478
released a terse statement

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:52.712
appearing to blame

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:54.481
Netanyahu for the leak.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.950
Although he denies it,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.852
the fact that the censorship

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:00.386
was given permission

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:03.089
to publish this audio recording

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:04.591
is serious

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:07.927
and indicates a loss of judgment.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.363
This leaked audio also suggests

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:11.097
he may be trying

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:12.532
to draw the White House

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:15.034
into confrontation.

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:16.603
I was very angry recently

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:18.471
and I didn't hide it from the Americans

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:19.772
that they renewed the contract

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:20.707
on the military base

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:22.509
they have with Qatar.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.044
President Biden has an openly spoken

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.279
to the tensions.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.448
But this week, Secretary of State

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.451
Antony Blinken criticizing Israel

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.553
for taking Gaza and territory

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:35.855
to create a security buffer.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.791
We've been very clear about

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.894
maintaining, in effect, the

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:45.765
the territorial integrity.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:48.067
And to that point,

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:51.371
has Qatar actually decided to possibly

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.673
pull out of the mediation talks?

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.508
There's absolutely no indication

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.310
that they're going to do that. Indeed.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.478
CIA Chief Bill

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.046
Burns is on his way to meetings

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:01.381
with his Israeli counterpart,

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:02.448
Egyptian officials.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:05.451
And, yes, Qatari officials as well.

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:06.920
And that is all about trying

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.022
to get those remaining hostages

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.290
released Jake.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.691
Nic Robertson in Tel Aviv

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:12.759
for us, thank you so much.
