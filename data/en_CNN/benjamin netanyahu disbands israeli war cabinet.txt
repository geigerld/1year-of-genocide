an Israeli official says prime minister Benjamin&nbsp; Netanyahu has disbanded the war cabinet which was&nbsp;&nbsp; responsible for key decisions relating to&nbsp; the Israel Hamas War it was formed in the&nbsp;&nbsp; days after the October 7th Hamas attacks the&nbsp; decision comes after opposition leader Benny&nbsp;&nbsp; gance withdrew from the body last week&nbsp; meanwhile Israel's military announced a&nbsp;&nbsp; daily tactical pause along a specific route and&nbsp; specific times to allow for humanitarian Aid&nbsp;&nbsp; into Gaza the IDF later clarified that it's&nbsp; still its troops are still fighting in Rafa&nbsp;&nbsp; and parts of Gaza CNN's Paula hanock is joining&nbsp; us now from Southern Israel Paula let's start&nbsp;&nbsp; with uh Benjamin netanyahu's decision to&nbsp; disband his War cabinet what's behind that decision well am in the war cabinet there were&nbsp; always three men who are basically making the&nbsp;&nbsp; decisions which was the Prime Minister the defense&nbsp; minister and the opposition leader Benny Gant now&nbsp;&nbsp; of course since Gant has resigned saying uh he's&nbsp; in protest of the fact there's no uh plan to get&nbsp;&nbsp; the hostages out no day after plan uh for Gaza&nbsp; and another plan to to get people back to Northern&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel as well who've been evacuated it is now&nbsp; effectively a twers war cabinet so what he has&nbsp;&nbsp; done is he's disbanded that and he has said&nbsp; according to an official in his office that&nbsp;&nbsp; the decisions when it comes to the war in Gaza&nbsp; will be made on a uh a security cabinet basis&nbsp;&nbsp; which is uh a wider cabinet basis uh also saying&nbsp; that or experts are saying that this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; avoids the uh the pressure that was coming from&nbsp; the far right of his Coalition uh some of those&nbsp;&nbsp; far right elements wanted to be part of the war&nbsp; cabinet uh so by disbanding it potentially he&nbsp;&nbsp; has uh uh got rid of that problem as well he&nbsp; doesn't have to accept or reject them because&nbsp;&nbsp; he does have a balancing act when it comes&nbsp; to his Coalition at this point uh but they&nbsp;&nbsp; do say within the prime minister's office this&nbsp; won't make a difference to actually making the&nbsp;&nbsp; decisions on the uh the war in Gaza and if they&nbsp; have to they will have smaller groups to decide&nbsp;&nbsp; tactical changes amra and regarding that tactical&nbsp; pause uh if there is still fighting going on in&nbsp;&nbsp; Rafa and parts of Gaza as the IDF says is this&nbsp; tactical pause in effect to allow humanitarian Aid in so this is a pause that comes from the&nbsp; Kem Shalom Crossing where we just were&nbsp;&nbsp; and it goes into Gaza and then up the salahadin&nbsp; road which is effectively the the north south Road&nbsp;&nbsp; uh that runs through Gaza now from the idf's point&nbsp; of view they say that they are securing that road&nbsp;&nbsp; so it will be safe for uh in uh International Aid&nbsp; organizations to distribute AIDS which they say is&nbsp;&nbsp; stuck on the Gaza side uh of the Kem Shalom border&nbsp; they say there's more than a thousand trucks that&nbsp;&nbsp; are there currently but we've spoken to some of&nbsp; those Aid groups including the UN groups in Gaza&nbsp;&nbsp; uh and they say that sometimes it is simply too&nbsp; dangerous for them to be able to get to that&nbsp;&nbsp; cross in and pick up the aid it's not just the&nbsp; fighting that they're concerned about it's also&nbsp;&nbsp; the sense of of lawlessness uh in Gaza there is&nbsp; a lot of looting uh they say it's very dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp; for them to be able to try and distribute the&nbsp; aid I did ask the IDF spokesperson if there&nbsp;&nbsp; would be some kind of military uh escort with uh&nbsp; these uh these trucks to try and get the aid in&nbsp;&nbsp; and that was uh not answered so at this point&nbsp; it doesn't appear that that would be the case&nbsp;&nbsp; we've also heard from the Gaza media office&nbsp; saying uh that as far as they're concerned&nbsp;&nbsp; there's been no tactical pause uh so they believe&nbsp; that it is Israeli lies in their uh words now the&nbsp;&nbsp; IDF has been quite clear that the fighting will&nbsp; continue it will continue in Rafa which is very&nbsp;&nbsp; close to where this uh this route is uh for the&nbsp; Tactical pause uh as they will be continuing uh&nbsp;&nbsp; what they have been doing since last month Amar&nbsp; all right Paula hanock watching this for us from&nbsp;&nbsp; Southern Israel thank you Paula meanwhile a&nbsp; US Special Envoy arrives in Israel Monday as&nbsp;&nbsp; tensions escalate on Israel's northern border&nbsp; with Lebanon CNN's Ben Weedman is joining us&nbsp;&nbsp; now live from Beirut uh Ben you and officials&nbsp; are warning that there is a very real danger&nbsp;&nbsp; of miscalculation escalating the conflict along&nbsp; uh the Israel and lebanon's Border what have you learned well what we've been seen is that&nbsp; certainly in the last few weeks uh things&nbsp;&nbsp; on the border have gotten much hotter in terms&nbsp; of the daily back and forth between hisbah and&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel although I must add that it's a currently&nbsp; a Muslim holiday and yesterday on the at least&nbsp;&nbsp; from hisbah side they didn't fire anything at&nbsp; the Israelis as far as we can tell but this&nbsp;&nbsp; Envoy Amos Hawkin who's the senior energy&nbsp; adviser at the White House and he's really&nbsp;&nbsp; the point man in dealing with the sort of the&nbsp; Lebanon on Israel file for the United States&nbsp;&nbsp; he's in Israel now we assume although it has&nbsp; not been officially announced that he's going&nbsp;&nbsp; to be coming uh to Beirut in the coming days&nbsp; nonetheless what is obvious certainly from&nbsp;&nbsp; statements made by senior Israeli officials&nbsp; including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;&nbsp; and the signs we're getting from hisbah is&nbsp; that both sides are primed for escalation every day the message goes out from South&nbsp; Lebanon in slick propaganda videos accompanied&nbsp;&nbsp; by a stirring soundtrack hisbah is ready&nbsp; to go from daily skirmishes to full scale&nbsp;&nbsp; war with Israel Meed in what appears to be&nbsp; an unwinable war in Gaza Israel has vowed&nbsp;&nbsp; to turn its military might on Hezbollah&nbsp; earlier this month Israeli Prime Minister&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin Netanyahu visited the Border saying&nbsp; we are prepared for very strong action in the north but the Iranian back group is by far the&nbsp; most formidable battle hardened foe Israel has&nbsp;&nbsp; faced on its borders since the 1973 October&nbsp; war after its guillas forced Israel to pull&nbsp;&nbsp; out of South Lebanon 24 years ago in 2006&nbsp; Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill&nbsp;&nbsp; although the war left parts of Beirut and much&nbsp; of Southern Lebanon in Ruins retired Lebanese&nbsp;&nbsp; Army Brigadier General elas Hana knows the&nbsp; militant Group Well hasbalah is an exclusive&nbsp;&nbsp; Club well disciplined monitored and they have&nbsp; which is the most important issue a charismatic leader since October Israeli strikes&nbsp; have killed more than 300 hisbah Fighters&nbsp;&nbsp; including last week high ranking&nbsp; Commander Talib Abdullah given a&nbsp;&nbsp; hero's farewell in Beirut at the funeral&nbsp; senior Hezbollah leader Hashim safadin&nbsp;&nbsp; warned we will increase our operations&nbsp; in intensity and force in quantity and quality analysts believe Iran has provided&nbsp; Hezbollah with an arsenal of sophisticated&nbsp;&nbsp; long range missiles capable of reaching Tel Aviv&nbsp; and Beyond until now Hezbollah has mostly limited&nbsp;&nbsp; its strikes to military targets along the rugged&nbsp; mountainous Frontier hitting Israel's extensive&nbsp;&nbsp; network of surveillance posts It also says&nbsp; it is taken out an Iron Dome battery the&nbsp;&nbsp; backbone of Israel's missile defenses and has used&nbsp; ground to- a missiles to shoot down three top of&nbsp;&nbsp; the line Hermes 900 drones in the process forcing&nbsp; tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes&nbsp;&nbsp; in the north healah is learning faster than Israel&nbsp; can adapt says Hanah you know they are learning&nbsp;&nbsp; it's like learning process it's like trial and&nbsp; error so as far as you go in time you are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp; more intensity more combined use of weapon and&nbsp; then more in depths and More in Effectiveness&nbsp;&nbsp; against the Israelis and what is the problem&nbsp; that the Israeli have no Pro have no answer&nbsp;&nbsp; for that since October Israel has bolstered&nbsp; its forces on the border and held exercises&nbsp;&nbsp; to prepare for war Hezbollah is also Ready&nbsp; for War a war that is just one miscalculation away now Mr Hawkin is probably trying to convince&nbsp; Vin the Israelis now is not a good time given the&nbsp;&nbsp; situation in Gaza to jump into a war with&nbsp; Lebanon and of course in Lebanon given H&nbsp;&nbsp; hezbollah's strength and abilities to strike well&nbsp; inside Israel the price for Israel would be very&nbsp;&nbsp; high but prime minister Netanyahu is under&nbsp; intense pressure from the public in Israel&nbsp;&nbsp; to allow those people who fled the north to go&nbsp; back home so they're really in a bind now the&nbsp;&nbsp; one solution and what has been seen before is&nbsp; that in late November of last year when there&nbsp;&nbsp; was an 8 day halt in the fighting in Gaza and&nbsp; there was a release of hostages in exchange for&nbsp;&nbsp; Palestinian prisoners and detainees the Border&nbsp; along between Lebanon and Israel was quiet hisb&nbsp;&nbsp; has made it clear if the fighting stops in&nbsp; Gaza the Border will be quiet so probably a&nbsp;&nbsp; ceasefire is the best solution all around amra&nbsp; Ben Weedman and beay for us thank you so much
