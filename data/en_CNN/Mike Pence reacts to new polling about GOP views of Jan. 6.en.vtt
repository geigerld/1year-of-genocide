00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:01.084
You recently met with

00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:02.502
families of hostages

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:04.004
still being held in Gaza.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.088
More than 100 hostages

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:06.506
are believed to still be alive,

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:07.966
including six Americans.

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.426
A lot of the hostage families

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:11.261
with whom I've spoken

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:12.095
are pretty critical

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:13.179
of the Netanyahu government.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:13.930
They say they don't think

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.182
Netanyahu is doing enough

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.767
to get their loved ones out,

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.394
that he's prioritized.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.312
Military operations

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.857
instead of getting the hostages

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:24.816
back safely.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:28.278
Is that what they told you?

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.904
Well, what I

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:31.489
what I heard from

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.199
not only families of hostages,

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.034
but as we walked

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:37.037
the streets of Kfar Rosa,

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:40.498
a kibbutz that was literally decimated

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.375
by the Hamas terrorists

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.711
invasion on October 7th, was a

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:48.506
was deep grief, but also a determination

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.175
to move their nation forward

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:51.926
and to restore their security.

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:52.844
I mean, you know,

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:57.265
it was remarkable to see the resilience

00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:58.391
of the people

00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.851
and the families that had lost loved

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:01.478
ones, the families of hostages.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:04.481
And one understands their impatience.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.482
And, you know,

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:06.733
I have three kids of my own,

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.109
two grandkids.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.111
I can't even imagine the level of grief

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:10.779
that that

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.655
they're experiencing in the struggle.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:14.491
But I must tell you

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.285
that I have never spent three days

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:19.204
on the road in any capacity

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:20.663
of whether it was on it

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:21.581
as vice president

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.041
or as a member of Congress, where

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.543
I have felt greater heartbreak

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:26.753
and greater inspiration.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.088
And in combination,

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.172
when we went to the south

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:30.965
and we visited the kibbutz

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:32.175
where the Hamas terrorists

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:33.843
literally slaughtered families

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:35.011
in a merciless

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:36.096
and horrific way,

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.847
I and just never thought

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.725
I'd see the aftermath of war like that

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.811
and literally an unspeakable evil.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.437
But to see the resilience

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.439
of the people of Israel,

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.774
to be among the troops

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:51.111
along the northern border with Lebanon

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.071
left me deeply inspired,

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.031
but more convinced than ever that

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.658
the United States of America must,

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.576
in this moment,

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:01.579
stand clearly shoulder to shoulder

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:02.372
with Israel

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.207
until they hunt down and destroy

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:05.917
the threat of Hamas once and for all.

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.377
So you have said that

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:08.545
Israel has the right to respond

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.004
to those horrific attacks

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:10.964
of October 7th

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:11.965
and the responsibility

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.383
to destroy Hamas as you just did.

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:14.592
But it does seem

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:16.010
that the IDF strikes have killed

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.679
more Palestinian civilians

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.180
and they have members of Hamas.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.057
And there are Israelis

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:21.975
who are worried

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.309
about the high civilian death

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.312
toll in Gaza, including for the reason

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.189
that this high civilian death

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.691
toll might actually ultimately

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.151
make Israel less safe

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:34.028
by inspiring more future terrorists.

00:02:34.028 --> 00:02:37.782
Do you share any of those concerns?

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.409
Well, first, Jake, look, I

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.118
grieve the loss

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:43.121
of any innocent civilian lives.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.622
But one of the things I learned

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:45.290
as we visited

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.040
several

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.708
of where

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:47.500
the terrorist

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.252
literally took over the police station

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:52.755
and murdered people in the streets

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:53.923
is is that

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:57.760
this was not simply a terrorist attack,

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:58.386
but I believe

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.096
it was a terrorist invasion.

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:00.763
I mean, what I

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:01.431
what I learned

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:02.765
in our briefings in the South

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:06.394
was that that fence line separating

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.687
Israel from Gaza

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.354
was breached

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.191
in more than 90 different places

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:14.277
simultaneously, paving the way

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.906
for some 3000 terrorists heavily armed,

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.324
to move into Israel.

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.868
And in fact, the briefings I received

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.746
pointed out that actually the terrorists

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:28.333
had sufficient armaments and supplies

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.292
to literally march

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:30.543
all the way here to Tel Aviv,

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.836
all the way to Jerusalem.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:36.174
But for the heroic efforts of police idea

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.885
forces and, frankly, courageous citizens,

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.261
they were stopped from doing that.

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.180
So I really believe that

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.890
what Israel is doing in Gaza

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.767
today is absolutely essential.

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.645
It is a response to an invasion

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.647
that was launched with the intention

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.233
of beginning the process of destroying

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.567
the Jewish state of Israel.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.653
And I really do believe

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.238
that that this is a moment

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:58.780
where

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.281
where America needs

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.116
to speak with one voice,

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:04.160
that we will stand with Israel today

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.620
and tomorrow and every day

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.205
until they have won outright

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:07.747
this fight

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.124
and eliminated the threat of Hamas.

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:11.584
We learned late Friday night

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.211
that the secretary of defense, Lloyd

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.379
Austin, spent

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.421
multiple days

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.590
this past week in the hospital,

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.758
including time in the intensive

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.261
care unit for a medical issue

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.553
that is still undisclosed.

00:04:22.553 --> 00:04:23.012
He did this

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:25.515
without the public, without Congress,

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.433
without the national Security Council

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.018
or even President Biden

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:30.895
being informed for several days.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.772
The defense secretary temporarily assumed

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.399
some of the deputy defense secretary

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.149
temporarily assumed

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:36.192
some of the responsibilities

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.778
while she was on vacation in Puerto Rico.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.238
As a former vice president,

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.406
you have

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.115
unique insight

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.574
as to what this actually means

00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:45.076
for a secretary of defense

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.119
to be unavailable

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.830
and to not be transparent with his boss

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.126
about his health. What does it mean?

00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:55.211
Well, first, I wish

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:55.586
I wish

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:57.046
the secretary of defense well,

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:58.006
and I'm pleased

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.424
he's making a full recovery.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:00.842
But

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:03.303
this the handling of this

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.387
by the secretary of defense

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.848
is totally unacceptable.

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.599
And I believe the American people

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.227
have a right to know

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.146
about his medical condition,

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.440
about the reasons for it.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.359
And he has he has a right to know

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:21.654
who was informed of his incapacity.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:22.947
And I mean,

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:25.366
but but to think that at a time

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:28.328
when we have allies at war in Eastern

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.872
Europe and here in Israel,

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.415
that the leader of a

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.208
of America's military

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:34.959
at the Pentagon

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.377
would be out of commission

00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:37.920
for a number of days.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.339
And the president of the United States

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.131
didn't know about it.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.050
I, I think I think it was

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.635
a dereliction of duty. And

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:45.636
and and

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:47.430
the secretary and the administration,

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.390
frankly, need to step forward

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.267
and give the American people the facts.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.602
Yet we still don't even know what he was

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.145
hospitalized for.

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:55.063
Yesterday marked

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.564
the third anniversary

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.941
of the January six attack on the Capitol.

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:00.318
A Washington Post poll this week

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.528
found that a third of Republicans

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.405
believe the falsehood that it's probably

00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:05.073
or definitely true

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.783
that the FBI instigated the attack

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.534
on the Capitol on January six.

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.494
President Trump

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:10.536
was spreading that lie

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:11.829
just this weekend, falsely

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:12.997
claiming the FBI was, quote,

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:14.624
leading the charge on January six.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:15.792
That's not true.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:16.876
Obviously, your life,

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:17.919
the lives of your family

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.253
members were threatened that day.

00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:20.755
What do you say to those,

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.215
including your former running

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:22.840
running mate

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.133
who are actively spreading

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:25.051
this baseless lie

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.344
or maybe even more importantly,

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.972
to those who believe it?

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.517
Well, I would say

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:35.520
to every American, as I did during my

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:37.271
my presidential campaign,

00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:39.774
that I know I did my duty, that day

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:40.650
to support and defend

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.610
the Constitution of the United States.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.529
I kept my oath.

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:47.782
And and they also simply need to look

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:48.491
to the facts

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:52.370
that that the Capitol Hill police said

00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:54.914
endured great hardship and great harm.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:58.501
I think over 120 officers were injured.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:06:59.585
I saw many of them

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:00.628
moving

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:03.423
through the garage where I was spirited

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.590
on the same day.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.594
And, you know, the the truth is that

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.221
that this was a riot

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:12.849
that should never have happened.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.726
That that as I've said many times

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:17.353
before, the former president's words

00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:19.313
that day were reckless.

00:07:19.313 --> 00:07:21.941
I believe all his history will judge

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.443
his role in that.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.694
But at the end of the day,

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:27.238
where I live every day and

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:27.989
and frankly,

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.115
the words of encouragement

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.241
that I receive on a regular

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:32.660
basis is I know by God's grace

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.079
we did our duty that day three years ago.

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:37.331
But I will tell you, Jake, that

00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:40.042
I actually I understand why

00:07:40.042 --> 00:07:40.793
President Biden

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:42.420
wants to focus his campaign

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.713
on on three years ago,

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.631
the record of this administration

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:48.968
has weakened America at home and abroad.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.386
And, you know,

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:51.846
I actually don't think

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:54.098
the election's going to be decided

00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:56.142
on a tragic day three years ago.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.310
I think it's going to be decided

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.853
on the failed policies

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:00.980
of the Biden administration

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.023
that embolden

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:03.816
the enemies of freedom around the world,

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.276
that launched the worst inflation,

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.486
that created the worst

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.405
crisis on our border in American history.

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:10.281
And it's one of the reasons

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.325
why I continue to hope

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.243
that with the Iowa caucuses

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:14.744
and New Hampshire

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:15.745
just around the corner,

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.039
that all the good Republican

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.665
voters in those states

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:22.043
will give our party a fresh start

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.670
and give us new leadership

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:25.838
to lead our party forward

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.423
in the election and beyond.

00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:28.424
Is there somebody

00:08:28.424 --> 00:08:30.176
other than Donald Trump that you want

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.345
the voters of Iowa to get behind?

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.471
Is there somebody you prefer,

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.139
whether it's Governor DeSantis

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:37.099
or Ambassador Haley?

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:39.644
You are somebody whose

00:08:39.727 --> 00:08:41.020
endorsement could

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.522
actually make a difference

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.898
with any wavering Republicans

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.107
who want a fresh start.

00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:48.110
As you note?

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.737
Well, I've been speaking

00:08:49.737 --> 00:08:51.405
to several of my old competitors,

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:53.282
I think very highly

00:08:53.282 --> 00:08:55.952
of Nikki Haley, of Ron DeSantis.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.036
And frankly, Chris Christie

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:58.913
been a friend for many years.

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:00.873
And I don't put a lot of stock

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:01.666
in endorsements.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:02.208
I'm not sure

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.210
whether I'm going to weigh in or if

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.461
and when I will.

00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:07.088
But, you know, I ran for president

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:08.297
because I think different times

00:09:08.297 --> 00:09:09.757
call for different leadership, Jake.

00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:11.425
And and I'm hoping

00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:13.302
that the good people of Iowa

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:14.262
that I got to know so

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:15.680
well in my campaign,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.348
the good people of New Hampshire

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:20.768
and South Carolina will will look at this

00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:21.894
moment and recognize

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:24.021
that elections are about the future.

00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:25.606
And we need new leadership

00:09:25.606 --> 00:09:26.899
in the Republican Party.

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.526
We certainly need new leadership

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:30.444
in the White House to move us forward.

00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:31.696
And if I see an opportunity

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.532
to have an impact on achieving that,

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:35.449
I'll certainly do it.

00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:36.701
And I'll keep you posted.

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.077
It's not just President Biden

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:39.704
who's focusing on January six.

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.414
Of course, you have Donald Trump

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.582
still talking about it.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:43.291
Do you want to just like

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.292
take this opportunity

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:45.751
to clear up this lie

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:46.961
that the FBI was leading

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:48.129
the charge on January six?

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.755
It's obviously not true.

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:51.340
I'm sure you know it's not true.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.216
Do you want to make make

00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:55.261
that clear to the voters?

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:56.887
You know, I've seen the

00:09:56.887 --> 00:09:58.222
director of the FBI

00:09:58.222 --> 00:09:59.390
repeatedly assure

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.516
the American people

00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:03.769
that the FBI were not the instigators

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:04.520
of the riot,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.731
that occurred on January six.

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:09.233
And frankly, I'm very grateful

00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:11.235
for the efforts of the FBI

00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:11.861
to bring

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:13.738
nearly a thousand people to justice

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.448
who ransacked our Capitol

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:18.451
and did violence against police officers

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:19.243
that day.

00:10:19.243 --> 00:10:20.703
But you're right,

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:23.289
We've been assured again and again

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.082
that it was not the case.

00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:26.834
And I just must tell you,

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:28.085
having been there that day,

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:30.254
I mean, to see people literally

00:10:30.254 --> 00:10:33.966
breaking windows, ransacking the Capitol,

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.344
it just infuriated me.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.137
I remember thinking,

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:38.804
you know, not

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:40.389
this not here,

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:43.392
not at the United States Capitol.

00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:44.310
And I believe everyone

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.936
that conducted that

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:47.313
that riot at the Capitol

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.522
needs to be held to the fullest

00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:49.357
extent of the law

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.525
and pleased that many have.

00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:53.736
But I have never been given

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:54.612
any information

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:55.571
of I've heard

00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:56.947
the many repeated assurances

00:10:56.947 --> 00:10:58.866
from the FBI that they were not involved,

00:10:58.866 --> 00:10:59.867
and I take them at their word.
