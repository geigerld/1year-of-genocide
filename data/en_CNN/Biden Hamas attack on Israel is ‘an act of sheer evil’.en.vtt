00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.201
We're watching President Biden

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:01.801
as he approaches

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:02.836
the podium at the White House.

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:05.472
Good afternoon. Listen to his remarks.

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:08.608
You know, there are moments in this life

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.243
I I mean this

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.444
literally when the pure,

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:14.547
unadulterated evil is unleashed

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:16.816
on this world.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.919
The people of Israel

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:20.720
live through one

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.289
such moment this weekend.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.558
Bloody hands of the terrorist

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.861
organization, Hamas

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.030
group, whose stated purpose for being

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.066
is to kill Jews

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:37.270
This was an act of sheer evil.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.973
More than 1000 civilians slaughtered,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.076
not just kill, slaughtered in Israel.

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.112
Among them, at least 14

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.114
American citizens killed,

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.550
parents butchered,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.551
using their bodies

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.421
to try to protect their children.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:55.255
Stomach churning

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.490
reports of babies being killed.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.960
Entire families slain.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.162
Young people massacred

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.763
while attending a musical festival.

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:06.533
To celebrate peace. To celebrate peace.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:08.701
Women raped,

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.704
assaulted, paraded as trophies.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.106
Families

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.508
hid their fear for hours and hours,

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.476
desperately trying

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.912
to keep their children quiet.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.848
To avoid drawing attention

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:24.684
And thousands of wounded.

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:25.218
Alive.

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.152
But carrying with them

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:28.021
the bullet holes and the shrapnel wounds.

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.290
And the memory of what they endured.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:35.228
You all know these traumas never go away.

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:36.563
There's still so many families

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:37.397
desperately waiting

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.899
to hear the fate of their loved ones.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.534
Not knowing if they're alive.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.270
Or dead. Or hostages.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.705
Infants in their mother's arms.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:47.140
Grandparents in wheelchairs.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.442
Holocaust survivors abducted

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.377
and held hostage.

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:52.579
Hostages whom

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.315
Hamas has now threatened execute

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:56.149
in violation

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.418
of every code of human morality.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:00.854
It's abhorrent.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:04.290
The brutality of Hamas

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.427
is blood thirsty and is brings to mind

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:10.797
the worst the worst rampages of vices.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.833
This is terrorism.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.936
But sadly for the Jewish people,

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.805
it's not new.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:20.940
This attack is brought to the surface.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.942
Painful memories.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:23.943
The scars left

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:26.312
by a millennium, antisemitism

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.947
and genocide.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.816
The Jewish people

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.453
So in this moment,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.889
we must be crystal clear.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.391
We stand with Israel.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.462
We stand with Israel.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.963
And we will make sure,

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:44.931
as has what it needs

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.666
to take care of its citizens,

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.536
defend itself and respond to this attack.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.872
There's no justification for terrorism.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.109
There's no excuse

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:58.711
Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian

00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.445
people's right

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.781
to dignity and self-determination.

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:04.484
Stated purpose is annihilation

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:05.318
of the state of Israel.

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:07.954
On the murder of Jewish people

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.657
They use Palestinian civilians

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:12.926
as human shields.

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:13.593
Mass offers

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:14.460
nothing but terror

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.430
and bloodshed with no regard

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.598
to who pays the price

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.937
The loss of

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:26.940
innocent life is heartbreaking.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.642
Like every nation in the world.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.711
Israel has the right to respond and deed

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.546
has a duty to respond

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.182
to these vicious attacks.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.185
I just got off the phone with the third

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.721
called Prime Minister Netanyahu.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.756
I told him

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:44.757
the United States

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.192
experience is an experience

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:48.161
in our response to be swift,

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.797
decisive and overwhelming.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.832
We also discussed how democracies

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:53.399
like Israel

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.268
and United States are stronger

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:56.135
and more secure

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:59.672
when we act according to the rule of law.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.809
Terrorist

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:06.980
purposely target civilians kill them.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:11.551
We uphold the laws of war, law of war.

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:12.619
It matters.

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.220
There's a difference

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:17.790
Today, Americans across the country

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.558
are praying

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:19.626
for all those families

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:21.794
who have been ripped apart.

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:23.963
A lot of us know how it feels.

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:25.665
It leaves a black hole in your chest

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:26.633
when you lose family

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:31.437
feeling like you're being sucked in.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:34.841
The anger the pain

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:37.377
the sense of hopelessness

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.347
This is what they mean

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:44.250
by a human tragedy,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.085
an atrocity

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.322
on an appalling scale.

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.791
We're going to continue to stand united,

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:53.860
supporting the people of Israel

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.329
who are suffering unspeakable losses

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:58.865
and opposing the hatred

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:02.235
and violence of terrorism.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.404
My team has been

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:05.972
in near-constant communication

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.807
with our Israeli partners

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.309
and partners all across the region

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.677
and the world.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.413
From the moment this crisis began.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:14.080
We're charging

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.448
additional military assistance,

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:16.783
including ammunition

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:19.285
and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome.

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:21.587
We're going to make sure

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:22.055
that Israel

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.590
does not run out of these critical assets

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:28.561
to defend its cities and its citizens.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:30.330
My administration

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.930
has consult

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.931
closely with Congress

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:33.966
throughout this crisis.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.502
When Congress returns,

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:37.136
we're going to ask them

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.538
to take urgent action

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:40.173
to fund the

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:40.907
national security

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:43.743
requirements of our critical partners.

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:46.479
This is not about party or politics.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.849
This is about the security of our world,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.952
security of the United States of America.

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:56.389
We now know

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.890
that American citizens are among

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.827
those being held by Hamas

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.528
I've directed my team

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.230
to share intelligence and deploy

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.598
additional expertize from across

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:07.400
the United States government

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.234
to consult with

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.336
and advise Israeli counterparts

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:13.339
in hostage recovery recovery efforts.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.175
Because as president,

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:17.443
I have no higher priority

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:18.611
than the safety of Americans

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:21.748
being held hostage around the world.

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.449
The United States has also enhanced

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.518
our military force posture in the region

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:27.920
to strengthen our deterrence.

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:31.457
The Department of Defense has moved

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:34.093
the USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group,

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:35.995
the Eastern Mediterranean,

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:37.196
and bolstered our fighter

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:39.031
aircraft presence.

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:40.666
And we stand ready to move in

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:42.034
additional assets as needed

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.172
Let me say again

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:48.608
to any country, any organization,

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:49.409
anyone

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.643
thinking of taking advantage of

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:52.178
the situation,

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.781
I have one word don't

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:57.083
don't

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:00.052
Hearts

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:02.288
may be broken, but our resolve is clear.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:05.491
Yesterday, I also spoke with the leaders

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:07.860
of France, Germany, Italy and U.K.

00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:10.163
to discuss the latest developments

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:11.431
with our European allies

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:15.034
and coordinate our united response

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:17.503
This comes on top of days

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:18.404
of steady

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:19.472
engagement with partners

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:21.240
across the region.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.877
We're also taking steps at home

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:25.411
in cities

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:27.547
across the United States of America.

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:29.048
Police departments have stepped up

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:31.350
security around centers of Jewish life

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:33.386
The Department of Homeland Security,

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:35.321
the Federal Bureau of Investigation

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:36.722
are working closely

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:37.156
with state

00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:38.191
and local law enforcement

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:38.524
and Jewish

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:39.492
community partners

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:41.160
to identify and disrupt

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.361
any domestic threat

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:44.330
that could emerge in connection

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.631
with these horrific attacks.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.067
This is

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:48.734
a moment for the

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:51.437
United States to come together

00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:55.208
to grieve with those who are mourning

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:57.643
Let's be real clear.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.379
There is no place for hate in America,

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:04.617
not against Jews, not against Muslims.

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:06.486
Not against anybody.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.620
We reject.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.321
We reject.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:11.457
What we reject is terrorism.

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:13.960
We condemn the indiscriminate

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.262
evil just we have always done.

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:19.732
That's what America stands for.

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:21.634
You know, just over 50 years ago,

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:22.802
I was thinking about this morning

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:23.803
talk from

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:24.604
the secretary of state,

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:27.340
the vice president in my office

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.642
over 50 years ago.

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:31.644
As a young senator,

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:34.380
I visited Israel for the first time

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.083
as a newly elected senator,

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.019
and I had a long, long trip

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.689
meeting with Goldman in her office

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:48.561
just before the Yom Kippur War.

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:51.464
I guess you could see

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:53.666
the consternation on my

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:54.867
face as she described

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.736
what was being faced.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:58.771
She knew they were facing

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.907
walked outside

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:01.941
in that

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.444
sort of hallway outside her office

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:06.579
to have some photo.

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:08.648
She looked at me all of a sudden, said,

00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:11.250
Would you like to have a photograph?

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:14.687
And so I got up and followed her out

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.022
here, standing there silent,

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:16.956
looking at the press.

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:19.759
You could tell, I guess I was concerned.

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.028
She leaned over and whispered to me.

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.330
She said, Don't worry, Senator Biden,

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:29.335
we have a secret weapon here in Israel.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.804
My word is what she said.

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:35.508
We have no place else to go.

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:38.878
We have no place else to go.

00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:41.581
For 75 years

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.783
is also the only guarantor

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.918
security of Jewish people

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:46.953
around the world.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.521
So the

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:49.121
atrocities of

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:51.791
the past could never happen again.

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:54.160
Let there be no doubt

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.462
the United States has Israel's back.

00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:58.831
We will make sure the Jewish

00:09:58.831 --> 00:09:59.999
democratic state of Israel

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:01.200
can defend itself

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.870
today, tomorrow, as we always have to.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.739
Simple as that.

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:09.241
These atrocities

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:11.010
sickening

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:13.579
We're with Israel

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:14.880
Just make no mistake.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.781
Thank you.

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:18.150
Mr.
President, what was your reaction

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.851
on the ground?
