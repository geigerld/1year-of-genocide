00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:02.035
And for a closer look at what we do know

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.870
and what we don't about this blast,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.704
I want to bring in CNN

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:05.905
military analyst, retired

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.575
Lieutenant General Mark Hertling here.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.743
General, look,

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:10.710
we have some video

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.645
here, and I want you to

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:13.646
just take a look at this.

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:16.983
This is some footage that seems to show

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.420
a rocket going up here

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.988
and then something happens.

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.356
That's pretty catastrophic

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.692
when you see this.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:26.393
What do you see?

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.828
I see a flame out of a rocket

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:29.963
and we've been talking about this

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.097
all day.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:31.364
You know,

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:32.532
and it's a result of

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.501
what happened yesterday.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:35.602
But when you see that rocket

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:36.302
going forward,

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.470
this happens a lot

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.406
with these kind of rocket

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:42.175
that are supplied by Iran.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.311
It is a rocket motor that doesn't work.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.846
It gets a certain distance

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.148
and then it just flamed out

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:51.151
and a rocket has a trajectory of a brick.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.153
Once it doesn't have a force behind it,

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:54.788
so it immediately drops.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.524
So you see it, right?

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.359
This is a slow motion there.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.094
Video flame out. Yeah.

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:02.595
So it loses its rocket motor

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.397
and then it just drops down.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.532
But what you also have

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.767
when that happens is the fuel.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:09.536
That's part of the rocket

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:10.870
that hasn't burned.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.505
So when it hits the ground,

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.007
we'll see next year

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.475
the explosion of an explosion

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:17.444
from a viewpoint from the ground.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.345
Now, this isn't a very big piece

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:19.979
of ordnance.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.948
It's a relatively small ordnance.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:22.982
So the the

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:26.252
the actual explosive isn't that big.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.520
But what is big

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.156
is the fuel that it hasn't used.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.758
That caused a lot of cars

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.293
in that parking lot to burn.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.428
We see the after effects of that.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.530
We see a very small crater.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.765
If it heads in a crater,

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:39.499
actually take a look

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:40.733
at what you're discussing here.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.102
I'm going to just break this down

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.436
a little bit more for folks.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.371
This what I'm showing you here,

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.006
this has to be clear,

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.274
provided by the IDF.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.008
This shows

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:49.476
what looks like

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.711
satellite imagery of the area

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.581
where this rocket

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:55.849
may have come down.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.817
Right. This is the explosion site.

00:01:57.817 --> 00:01:58.685
They're saying that

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.720
if you look over here,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.388
this is what typically you would see

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.756
if there was an IDF strike,

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.024
even as large

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:08.495
as 19 meters, a much larger crater.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.564
It doesn't seem like we see that here.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:12.999
And we also have some before

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.200
and after images here.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.602
This is the hospital,

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:17.137
the Al-Ahly Hospital.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.973
This is the explosion site

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.041
in this area here.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.977
And here it is after.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.044
So you were just discussing

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.012
the size of the crater.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:26.779
We don't

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.715
some of the images are not super clear.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.750
No. Whether there was a crater or not.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.918
But when you look at this,

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.353
this is up close of the cars

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:34.220
and the side of the fire.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.821
What do you see?

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:34.921
Well,

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:35.989
what I saw earlier

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.791
today was a photo of a very small crater

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:41.761
about right here, about right there.

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:42.962
What you see in this

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.665
area are a lot of burned cars.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.567
What you see over here are cars

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:48.902
that are not burned.

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.803
What you see across at this building,

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:51.704
if you had a picture of the

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:54.941
building, which I think we do

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:55.975
know, I'm sorry,

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:56.609
we don't have an up

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.377
close of the building,

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:58.011
but we do have

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.045
what we do see

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:01.281
is pockmarks on the side of the building.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:02.315
Look at this video here.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.816
And it's well, and it will show up here.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:04.951
You see the burning car.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.153
But is the camera scans over here,

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:09.322
you'll see cars that aren't burned.

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.690
Yeah, very close.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.326
So it had an effect of the explosive

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.661
capability of a rocket,

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.229
which is relatively small,

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.631
but a lot of fuel blowing up after it.

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.733
That didn't burn off the rocket motor.

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:23.736
So this is evidence of

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.838
certainly not a bomb

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:28.007
that would come off of an aircraft.

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:29.275
You see the pockmarks,

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.810
the blown out windows,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.078
but not a whole lot else.

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:32.745
I mean, there's not

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.714
a whole lot of damages to the building.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.349
Now, the doctors inside of the building

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.517
said that there were patients

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:38.518
that were injured

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:40.053
that could have been from the blast

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.822
glass flying inside of the building.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:43.890
But it certainly wasn't

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.159
a strike on the hospital itself.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.694
And just briefly,

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.363
if you were to have seen a strike,

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:52.532
a true strike coming from Israel,

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:53.266
I want to also,

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.300
just as I'm saying,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.603
this show you, this is

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:57.403
an image that

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.372
shows, according to the IDF,

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:01.507
the trajectory of this rocket.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.209
And it comes from somewhere

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.980
inside of northern Gaza and it goes

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.282
this direction across east.

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:10.817
What you have here is something

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.219
called a point of origin.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.221
That's where the rocket was fired from.

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:16.856
Right. Where that red dot is.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:18.725
You see multiple tracers

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:19.559
coming off of those.

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:20.827
Those are the different rockets

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:22.929
that come out of that rocket pod.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.531
The one that came out right here

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.834
came out over the hospital. And I.

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.670
I believe that that was the one that lost

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.271
its engine

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.239
and fell on close to the hospital,

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:34.540
not on the hospital.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.975
So this is part of the proof

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:37.810
that the Israeli Defense Forces gave.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.678
They said, hey, here,

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:41.281
this is something called a QS 36 radar.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.682
They use these radars

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:44.317
to connect with the Iron Dome

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:45.918
to shoot down rockets.

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:46.552
So when you see

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:49.555
all these coming off of a missile site

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:50.657
and one dropping

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:52.425
over the top of a hospital,

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:53.860
you can see where it was

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.327
truthfully,

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:54.994
an accident,

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:58.331
a missile that that didn't go through

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.199
to to its final mission. Yeah.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.301
And as you pointed out

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:01.934
many times,

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:04.871
these are Iranian provided missiles.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.306
They they tend to do that.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.407
General Mark Hertling,

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:08.207
thank you very much

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.642
for breaking all of that down for us.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.010
And President Biden

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.246
reflecting on the difficult decisions

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:14.547
ahead for Israel's leaders.

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:17.817
Here is part of what he said.

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.385
I made wartime decisions.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:20.320
I know the choices

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.821
are never clear or easy

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:24.157
for the leadership.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.159
There's always cost.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.460
That requires being delivered.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.497
It requires asking very hard questions.

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:34.500
It requires clarity about the objectives

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.602
and an honest assessment

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:37.904
about whether the path you're on

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:39.906
will achieve those objectives.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:40.873
Now,

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:41.507
the vast

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:45.078
majority of Palestinians are not Hamas.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.080
Hamas does not represent

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.083
the Palestinian people.

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:51.050
I want to bring in now

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.619
Aviv Ezra, a senior Israeli diplomat

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:54.287
at the New York

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.755
consulate and a former consul

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:57.557
general in Chicago.

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:59.392
Aviv, thank you for being here.

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:01.361
This incident has had

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.528
real ripple effects.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:05.031
And putting aside for a moment

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.666
any dispute about who's responsible

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:07.233
and who's not.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:08.668
We just broke that down.

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:09.869
Has it altered

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.037
Israel's plans

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.106
for a ground invasion of Gaza?

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.340
Well, the way we see it,

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.642
this is actually a triple war crime.

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:17.076
On the one

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.711
hand, they're sending missiles

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.047
from population areas into Gaza.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.615
They're shooting at population,

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:24.183
innocent civilians in Israel.

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:24.951
And thirdly,

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:26.619
when they misfire,

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:27.820
they hit their own population

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.888
in the Gaza Strip.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.022
So for us,

00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:31.891
this is not only a triple war crime.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.893
It is something that later on that

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.561
took a life of its own

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.730
into the conversation of who is in charge

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.598
and the fake news

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:39.298
that came out of it

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:40.366
with the attack on the station

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.934
last 24 hours ago

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:43.002
created a situation

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:44.904
where Israel was guilty

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.172
before we finish it.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.573
But I'm sure you can imagine

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:49.475
that that is likely to happen here.

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:52.612
Does the fallout from this,

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.113
even if it's as a

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:55.681
result of misinformation,

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:57.450
change the calculus for Israel

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.720
as it tries to decide what happens

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.255
if there is a ground invasion

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:02.889
and whether that is

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:03.823
something that can be done

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:05.158
or should be done right now?

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:05.892
Well, for Israel,

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:06.526
it's pretty clear

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:07.593
that we have to make sure

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.095
that what happened in October

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.263
seven would not happen again.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.932
Therefore, we want to make sure that we

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.067
extract the pricetag from the period

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:15.902
from Hamas's

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:16.302
the price

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:18.337
tag from the Israeli people

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.373
to the Palestinian people,

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:21.541
because they mourn really

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:23.109
the brunt of the burden. Correct.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.277
So we want to differentiate

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.812
between the Palestinian people and Hamas.

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:26.846
And like the president said,

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:28.114
Hamas does not represent

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:28.881
the Palestinian people.

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:29.682
Hamas is a terror

00:07:29.682 --> 00:07:30.750
organization, a vicious,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.084
barbaric terrorist concession

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:33.419
that needs to pay a price.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:33.820
And by the way,

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.888
when we talk about free Gaza,

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:36.722
I think they talk about

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:38.024
free Gaza from Hamas.

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:38.524
So we

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:40.359
we are doing everything we can

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:40.827
to make sure

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:42.161
to make that differentiation.

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:43.463
We open corridors, safe

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.198
corridors, to have the

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:47.266
innocent population go down south.

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:49.268
We invested for days.

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:50.203
We are waiting to make sure

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:52.004
that they make it, that we create safe

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:53.105
shelters over there.

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:54.006
We actually have,

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:55.308
on the other hand, Hamas

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.243
pushing them back into the war zone

00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:58.811
by that, creating another world.

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:00.646
Do you understand

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.148
why there is so much distrust

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:02.682
in the Arab

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.150
world of

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.051
the information

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.118
coming from the IDF

00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:07.186
and the narrative about

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:10.189
what happened in this hospital blast?

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:13.259
And how is Israel going to deal

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.694
with the fact that some of that distrust

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.362
comes from a real place?

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:17.797
Because there have been past incidents

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:19.098
in which the IDF has given

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:20.466
incorrect information?

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:22.835
Well, the IDF, I think, is

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.103
most of the time

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:24.837
that we are focused

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:26.706
on investigating and understanding

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:27.874
what happened. It takes time.

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.175
This is what happened this time around.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.743
This is what happened in the past.

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:32.745
When we get it wrong, we try to fix it.

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:33.946
And sometimes we also

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:35.181
try to fix things that

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.883
that we have got wrong in the past.

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:38.684
I think credibility is crucial here.

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.219
We are

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:41.687
comparing between a

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:42.722
liberal democracy

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.357
with checks and balances

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.591
and a terror organization.

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:46.759
And I think at this time

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:47.627
it's black and white.

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:48.661
We have to, first of all, stand

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:50.897
by Israel, like the president said.

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:51.931
All right.

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:54.433
Ezra, thank you very much for joining us.

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:55.835
We appreciate it. Thank you so much.
