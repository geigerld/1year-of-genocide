.

00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:03.703 line:0%
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:04.871 line:0%
SO LET ME START WITH YOU, 

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:06.639 line:0%
MATTHEW, AND YOUR REPORTING.

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:08.274 line:0%
U.S. OFFICIALS ARE SAYING IN 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.509 line:0%
TERMS OF WHAT STARTED THIS 

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.910 line:0%
ATTACK AND POSSIBLY WHAT COULD 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:11.344 line:0%
DETERMINE HOW MUCH BIGGER THIS 

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:14.748 line:0%
CONFLICT GETS.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:16.950 line:0%
U.S. OFFICIALS ARE SAYING THAT 

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.184 line:0%
THERE IS NO PROOF OR SUGGESTION 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.387 line:0%
OF DIRECT IRANIAN INVOLVEMENT.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:21.388 line:0%
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING?

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:23.156 line:0%
&gt;&gt; WELL, I MEAN, IN GENERAL 

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:24.057 line:0%
TERMS, ISRAELI OFFICIALS I'VE 

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.792 line:0%
SPOKEN TO AGREE WITH THAT 

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:28.561 line:0%
ASSESSMENT IN THE SENSE THAT 

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:30.130 line:0%
THEY'RE SAYING, LOOK, THE 

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.865 line:0%
BACKDROP OF THIS IS THAT IRAN 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.800 line:0%
PROVIDES MATERIAL SUPPORT, 

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.234 line:0%
TRAINING, POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.402 line:0%
HAMAS.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:37.670 line:0%
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:39.172 line:0%
THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE 

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.273 line:0%
JUST SAID THEN AND WHAT ISRAELI 

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:42.075 line:0%
INTELLIGENCE IS SUGGESTING.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.876 line:0%
THEY ARE SAYING TO ME, THE 

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.445 line:0%
SENIOR ISRAELI OFFICIAL TELLING 

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:47.147 line:0%
ME EARLIER THAT IRAN GREEN 

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.348 line:0%
LIGHTED THE IDEA OF THIS 

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.716 line:0%
OPERATION, DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.017 line:0%
TIMING PERHAPS, DIDN'T QUITE 

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:53.153 line:0%
UNDERSTAND PERHAPS AS MANY OF US

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:54.387 line:0%
DIDN'T, THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:58.258 line:0%
THIS OPERATION WOULD BE BUT KNEW

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:58.925 line:0%
THIS OPERATION WAS BEING 

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.226 line:0%
PLANNED.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.227 line:0%
AND THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT TO 

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.628 line:0%
HAVING NO INVOLVEMENT 

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.662 line:0%
WHATSOEVER.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.897 line:0%
IT'S NOT THAT IRAN WAS PULLING 

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.664 line:0%
THE STRINGS, BUT IT'S SOMEWHERE 

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:07.000 line:0%
IN THE MIDDLE.

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:09.736 line:0%
&gt;&gt; SO, A SENIOR HAMAS OFFICIAL 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.603 line:0%
IS NOW CLAIMING THAT THEY SPENT 

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:12.038 line:0%
TWO YEARS -- THAT'S AMAZING TO 

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:14.541 line:0%
THINK ABOUT THAT AS MATTHEW AND 

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:16.109 line:0%
I ARE STANDING HERE -- TWO YEARS

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.710 line:0%
PREPARING FOR THIS UNPRECEDENTED

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.845 line:0%
ISRAEL AND THAT IT DID FINANCIAL

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.145 line:0%
AS WELL AS WEAPONS SUPPORT FROM 

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.780 line:0%
IRAN.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:23.049 line:0%
ALSO SAYING THAT RUSSIA REACHED 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.751 line:0%
OUT AFTER THE ATTACK.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.786 line:0%
GENERAL HODGES, WHEN YOU PUT ALL

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:27.187 line:0%
THIS TOGETHER, HOW SIGNIFICANT 

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:28.021 line:0%
IS THIS?

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:29.756 line:0%
THE INVOLVEMENT THEY ARE SAYING 

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.090 line:0%
THEY HAD FROM BOTH RUSSIA AND 

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.258 line:0%
IRAN.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.326 line:0%
BUT ALSO THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:37.730 line:0%
THEY ARE SAYING THEY PLANNED 

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:38.064 line:0%
THIS THAT ISRAEL DID NOT SEE IT 

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.867 line:0%
COMING.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:43.136 line:0%
&gt;&gt; SO, ERIN, I THINK THIS IS 

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.436 line:0%
RUSSIA OPENING UP A SECOND 

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.572 line:0%
FRONT.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:47.740 line:0%
I MEAN, WHAT'S GOING ON NOW IS 

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:49.709 line:0%
DISTRACTING SO MUCH ATTENTION 

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:51.544 line:0%
AND EVEN RESOURCES AWAY FROM 

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:52.378 line:0%
UKRAINE, WHICH, OF COURSE, 

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.713 line:0%
BENEFITS RUSSIA.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.684 line:0%
NOBODY EVEN HAS MENTIONED 

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:57.984 line:0%
UKRAINE HARDLY IN THE LAST 96 

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:58.818 line:0%
HOURS.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:00.653 line:0%
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY ACCURATE 

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:02.522 line:0%
WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS 

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:05.091 line:0%
THERE WAS NO DIRECT INVOLVEMENT,

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:07.093 line:0%
BUT THE WAY YOU AND MATT HAVE 

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:09.195 line:0%
LAID IT OUT, IT'S GREEN LIGHTING

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:11.397 line:0%
THE WEAPONS, I MEAN, I WATCHED 

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.765 line:0%
THE TRAINING VIDEO OF THESE GUYS

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:13.233 line:0%
WHAT, THEY WERE DOING TO PREPARE

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.767 line:0%
FOR THIS ATTACK.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.703 line:0%
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU DO IN 

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.770 line:0%
YOUR GARAGE OR YOUR BASEMENT.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:22.509 line:0%
THIS IS REALLY HIGH-QUALITY 

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:24.043 line:0%
EFFORT ON THE SIDE OF HAMAS.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.845 line:0%
&gt;&gt; AND, MATTHEW, WE'RE 

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.746 line:0%
TALKING -- I WAS TALKING TO 

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:29.215 line:0%
SOMEONE TODAY.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:30.817 line:0%
THERE ARE THESE STORIES ABOUT 

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.818 line:0%
IDF FIGHTERS TAKING ON EIGHT TO 

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:35.221 line:0%
TEN OF THESE FIGHTERS AND 

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:36.523 line:0%
FIGHTING FOR HOURS AND HOURS IN 

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.424 line:0%
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT, THAT THIS 

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:40.660 line:0%
WAS ALSO GOING ON FOR QUITE SOME

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:42.061 line:0%
TIME, THAT THESE WERE NOT JUST 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.630 line:0%
HIGHLY MOTIVATED BUT HIGHLY 

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.164 line:0%
PREPARED AND HIGHLY ARMED 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.497 line:0%
INDIVIDUALS.

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.232 line:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:47.433 line:0%
THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE 

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:49.736 line:0%
SHOCK, ERIN, OF COURSE, TO THE 

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:50.670 line:0%
PEOPLE OF ISRAEL, THEY'RE 

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.405 line:0%
ENRAGED BY IT.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.039 line:0%
AND, OF COURSE, IT'S BEEN 

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.407 line:0%
SURPRISING AS WELL.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.810 line:0%
AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY 

00:02:54.507 --> 00:03:02.515 line:0%
SURPRISING FOR HAMAS AS WELL.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:03.283 line:0%
FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING, 

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:05.251 line:0%
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO 

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:05.718 line:0%
BE SO SUCCESSFUL, IF I CAN USE 

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:08.254 line:0%
THOSE TERMS.

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:08.988 line:0%
PERHAPS THEY WANTED TO GET SOME 

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.223 line:0%
ISRAELI HOSTAGES, PERHAPS THEY 

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:11.624 line:0%
WANTED TO USE THAT TO NEGOTIATE 

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:13.259 line:0%
BETTER TERMS IN GAZA.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:15.395 line:0%
BUT WHERE THEY'VE GONE TO HAS 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.197 line:0%
LED TO THE BRINK OF UTTER 

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.497 line:0%
CATASTROPHE FOR THEM AND FOR 

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:18.431 line:0%
GAZA.

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:20.266 line:0%
&gt;&gt; AND, GENERAL HODGES, WHEN YOU

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:22.936 line:0%
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ACTUALLY SAW

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:25.772 line:0%
ON THE BORDER TODAY RIGHT ALONG 

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:27.273 line:0%
THAT BORDER THREE MILES AWAY, 

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.674 line:0%
VERY BLATANT MASSING OF ISRAELI 

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:28.841 line:0%
FORCES.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:30.543 line:0%
THEY ARE BUSING THEM IN.

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:31.978 line:0%
WE HEARD HEAVY OUTGOING FIRE.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:32.946 line:0%
WE HEARD THE FIGHTER JETS AND 

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:33.746 line:0%
THE EXPLOSIONS AND WE SAW THEM 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:37.584 line:0%
IN GAZA.

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:37.917 line:0%
AND THEN AT ONE POINT 60 ROCKETS

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:40.186 line:0%
CAME IN.

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:40.553 line:0%
IT WAS A BARRAGE, IT WAS AN 

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:43.323 line:0%
ONSLAUGHT.

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:45.158 line:0%
THAT'S THE TEMPO THAT WE 

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.758 line:0%
EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT THE 

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:47.060 line:0%
AFTERNOON TODAY.

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:49.362 line:0%
GENERAL HODGES, WHAT DOES THIS 

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:50.997 line:0%
SAY TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IS NEXT?

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:52.532 line:0%
DO YOU SUSTAIN THIS SORT OF BACK

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:53.766 line:0%
AND FORTH IF SOMETHING ISN'T 

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:55.468 line:0%
ABOUT TO IMMINENTLY OCCUR?

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:57.604 line:0%
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M PUTTING 

00:03:55.568 --> 00:04:00.073 line:0%
MYSELF IN THE SHOES OF THE 

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.440 line:0%
COMMANDER OF, SAY, A BATTALION 

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:03.309 line:0%
COMMANDER.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.643 line:0%
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS MY 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.745 line:0%
MISSION.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:08.881 line:0%
SOLDIERS CANNOT STAY IN A CROUCH

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:10.216 line:0%
OR COILED LIKE THIS 

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:11.251 line:0%
INDEFINITELY.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:13.052 line:0%
SO, WHAT YOU HAVE SHOWN VERY 

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.821 line:0%
CLEARLY IS THAT THEY ARE IN THIS

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:15.188 line:0%
CROUCH GETTING READY FOR 

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.090 line:0%
SOMETHING.

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:19.259 line:0%
BUT ARE THEY GOING IN THERE TO 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.395 line:0%
DO A PUNITIVE STRIKE, GO IN FOR 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.062 line:0%
A FEW DAYS, KILL AS MANY HAMAS 

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:26.633 line:0%
AS THEY CAN?

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:27.800 line:0%
OR IS THIS GOING TO END UP IN AN

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.534 line:0%
OCCUPATION THAT MAYBE LASTS FOR 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.937 line:0%
SEVERAL MONTHS?

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:31.237 line:0%
THAT'S A DIFFERENT SORT OF 

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.372 line:0%
THING.

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.673 line:0%
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD WANT TO KNOW

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:36.542 line:0%
IF I WAS THE COMMANDER.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:38.678 line:0%
WHAT'S THE END STATE WE'RE BEING

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:41.814 line:0%
SENT IN TO ACHIEVE.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:42.548 line:0%
NO MATTER WHICH, EITHER OF THESE

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:44.617 line:0%
TWO POSSIBILITIES, IT'S GOING TO

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:46.753 line:0%
BE VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:47.153 line:0%
YOU'VE POINTED OUT THE 

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:48.154 line:0%
BULLDOZERS.

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:50.857 line:0%
THE ISRAELIS ARE PROBABLY AS 

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:54.694 line:0%
GOOD AS ANYBODY IN THE WORLD AT 

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:56.929 line:0%
USING BULLDOZERS AND OTHER 

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.930 line:0%
CAPABILITIES INSIDE A DENSELY 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.732 line:0%
POPULATED AREA LIKE THIS.

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.367 line:0%
THEY KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:04.304 line:0%
BUT EVEN WITH THAT, IT'S STILL 

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:06.406 line:0%
GOING TO BE VERY COSTLY.

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:07.940 line:0%
&gt;&gt; AND, MATTHEW, AS YOU HAVE 

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:10.043 line:0%
SPENT SO MUCH TIME IN UKRAINE, 

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:12.211 line:0%
AND WE WERE THERE AS THE WAR 

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:14.347 line:0%
BEGAN, THERE ARE MORE THAN 

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.581 line:0%
DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THAT

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:16.849 line:0%
PUTIN HAD AT ONE POINT ON THAT
