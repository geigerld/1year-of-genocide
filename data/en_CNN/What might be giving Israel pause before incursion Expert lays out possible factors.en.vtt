00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:00.667
A spokesman for the

00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.127
Israeli Defense Forces.

00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:03.336
The top spokesperson

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:04.295
says that it will start

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:06.464
firing more airstrikes

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:08.174
starting from today

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:09.217
and that a ground invasion

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:10.176
will begin once

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.804
the military conditions are optimal.

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:13.304
Well, joining me

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:14.264
now is the former State

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:15.056
Department negotiator

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:17.183
for the Middle East, Aaron David Miller,

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.935
along with former Department of Homeland

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.437
Security official Juliette Kayyem.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.689
And thanks very much to you both.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.150
Let me just start, Aaron, with you.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.028
We know that Israel has been ready

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.904
to go for days at the military,

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:30.488
has been ready

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:31.823
a state of incredible readiness.

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:32.532
And when they

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:33.825
they now are giving 24 hour

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.827
leaves, 2 to 2 soldiers.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.162
We've heard they come in, they come out.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:38.830
I mean, they are ready.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.666
And yet they have not yet gone.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:45.587
What do you think is giving the pause?

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.546
Well, first of all, Aaron,

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:47.922
thanks for having me.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:48.840
A lot of factors.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.176
I think number one, there's weather.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:51.926
Number two,

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:53.344
there's Israeli indecision

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:55.305
about the breadth and depth

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:56.056
that precisely

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.766
how they're going to do this.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.475
Number three,

00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.642
the president's visit,

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:02.228
I think, may have actually engendered

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.646
a good bit of thinking

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.523
on the part of the Israelis with respect

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:07.817
to the way they're going to do this.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:10.820
And finally, I think the cruelest dilemma

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.155
is hostages.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.116
Israelis are torn between

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:16.242
their commitment

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.160
not necessarily

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.204
to avenging the deaths of four,

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:20.246
1400 people,

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.957
but to preempting the possibility

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:25.376
this could ever happen again on one hand

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:26.252
and their commitment

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.670
to redeem the living.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.922
I mean, you've been there now.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:29.881
You've seen

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.925
you've talked to the families,

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:35.887
hostage, hostage redemption,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.056
retrieving Israeli soldiers

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.057
and civilians dead

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:41.226
or alive from the battlefield

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:42.685
is a national priority.

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:45.772
So this is the cruelest dilemma of all.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.234
Although I think in the end,

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:49.943
undermining

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.736
Hamas and destroying its capacity

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:53.238
to govern in Gaza

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:57.742
will probably be the greater priority.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.077
And yes,

00:01:59.077 --> 00:01:59.369
and it

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.829
it appears they've been making that

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.080
that as clear as they can.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.789
And as I said,

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.792
the families of the hostages,

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:06.876
sometimes with anger,

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:08.086
sometimes with acceptance,

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:08.670
seem to know

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.296
that there isn't

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.423
any ambiguity there for them,

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:13.716
which only one can imagine

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:14.634
that cruel reality

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.010
for those for those families

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.679
who are so desperately hoping.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:18.680
Juliet, The thing is,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.265
of course, as Israel

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:21.933
waits, is ready

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:22.934
and waits, there's obviously

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.102
the military issue of that,

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:24.727
which is how long

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:26.604
can you be at such a state of readiness

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.523
with 360,000 people on a border?

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:29.649
And wait, know,

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.984
how long can you stay like,

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.111
you know, down on the start moon

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.696
On the start line. Right.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:35.613
There's also the question

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:37.157
that as they wait,

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.867
the frustration builds around the world.

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.451
The protests that we've seen

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:41.619
obviously have been widespread

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:42.162
around the region.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.121
But one particular one

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:43.872
that stood out to me

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:44.831
that I keep mentioning

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:45.957
because I think the scale

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.041
just really hits me.

00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:48.376
80,000 people

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:49.377
protesting out

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:52.297
outside the consulate in Adana, Turkey.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.381
Adana Turkey is not a place

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.966
that most people in the United States

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.467
even heard of. 80,000 people.

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:57.969
They had to shut that consulate.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.014
So what are the risks here? Yeah.

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:01.931
The risks are multiple.

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:03.016
I think these are the ones that

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.601
the President Biden has been trying

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.226
to highlight

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:06.144
to the Israelis

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.812
based essentially on our lessons

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.147
in Afghanistan.

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:11.065
One is after being attacked,

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:12.817
after we were attacked on 911,

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:14.527
one is what is the end game?

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.237
It is one thing to say,

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:16.696
you know,

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.406
for those of us in counterterrorism,

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:22.035
we are going to make Hamas not able

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:25.788
to govern in Gaza, then what right is is

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:30.084
are the Israelis actually anticipating

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:31.336
in Gaza?

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:34.255
And if not, then then who is right?

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.007
So that's the first part.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.842
The second is

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:40.637
the issue of civilian deaths.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.764
You know, going back 20 years, we were

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:45.934
we were probably not thinking about what

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.603
civilian deaths meant in Afghanistan.

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:48.770
Well,

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.021
it essentially meant

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.690
that you were radicalizing populations

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.441
that might not

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.443
otherwise have been radicalized.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:57.028
So, you know, obviously,

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.696
the human rights issues are key.

00:03:58.696 --> 00:03:59.405
And and

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.615
the third is,

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.408
if you don't have an answer

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.618
to the first two questions,

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.037
how do you stop a regional conflict

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.872
if you you know, Biden's success

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:08.915
so far, I have to

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.125
say, is in is what's not happened.

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:11.501
Right.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.460
I mean, in other words,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.045
the Israelis have not gone in yet.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.046
There hasn't been.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:16.923
There's there's regional

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.051
anger and there's lots of criticism.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:21.886
But you haven't had the kind of unrest

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:22.512
that one might have

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.597
anticipated last Saturday.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.266
So that's that's the dialog

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.308
that has to go on it.

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:28.309
But but

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.312
what's the endgame here for Israel?

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:33.523
You're not going to govern God's is Gaza.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:37.151
I mean, that's that's their challenge.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.444
And but, Erin, it also

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.696
comes as there's been this,

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:39.904
you know,

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:41.406
incredible backlash in the United States.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.950
It's not just pro-Palestinian rallies.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.951
Of course.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:45.952
It's it's horrific.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.412
Things like

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.455
Polo Sandoval was just reporting

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.165
with the head of a synagogue

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:53.084
being stabbed to death outside her home.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:53.960
I mean,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.794
there are horrific

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:56.296
things happening right?

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:56.629
There is

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.131
there is a backlash

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.675
that that is that is building.

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.469
And the reality of it is, is

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.346
how dangerous is this in the U.S.?

00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:07.515
Erin.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.267
Well, here and that's a

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:10.018
that's a question

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.060
you and I could talk about

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.478
probably for days.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.481
Given the divisiveness, the polarization,

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:18.192
hate speech, social media,

00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:21.195
the behavior of certain

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.197
American politicians

00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:24.490
which encourage this,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.701
I think is extremely dangerous.

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.412
Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.413
And that's

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.748
those currents

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.916
clearly are going to be fed

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:34.876
by what happened

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:38.087
on October 7th and Israel's response

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.130
in Gaza.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.007
No question about that.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.093
Our own broken house, frankly, is in

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:45.219
some respects

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.180
as much on display in the president.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.057
I think, in his remarks

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:50.558
day before yesterday

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:51.559
addressed this question.

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:54.228
But I think it's absolutely critical

00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:55.980
that we continue to talk

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.857
about the importance

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.401
of tolerance, of mutual understanding.

00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:01.319
And, of course,

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.862
as Juliette notes,

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:06.324
Department of Homeland Security, the FBI

00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:08.868
follow these these groups.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:09.702
If, in fact,

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:12.246
you're talking about organized responses

00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:15.249
as closely as possible.

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.792
Right. Right.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:16.417
And the president did,

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:18.002
of course, talk about

00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:18.920
how horrible both things

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.923
are Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, that

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.550
the US must not succumb to those.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.593
Thank you both so very much.
