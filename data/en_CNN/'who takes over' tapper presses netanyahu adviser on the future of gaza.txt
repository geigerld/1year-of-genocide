&gt;&gt; CNN's Becky Anderson in Doha are, Qatar, we appreciate it. Senior adviser to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and ambassador to the united Kingdom, mark Greg is with us in tel aviv. First, let me ask you, military people in Israel not just the United States have their own language. When the idf says that military ground excursion has expanded, ground operations expanded, I didn't know, what does this mean that ground operation is expanding. Doesn't mean Israeli troops, soldiers on the ground in gaza? ? &gt;&gt; I'm not gonna go into anything operational especially if the operation is ongoing. But I can say that, yes, we're beefing up the pressure on hamas. That pressure increase and continue to increase until we achieve our goal. &gt;&gt; Is there are a ground, ground operations expanded does that mean it's happening it's what it sounds like to me again I don't speak military lingo whether it's in the Pentagon, idf what is it mean? &gt;&gt; I said a moment ago operations are ongoing. &gt;&gt; I still don't know that means. &gt;&gt; What about this barrage of airstrikes going on in gaza right now. &gt;&gt; I cannot go into anything technical, I can say this we are focused on our goal which is the elimination of hamas, the destruction of its military capabilities, military machine, and the end of its political control over the gaza strip. &gt;&gt; The idf released earlier toy, a 3D map of command and control center of hamas, the idf says it's under a hospital in gaza. It's not photographs, it's a graphic depiction, where does it where it is that information come from? &gt;&gt; That information is enclave, based on Israeli intelligence. If you ask the gazans who are honest with you, they'll tell you for years they've known that how mask uses hospitals, in this case a sherpa hospital for their command and control. The idf spokesperson and people in gaza must have seen it, when the war started on the 7th of October with that massacre, they expected Israel to strike back. There was a surge of hamas activists, terrorists, scores of them finding shelter. &gt;&gt; So, obviously, it's been known and it's been reported, Anderson's been to gaza, it's known that hamas fires rockets from civilian centers from apartments, et cetera -- &gt;&gt; From schools, U.N. Facilities. &gt;&gt; It's been reported, it's not just idf claiming it but it's been reported by independent journalist on the ground. This is real consider hospitals to be targets, there are also as you will acknowledge, patients, doctors, nurses in these hospitals. &gt;&gt; We were pointing out the facts, we want the world to understand the enemy that we're up against. A ruthless enemy that has been reported widely, has no trouble massacring Israeli civilians, they did so in all the gruesome reality that we saw on October seven. They have no qualms whatsoever about impending themselves and humanitarian buildings like hospitals. Which it shows us exactly what we're up against. When this is over and we have defeated hamas, we've destroyed it's military machine, we've removed it from the position of power it holds in gaza today. I think not only we doing Israelis of flavored freeing these terrorists from the south, or doing the people of gaza favor, or freeing them from this extremist dictatorship run by a bunch of cutthroat terrorists. &gt;&gt; Who takes over in gaza when and if you defeat hamas? Who takes over? &gt;&gt; We will defeat hamas, will eliminate them. &gt;&gt; Who takes over? &gt;&gt; We have contingency plans. We're looking at different scenarios, we've been discussing them with friends and allies, like Washington, at this stage I cannot go into details. The focus at the moment is defeating hamas. And anything is superior, preferable to continue hamas ruling in gaza. We've seen what it brings, it brings them a spare we saw on Israel and October seven. We don't want to go back there. &gt;&gt; Senior hamas official says hamas is ready to -- defeat troops if they enter gaza. He went on to say, quote, the resistance is ready. What I laid out what your soldiers are gonna be facing in gaza, it's it is, the challenges this vast network of 200 kilometers of tunnels that they've been building for 20 years. It's very sophisticated, the defense minister said to me earlier today, all the money going to gaza over the years not to build university, not to build factories, to build tunnels and by rockets. A ruthless terrorist group Wellington blow themselves up and do anything, use their own people as a human camouflage, urban where fair or the toughest warfare there is, 2 million civilians you do not want to Cal, you don't want to hurt them, you're unfortunately killing them. But you do not want to. We're making an effort not to like your killing a lot of them. This is a task, it's seeming impossible and you are sending soldiers and duet. &gt;&gt; Obviously, -- &gt;&gt; On top of a humanitarian crisis ongoing. &gt;&gt; First of all, the entire situation wherein is precisely because hamas attacked us on October 7th, were responding to I have no doubt that we're going to battle facing risks, you're 100 percent correct. The enemy is horrific and it's barbarity, it's fanaticism, and it's disregard rules of war, that's clear. The young soldiers going, you need to do this why, the current status quo, this terrorist I.S.I.S. Enclave in our southern border is unsustainable. We will not live like that any longer. We saw what they are capable of doing. We saw a gruesome, terrible horrific violence. We refuse to live with that neighbor anymore. We are now going to a redo
