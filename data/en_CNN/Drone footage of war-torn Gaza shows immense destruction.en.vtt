00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.736
Ben, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:07.207
seems to be growing worse by the hour.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:08.641
Well, in fact, Wolf, the UN

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.377
is describing it as dire.

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.277
And I think the U.N.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:14.114
is rather understating the case.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:14.881
It sounds,

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:15.782
by all accounts

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.350
that it's callous traffic.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.385
In addition

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:18.918
to the fact

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:19.919
that the death toll in

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.523
Gaza has now exceeded 1500.

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.592
The health system, by all accounts,

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.227
and according to the Palestinian health

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:30.230
Ministry, is in a state of collapse.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:33.266
All the things you need to run a hospital

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.968
are slowly running out.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.102
The fuel

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.237
for the generators

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:38.371
that keep the hospitals

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.073
running medicine,

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:40.673
basic

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.742
supplies are simply not

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:44.044
being replenished.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.545
And therefore,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:46.279
we're seeing that,

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.181
for instance, in hospitals

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.749
all around Gaza,

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.351
many of the injured are

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.820
simply put on the floor in the corridors.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.722
There are no beds left.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.558
The operating theaters are beyond

00:00:58.558 --> 00:00:59.826
capacity now,

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.995
according to the United Nations.

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:05.398
There are 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:07.367
who now have no access

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.301
to health care,

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.235
partially

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.270
because of the fighting,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.839
but partially because the health workers

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:15.308
and all the facilities are being focused

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:17.343
on treating the injured.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:19.112
Now, speaking of the injured, earlier

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:20.480
this evening, our colleague

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.183
Christiane Amanpour spoke to Dr.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:24.317
Hassan Abu City,

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:24.918
who's a

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.086
Palestinian British

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.620
doctor who has been going

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.456
to Gaza regularly.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:30.490
I've interviewed him

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.357
many times,

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.659
also in

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:33.960
operating theaters

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.727
while he's actually

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.396
operating on the injured.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:39.332
And he says that the among the wounded,

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:43.570
30 to 40% of them are children.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.604
And certainly there is a

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:47.740
sense in Gaza that

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.043
at this point

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:53.246
people feel that the ordinary civilians,

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.916
they are simply being abandoned

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.084
but are not doing enough.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.886
No one cries over us.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:02.288
There's no chivalry, no feelings.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.857
Hearts are dead.

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:06.559
Only shocks and body parts remain.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:07.994
People are blind to this.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.029
People can't find food in their homes.

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.331
And there is an extremely

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.766
tough social condition in Gaza.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.502
Siege above the siege.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:16.836
And all of this is happening

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:18.371
because of the siege.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.073
Where should our people go?

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:22.375
We've been besieged for 18 years.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.611
Where should we go?

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:27.480
And and of course, where can they go?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.549
They cannot go anywhere.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.584
The border to Egypt is closed.

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.086
They can't go into Israel.

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:34.254
The United States

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.755
and other European powers

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:37.223
are trying to figure out

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:39.259
some sort of humanitarian corridor

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.394
so Palestinian civilians

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:43.830
who have to can get out of Gaza.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.864
But at this point,

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.699
no progress on that front.
