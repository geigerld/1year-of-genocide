&gt;&gt;&gt; AND WE'RE BACK WITH SENIOR  ADVISER TO ISRAELI PRIME  MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU MARK REGOFF. THANKS FOR JOINING US. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS  REPORTING THAT THREE SENIOR  ISRAELI OFFICIALS SAY THAT THE  PLAN IS TO WIPE OUT HAMAS'S TOP  LEADERSHIP IN GAZA. AND TO INVADE GAZA CITY. WE HAVEN'T HEARD WHAT THE PLAN  IS. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF AIR STRIKES  ON GAZA. YOU COULD CONFIRM THAT THAT IS  THE PLAN, TO WIPE OUT HAMAS AS  TOP LEADERSHIP AND TO INVADE  GAZA CITY WITH A GROUND FORCE? &gt;&gt; JAKE, YOU OF COURSE KNOW THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO  OPERATIONAL DETAILS OF MILITARY  ACTIVITIES THAT ARE STILL AHEAD  OF US. I CAN ONLY SHARE THE GOAL WITH  YOU OF THE OPERATION. WHICH IS BEEN STATED AND I'LL  STATE IT AGAIN, WE WILL  DISMANTLE HAMAS'S MILITARY  MACHINE AND TAKE APART ITS  POLITICAL GOVERNMENTS IN GAZA. WE WILL DESTROY BOTH THE  MILITARY WING OF HAMAS, ITS  MILITARY MACHINE, AND THE  TERRORIST CAPABILITIES AND  GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES, ITS  GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE IN GAZA.  &gt;&gt; HOW MANY PEOPLE IS THAT, DO  YOU THINK? &gt;&gt; I CAN'T GO INTO NUMBERS. BUT IT MEANS THAT WHEN THIS IS  OVER, HAMAS WILL BE INCAPABLE OF LAUNCHING THE SORT OF HORRENDOUS ATTACK THAT THEY DID ON OCTOBER  7th. THEY WILL BE PHYSICALLY  INCAPABLE OF LAUNCHING SUCH AN  OPERATION. &gt;&gt; SO, CERTAINLY TAKING OUT  HAMAS'S LEADERSHIP, I UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF THAT. BUT THE PALESTINIAN HEALTH  MINISTRY IN GAZA SAID 2800  PALESTINIAN HAVE BEEN KILLED AN  SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A QUARTER AND  A THIRD OF THEM ARE CHILDREN. THAT IS NOT HAMAS'S LEADERSHIP. &gt;&gt; CAN I PLEASE OFFER A WARD OF  CAUTION. NOW I KNOW THAT THERE IS REAL  SUFFERING IN GAZA. THERE IS A WAR GOING ON AND  INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE GETTING  CAUGHT UP IN A VERY DIFFICULT  SITUATION. I DON'T MINIMIZE THAT. BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE WITH A  GRAIN OF SALT ANY INFORMATION  THAT COMES OUT OF THE HAMAS  CONTROLLED MINISTRY OF HEALTH IN GAZA. THAT HAS TO BE SAID. IT IS NOT A DEMOCRACY, THERE IS  NOT AN INDEPENDENT HEALTH  BUREAUCRACY TRYING TO DO ITS  BEST. EVERY DOCTOR THAT YOU SPEAK TO  AND EVERY HOSPITAL DIRECTOR THAT YOU SPEAK TO WORKS UNDER THE GUN OF HAMAS. THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT. IF THEY SPEAK OUT OF TURN, THEY  WILL PAY A PRICE. IT IS LIKE SPEAKING TO A DOCTOR  IN NORTH KOREA OR A DOCTOR IN  THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. THEY DON'T HAVE INDEPENDENT  OPINIONS. THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PARTY  LINE AND IF NOT, THEY FACE  VIOLENT CONSEQUENCES. SO THOSE NUMBERS, THEY MIGHT BE  TRUE, THEY MIGHT NOT BE TRUE. HAMAS, OF COURSE, HAS AN  INTEREST IN EXAGGERATING  CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. &gt;&gt; SO LET'S ASSUME --  &gt;&gt; AND HAMAS DIDN'T SAY HOW MANY WERE COMBATANTS OF COURSE.  &gt;&gt; RIGHT. SO LET'S ASSUME THAT YOU TAKE  OUT THE HAMAS LEADERSHIP AND  THEIR ABILITY TO COMMIT  ATROCITIES. AMBASSADOR HERZOG TOLD ME  YESTERDAY THAT ISRAEL DOES NOT  WANT TO REOCCUPY GAZA SO WHAT  HAPPENS AFTER HAMAS IS  DESTROYED? WHO WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF GAZA? &gt;&gt; SO, FIRST OF ALL, MAYBE  ALMOST ANYTHING WOULD BE BETTER  THAN HAMAS. I MEAN, IF THERE WERE ILLUSIONS  THAT HAMAS HAD SOMEHOW MODERATED ITS POSITION THAT THE  RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT OF  BEING RULING OVER 2.3 MILLION  PEOPLE, FORCES HAMAS TO BE A  MORE RATIONAL BEHAVIOR, THAT WAS PROVEN WRONG. THE VIOLENCE, THE BRUTAL  HORRIFIC VIOLENCE THAT WE SAW  OCTOBER 7th SHOWED THAT TO BE  WRONG. THIS IS A HARD CORE EXTREMIST  MURDERIST TERRORIST  ORGANIZATION. AND SO YOU HAVE TO SAY, IF IT IS LIKE ISIS, HOW COULD IT GET MUCH WORSE. SO YOU HAVE TO HIT IT HARD, AND  WE HAVE TO -- WE HAVE TO DESTROY ITS ABILITY TO ATTACK US. AND I'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS  WHERE DIFFERENT CONTINGENCIES  HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED, WHAT  HAPPENS AFTER, AT THIS TAJ I'M  NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS THOSE  DISCUSSIONS, BUT ISRAEL IS  THINKING THREE STEPS AHEAD. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING NOW IS  NOW IS WE FOCUS ON THE  DISMANTLING OF THE POLITICAL  STRUCTURE.  &gt;&gt; THERE IS A NEW REPORT THAT  ALLEGES SENIOR OFFICIALS IN  NETANYAHU'S OFFICE ARE BARRED  FROM WORKING WITH AN ISRAELI  DEFENSE MINISTRY TASK FORCE  WHICH IS FOCUSED ON PREPARING  INFRASTRUCTURE NEAR GAZA. BECAUSE THE DEFENSE TASK FORCE  IS LED BY A STAUNCH OPPONENT OF  THE NETANYAHU JUDICIAL OVERHAUL. IS THAT TRUE? &gt;&gt; I HAVE NOT READ THAT REPORT  AND I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY OF THAT. I APOLOGIZE.  &gt;&gt; YOU'VE SAID THAT ISRAEL IS  UNITED RIGHT NOW. VERY UNITED. SO FAR NETANYAHU HAS NOT BEEN  ABLE TO GET OPPOSITION LEADER LA PEAD TO JOIN THE UNITY  GOVERNMENT. WHAT IS GOING ON THERE? SHOULDN'T ISRAEL BE AS UNITED AS POSSIBLE? &gt;&gt; WELL WE'VE ALREADY UNITED BY  BRINGING IN ONE MAJOR OPPOSITION PARTY. AND AS YOU KNOW, THEY JOINED A  FEW DAYS AGO AND WE'VE NOW GOT A NATIONAL EMERGENCY GOVERNMENT. WHERE MR. GANTZ, WHO WAS A  SEVERE CRITIC OF PRIME MINISTER  NETANYAHU, STEPPED IN AND  STEPPED IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS  WE HAVE TO UNITE TO FIGHT THE  COMMON ENEMY AND IF YOU LOOK AT  POLLING IN ISRAEL, THERE IS WIDE SUPPORT FOR THAT SORT OF MOVE. IT MUST BE REMEMBERED, WHEN THEY CROSSED THE BORDER ON OCTOBER  7th TO MURDER US, THEY WENT TO  LEFT WING KIBBUTZ, WHERE PEOPLE  IN THEIR LIVES NEVER VOTED FOR  NETANYAHU AND THEY WENT TO RIGHT WING VILLAGES WHERE EVERYBODY  LIKES NETANYAHU. THEY DIDN'T CARE IF ISRAELIS  WERE LEFT WING OR RIGHT WING OR  RELIGIOUS OR SECULAR. THEY KILL US BECAUSE WE'RE  ISRAELIS AND BECAUSE WE ARE  JEWS. THAT IS -- THE MURDERS AND  VIOLENCE THAT WE SAW ON OCTOBER  7th, THAT WAS THE LARGEST SINGLE ACT OF ANTI-SEMITIC VIOLENCE  SINCE 1945. SINCE THE TERRIBLE YEARS OF THE  HAUTE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING LIKE  THAT FOR MONTHAN HALF A CENTURY. SO I THINK MORE MANY ISRAELIS,  WE ARGUE ABOUT POLITICS AND  LOUDLY AND PASSIONATELY. BUT I THINK THESE ATTACKS BY  HAMAS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT WERE A SLAP ON THE FACE. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE  HAVE A COMMON DESTINY, AND A  COMMON -- A COMMON SITUATION  THAT WE'RE ALTOGETHER IN FACING  THESE TERRIBLE AND HORRIFIC  CHALLENGES.
