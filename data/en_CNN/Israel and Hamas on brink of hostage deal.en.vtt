00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.501
A major breakthrough on

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:03.203
hostage negotiations.

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:06.039
Israel's war cabinet is meeting right now

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.407
on a deal with Hamas

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:11.077
to free about 50 of the 237 people

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.013
being held captive.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.482
It's been 45 days since hostages,

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.449
mostly innocent

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.451
civilians, were taken by Hamas

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:19.886
on the Jewish

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:22.856
Sabbath, taken during an attack on Israel

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.691
when terrorists raped women

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.259
and murdered families.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.495
More than a thousand people that day.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:28.995
For each

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.765
spare that fate and instead taken hostage

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.901
the unknown and the wait is excruciating

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:35.802
for their families.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:38.805
Now we are told an announcement of a deal

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:39.472
that will allow

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:41.408
some of those hostages to come home

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:42.842
could be imminent.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:43.676
President Biden

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.679
addressed that moment ago.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:49.482
We're now very close, very close,

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.451
and could bring

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.187
some of these hostages home very soon.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.722
But I don't want to get into

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:56.923
the details of change

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:58.925
because nothing is done until it's done.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.095
And we have more to say.

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.497
We will. But things are looking good.

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:06.966
CNN is covering the

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.234
story from all angles.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.103
Oren Liebermann is in Tel Aviv.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:10.570
M.J.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.038
Lee is here in Washington

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:12.839
at the White House.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.974
M.J., I want to start with you.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:17.944
That was pretty remarkable.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:19.879
Moment from the president

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:20.880
of the United States

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.983
to lean that far into where he thinks

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:26.953
that this negotiation is right now.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:27.954
Yeah, that's right.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:29.255
You heard the president saying

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.791
that we are very close to a deal.

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.126
And that very much echoes

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.828
what sources have been telling CNN

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:35.995
all morning,

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:37.130
that the US, Israel

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.065
and Hamas are on the cusp

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.533
of announcing this deal

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.602
and it could come as early as today.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:43.403
I was in the room

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:44.938
when the president made those remarks,

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.173
and I did try to ask him at the end

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.075
how many Americans he believes

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.810
may be among the 50 hostages

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.811
initially released.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.146
And he said, I'll have plenty of time

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:54.481
to talk about the hostages,

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.982
but not now, basically

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:58.351
declining to go into any of the details.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:01:59.686
And I'll let Orrin speak

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.554
to the details of sort of the contours

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.156
of this potential deal.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:04.457
But at least for the Biden

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.325
administration, this,

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.092
of course, Dana,

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.027
has been an urgent priority

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.863
trying to get these hostages out,

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.197
because they have said all along

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:11.898
that they believe

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:13.633
there are at least a handful

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.735
of American citizens in the mix

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.238
in Gaza being held by Hamas.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:19.172
And now what U.S.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:20.039
officials are saying

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.541
is that they are hopeful

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.275
that three year

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:23.977
old American citizen Abigail

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.646
Alden will be among the 50 hostages

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.148
that are initially released.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.048
She is the youngest

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.350
known American hostage.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.385
Her parents were killed by Hamas.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.487
So this is a very tenuous situation,

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.922
but hopefully we are.

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:36.189
U.S.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.991
officials are saying this three year

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:38.658
old American

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.426
toddler will be in the mix

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.095
of the 50 hostages.

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.930
We have, of course, and seen U.S.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.665
officials working around the clock

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.100
to try to secure this deal.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.101
Over the last few weeks.

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.035
The president, of course,

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:49.969
has been on the phone

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.337
with Prime Minister Netanyahu,

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.573
the emir of Qatar, the president of Egypt

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.674
and other top U.S.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.742
officials have been traveling

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:56.843
in the region as well.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:57.310
But, Dana,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.012
it's important to underscore,

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.080
if this deal were to come to fruition,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.649
this is not only significant

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.651
because of the release of hostages,

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.152
but because this would mark

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:08.454
the first sustained pause in fighting

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:11.791
and the first major escalatory step

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.860
that Israel will be taking really

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.162
since the war first began.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:16.563
M.J.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.031
thank you so much for that reporting.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.532
And let's get more specific

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.935
about what sources are telling us.

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:23.069
This deal

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.338
may include the release of 50

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:26.973
women and children

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:27.840
And in exchange,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.176
there would be a four or five day

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.611
pause in fighting, as M.J.

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.079
just alluded to.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:33.646
Now, three

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:35.181
Palestinian prisoners

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:36.049
would be swapped

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.352
for each civilian Israeli hostage

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:42.789
or other hostage being released by Hamas.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:44.757
Israel would stop flying

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.893
surveillance drones over Gaza

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.262
for at least 6 hours each day.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.630
Oren, I'm

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.264
going to go to you

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.299
now about what is happening

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.468
in Israel as we speak.

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:56.970
That government is meeting.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.004
What are you hearing about

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.172
how that meeting is going

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:00.039
and whether or not they

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.140
will approve this deal?

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:03.576
So this

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:03.810
is all

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.411
part of a legal and political process

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.413
that is required to approve such a deal

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.548
and that is required

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:09.716
for a critical part of this,

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:10.917
and that is to approve

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.852
the release of Palestinian prisoners

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:14.220
women and children.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.989
So the first part of that is the war

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:16.689
cabinet is meeting,

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.491
and that's a very small group of people,

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.359
including Prime Minister

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.560
Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.694
that will lead straight

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:24.197
into a meeting of the security cabinet.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:26.132
Again, that's a slightly larger group.

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:27.700
And then the full cabinet itself,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.735
that is the government.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:29.702
And it needs to be approved

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.537
that each one of those stages

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.139
for this deal to go through.

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.140
Now, that's critical

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.341
because two partners

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.310
in Netanyahu's governing coalition

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.645
to far right partners,

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:39.212
I should say,

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:40.246
have already put out a statement

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:42.448
saying they will oppose this deal.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.384
And that could, of course, scuttle it.

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:45.818
And if they want it to go to the extreme,

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:47.387
they could theoretically topple

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:48.655
Netanyahu's government.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:49.622
But having spoken

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:50.990
to one of the families of the hostages

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.225
a short time ago,

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.093
they say they received an assurance

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:55.728
from one of the other critical members

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:56.996
of Netanyahu's government

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:58.798
that if this deal is put forward,

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.033
it will get approved.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:00.767
And that gives them

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:02.635
a critical bit of confidence

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.203
that having gotten to this point

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:06.773
where we see the process in Israel begin

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.741
to approve a hostage deal

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:09.542
in an exchange

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.010
and an agreement with Hamas

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.978
that would see them free

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.213
Israeli and other hostages potentially

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.915
that it will get over the line.

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:17.850
And that's what they're looking to now.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.584
And that's important

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:19.452
because these families

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:20.920
have heard the word imminent

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.189
before and have heard reports and rumors

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.891
that something is about to happen.

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.159
But if you speak with them,

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.126
they believe there's something

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.594
far more tangible here,

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:30.363
something far more powerful, palpable

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:31.297
and real

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:32.398
even if they haven't gotten

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:33.066
an official word

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:34.734
from the government at this point.

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:36.202
Now, these three votes in meetings

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:37.070
that are expected tonight

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.538
are not the end of the process.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:40.640
There is then a 24 hour window

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.341
in which

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.241
there can be appeals

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.009
that the Supreme Court

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.444
filed against this.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:45.812
That, too, will take its time

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.347
as that runs its course.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.214
But from the indications

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:49.649
we're seeing here, the government,

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:50.683
Netanyahu feeling

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:52.085
confident as this moves forward

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:52.952
through the evening.

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:53.720
And we will certainly keep

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.721
you posted, Dana,

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:56.823
as it moves into the subsequent meetings.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.359
So that's the process which is important.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.393
The politics there

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:02.662
obviously are critically important.

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:03.963
And now let's talk about the people,

00:06:03.963 --> 00:06:05.732
the people who are being held.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.266
Do we know anything

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:10.103
about the condition of these hostages

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.170
all of them,

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.572
but even specifically,

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:15.475
the women and children on that list of 50

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:18.277
who are hopefully going to be released?

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:21.914
The answer is we simply don't.

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:22.215
We know

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.784
so little about the nearly 240 hostages

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:26.252
held in Gaza.

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:27.754
And that has been an incredible source

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:28.454
of frustration.

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:28.821
In fact,

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:30.690
a little information we do know

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.424
has only come out

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:32.525
from the Israeli military

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.861
when it says it has found the bodies

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:37.063
of two Israeli hostages killed in Gaza

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.331
and brought them out.

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.766
There were several hostages released

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.801
very early on, but that was weeks ago,

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:42.902
if not more than a month

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.203
ago, in terms of

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:45.037
who is coming out,

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:46.773
the 50 women and children.

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:47.840
We know at this point

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.009
almost nothing except that little bit.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.078
On the on the flip side of that.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.380
We also don't know anything about the 150

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.581
Palestinian women and children

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.049
who are set to be released

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:58.351
as part of this exchange.

00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:00.153
So in terms of the details

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:00.720
of how

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.288
this plays out, really the

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:03.523
the nitty gritty of this,

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:04.957
we are still waiting for that.

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:05.391
And, of course,

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.759
the families of the hostages

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:07.860
still waiting to find out

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.430
if their loved ones are on that list

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.763
or and

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.565
thank you so much for that reporting.

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:14.100
And this potential breakthrough

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.967
in these hostage

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:15.835
negotiations

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:17.136
comes a day

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:19.305
after the families of hostages met

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.175
in Israel with that war cabinet there,

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:25.178
emotional calls to bring the hostages

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:25.511
home.

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.013
That's what happened in those meetings.

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:27.847
Now, we heard

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:28.748
similar emotion

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:32.518
from one of the family members of a

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:33.519
young girl

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.822
that MJ was talking about, Abigael Adan.

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.990
She she's three years old.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.392
She's being held in Gaza.

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:40.660
This is her great aunt

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.928
speaking to CNN this morning.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:45.331
These people have been in the

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:47.200
dark for 45 days.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.035
Abigail is a beautiful child

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:50.937
who wants to run around and play soccer

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:52.738
with her older brother and sister.

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:54.173
And she hasn't

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:56.309
been able to run around in 45 days.

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:58.377
I don't know where she is. We don't know.

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:00.346
She should be home with her family

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:02.381
and with her sister and brother.

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:04.083
And she isn't right now.

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:06.219
I'm not a politician. I'm not a diplomat.

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:07.920
I will believe it when I see them

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.156
walk out to be driven out.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.090
And they are free.
