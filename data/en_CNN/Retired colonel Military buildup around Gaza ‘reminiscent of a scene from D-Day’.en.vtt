00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.001
To go to the ground.

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:01.434
I want

00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:03.203
to turn to someone who is right now

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.438
fighting on the front lines of this war.

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:05.872
Joining me

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:09.342
now is IDF soldier Rudy Rockman.

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:11.945
Rudy, you are quite literally,

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.180
as we can see there in your picture.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.616
You are called now to duty.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:18.118
What have the last few days

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.186
been like for you on the ground

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.588
and where you are in Israel,

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:22.856
which, by the way, I should say

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.924
we are not specifically naming

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:28.995
just for security reasons as well.

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.296
Yeah. Thank you for having me.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.731
I mean, it's been almost a week

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:32.532
since this started.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:33.600
And as a reservist,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.467
I've been out of the Army

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.301
for over ten years.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:36.436
I'm a civilian.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.004
I've done my degrees,

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.672
I've work, I have families.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.775
And all of a sudden on Saturday morning,

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:43.143
it was Shabbat and it was so quiet.

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:44.511
It was the holiday for the Jewish people.

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:45.512
We get called up

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:46.780
and we started seeing these videos

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.548
of what had taken place in the morning

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.449
and our entire unit

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.151
got deployed to Vaasa,

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.752
which is a village on the border of Gaza,

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:54.320
which had some of the most horrendous

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.188
massacres.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:55.922
And unfortunately,

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.257
we were there for four days

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.758
rescuing the remaining civilians

00:00:58.758 --> 00:00:59.559
that remained.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.428
But when we got there, it was a massacre.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:02.028
We saw

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:03.963
bodies of men, women,

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:05.799
children, elderly, elderly,

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:06.900
cut up into pieces.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.967
The most gruesome images

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.135
you can ever imagine.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.403
And it was very unfortunate

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.371
to see those things.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.372
But thankfully,

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:13.807
we were able to secure the area.

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:14.941
And since then, we're ready

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.477
to be deployed to the next location.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:18.011
As you

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:19.045
prepare for what this

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:21.114
next phase of the war looks like,

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:22.849
Israeli officials have been pretty clear

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.050
that the plan

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.417
right now,

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.287
the objective is to wipe out Hamas.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:27.787
But I wonder,

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:30.223
do you think that that will require

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.858
street by street fighting?

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:32.959
And are you

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.127
personally prepared

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:36.796
for what that would mean?

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:38.565
I mean, the entire army has been prepared

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:39.199
for this war.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.100
Hamas goal

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.701
from the very beginning has been

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.203
to eliminate the Jewish people

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:44.471
and to eliminate Israel.

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:47.040
It's actually been in their constitution

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.341
when they built

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.242
their government

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:49.943
saying that they need

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:50.844
to eliminate the Jews,

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:51.544
not only in Israel,

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:52.879
but in entire the world.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.448
So when you give a terrorist organization

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:55.815
like that

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.517
weapons to go and fulfill their goals,

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:58.485
we know what that looks like,

00:01:58.485 --> 00:01:59.686
whether it's for Hamas,

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.621
the Palestinian Authority or Hezbollah

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.056
or all these different groups

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.891
that are actually oppressing its peoples

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:05.692
and don't actually

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:06.626
represents its peoples.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.027
If you speak to Palestinians

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:08.661
on the ground,

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:09.829
whether in Judea and Samaria,

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:10.130
the West

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.465
Bank or in Gaza, they do not like Hamas,

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.199
they do not like

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.267
the Palestinian Authority.

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:14.701
They're on their,

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.769
what, 20th year of their four year term.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.271
These are oppressive

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:18.972
regimes

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.106
that are controlling their people

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.242
and not only attacking Israeli civilians.

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.476
The forcing Palestinians

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.211
to also be caught into this conflict.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:26.713
Israelis do not want to see

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:29.082
either Israelis die or Palestinians die.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.683
The majority of us are innocents,

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.418
and this is not a war between the people.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:33.419
Let me make it clear

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.854
the Jews are not fighting the Muslims

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:35.388
and the Israelis

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:36.823
are not fighting Palestinians.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:37.891
We're fighting Hamas,

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:38.858
which is oppressing

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:40.360
both Israelis and Palestinians.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.161
Are we ready?

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:41.961
We are ready.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:42.795
But we also need to

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.464
not only look at the what is happening,

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:45.565
we need to understand

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:46.699
why it is happening.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.568
And this really started with the West

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.403
pushing narratives of dividing

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:51.738
Israelis and Palestinians.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.673
The reality is that there is no future

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:54.874
without Palestinians

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:55.842
and without Israelis.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.510
Neither of us are going to disappear.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.711
So I hope that when this settles,

00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.979
we can learn from this entrance

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.281
on this conflict together.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.283
It's an important point.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.751
And and I think so

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.753
many people share your hope that

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.087
that if there is an end to this,

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:09.155
hopefully there is

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:09.656
that It's one

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.524
that is obviously a lot more peaceful.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:12.692
But as we sit here,

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.060
there's so much concern

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.995
right now about the 1 million

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.163
or so Palestinians

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:18.198
who are being

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.065
told to flee

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:22.068
the northern part of Gaza right now.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:24.037
I've noted that you've observed

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.373
in the past that Hamas uses civilian

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.075
casualties of Palestine

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.510
as a propaganda tool.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.046
But are you worried that this operation

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.981
carried out by by Israel

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:37.617
could ultimately play into Hamas's hands

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:38.551
if those civilians

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.086
are not able to evacuate

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:43.056
and many of them end up killed?

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:43.723
Absolutely.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.191
I don't want to see any civilian killed.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.392
You know, for me, you're

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.560
you're you're a foreigner.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.028
You know, your fellow human being.

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.030
But for me, Palestinians are my cousins.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.931
They're my family.

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:52.599
So I don't want to see

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.633
any Palestinians killed.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:54.701
And I'm glad that they have at

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.769
least 24 hours to be able to evacuate.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.571
Israelis have less than 24 seconds

00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.539
to be able to evacuate

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.640
when they're being fired on.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.308
But when you look at people in Gaza,

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:02.909
I really hope

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.310
we can minimize the casualties

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.044
because none of us

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:06.312
want to see anybody dead.

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:07.413
We want to remove Hamas.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.581
So it can stop being a threat

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.583
both for Israelis and Palestinians.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:11.084
And in order

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.285
to transcend this conflict, it's

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:13.653
not just about creating peace.

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.054
It's about creating justice.

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.689
There's injustice both for Israelis

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.991
and both for Palestinians.

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.259
And there's one land

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.127
and one land that we can both live on.

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:22.195
But in order to get there,

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:23.663
we have to stop these zero

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:24.864
sum game

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:26.666
narratives that are educating people

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:27.900
that in order to be pro-Israel,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.202
you have to be anti-Palestinian.

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:30.503
Or in order to be pro-Palestinian,

00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:31.571
you have to be anti-Israel.

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:32.138
The reality,

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:33.973
if you're anti, either you're anti both

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:35.375
because we both belong in this line

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.410
and we will both be here eternally.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.511
You mentioned that you've been out

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:39.612
of the Israeli military

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:40.980
for about ten years.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.482
Is there anything in your experience

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.182
that compares

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.617
to what you are about to go into

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.653
and how long are you expecting

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:49.622
this conflict to last?

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.025
Yes, I got out of the Army in 2013.

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:52.892
So in 2012

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:54.127
there was an operation on the border

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:56.462
where we almost went into Gaza shortly

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:58.598
after I finished the army in 2014.

00:04:58.598 --> 00:04:59.799
The IDF went into Gaza.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:00.800
So this is not something

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.302
new, unfortunately,

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:02.769
but I hope

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:03.836
this will be the last time

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.605
that this happens.

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:07.740
We certainly hope it will be for you

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.842
and for really everyone in the region.

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:10.543
Rudy Brockmann,

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:11.611
thank you for joining us

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:14.580
and we wish you all the best.

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:16.516
Thank you for having me.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:19.018
And for a closer look at what's happening

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:20.787
on the developing battlefield

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:21.321
right now,

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.523
I'm joined by CNN military analyst

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:25.558
Colonel Cedric Leighton.

00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:28.027
Colonel Leighton, we're

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:30.930
we've been discussing the issue of the

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.333
the potential refugees

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.901
that could be made in Gaza

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.436
if they do flee.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:37.804
Talk to us about what

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:39.205
evacuation even

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:41.507
looks like in Gaza right now.

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:42.842
I mean,

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:43.710
a million people

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.511
in that part of the territory.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:46.946
Where do they even go?

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:47.413
Yeah, that's

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:48.848
going to be the real question, Avi.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:49.382
And, you know,

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:51.584
let's take a look at the evacuation zone

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.386
as we know it right now,

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:56.189
because when you see the types of things

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.490
that can happen here,

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.492
you've got this area in the north.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:00.360
There are

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.862
about 1.1 million people

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:05.131
that are in this area at this point.

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:06.566
And what's going to happen, Abby,

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.868
is they are supposed to, according to

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.636
what the Israelis have told them,

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:14.006
go down here toward the Rafah crossing

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:16.676
right here, the Egyptian border.

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:18.478
So their ability to do this

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:19.145
kind of thing

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.880
is actually going to be limited

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.548
because they really don't

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:23.983
have a humanitarian corridor

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:25.051
coming through this way.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:25.885
And can you give us a sense

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.420
of the distance here

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.622
or the distances both in space up here

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:31.457
and how far they would need to travel?

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:31.657
Yes.

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:32.191
So basically,

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:35.161
we're talking about 25 to 30 miles down

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:37.230
this way. It's a very small place.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.066
Gaza is about 140 square miles total,

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.334
a total population,

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:42.969
about 2.2 million people.

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.237
So it's pretty dense

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.738
in terms of its population.

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:46.672
And what they're going

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:48.241
to have to do in a case

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:49.175
like this

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:52.211
is not only go through these areas,

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:53.546
but they're no safe zones

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:54.914
in any of these areas.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.550
And when you go through these areas

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.852
which are less densely populated

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:01.587
than the northern area,

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:03.389
there are less services there, less

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.490
there's less of an ability

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.691
to care for people.

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:06.659
And if they don't

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.161
get this crossing opened,

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:09.729
they won't be able to

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.130
really stay in this area

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.331
for a long period of time

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:14.834
because it's going to be a place

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.369
where they don't have living facilities,

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.170
they don't have water,

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.171
they don't have sanitation

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:19.338
or any of those things.

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:20.907
I want to talk now about as what

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:21.407
the build up

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:22.575
that we're seeing

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:25.945
of Israeli troops around Gaza.

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:26.913
As you can see,

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:29.081
it's there basically surrounding Gaza.

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.751
And then just to show our audience here,

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:33.953
these are some pictures of

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.355
just the heavy machinery that is

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:36.989
that is part of

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.424
that build up when you look at this

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.760
as someone with a military eye.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.861
Tell us what you're seeing

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:42.862
and what does it tell us about

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:44.764
what the Israelis are preparing for?

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.466
So this is kind of reminiscent

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.168
of a scene from D-Day back in 1944

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:50.403
when Eisenhower was talking

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:51.370
to his paratroopers

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.239
before they launched that invasion.

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:55.141
This is what units do.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.442
The commanding officer

00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:57.777
will talk to the units.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:58.511
They will go out.

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.646
They will deploy in forward positions.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.582
You see the Merkava tanks coming through

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:04.484
and armored personnel carriers

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:05.485
call the tanks right there.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.385
They're Israeli made.

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:07.153
They've been in service

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:10.156
since 1979 in the Israeli army.

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:11.491
They've got radio equipment,

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.692
they've got

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:15.261
their rifles, they've got ammunition.

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:16.496
They are ready to go.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.397
These people are well-trained.

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:19.365
They're ready to go.

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:22.602
And they will deploy to forward positions

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:26.506
that are right near the Gaza border.

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:28.741
Obviously, this has been

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:29.876
a week now

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:31.811
of really intense bombing in Gaza.

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:33.279
And I just want to give our audience

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.481
a sense here of how this compares

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:38.718
to another previous conflict

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.052
that lasted 50 days,

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.787
almost the same number of

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:45.458
bombs dropped in that time.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.092
And the dust,

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:49.095
the death toll here.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.997
Colonel Leighton,

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:52.365
what can we expect?

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.934
Really, this is 50 days versus six days.

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:56.702
We're almost at the same place.

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:57.570
As we go forward,

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.038
what can we realistically expect

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.172
in terms of the toll

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:01.641
that this will all take?

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:02.174
I'm afraid

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:03.976
it's going to be a very heavy toll

00:09:03.976 --> 00:09:04.977
and this could be

00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:07.446
an exceptionally gruesome war.

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.348
All wars are gruesome, but this one,

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:10.583
because of the close quarters,

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.652
because of the urban combat

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:14.854
that inevitably going to happen

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:15.454
through the narrow

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:16.822
alleyways of Gaza City

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:18.691
and other places like that.

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:19.992
I'm afraid that this death toll

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.894
is going to rise considerably.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:23.262
There are ways to mitigate that.

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:25.498
Israel says it's trying to do that.

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:28.434
The problem is, is that Hamas will use

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:29.502
innocent civilians

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:31.537
as human shields in this scenario.

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:32.972
And that's something that has happened

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.240
in other places in Iraq.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.375
It happened in Afghanistan. It happened.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:37.243
This is the kind of thing

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.077
that we can expect.

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:39.278
And unfortunately,

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:41.347
if this isn't stopped,

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:44.317
we are going to see a situation where

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:45.585
the forces will meet

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:49.322
and there's going to be a major increase

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:50.122
in this death toll.

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:50.656
Yeah, I think we

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.124
we just have to

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:53.059
be clear eyed about what

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:55.194
we are facing in this region

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:55.861
going forward.

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:56.996
It's going to be gruesome.

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:57.964
Unfortunately.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.732
Colonel Leighton, we appreciate you

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:00.833
joining us on all of that.
