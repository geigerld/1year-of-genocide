00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.292
Today, a phone call that

00:00:01.292 --> 00:00:03.211
could alter the course of a war.

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:04.504
The planned phone call

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:05.255
between President

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:06.715
Biden and Israeli Prime

00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:08.383
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:09.843
This will be the first call

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.177
between the two leaders

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.762
since that tragic incident

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:15.056
where seven aid workers were killed

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:18.184
in an Israeli strike in Gaza this week.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:19.227
Top White House

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:20.437
officials are telling CNN

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:24.065
that Biden is both angry and outraged

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:24.816
about it.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:25.650
This morning,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.652
the founder of World Central Kitchen,

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:30.864
the aid workers work for chef Jose Andres

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.366
is accusing Israel of systematically

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.659
his word, targeting

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.578
the aid convoy car by car.

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:37.662
And he is calling

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:41.416
for an independent investigation into it.

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:43.835
This was not just

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:47.505
but like the situation where, oops,

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.133
we dropped the bomb in the wrong place or

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:50.717
or No,

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:51.384
but I know

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.387
is that we were targeted deliberately,

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.890
nonstop until everybody was

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.642
dead in this convoy.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:00.477
CNN's Arlette

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:01.811
Sines is at the White House

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.521
with more for us and Arlette.

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:04.189
Democratic Senator

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.399
Chris Coons is very close to Joe Biden.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.692
He was just on speaking to Sara

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.611
and he said this phone call he expects

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.738
is going to be very important

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.364
in the next step

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:16.326
in the US Israel relationship.

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:16.993
Yeah, Kate.

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:17.827
And President Biden

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:18.578
is expected

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.663
to convey his personal anger

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:22.749
and frustration directly to Israeli

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.667
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.294
as they speak in the coming hours.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:28.755
The the Israeli strike that killed

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.215
these seven aid workers

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:31.549
with World Central Kitchen

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.384
really marks the latest flashpoint

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:34.677
in an increasingly tense

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:37.639
relationship between Biden and Netanyahu.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.182
And many are questioning

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:40.934
whether this moment could serve

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.311
as a turning point in U.S.

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:44.771
support for Israel

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.689
as it conducts his campaign

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.441
to root out Hamas in Gaza.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.484
Now, the president

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:50.944
has expressed his outrage

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:51.694
about the incident.

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:53.655
Frustration has been rising here

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:54.614
at the White House.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:55.740
The president is expected

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.741
to focus on the death

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:57.700
of those aid workers,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.785
while also broadening

00:01:58.785 --> 00:01:59.786
out the conversation,

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.371
trying to discuss ways

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:02.997
to ensure that there are protections

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:04.666
for humanitarian aid workers.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.501
We have sources have told us that U.S.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:07.710
officials have already started

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.212
talking to the Israelis

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.672
about the need to change

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.674
the way that information is transmitted

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.467
when it comes to the locations

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:15.885
of aid workers.

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:17.345
We also anticipate the president

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:18.972
to talk about the ongoing

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.640
hostage and humanitarian

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.891
aid negotiations

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:23.726
to try to get a temporary cease fire,

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:25.061
as well as that operation

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.689
that Israel is expected to wage in Rafah.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.440
Now, ahead of this call,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.817
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.527
spoke with his Israeli counterpart,

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:33.486
Yoav Gallant,

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.488
where a Pentagon spokesperson said

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.031
that he conveyed his outrage

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:38.908
while also saying that this incident

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:40.118
reinforces U.S.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.619
concerns about needing

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:42.912
to protect civilians

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:44.289
in any type of operation

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.291
that Israel conducts in Rafah.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.042
But even as we have seen

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:48.668
this heightened

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.295
rhetoric from the administration

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.130
expressing anger and outrage,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.548
well, we have not seen yet

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.717
is any shift in policy

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.510
when it comes to the U.S.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.970
approach to Israel,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.431
especially when it comes to the U.S.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.267
continuing to provide military support

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.060
to Israel without any conditions.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.187
Officials here at the White House

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.563
said that they are not at that point

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.273
where there is a shift in policy,

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:10.481
though

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.316
a senior administration

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.193
official says that there has been a shift

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.486
in the frustrations from the president.

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:16.988
Now, this all comes as President

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.448
Biden is also facing

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:19.574
significant pressure

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:20.283
here at home

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:21.659
when it comes to his handling

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.577
of this conflict.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.162
He heard that directly from Muslim

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:25.205
community leaders

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.915
here at the White House on Tuesday.

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:28.499
But many are questioning

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.043
whether this exact moment

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.502
could serve as any turning point

00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:33.129
in the administration's strategy.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.172
As of now,

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:35.423
it doesn't seem that they're changing

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.425
any pathway forward

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.469
in the imminent future.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.012
Or plans at the White House.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.514
Thank you so much, our lot, Sara.

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:44.265
All right. Thank you, Kate.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:44.891
CNN chief

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:45.767
International anchor

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.770
Christiane Amanpour is joining us now.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:49.562
Christiane,

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.606
we just heard from Senator Coons,

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:52.899
who says there is a line

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.068
and there should be conditions

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.070
and the president of the United States

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.155
has been very frustrated,

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.907
we know, with Netanyahu and Israel's

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.201
approach in Gaza at this point.

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:04.827
The pressure is really mounting

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:06.871
on Israel from other close allies.

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.457
What are you hearing?

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:10.750
Well, precisely that.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.460
And really in the United States,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.336
you'd have to go back

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:16.172
as far as the first George W. George H.W.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:17.382
Bush administration

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:18.383
when they expressed

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:19.759
public frustration

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.344
and anger over different issues,

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.471
the increasing building of settlements.

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:26.349
And James Baker held out a phone number

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.558
for the State Department to say,

00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:29.435
when you're serious, give us a call.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.603
You have the number.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.355
But what does this actually change,

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:33.398
this mounting pressure,

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.691
As you heard from all that,

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:35.566
it's unlikely

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:36.150
to change

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.235
any shift towards

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.445
sending military aid to Israel.

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:40.863
But that is precisely

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:42.240
what governments around the world,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.783
Israel's allies,

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:44.575
are being asked to do,

00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:47.203
including here in the U.K.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.955
Defense minister, former

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.581
prime minister and Foreign Minister

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:51.916
David Cameron has said

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.084
that he has demanded

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.585
to his Israeli counterpart

00:04:54.585 --> 00:04:56.045
an immediate investigation

00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:56.462
into this

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:58.798
appalling attack on aid workers.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.425
And he said, we want to see that happen

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.843
very, very soon.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:02.844
The problem here

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.721
is that all the allies say

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.140
that Israel has a right to defend itself

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.517
after what happened on October seven,

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.979
but that it must act within the rules

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.272
of the international road

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:16.316
that are international laws

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.233
that include

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.569
not firing on civilian convoys.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:20.653
And let's not forget

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:21.946
this one, like the others,

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.240
were heavily coordinated with Israel.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.700
This is what the U.N.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.826
humanitarian chief

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.078
told me about the World Central Kitchen

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:34.625
assassinations or attacks on Monday.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:35.168
Yes, it's

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.252
a duty of care problem,

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:38.838
but it's also a legal problem.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:41.424
A attacks on humanitarian institutions

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:42.258
and workers

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:45.470
is prohibited under international law.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:46.179
So whether

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:49.432
it's intentional or not, it's a crime.

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:52.518
And we must be very conscious of this

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.311
as I say.

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.062
It's been happening,

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:54.854
as you know, Christiane,

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:59.108
to our colleagues from the outset.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.569
And as you know, hundreds,

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.404
nearly 200 U.N.

00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:04.364
and other aid workers

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.490
have been killed, the vast

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.658
majority of them Palestinians.

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:08.826
Sara.

00:06:08.826 --> 00:06:09.035
You know,

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.453
it strikes me in your conversation

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:11.037
that he said

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.330
whether it's intentional or not,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.040
it is still a crime.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.458
What is the impression

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.919
that Netanyahu and his administration

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.173
is giving to those who are calling for

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.925
for better treatment of civilians?

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.635
What are you hearing?

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.762
Well, look, it's really, really difficult

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:28.429
to understand this.

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:29.347
Even former

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.182
President Trump has told

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:32.517
and you can see it on an Israeli

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:34.060
website, Israel Hayom,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.520
it's a right wing website.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.854
They interviewed him earlier

00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:38.022
and even he said,

00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:39.732
you've got to stop your war.

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:41.192
Yes, you could defend yourself,

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.110
but you've got to stop this.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.653
You're losing your international

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.071
credibility and support.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.448
And we cannot keep seeing these bodies

00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:48.950
piling up in Gaza.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.827
So this is really becoming a memory

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.620
Trump gave Netanyahu

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.621
everything he wanted,

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.580
moving the consulate

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.125
and the embassy to Jerusalem, giving them

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.334
sovereignty over the Golan

00:06:58.334 --> 00:06:59.752
Heights, practically inviting them

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:01.045
to annex the West Bank.

00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:04.006
He was very much in Netanyahu's camp.

00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:06.843
But right now, as we as I've said,

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.219
there's an increasing number

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.554
of allied governments,

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:10.721
allies of Israel,

00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:11.806
who are looking at

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.599
the very serious matter

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.602
of continuing to send the massive weapons

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:19.897
systems and the bombs, 2000 ton bombs

00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:21.274
from the United States

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.775
that owe to time bombs

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:23.526
that are being sent.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.695
And again, here is Jose Andres

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:30.032
on his conversation with President Biden.

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.535
I spoke to President Biden yesterday

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.120
and Biden made this statement,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.790
which seems it's already a harder stand.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.167
But

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.626
it's very complicated to understand

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:42.670
that we are going to be sending

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.130
America is going to be sending his Navy

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.923
on these military

00:07:45.923 --> 00:07:47.467
to do humanitarian work,

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.593
when at the same time

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.720
weapons provided by America,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.931
not not to defend Israel itself

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:57.643
from missile attacks, but used weapons

00:07:57.643 --> 00:07:58.227
that are killing

00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:01.230
civilians in this moment.

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:02.773
And as you can imagine,

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:05.568
if international aid organizations

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:08.821
like the UN, like Jose Andres, stop doing

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:10.698
their vital humanitarian work,

00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:11.949
who is going to do it?

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:13.576
Is Israel going to do it?

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:14.660
That's all that's left.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.245
And we saw the catastrophe

00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:17.663
when they tried that,

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:18.998
you know, freelancing

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.041
a few weeks ago

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.626
and some 118

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.419
people were killed in shootings

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:24.420
and a stampede.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.048
It's a very critical issue right now.

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.007
Christiane Amanpour,

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:28.716
thank you so much

00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:31.010
for all of your reporting, as always.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.719
John.

00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:33.262
As we are standing by for that phone call

00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:33.971
between the president

00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:34.680
and prime minister,

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.683
there already has been one conversation

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.476
between us

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:39.936
and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.646
and his Israeli counterpart.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:42.939
So what took place there

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.357
seen as the torture portrait

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.192
at the Pentagon to torture?

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.778
What did they have to say?

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:49.987
Well, John, it was largely,

00:08:49.987 --> 00:08:50.738
largely a mirror

00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:52.031
image of the conversation

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:54.784
that President Biden had or that

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:55.451
the statement

00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:56.786
that President Biden had issued earlier

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.871
this week that he was expressing outrage

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:00.623
over this W.K. strike.

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:01.415
Secretary Alston

00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:02.625
apparently told the Israeli

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:03.793
defense minister

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.336
that he, too, was outraged

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:06.337
by this attack,

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:08.172
and he urged them to conduct

00:09:08.172 --> 00:09:09.173
a swift, thorough

00:09:09.173 --> 00:09:11.050
and independent investigation

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.218
into this attack.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.052
And importantly,

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:13.844
something that we've heard

00:09:13.844 --> 00:09:14.804
from other administration

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:15.846
officials as well,

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:16.847
they want the results

00:09:16.847 --> 00:09:19.058
of this investigation to be made public

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:20.685
and they want someone

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.896
to be held accountable for this

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.523
tragic mistake,

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:26.774
which is what the Israelis

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:28.276
are characterizing it as.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:29.819
But the administration is really,

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:30.361
at this point

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:31.737
kind of withholding judgment

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:34.240
about whether or not this was deliberate.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.241
And for that reason,

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.826
they are not giving any sense

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:37.535
of whether or not

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:38.286
they're going to shift

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:39.745
their policy towards

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:41.872
Israeli defense and arms sales,

00:09:41.872 --> 00:09:42.999
which have been ongoing,

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:44.834
as we reported earlier this week.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.127
The administration is set to approve

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:49.839
an $18 billion F-15 sale to the Israelis,

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.257
where the jets won't

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.466
necessarily be delivered

00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:53.718
for another 4 to 5 years.

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:54.427
There are questions

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.178
about why the administration,

00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:57.096
while they're expressing

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.264
outrage over this strike,

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.515
while they're expressing outrage over

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:01.309
the fact that Israel does not appear

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:02.018
to be doing enough

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:02.977
to protect civilians,

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:04.812
is engaging in these arms sales

00:10:04.812 --> 00:10:05.855
with the Israelis

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.064
and thereby kind of

00:10:07.064 --> 00:10:08.858
affirming that they view them

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:10.359
as kind of a professional military

00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:11.193
that is capable of

00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:12.820
carrying out these operations

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.113
in a way that is consistent

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:15.156
with how the U.S.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.699
would expect their allies to.

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:17.408
And so

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:19.035
Secretary Austin did reiterate

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.579
that he is angry about this strike.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:22.538
It remains to be seen

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:23.247
whether anything

00:10:23.247 --> 00:10:24.290
is actually going to change

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.416
when it comes to concrete.

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:25.750
U.S.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.376
actions, because at this point,

00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:28.628
it does not seem as though

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.004
the Israelis are necessarily

00:10:30.004 --> 00:10:32.006
listening to what the U.S. is saying.

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:32.548
And we're seeing that

00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:33.424
play out in real time,

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:33.966
of course,

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:35.468
with the operation that they're planning

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.386
in southern Gaza in Rafah.

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:39.847
Yes, indeed, Indeed, that is the case.

00:10:39.847 --> 00:10:42.266
Obviously, a very important day

00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:43.267
as we watch it unfold.

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:44.435
Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon,

00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:45.436
thank you very much.
