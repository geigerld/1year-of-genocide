More than 40,000 Palestinians have now been killed in Gaza, a majority of whom are civilians, and these numbers are from the Palestine Ministry of Health. But they are backed up by the United States, by international organizations. Humanitarian conditions in Gaza have degraded so much that diseases like polio and hepatitis A are now spreading. We have seen countless children be orphaned. mothers lose their children. How much is too much, sir? At what point is it time to end this war? Well, we'll end the war when we achieve our world goals of the making sure that Hamas can't repeat such atrocities. But we're fighting this war in a just war with just means. In fact, with means that no other army has as over form, no other army has done, has taken the precautions that Israel has taken, sometimes at great risk, to make sure that we minimize the number of casualties. You talked about polio. We enable now massive vaccination of polio. We want 90% of the Gaza and the people of Gaza, vaccinated, I think 200, 200,000. 200,000. I think we're vaccinated today. We've put in a million tons of food, a million tons of aid, 700,000 tons of food. That's unheard of. We've taken, because we think that every civilian death is a tragedy for Hamas. Every civilian death is a strategy for us. It's a tragedy that 1.4 million people in Gaza, they moved from the north to the south. You're going to have thousands, 20,000 killed. You're going to have a catastrophe, a humanitarian catastrophe. There have no place to go, no food to eat. Now, report honestly, because here's what happened. They all left. They went to the humanitarian zone, which was two miles away. Let's. On the beach. They have tents. We supplied tents for 150,000 people. The agency supplied the rest, and some of them carried over into that place. We supplied water lines, sewage lines, food. There's more to be done. Medical. So now we know how many people were killed. How many terrorists? Because we counted them. And we just passed 2000 terrorists. Body count of terrorists. The people left. How many civilians died? I asked the commander, the commander of the, of the division that did the Rafah operation and the Philadelphia border. He said, Prime Minister, there are hardly any civilian deaths because everybody left. They heeded our warnings. But he said there were probably two dozen, and most of them occurred two dozen. And most of them occurred when one of our bombs hit, Hamas ammunition depot that was planted inside a residential area. 40 people died. About 20 were terrorists, but 20 were civilians. And he said, that's most of the deaths. That's the lowest ratio of noncombatants to combatants in the history of urban warfare. That's it. because you accused us of something that is outrageous and in fact, the accusations against us outrageously false humanitarian aid, a million trucks of aid, a million tons of aid, 700,000 tons of food, a deliberate starvation policy. You can say anything that doesn't make it true. You repeat a lie over and over and over again. It assumes the cachet of self-evident truth. But it's false. Israel is doing and the Israeli army is doing something that no other army has done in history. And we'll continue to do that. I'm not going to change my policies, humanitarian policies, vaccination policies, combat policies to minimize civilian casualties.
