WHAT INFLUENCE DOES THE UNITED STATES HAVE AS ISRAEL SEEKS TO AVENGE THE SLAUGHTER OF 1200 PEOPLE ON OCTOBER 7TH, AND TO REMOVE HAMAS FROM POWER IN GAZA. OUR FIRST GUEST TONIGHT, JOSH BALL, RESIGN FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT SOON AFTER OCTOBER 7TH, IN PROTEST OF WHAT HE SAID WERE AN SCRUTINIZED U.S. ARMS TRANSFERS TO ISRAEL. IN HIS RESIGNATION LETTER, HE SAID THE ISRAELI RESPONSE AND AMERICAN SUPPORT QUOTE, WILL ONLY LEAD TO MORE WAR AND DEEPER SUFFERING AND FOR BOTH THE ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, AND IS NOT IN THE LONG TERM AMERICAN INTEREST. JOSH PAUL IS JOINING ME NOW, WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME. &gt;&gt; I WAS STRUCK BY WHAT THE U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY SAID. THIS IS A VERY BOLD, MILITARY ASSESSMENT, THAT THIS AMOUNT OF CIVILIAN KILLING IS GOING TO LEAD NOT ONLY TO THIS TRAGEDY THAT THE WORLD IS WITNESSING, BUT A STRATEGIC HE, USE THE WORD, DEFEAT. SO TELL ME, HOW DO YOU ASSESS WHAT HE SAID? &gt;&gt; I THINK HE'S RIGHT, AND I THINK WHAT YOU SEE IS A TENSION BETWEEN THOSE OF US WHO HAVE WORKED IN POLITICAL AND MILITARY FIELDS ON THE GROUND, IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND IN THE DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT IN THE UNIFORM SERVICES, WHO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK. THIS IS NOT GOING TO LEAD TO THE RESULT THAT ISRAEL WANTS, IT IS JUST GOING TO PROLONG THE SUFFERING OF BOTH THE ISRAELI -- FOR ANOTHER GENERATION. AS OPPOSED TO A VERY POLITICAL, IDEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, THAT IS COMING FROM THE POLITICAL LEVEL IN THE U.S. AND IN ISRAEL, AND IN THE UK. THAT THINKS THERE IS A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK. THERE IS NOT, AND THE SUFFERING WE HAVE SEEN ON THE GROUND REALLY REFLECTS THAT. I CAN'T RECALL A TIME IN MY EXPERIENCE, WE HAVE SEEN SUCH A DISCONNECT BETWEEN OUR VALUES AND OUR ACTIONS, OR BETWEEN THE PERSPECTIVES OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, AT THE REALITIES ON THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; CAN I ASK YOU WHERE AND HOW YOU DRAW THAT LINE AND MAKE THAT -- ISRAEL HAS GONE TO WAR AGAINST HAMAS AND GAZA, AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THERE IS BEEN BACKLASH AROUND THE WORLD. WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT THIS IS SO DIFFERENT TO HAVE CAUSED YOU TO RESIGN. &gt;&gt; A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THE SCOPE AND THE SCALE. HERE WE ARE, TWO MONTHS INTO THIS CONFLICT, AND WE HAVE SEEN THREE TIMES MORE CHILDREN DIE, 6000 IN GAZA, THEN IN TWO YEARS OF RUSSIA'S WAR AGAINST UKRAINE. WE HAVE SEEN OVER 50 JOURNALIST KILLED. OVER 100 YUAN AID WORKERS, OVER 200 MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A DOCTOR IN GAZA? &gt;&gt; WE'VE INTERVIEWED A LOT OF THEM, AND IT'S A TERRIBLE SITUATION. &gt;&gt; THE SCALE OF THE LOSS HAS BEEN ASTOUNDING, AND OF COURSE MY ROLE IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT INVOLVES IMPROVING -- GOING TO ISRAEL RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE ENABLING THIS KILLING. &gt;&gt; THIS IS AMERICAN POLICY, IT'S NOT LIKE THESE ARE ROGUE TRANSFERS. THIS IS AMERICAN POLICY, BIPARTISAN, DECADES LONG. ISRAEL IS AMERICA'S STRONGEST ALLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND AMERICA PROVIDES THE MOST AID IN THE WORLD TO ISRAEL, AND OBVIOUSLY TO EGYPT AS WELL, BUT IN GENERAL TO ISRAEL. AGAIN, WHAT IS SO ON SCRUTINIZED ABOUT THIS. WHAT WAS SO DIFFERENT THAT MADE YOU RESIGN PUBLICLY? &gt;&gt; IN ALL THE ARMS TRANSFERS I'VE BEEN PART OF DISCUSSING BEFORE, INCLUDING TO ISRAEL, THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN SPACE FOR DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. YOU CAN RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THESE ARMS ARE GOING TO BE USED. DO WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE LAWS OF WAR, LOTS OF PROPORTIONALITY, ARE GOING TO BE RESPECTED. DO WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE UNITS THAT THESE ARMS MAY BE GOING TO? AND THEIR TRACK RECORDS? WHAT WAS DIFFERENT HERE WAS THAT THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION, THERE IS NO SPACE FOR THAT DISCUSSION, THERE WAS SIMPLY AN APPROACH CENTRALLY THE BARN DOORS ARE OPEN, AND THAT REMAINS THE CASE. THE WALL STARTED -- IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS THAT THE AMERICA HAS TRANSFERRED -- GUIDANCE KITS, AND 45,000 ARTILLERY SHELLS. THE BUNDLES REMAIN OPEN, AND WELL I'M CERTAINLY ENCOURAGED TO HEAR WHAT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS SAID, WHAT SECRETARY AUSTIN HAS SAID, FOR AS LONG AS THOSE BARN DOORS ARE OPEN, I CAN'T REALLY KNOW WHY THOSE ISRAEL WOULD TAKE THOSE WARNINGS SERIOUSLY. &gt;&gt; CAN I READ THE STATE DEPARTMENT RESPONSE YOUR RESIGNATION? BASICALLY HE'S SAYING THAT HE IS DIFFERENT BELIEFS, AND OF COURSE ONE THING THAT IS INTERESTING FOR ALL OF US, IS TO KNOW THAT THERE IS A DISSENT, THERE IS AN OFFICIAL DISTANT CHANNEL IN THE THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO AIR THEIR CONCERNS. THAT WAS HISTORY, FROM THE VIETNAM WAR. THIS IS WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS ABOUT YOU, WITH RESPECT TO THIS SPECIFIC CRITICISM THAT HAS BEEN AIRED, WE'VE MADE VERY CLEAR THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE PROVIDING THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. BUT THE PRESIDENT AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS STATE SPOKEN TO THIS VERY CLEARLY THAT WE EXPECT ISRAEL TO ABIDE BY ALL INTERNATIONAL LAW, AS THEY DEFEND THEMSELVES. ISRAEL SAYS IT'S DOING THAT TO THE BEST OF ITS ABILITY. &gt;&gt; I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS THE LARGER, MORE POWERFUL PARTNER IN THIS RELATIONSHIP, TO GIVE ADVICE. TO GIVE GUIDANCE. TO STEP IN WHEN THINGS ARE NOT GOING RIGHT. WHEN WE SAY THAT WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO, FOR THEIR COMMITMENT, TO DEFEND ISRAEL, TO SUPPORT ISRAELI SECURITY, AND THEN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND SAY, IS THAT WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING? IS ISRAEL MORE SECURE, AS A RESULT OF OUR ASSISTANCE? OR HAS OUR MILITARY ASSISTANCE ENABLED ISRAEL TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THE EXPANSION OF SETTLEMENTS IN THE WEST BANK? TO CONTINUE THE SIEGE OF GAZA? AND TO TAKE STEPS THAT ULTIMATELY UNDERMINE ITS OWN SECURITY, RATHER THAN LEADING TO A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE? &gt;&gt; AS YOU KNOW, THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES, AND WHETHER IT SAYS IT PUBLICLY OR BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET -- FOR INSTANCE, ISN'T THERE IS NO SECRET THAT THERE IS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN BIDEN AND NETANYAHU BEFORE THIS. OVER THE ATTEMPTED, ESSENTIALLY, THESE ARE MY WORDS, OF THE OVERTHROW OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, IN THE JUDICIAL REFORM. BIDEN DIDN'T EVEN INVITE HIM TO THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S A TOTAL RARITY. HOWEVER, THEY BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER TO AFFECT ISRAELI POLICIES, THE LIKE OF WHICH WE'RE TALKING, TO AFFECT THE POLICY AND MAKE IT MORE TOWARDS THE PEACE PROCESS, THEY HAVE TO EMBRACE ISRAEL, DEFEND ISRAEL, SUPPORT ISRAEL. IN ORDER TO GET THE TRUST OF THE ISRAELI PEOPLE. SO THE THEY CAN THEN SPEAK CLEARLY TO THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT. AND YOU SAW UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THE PEOPLE OF ADMINISTER ISRAEL DIDN'T SUPPORT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THEY THOUGHT OBAMA DIDN'T SUPPORT THEM. &gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL I WOULD ASK FOR THAT EMBRACE GETS THE UNITED STATES. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW, IT'S ALL NOT ONLY A DISASTER IN GAZA, BUT IT'S A FOREIGN POLICY DISASTER FOR THE UNITED STATES, ACROSS THE ARAB WORLD, AND THANK FRANKLY ACROSS THE GLOBAL SOUTH. I THINK WE SEEM LIKE HYPOCRITES WHEN WE CRITICIZE RUSSIA FOR HUMAN RIGHTS EXCUSES, BUT FAILED TO DO IT WITH ISRAEL. I THINK OUR EMBRACE, WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THAT EMBRACE, BECAUSE IT DRAWS US IN AS WELL. SECONDLY, OF COURSE, THE ANSWER IS THAT WE DO HAVE LEVERAGE THAT WE CAN USE WITHIN THAT EMBRACE. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT AMERICA SHOULD NOT REMAIN CLOSE WITH ISRAEL. I'M SUGGESTING SIMPLY THAT, AS WE ARE THE PROVIDER OF ARMS, AS WE ARE THE PROVIDER OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER FUNDED ASSISTANCE EVERY YEAR, TO WHAT IS ACTUALLY A WEALTHY COUNTRY, WE DO HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF LEVERAGE, AND OF COURSE WE PROVIDE ISRAEL WITH THE SECURITY AND DIPLOMATIC BACK UP ACROSS THE REGION THAT HAS ENABLED ITS INTEGRATION. WE HAVE A LOT OF LEVERAGE HERE, TO SET ISRAEL ON A BETTER PATH, AND TO END THIS SENSELESS KILLING GAZA. WE ARE NOT USING IT. &gt;&gt; HOW DOES WHAT HAPPENED ON OCTOBER 7TH AND ISRAEL, WAS BARBARIC. IT WAS SAVAGE. WE'VE HEARD THE STORIES OF IN GANG, OF CHILDREN BEING SHOT TO DEATH IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS, WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH MORE THAN 250 PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TAKEN HOSTAGE, INCLUDING BABIES. HOW DOES A NATION GET -- I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT WHERE IT IS. BEYOND IT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT WORD IS. HOW DOES IT GET TO FEEL THAT IT'S BEING SUPPORTED, AND THEN IT THEN DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WHAT'S -- GAZA, GOING ON RIGHT NOW. THE ELDERS, WHICH IS A GROUP OF FORMER PRESIDENTS, PRIME MINISTERS, AND EVEN OFFICIALS, HAVE ALSO QUESTIONED NOW, THEY JUST PUT OUT A STATEMENT QUESTIONING ARMS TRANSFERS, AND TALKING ABOUT THE INHUMANITY THAT HAPPENED IN GAZA, THAT IS RISING TO AN INTOLERABLE LEVEL. &gt;&gt; I THINK WHAT HAPPENED ON OCTOBER 7TH WAS AN ABSOLUTE ATROCITY, IT WAS 1000 ATROCITIES. I THINK AT THE SAME TIME, WE CONDEMN THOSE ATROCITIES, WE HAVE TO CONDEMN THE ATROCITIES THAT HAPPENED EVERY DAY TO PALESTINIANS IN THE WEST BANK. YOU MENTIONED SEXUAL VIOLENCE. I WAS PART OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS VETTING PROCESS FOR ARMS GOING TO ISRAEL, AND A CHARITY CALLED DEFENSIVE CHILDREN INTERNATIONAL PALESTINE TO OUR ATTENTION AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO THE SEXUAL ASSAULT, THE OF A 13 YEAR OLD BOY THAT OCCURRED IN AN ISRAELI PRISON, IN JERUSALEM. WE EXAMINED THESE ALLEGATIONS, WE BELIEVE THEY WERE CREDIBLE, WE PUT THEM TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL, AND YOU DON'T HAPPEN THE NEXT DAY? THE IDF WENT INTO THE D.C. IP OFFICES, AND REMOVED ALL THEIR COMPUTERS, AND DECLARED THEM A TERRORIST ENTITY. I THINK IT'S VITAL THAT ATROCITIES NOT HAPPEN TO ANYONE, NOT SEXUAL ATROCITIES, VIOLATIONS, NOT ANY KIND OF GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. WE ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS SO MUCH DEHUMANIZATION, WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT SEEN FOR THE VALUE THAT THEY HAVE. AND I THINK THAT'S TRUE WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE WHO ATTACKED ON THEIR KIBBUTZ, AND THOSE WHO ARE ATTACKED IN THEIR HOMES IN GAZA. , OR IN THE WEST BANK. WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS TO CENTER THE HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE AT THE CORE, AND WHO ARE SUFFERING SO MUCH IN THIS COMPLEX. &gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE THAT, IN ORDER TO HAVE SOME KIND OF PEACEFUL RESOLUTION, SO THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN, THAT HAMAS HAS TO BE REMOVED FROM POWER? &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU NEUTRALIZE HAMAS? THE ANSWER IS, THROUGH A LASTING POLITICAL SETTLEMENT THAT PROVIDES A PALESTINIAN STATE. NOT A PROCESS THAT PROMISES ONE, HOLDS THE PROMISE, AND NEVER GETS TO IT. YOU NEUTRALIZE HAMAS BY SHOWING THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE THAT IF THEY WANT TO SUCCEED, IF THEY WANT TO SUCCEED THE ROUTE IS THERE FOR THEM TO DO SO THROUGH A POLITICAL PROCESS, RATHER THAN THROUGH VIOLENT RESISTANCE. UNTIL WE HAVE THAT PROCESS IN PLACE, YOU CANNOT DEFEAT THE PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE.
