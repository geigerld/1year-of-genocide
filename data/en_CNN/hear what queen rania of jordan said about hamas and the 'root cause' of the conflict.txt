Despite increasing calls for a cease fire in Gaza,  remains defiant against those calls until Hamas releases all hostages. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the rejection, saying it would only give Hamas more ti to regroup and attack Israel aga But he did reiterate today on a surprise visit in Baghdad that he is still pursuing a humanitarian pause. Blinken, that is the queen of Jordan, says a stance against a  fire is ill advised and will not bring peace to the  CNN's Becky Anderson is in Doha, Qatar, and spoke with Queen Rani earlier today. Fred, we've seen consistent and united calls for a cease fire across this region, including from Jordan's Queen Ra Israelis flatly rejected those c And when Arab leaders met with Antony Blinken in Amman on  the US secretary of state reaffi the U.S. position that a ceasefire will only enable Hamas to commit more attacks like the one on October the seve Well, Queen Rania said that position was short sighted if you manage to eliminate all o What next? The root cause of this conflict is an illegal occupation. It is routine human rights abuse illegal settlements, a disregard resolutions and international la If we do not address these root  then you can kill the combatants but you cannot kill the cause. She went on to say that the death of civilians will only further the cause of Hamas and not bring peace to Israel. But Israel has insisted that it is doing its best to protect civilians and blames Hamas for using them as human shields.

They are not the target audience The rest of the world is. It is Israel's attempt to try to legitimize their actions. And when it comes to human shiel I think we need to defer to international law. Of course, the use of human shields is crim even if one side use it puts a civilian in harm's way that civilian is still entitled to full protection under international humanitarian That is the global standard. And no nation is exempt in a place like Jabalya, which is one of the most crowded corners of Gaza. Gaza being one of the most dense populated spots on Earth. Civilian death is not incidental It is not accidental. It is a foregone conclusion. And that makes it a war crime. Jabalya is the refugee camp in Gaza where civilians have been sheltering in U.N. schools. It's been hit on multiple occasions, including this weekend. And at the end of the conversati Queen Rania had a really poignant message for those standing behind Israel She said that if you are an ally to Israel, you need to give them the uncomfortable truth, that they have crossed the line that is, Queen Rania is position And it really speaks to the frus that you hear across this part of the world, the Arab world that we have been reporting on n for weeks Fred. Becky Anderson, thank you so much, in Doha.
