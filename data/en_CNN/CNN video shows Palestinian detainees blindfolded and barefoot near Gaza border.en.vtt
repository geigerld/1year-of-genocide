00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.334
A CNN team witnessed

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:02.769
Israeli soldiers

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:05.238
with Palestinian detainees

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.674
who were blindfolded and barefoo

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.075
UN human rights officials

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.577
have previously urged Israel

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:11.778
to end what they called

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.813
the mistreatment of Palestinians

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.849
which included the use of blindf

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.616
CNN's Jeremy

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.052
Diamond has this reporting for u

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.620
and joins us now live.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.891
Jeremy, what did you learn?

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:25.658
Well, Fred,

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:26.192
my team and I

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.394
were in southern Israel today

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.862
near the border with Gaza,

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.196
when suddenly we spotted

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.831
more than two dozen men,

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.166
some of them kneeling,

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.001
some of them sitting on the grou

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.136
with Israeli soldiers

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.170
standing around them.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.872
We now know that these men

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.440
were Palestinians detained

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.675
by the Israeli military in Gaza

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:43.810
and brought to Israel

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.245
for further questioning.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.180
Now, if you look at the video he

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.182
that we have, these men were bli

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:50.350
they were barefoot.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.584
And keep in mind

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:54.821
that it was about 50 degrees Fah

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:55.755
during this day.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:56.856
And all they're wearing

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:59.759
are these disposable white cover

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:01.728
Their hands are tied behind thei

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.563
And you can see that many of the

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.432
are clearly physically exhausted

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.067
their heads kind of nodding

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.402
down, bobbing, swaying.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.171
One man was lying on the ground

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:11.938
before an Israeli

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:13.373
soldier comes to rouse him,

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.008
propping him back up

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.377
so that he can be sitting on the

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.578
Now, the Israeli military

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.779
told us this in a statement

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:20.647
saying, quote,

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:21.081
These are

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:21.915
the individuals

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:22.382
shown on

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:23.683
camera are suspected

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.185
of terrorist activity

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.519
and were arrested in Gaza

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.021
and transferred to Israel

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.589
for further interrogation.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:30.857
Relevant suspects

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.525
are taken for further questionin

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:33.393
within Israel.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.894
Individuals who are found

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.229
not to be taking part

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.530
in terrorist activities

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.432
are released back into Gaza

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.101
as soon as possible.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.269
Now, they also addressed the con

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.672
in which we found these detainee

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:46.639
talking about the fact

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:47.440
that they were wearing

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.675
these white coveralls

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.510
because they had been stripped,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.344
their clothing

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:52.612
searched to ensure

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:53.480
that they were not carrying

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.215
weapons or explosives.

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:55.782
And they said that

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.417
they would be given clothing

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.251
once they arrived

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.686
at that detention facility.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:00.820
They also said that

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.288
when we came across them

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:02.989
that they were about

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.358
to be put on a heated bus

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:06.559
in order to be taken

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:07.827
to that detention facility.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:09.162
We weren't able to see

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:10.730
exactly how long these men

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.832
were actually on the ground ther

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:13.166
And that's

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:14.701
because an Israeli soldier

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.636
came to us and demanded

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.338
that we leave the premises

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:19.939
once he saw us filming.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.342
Now, as it relates to Israel's

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.810
the Israeli military's claims he

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.445
that these are terror suspects.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.514
It's important to note that we h

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:28.615
while this is the first time

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:29.549
that we have been able

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.685
to unilaterally directly documen

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.020
these detentions,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.488
there have been a lot of videos

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.123
of Palestinian men

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:38.458
and boys in Gaza

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.293
detained by the Israeli military

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:41.461
and in many cases,

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.062
they have proven to be civilians

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:44.030
They have been identified

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.365
by their friends or relatives

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.066
in videos as civilians.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.134
We also interviewed

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:50.103
ten Palestinian men and boys

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.271
back in December

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.139
who said that they were arrested

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.008
and detained by the Israeli mili

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.142
for five days

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:57.277
without charge

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.012
before being ultimately released

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.680
when they were released.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.082
Those men and boys had swollen

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.250
wrists, bruises

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.252
on their wrists, in some cases

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:06.920
from the fact

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.021
that their hands were tied

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:08.922
behind their backs

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.191
for the duration of that detenti

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.059
Now, the Israeli military, for i

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.029
insists that it proceeds with

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.363
international law

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.899
in all of these cases Fred.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.834
And then, Jeremy, separately,

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.670
more countries are pausing

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.072
funding for the United Nations

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:28.441
relief agencies operating in Gaz

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:31.244
The IDF said today that

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:32.779
those facilities were used

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.714
for terrorist purposes.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:38.284
What do you know about that?

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:39.319
Yeah, that's right.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.087
The United Kingdom is now also j

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:41.955
the United States

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:44.958
in temporarily pausing funding t

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.759
which is the main agency

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.795
responsible for Palestinian refu

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.662
But they have been playing,

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:51.397
of course, a critical role in Ga

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.232
right now,

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.199
providing shelter,

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.601
providing food

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.703
and other humanitarian assistanc

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:57.570
That is so desperately

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.771
needed at this moment.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.205
But, of course,

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:01.407
this all comes after these bombs

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:02.742
allegations yesterday

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:07.146
that 12 UNWRA staffers were invo

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:09.749
in the October seven terrorist a

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.050
carried out by Hamas.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.752
That's according to intelligence

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:13.920
that Israel shared

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.421
not only with the United States,

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.457
but also with UNWRA directly.

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.225
And following that information,

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:22.061
UNWRA went on to fire

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.596
some of those staffers.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.298
We don't know exactly how many, 

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:26.399
they did say

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.133
that they fired

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.969
multiple staffers, in part

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.070
because they want to ensure

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.372
that humanitarian assistance

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:34.474
can continue to flow into Gaza.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.175
UNWRA, for its part, has pledged

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:38.311
a full investigation into this m

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.046
and has vowed to hold any of tho

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:41.748
responsible accountable for this

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:42.181
But today,

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.417
we're also getting reaction from

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:45.351
which is condemning

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:49.222
Israel's threats against that UN

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.156
Israel has said

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:51.858
that they would like to end

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:53.726
UNRWA's role in Gaza altogether

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:54.627
and is calling

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:55.628
on countries to end

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.630
funding to that agency Fred.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.365
All right, Jeremy Diamond,

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.901
thank you so much for your repor

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:02.235
All right.

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:03.136
In Gaza,

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.138
the Palestine Red Crescent

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.440
Society is appealing for protect

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.542
for the Al Amal Hospital in Hon.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:10.677
Yunis in Gaza.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:11.811
The aid agency says

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.446
Israeli bombing in the area

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:15.481
has endangered its medical staff

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.583
and the 7000 people who are

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:18.918
taking shelter there.

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:20.253
Separately, at least nine

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:21.354
people were killed

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:23.323
and another 75 injured this week

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.892
when Israeli tank fire hit the U

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:27.694
shelter that was harboring

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:28.861
hundreds of people.

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.363
That's according to the UN.

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:32.031
Streams of Palestinians

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:33.866
fled the area in southern Gaza

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:35.535
following the attack.

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:37.103
The Israeli military said

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:39.072
it is looking into the incident

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:41.941
and said it wasn't the result of

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:45.445
by Israeli forces.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.714
I want to bring in Jayda McKenna

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:50.983
She is the CEO of Mercy Corps.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:51.884
So good to see you.

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.853
So there's an aid organization

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.455
that has been working in Gaza

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.990
and the West Bank for more than 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.293
What what have your aid workers

00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:02.395
been telling you about the attac

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:05.465
shelter and the aftermath?

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.133
You know, increasingly,

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:08.468
Palestinians have been moved

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:11.371
into smaller and smaller spaces.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.605
And for this to happen,

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:13.773
it's just another example

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.408
where there are very few places 

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:16.943
physically to be.

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:17.710
And to see them

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.479
continually getting bombed.

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.114
It just escalates this feeling

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:22.448
that nowhere is safe

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:23.449
and the anxiety

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.351
of the hardship of living amidst

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.286
the worst situation.

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:28.354
After the attack,

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:30.690
you reiterated that Gazans are t

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.891
They have nowhere to go.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.092
And the same applies

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:35.495
to some of your aid workers.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:38.531
What are they doing to try to st

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:39.332
And how are you able

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:41.801
to communicate with people?

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:44.270
So we sent some of them have,

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.138
you know, different SIM

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.239
cards from other countries

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:46.839
to get around

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.208
telecoms plans, because the Isra

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:50.910
I mean, Israel has shut down

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.079
telecommunications for four week

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.714
or days at a time at times.

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:55.081
You know,

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.816
they talk about spending a lot o

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:58.651
each day looking for food.

00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:00.453
They talk about spreading over

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:02.054
safe shelter.

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:03.189
They try to get word

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:05.458
about their relatives and others

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:08.127
And they are also just complaini

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:09.562
They're also starting to get sic

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:10.596
I have one staff member

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:12.365
who said everyone in her family

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:14.033
has either a skin infection

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:15.902
or some other kind of infection.

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:18.337
So this prolonged period

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:19.939
of harsh winter weather

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.975
with no safe shelter, not enough

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:23.876
not enough food,

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:25.545
it's taking its toll on people

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:27.847
in many different dimensions.

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:28.981
You are among many

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:29.682
who have called for

00:07:29.682 --> 00:07:31.818
an immediate cease fire,

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:33.119
something you've been demanding

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:36.122
for some time now.

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:38.391
Do you feel like your plea

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:43.062
and that of many is even being h

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:46.499
Or do you believe that at some p

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:47.800
there will be a cease fire

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.135
if it doesn't haven't happened

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:52.371
more immediately?

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.639
It's very disheartening.

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.575
And, you know, at this point,

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:57.343
all all 2 million

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:58.978
people of Gaza are in need of

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.513
humanitarian aid

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:02.215
to launch a response

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:03.983
and to serve that many people.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.251
That is something outside

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:07.320
of the purview of aid organizati

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.323
There is no way for us to do tha

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.059
in the absence of a total cease 

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:14.827
People don't know where to go fo

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.462
Our staff will be at risk

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:18.030
and it will be chaotic.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.632
So it's really disheartening

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:20.433
that our pleas for

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:22.101
this have been unheard

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:24.036
because the longer this goes on,

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:24.837
the more

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:25.371
that is

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:28.374
an absolute precondition for any

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:28.941
And you say

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:30.543
one of the things that hampers

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:32.945
your organization is a lack of a

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:34.380
and a lack of access points,

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.650
you know, for for Gaza aid.

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:38.317
Can you kind of

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:39.151
paint a picture

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:41.521
for people who still have a hard

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.922
envisioning,

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:45.825
you know, what these obstacles a

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:48.995
and in what ways can aid

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:52.932
be rendered rendered?

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:54.133
So just to start with,

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:56.102
getting supplies in on a normal

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:57.537
Gaza was always dependent

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.404
on those crossings

00:08:58.404 --> 00:09:00.473
for all of their commercial good

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:01.240
and everything else.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.308
On a normal day,

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:03.376
500 trucks,

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.777
including like regular

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:05.478
grocery store

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:08.180
restocking, would go through the

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.849
to go into Gaza every day.

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:11.517
At this point, we're averaging

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:15.054
about 130 trucks a day, just of 

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:17.356
not of any commercial things.

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:18.724
There are hundreds of trucks

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:20.626
lined up at the Egyptian border.

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:22.094
Some items have been

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.496
indiscriminately banned

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:24.297
from those trucks.

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:25.698
So sleeping

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:26.866
bags were rejected

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:28.868
for having metal zippers.

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:29.835
Tents were respected

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:32.405
for were rejected for having met

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.041
So a truck gets the inspection s

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:36.742
something gets disqualified,

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:37.643
and then they have to go

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:38.110
all the way

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.680
to the back of the line on top o

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.280
where are we

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.815
as aid workers to tell people

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:45.051
to go to collect aid?

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:46.052
Earlier in this segment,

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:47.286
we talked about a U.N.

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:48.821
shelter getting bombed.

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:50.523
You have a hospital getting bomb

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:51.857
Where do we feel comfortable

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:53.459
telling people that they can go

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.828
and be safe to get these supplie

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.396
So people are so desperate,

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:58.331
they're even mobbing

00:09:58.331 --> 00:09:59.832
the trucks that are coming in.

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:02.001
But we just have no visibility

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:03.970
to how we safely transport

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:04.737
because areas

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:06.272
that should have been deconflict

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.641
continue to be bombed.

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:10.009
And then what about

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:13.512
medical care?

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.881
So this is you know, at this poi

00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:16.382
the U.N.

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:17.984
is warning that a warning

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:19.652
that a famine could be coming.

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:20.453
But at this point,

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.521
your people are so depleted

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:24.690
of food and resources

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:25.992
and no medical care

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:27.059
that they're you're starting

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:27.827
to see people dying

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:28.928
of secondary things

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:31.931
like diarrheal diseases, infecti

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.667
and and with the lack of medical

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:36.168
or medical supplies.

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:37.036
They are hopeless.

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:38.938
Very people are going to die

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:40.773
from very simple infections

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:41.674
that could have been handled

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:43.376
with antibiotics.

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:44.010
Terrible.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.512
All right, Jim McKenna,

00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:47.480
thank you so much.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.547
And I know you

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:50.216
and so many

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:51.317
non-government agencies

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.818
are working so hard to try to re

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.053
whatever care

00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:55.054
and assistance you can,

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:56.856
and it is an uphill battle.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:57.957
Thank you so much for your time.
