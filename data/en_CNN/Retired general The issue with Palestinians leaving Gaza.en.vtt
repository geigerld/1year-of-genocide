00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.567
Hundreds of

00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:02.035
thousands of reservists

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.503
are now gathering at the border

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:04.437
with Gaza

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.306
six days after the Hamas

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.741
terror attacks on Israel.

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:08.375
The White House now

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:11.378
says 27 Americans were killed.

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:14.381
14 remain unaccounted for.

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.249
Joining us now to discuss is retired U.S.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.284
Army Brigadier General Peter Zwack.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:18.952
General Zwack

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.587
thank you so much for being with us.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:21.888
The White House has made it

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:23.423
clear that recovering Americans

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:24.624
being held hostage

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:27.527
by Hamas is a key priority.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:31.631
How do you see that playing out?

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.500
Well, it's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.801
it's it's

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.437
it's extraordinarily complicated

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:40.974
because it's likely that

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.710
that most of those Americans

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.878
or a percentage of them

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:48.114
are also Israeli citizens

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.216
and they're intermingled

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.152
with the other hostages

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.387
from a number of countries.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.122
So

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:59.492
my instinct is that we need to

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.862
fall in and support the Israelis

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:03.696
while they

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.065
do the lead effort

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.068
to work those hostages out.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.403
I don't think that

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.105
it's right for a negotiator.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.039
And they can try.

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.909
But after what Hamas has done,

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:16.810
I don't think anybody's

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.044
in the mood for that.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.245
But the problem is,

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.014
is that what will happen

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:22.649
if Hamas,

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.751
as they've shown extraordinary,

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.019
ruthless already.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:26.586
They're already

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:30.457
so deep into the into this that,

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.325
you know, they can perpetuate it.

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.827
What do they do, for example,

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:35.862
to start pulling hostages out

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:37.197
and shooting them

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.299
if they're not getting their demands met?

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.333
And at that point, at

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:44.137
what point do you go in with major forces

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:48.041
or Israeli special operations or combined

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.008
special ops?

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:49.676
I don't know.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.112
It's devilishly complicated.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.147
I believe there's a lot of midnight oil

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:57.283
being burned in capitals.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:00.386
And but what this does do is it

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:01.521
it just continues

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.290
to show the depravity of Hamas.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.127
And I think a key angle is to try to,

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.795
as much as possible,

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:12.899
separate Hamas in Gaza from the

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.534
Palestinian civilians,

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.803
that they're caught in the middle of this

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.138
and are also hostage

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.240
to this awful situation.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.142
I want to expand on that point.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.210
General, is there any potential

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.512
for humanitarian

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:28.214
corridors, ways for those civilians

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:30.216
to get out of harm's way?

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.852
What would your advice be?

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.754
Well, my advice would be

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:38.091
and I'm so far away from this, would be

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.292
you're all you've got.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.093
You know,

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.061
I know we're talking to the Egyptians

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.465
and other nations all.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:48.067
There would be a hard mission as well,

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:50.637
because how do you manage the flow?

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:53.072
There will be also a major effort to make

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:56.142
sure that that

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.945
the any any type of outflow.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:02.215
Where do the refugees go?

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.816
Egypt,

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.452
I don't think is ready to take on

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.855
thousands or hundreds of thousands

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:12.091
of of displaced persons.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:15.261
This is really hard.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:18.998
And I know in the whole this discussion

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:20.667
about sending food

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.002
and aid up through those corridors

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:25.104
makes eminent sense.

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:25.905
But do they?

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:29.175
But does it get to the Palestinians

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:31.144
who desperately needed in

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:34.781
in the in the city, or does it go into

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:38.151
feed to feed the Hamas and and continue?

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:40.220
I'll make one other point about Hamas.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.487
How how ruthless

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:42.422
and how they purport

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:44.390
to be supporting the Palestinian,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.959
the fact that even now

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.596
they're firing rockets out of built up

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:52.398
hell out of built up Gaza shows

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:54.400
they have no disregard.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.767
They have

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:57.437
they have total disregard for the

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:59.739
for the Palestinian citizens

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.941
who they are using for cover.

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:03.042
And that should be,

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:03.810
I don't know, through

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.445
leaflets or narrative,

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.780
get out to the populations

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.717
who to that Palestinian population.

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:12.185
That is key in all of this.

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:14.821
Million a couple million of them.

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:16.656
Brigadier General Peter Zwack,

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:17.824
very much appreciate your time, sir.

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.592
Thanks for joining us.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:20.426
Thank you for having me.
