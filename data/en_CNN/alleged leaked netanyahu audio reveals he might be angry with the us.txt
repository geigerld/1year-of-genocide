During a testy meeting with hostage families Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to have strained his one regional relation ship with Qatar that matters most to those very families moving. You don't hear me thinking Qatar, because Qatar is essentially no different from the U.N. or the Red Cross. And in some ways, even more problematic. They have leverage because they're financing them. These comments caught off mic, triggered a rapid and barb diplomatic put down from Qatari officials who helped negotiate the release of almost 100 Israeli hostages in November, saying in a tweet, We are appalled by the alleged remarks attributed to the Israeli prime minister. If validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives, but are not surprising. Just days earlier, Qatar had been talking up relations with Israel and the pretense for Hamas to release more hostages. We are engaging in serious discussions with both sides. We have presented ideas to both sides. We are getting a constant stream of replies from both sides. Qatar's frustration now seems personal, with Netanyahu. Qatar concluding their criticism with a view increasingly suspected by some Israelis. Netanyahu wants to keep the war going, The Israeli prime minister would only be obstructing and undermining the mediation process. For reasons that appear to serve his political career, hostage, families who were in the meeting with the prime minister released a terse statement appearing to blame Netanyahu for the leak. Although he denies it, the fact that the censorship was given permission to publish this audio recording is serious and indicates a loss of judgment. This leaked audio also suggests he may be trying to draw the White House into confrontation. I was very angry recently and I didn't hide it from the Americans that they renewed the contract on the military base they have with Qatar. President Biden has an openly spoken to the tensions. But this week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticizing Israel for taking Gaza and territory to create a security buffer. We've been very clear about maintaining, in effect, the the territorial integrity. And to that point, has Qatar actually decided to possibly pull out of the mediation talks? There's absolutely no indication that they're going to do that. Indeed. CIA Chief Bill Burns is on his way to meetings with his Israeli counterpart, Egyptian officials. And, yes, Qatari officials as well. And that is all about trying to get those remaining hostages released Jake. Nic Robertson in Tel Aviv for us, thank you so much.
