I WANT TO GO BACK TO NIC  ROBERTSON, WHO IS THERE ON THE  GROUND IN ISRAEL. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING RIGHT NOW? &gt;&gt; Reporter: I JUST TOLD YOU  WHEN WE WERE SPEAKING A COUPLE  MINUTES AGO THERE WAS TWO  MINUTES OF SILENCE. IT'S NOT SILENT ANYMORE. THE GUNS HAVE PICKED UP AGAIN. YOU'RE HERG THE FIGHTER JETS  AND, PLOEGSS. SOME OF THEM HEAVY BEHIND US. WE ALSO JUST SAW A FLASH ON THE  SKYLINE. DIDN'T HEAR AN EDUCATION PLOEX  INDICATING IT COULD BE SOME  DISTANCE AWAY. BUT IF WE HAD A SENSE A FEW  MINUTES AGO THE BOMBARDMENT OF  EARLIER MIGHT HAVE BEEN EASING  OFF, I THINK THE LAST TWO  MINUTES HERE, WHILE YOU HAVE  BEEN TALKING TO THE CONGRESSMAN, IT'S REALLY PICKED UP AND  INTENSIFIED. I THINK IT WILL DO THIS FOR SOME TIME. THE FLUCTUATION, I CAN HEAR  ARTILLERY FIRING FROM THIS  DIRECTION. POSSIBLY WOL HEAR THE IMPACTS  FROM GAZA. SOME OF THE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN  EXCEPTIONALLY LOUD AND STRONG. YOU CAN FEEL THEM SHAKING THE  GROUND HERE. NOT CLEAR PRECISELY WHAT THE  TARGETS ARE OTHER THAN HAMAS AND ITS INFRASTRUCTURE. NOT CHEER LOW THE REST WILL ROLL OUT. BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND FEELING IS QUANTIFY BLISS A STEP UP FROM PREVIOUS NIGHTS. &gt;&gt; AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE SOMETHING THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT  EARLIER AND THAT ALEX MARQUARDT  HAS BEEN REPORTING ON AND BECKY  ANDERSON AS WELL. WHICH IS SOURCES SAYING THERE  WERE SIGNIFICANT DISCUSSIONS  ABOUT HOSTAGES. MORE THAN 200 HOSTAGES BEING  HELD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE  BORDER FROM WHERE YOU ARE, AND  THE QUESTION THAT YOU POSED, AS  YOU'RE SEEING THE INCREASE IN  ACTION RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES,  HOW THAT COULD IMPACT THE  ABILITY TO GET THE HOSTAGES OUT  AND WHETHER THERE'S ANY  CONNECTION AT THIS POINT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE DIPLOMACY  AROUND THE TABLE IS IN ESSENCE  HOSTAGES FOR HUMANITARIAN AID. A HUMANITARIAN PAUSE OR HAMAS  HAS SDD FOR A FIFTH-DAY  CEASE-FIRE. THEY ARE NOT ABOUT TO HAVE A  THERE'S BEEN INCREASING PRESSURE AND USING WITH LANGUAGE FROM  DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE EUROPEAN UNION PUTING YOU'RE PROBABLY SEEING SOME OF THE  FLSHS BEHIND ME OF SOME OF THE  STRIKES UNDERWAY. WE'RE HEARING THE FIGHTER JET. THAT BLAST THAT YOU HEARD THERE, I'M ASSUMING YOU COULD HEAR IT,  WAS THE SORT OF THING WE HAVE  JUST BEEN HEARING REPEATED,  REPEATED, REPEATED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. THAT SEEMS TO HAVE A MISSILE  FROM A FIGHT JET. BUT THE IDEA THAT HAMAS WAS  TALKING ABOUT A CEASE-FIRE, THE  IDEA THAT THE HOSTAGE RELEASE  COULD COME AS PART OF A DEAL  WHERE THERE COB A THIS IS ALL  DIPLOMACY, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER  PART OF THE EQUATION AND THAT'S  THE MILITARY PART. BOTH SIDES GO TOE TO TOE, MAKE  THEIR DEMANDS, WAIT FOR THE  OTHER SIDE TO TAKE CONCESSION  ISES. THESE ARE CONCESSIONS, AS WE SAY, OVER FUEL INTO GAZA OR  HUMANITARIAN AID. BUT THERE ARE ALSO THE TWO SIDES ARE GOING TOE TO TOE IN MILITARY TERMS WAITING FOR THE OTHERS TO  BACK DOWN. IT WAS ONLY A FEW HOURS THEY  WERE FIRING ROCKETS INTO TEL  AVIV THAT HIT AN APARTMENT  THERE. THE IDF CLEARLY STEPPING UP ITS  ACTION IN THIS PART OF GAZA  TONIGHT. SO THESE ARE ALL WAYS OF  PRESSURING THE OTHER SIDE AND  WHERE THE TALKS NOW STAND, AS  THERE IS NOT A CLEAR PAUSE IN  THE MILITARY OFFENSE. THE REVERSE WOULD SAY AN A  ESCALATION. IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT A WEEK  AGO TODAY, FRIDAY LAST WEEK,  THERE WAS INTENSE DID YOU WANT  SIT   DIPLOMACY BEHIND THE SCENES FOR  THE RELEASE OF THE AMERICAN  HOSTAGES. LATE FRUD NIFRIDAY NIGHT. IT WAS VERY QUIET IN MILITARY  TERMS. WE BARELY HEARD ANY SHELLING OR  ANY AIRCRAFT STRIKES, COMPARE  AND CONTRAST THAT TO NOW TO  TODAY, YOU GET THAT REAL SENSE  THAT IF IT TALKED TWO DAYS TO  RELEASE TWO HOSTAGES, ABSENT ANY PAUSE, PERHAPS THE RELEASE OF 50 HOS &gt;&gt; STANDBY. LET US KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING. I WANT TO GET TO JEREMY DIAMOND  IN ISRAEL. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM  SOURCES THERE? &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE NIC, WE HEARD  EARLIER IN THE DAY THERE WAS  PERHAPS SOME PROGRESS IN THE  HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS, BUT NOW  WHAT WE ARE HEARING ARE THE  SOUNDS OF WAR. THE MOST INTENSE BOMBING AT  LEAST IN TERMS OF WHAT I CAN  HEAR FROM MY POSITION HERE IN  ASHKELON THAT I HAVE HEARD IN  THE THREE WEEKS I HAVE BEEN HERE COVERING THIS WAR. WE ARE HEARING INTENSE AND  REPETITIVE THUDS, BOMBING,  ARTILLERY, ALSO CLEARLY GOING  WHAT WE'RE ALSO SEEING IS HAMAS RESPONDING WITH AT LEAST TWO  ROCKET BARGES TOWARDS SEVERAL  ISRAEL AND HERE TOWARDS  ASHKELON. SO THIS IS CERTAINLY TAKING ON A DIFFERENT TONE AND TENOR FROM  HERE. IT'S HEART TO SAY IF THIS IS THE FINNING OF THAT INVASION, THAT  THEY HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT WILL  BE HAPPENING AT SOME POINT. WE KNOW THAT IN RECENT DAYS,  ISRAELI OFFICIALS HAD CLEARLY  TOLD AMERICANS THEY WERE WILLING TO GIVE THEM A FEW DAY OS TO SEE HOW THESE HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS  DEVELOPED. WHILE WE DON'T KNOW OFFICIAL WLI WHETHER THOSE TALKS HAVE  COMPLETELY COLLAPSED, WHAT IS  CLEAR IS THAT ISRAELI OFFICIALS  WERE NOT GOING TO WAIT  INDEFINITELY IN ORDER TO MOVE  FORWARD WITH THEIR GROUND  CAMPAIGN. AGAIN, WE ADOPT KNOW WHETHER  THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO  SEE ON THE GROUND. WE'RE SEEING AN INTENSIFICATION  OF A STRIKE ON GAZA. THERE'S ALSO REPORTS OF  TELECOMMUNICATIONS BEING OUT. IN ADDITION, WE KNOW IN RECENT  DAYS, WE HAVE SEEN A STEPPED UP  PACE. NOT ONLY OF THE AIRSTRIKES, NOT ONLY OF THE TARGETING OF THE  ITEMS, BUT ALSO INCREASING RAIDS INSIDE OF GAZA. THERE'S BEEN TANKS GOING INTO  GAZA TO CARRY OUT TARGETED  RAIDS, TO TAKE OUT ONLY SOFT THE TUNNELS AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT WE ALSO AWE LAST NIGHT WAS  THE FLO TILL LA 13 GOING INTO  SOUTHERN GAZA AND CARRYING OUT A RAID THERE AS WELL. ALL OF THAT IN THE LEAD UP TO  WHAT WE ARE NOW HEARING, WHICH  AGAIN IS A VERY SERIOUS  INTENSIFICATION OF AIRSTRIKES,  MUCH LOUDER BOMBING THAN WE HAVE HEARD PERHAPS IN THESE NEARLY  THREE WEEKS OF THIS WAR. &gt;&gt; JEREMY, THANK YOU. STANDBY. YOU WANT TO BRING IN GENERAL  MHURTLING, WHO WAS THE COMMANDIG GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES  ARMY EUROPE AND THE 7th ARMY  GENERAL. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING WHEN YOU  HEAR OUR REPORTERS &gt;&gt; WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE  REPORTING IS EXCELLENT FROM  NORTHERN GAZA. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SOUTH. JEREMY TALKED ABOUT WHAT'S  HAPPENING IN THE SOUTHERN  EXTREME WITH THE ISRAELI NAVY  BUT ALSO IN KHAN YUNIS. ARE THERE THE SAME KIND OF  EXPLOSIONS GOING ON IN THOSE  AREAS? I THINK THE ISRAELI DEFENSE  FORCES ARE GOING TO HIT ALL  SECTORS OF GAZA. JEREMY POINTED OUT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS AN INCREASE IN AIR  STRIKES AND INCREASE IN  INTELLIGENCE PROBES BY GROUND  FORCES WHICH WENT INTO GAZA AND  THEN CAME OUT, WHICH TELLS ME  THEY WERE SEEKING MORE  INTELLIGENCE, MORE TARGETING  DATA, FOR A FINAL PUSH. WHAT YOU'RE SEEING PRIMARILY, I  BELIEVE, FROM THE AIR FORCE AND  PERHAPS EVEN ARTILLERY FIRE FROM OUTSIDE OF GAZA, IS A  PREPARATORY STANCE BY ISRAEL. THEY ARE CONDUCTING FINAL PREP  FIRES, PUTTING A LOT OF FORCES  IN IT, AND REMEMBER, THESE  WEAPONS DON'T JUST KILL. WHAT THEY'RE BOMBING GAZA WITH  AND HITTING THEM WITH ARTILLERY, IT'S ALSO PSYCHOLOGICAL. WHEN YOU'RE UNDER THAT KIND OF  FIRE AS A TERRORIST OPERATION,  YOU KNOW SOMETHING BIG IS  HAPPENING. AND THEY'VE BEEN UNDER THESE  KIND OF BOMBS FOR THE LAST 20  DAYS. AT THE SAME TIME AS NIC RIGHTLY  POINTED OUT, THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES HAVE BEEN MOBILIZED  ALMOST 20 DAYS NOW. YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP A LARGE  FORCE OF 300,000 WAITING IN A  FIELD FOR THAT LONG. THEY TEND TO START LOSING THEIR  EDGE. AND THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT, THE  ONE MR. NETANYAHU WHO IS GOING  TO PULL THE TRIGGER AND START  THE OPERATION, AND ALL  INDICATORS ARE HE'S BEEN HOLD  BACK BECAUSE OF THE DIVISIONS  WITHIN HIS CABINET, WHEN HE DOES THAT, HE HAS TO HAVE THE FULL  FORCE OF THE ATTACK GOING. WHETHER OR NOT GROUND FORCES ARE GOING TO COME IN AND GO BACK OUT OR COME IN WRIT LARGE AND STAY,  YOU KNOW, THAT'S YET TO BE  DETERMINED. BUT I WOULD SUGGEST IT PROBABLY  TONIGHT OR TOMORROW IS GOING  TO -- WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME OF THE MAJOR EFFORTS OF THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCE GOING IN WITH MAIN FORCES TO STRIKE SOME OF THE  TARGETS THEY'VE BEEN COLLECTING  INTELLIGENCE ON.
