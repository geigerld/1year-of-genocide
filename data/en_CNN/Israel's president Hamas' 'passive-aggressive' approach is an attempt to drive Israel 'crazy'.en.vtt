00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:00.709
This is a really

00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:01.960
precarious moment

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.712
in Israel's history right now,

00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:05.630
as I'm sure you and I agree.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.673
Israel's been at war now

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.134
for more than 50 days against Hamas.

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:11.428
Given what happened back on October 7th,

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:12.095
three days

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.556
into this temporary truce right now,

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:16.182
how meaningful is it, Mr.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.350
President, right now

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.768
for Israelis to see

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.395
at least some good news,

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:21.813
some of the hostages

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.524
being reunited with their families?

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.444
It is extremely important because we see

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:30.905
we see human beings who are in the abyss

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.075
and without knowing their whereabouts

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.118
and their fate,

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.245
as well as the fact that they themselves

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.039
are totally secluded

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:39.873
and disconnected

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.499
from the rest of the world.

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.711
The fact that you see young girls,

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.087
a young boy

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:49.674
or a grandmother is walking soul

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:52.093
and going to Israeli hospitals

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:53.261
and coming back and meeting

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:57.766
their families is a huge emotional storm.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:02.312
And something that gives us a happiness.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.980
But of course, happiness

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.857
with a lot of sorrow it

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:08.860
because there are at least 200

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:12.405
hostages still held out there in Hamas

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.782
under Hamas duress,

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:16.326
somewhere in in bunkers somewhere.

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:17.994
And without knowing what they are,

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:19.245
what the how they live

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.663
and what their whereabouts.

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:22.624
Some family torn apart.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:25.627
Most of the hostages that were released

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:28.463
have still family members left behind,

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:30.757
meaning tearing their families apart.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.133
And as you can see

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.343
throughout the last few days,

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:37.097
Hamas is threatening on now psychology

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.766
with a kind of a

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.518
passive aggressive approach

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:44.521
which wants to drive us as a nation crazy

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:47.065
because of the emotions failed

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:48.983
and because of the extreme pain

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:51.319
and worry of so many relatives

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.445
to their friends

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.073
and family who are out there in Gaza.

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:55.406
As you

00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:55.990
know, Israel's

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.575
defense minister, Yoav Gallant,

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:59.494
said yesterday, and I'm quoting him now,

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.538
any further negotiations

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:04.541
will be held under fire, end quote.

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.627
Is he effectively closing the door

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:10.130
to extending the truce?

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.465
So we have to remember that

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.967
there are a few more days

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:17.846
of release of the hostages

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.932
while Israel is releasing terrorists

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:22.267
who are charged

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.393
and present

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:26.020
for telling activities, including

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.896
and taking

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:28.565
and lives of people

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.859
or threatening to take lives of people.

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.612
And this is a very gruesome process.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:35.947
So I don't want to speak

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:36.906
about the next step,

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.616
but it is clear to us

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:40.660
that if we want to prevent

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.663
further turmoil against Israel from Gaza

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:46.749
and change the future of the Middle East

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.710
and the way the Palestinians

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.044
have some hope,

00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:52.881
the only way to do it in a humane way

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:53.965
in order to

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:57.010
to protect the human values in the region

00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.803
is by uprooting Hamas.

00:02:58.803 --> 00:02:59.929
And that will

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.055
lead to the fact

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:03.516
that we have to take further action

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.310
and undermine Hamas's

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.644
military capabilities.

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.104
I'm anxious to get your thought.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:11.232
If Hamas agrees to another day,

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:13.484
another few days of this truce

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:14.611
in order to release

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.487
more Israeli hostages,

00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:17.739
should Israel accept that?

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.241
So that is already being negotiated.

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:20.742
First of all,

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:24.287
it was agreed in the original agreement,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.705
which has been violated

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.040
constantly by Hamas,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.251
but still implemented piecemeal,

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.753
that if they bring

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:35.256
another ten prisoners on. So

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.925
the exact number and forces

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.468
in the agreement itself,

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:39.844
there will be an extension

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:42.805
of another day of humanitarian pause.

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:44.766
So that is already agreed.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.059
They can definitely

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.102
bring many more hostages

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:49.479
and release them.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.272
They they kind of said

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:52.065
that they don't know

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.067
where they on the whereabouts are.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.486
That looks to us totally false

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.738
because they've been controlling Gaza

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.031
to the last iota

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.617
for the last 20 odd years

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:04.452
in a very cruel regime

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:06.246
that didn't let anybody move

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.538
without their permission.

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:09.999
So that is why I truly hope

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.417
that in this instance,

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.378
they will release more and more

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:15.004
and they will get more

00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:17.590
and more humanitarian pauses

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.509
as to what happens afterwards,

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.427
it is clear that we intend

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.137
to complete the task,

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:24.806
meaning undermine

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.267
the military capabilities of Hamas

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.227
as an entity and enable

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:30.853
a different future

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:32.563
for those who live near the border,

00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:33.314
for Israelis

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:34.732
and Palestinians,

00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:35.525
for the ability

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.902
to undermine this empire of evil

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:39.821
which operates from Tehran

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.948
and of course, impacts the entire region.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.449
So I just want to be precise, Mr.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.325
President,

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.576
in order to get more

00:04:45.576 --> 00:04:48.162
Israeli hostages released,

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:49.664
do you think Israel should agree

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.582
to extend the truce?

00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:53.293
So it depends.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.295
So far, the agreement speaks about.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.296
The agreement was for four.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:56.796
Days,

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.423
but it says specifically

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.383
that any additional ten

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.468
or so hostages released,

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.137
there would be another day

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.471
of humanitarian pause.

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.849
And that is what is being

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:11.019
implemented as to what happens next.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.812
There is a Qatari delegation

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.397
in Israel today

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.065
and I think they are talking

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:18.026
to the relevant authorities

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.277
in the

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:22.030
Israeli government as to the next phase.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.741
So you are open to extending the truce.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:25.992
So, again,

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.702
the way you interpret and interpret

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.704
the word truce is complicated.

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:30.997
We've already agreed

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.332
we made it public

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.249
that if

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.210
and above that for the initial four days,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.919
there's not

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.380
a release of further prisoners

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.342
ten per day or something of 1011.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.177
I don't have the exact numbers.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:47.388
We will extend the humanitarian pause

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:49.474
and meaning the truce.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:51.100
That's the way you call it. A pause.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.934
Yes. Yeah.

00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:55.396
And but our clear intention is to go in

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:56.898
and complete the job

00:05:56.898 --> 00:06:00.234
because we must not enable this

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:01.569
base of terror on this

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.196
platform of terror,

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.573
which was taken over by a cruel code,

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:09.786
a time 2007 by Hamas to continue.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.120
And how would you expect

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.830
anybody who went through these

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.792
horrific torments and the horrific scene

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:19.045
and this barbaric attack on October 7th

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.963
with rape and torture

00:06:20.963 --> 00:06:23.716
and beheading and shopping and

00:06:23.716 --> 00:06:26.052
and mutilating bodies

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.846
and abducting hostages,

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:29.889
how do you expect

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.265
anybody to go back there

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:33.017
if there's no complete

00:06:33.017 --> 00:06:34.811
and to this threat?

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:35.770
So let's talk a little bit

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.438
about looking down the road

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:39.565
after this war with Hamas.

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:40.942
You have said Israel and I'm

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:41.692
quoting now,

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:44.695
can't leave a vacuum in Gaza.

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:47.615
So will Gaza be governed by a revitalized

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.117
Palestinian Authority

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.077
as President Biden has proposed?

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:54.414
So this is something really important

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:56.624
to go into and discuss

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.876
because people have to be serious

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:00.336
if we want to prevent

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:02.338
a recurrence of further terrible

00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:05.508
if we want to go into a stable horizon

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:06.509
in the region,

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.220
we have to be lucid about it.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.805
Is there any force

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.974
in the world, in the region,

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.892
which is willing to take over

00:07:14.892 --> 00:07:16.018
and run the place

00:07:16.018 --> 00:07:17.895
in terms of the security

00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:20.565
and preventing further whores,

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:23.943
sadistic and barbaric jihadist activity?

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:26.612
Somebody has to say who it's going to be

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:27.822
when there are nations

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:30.241
who say we won't have boots on the ground

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:31.784
when there are nations and say,

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:32.827
of course not.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:35.163
We leave the dirty job to you guys.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.165
So when Israel says right

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:38.791
now, the security

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.418
and well-being of this place

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.879
in terms of this security element,

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.006
meaning fighting terror

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.842
and forcing law and order adjudicating

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:48.968
and so forth,

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.470
will stay in Israeli hands

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.472
until there is an agreement.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.849
One has to build the alternative.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:55.725
The alternative

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:59.145
needs to be discussed in there in various

00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:00.646
key places

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.857
and see what's next in the interim,

00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:05.860
there has to be a major humanitarian aid

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.904
and a major humanitarian effort

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:08.779
in this respect.

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:12.074
For example, I commend the hospital,

00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:14.285
which is being built now

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.829
in Rafah by the United Arab Emirates.

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.539
There are other countries

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:20.625
who are making similar efforts

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.710
and we commend them as well.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.588
But the most advanced projects so far,

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:26.172
for example,

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.173
for another

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.633
new hospital in the Gaza

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:31.302
Strip is done by United Arab Emirates.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.053
And yesterday

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:33.930
the trucks came in in order

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.307
to build this hospital in Rafah.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:39.977
So there should be an overall effort

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.813
to make something that makes sense for

00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:43.606
the future

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:44.315
on the well-being

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.858
of Israelis and Palestinians.

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:47.860
What should the governing authority

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.863
of Gaza be after after this Israel

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.490
Hamas war

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.367
if it's not the Palestinian Authority?

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.244
I've been saying it long,

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.286
many, many times.

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:58.329
And I'll say it again

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:00.790
this is not only a war between

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.458
Israel and Hamas.

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:05.461
This is actually a war that defends

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.673
the real values of liberal

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:11.092
and democratic countries,

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:12.718
all countries who believe

00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:13.511
in the rules

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:14.845
of the family of nations,

00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:17.348
as opposed to an empire of evil,

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:19.892
which is an empire of jihadis

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:22.937
which believe only in eradicating

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.230
all of us out of here,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.440
not only Jews, but also Christians.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.984
And the next will be Europe

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:29.277
and the United States.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.195
So that is what the war is all about.

00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:32.405
And therefore,

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.074
how you come out of the war, meaning

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.993
how do you make sure

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.828
that what will come out of the war

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.204
will promise

00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:41.664
regional security

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:44.292
and stability, will promise peace

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:48.462
or, let's say, seizing of fire and tell

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.547
this is the key

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:51.549
and this has to be analyzed

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:54.552
clearly and in a very punctual way,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.928
not slogans.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:57.346
I heard President Biden's

00:09:57.346 --> 00:10:01.309
speech on Friday, and from his vacation,

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:02.143
and I.

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:04.437
I truly welcome these words.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.230
I mean, these were important words

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.189
as he spoke

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:08.065
about the fact

00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:09.817
that there is an empire of evil,

00:10:09.817 --> 00:10:11.402
which wants to undermine

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:13.571
all the peace processes in the region.

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:14.780
It is clear

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.574
that what Hamas did under

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:19.035
the instructions of Iran,

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.995
is to undermine the ability

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.830
of further peace agreements

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:23.706
following the Abraham

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:25.625
Accords, also peace agreement

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.501
with Saudi Arabia, and also

00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:30.129
and offering a huge, huge connection

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:31.297
between Europe all the

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:33.215
way down to Australia.
