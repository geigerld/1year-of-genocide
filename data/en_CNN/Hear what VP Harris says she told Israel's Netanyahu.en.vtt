00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.936
I told him that I will always en

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:05.872
that Israel is able to defend it

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:08.875
including from Iran and Iran bac

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.878
militias such as Hamas and Hezbo

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.114
From when I was a young girl

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.181
collecting funds

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.584
to plant trees for Israel.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.652
To my time in the United States 

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.488
and now at the white House.

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.957
I have had an unwavering commitm

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.393
to the existence of the State of

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.028
to its security,

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.363
and to the people of Israel.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.631
I've said it many times,

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.400
but it bears repeating.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.403
Israel has a right to defend its

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:40.106
and how it does so matters.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.777
Hamas is a brutal terrorist orga

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:47.247
On October 7th, Hamas triggered 

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:50.250
when it massacred 1200 innocent 

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.120
including 44 Americans.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.255
Hamas has committed

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.258
horrific acts of sexual violence

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.327
and took 250 hostages.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.363
There are American citizens

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.198
who remain captive in Gaza.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.134
Soggy taco

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:11.538
hen Hirsch Goldberg, Poland.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:14.941
Edan Alexander,

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.310
Keith Siegel,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.146
Omar Neutra

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.582
and the remains of American citi

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:27.187
Judy Weinstein, God, a Guy and I

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:30.390
hen are still being held in Gaza

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.093
I have met with the families

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.561
of these American hostages

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.596
multiple times now,

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.598
and I've told them each time

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.266
they are not alone,

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.869
and I stand with them.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:43.503
And President

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.939
Biden and I are working every da

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.842
to bring them home.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:51.811
I also expressed with the Prime 

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.780
my serious concern

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.215
about the scale of human

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:57.083
suffering in Gaza,

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.852
including the death of far

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:01.855
too many innocent civilians.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:05.091
And I made clear my serious conc

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.092
about the dire

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:09.028
humanitarian situation there.

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:11.631
With over 2 million people facin

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.634
high levels of food insecurity

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.636
and half a million people

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:19.639
facing catastrophic levels of ac

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.241
food insecurity.

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.343
What has happened in

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.811
Gaza over the past

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.213
nine months is devastating.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.749
The images of dead children

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.519
and desperate, hungry people

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.788
fleeing for safety, sometimes di

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:38.958
for the second, third or fourth 

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.194
We cannot look away

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:43.329
in the face of these tragedies.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.998
We cannot allow ourselves

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:48.001
to become numb to the suffering.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.970
And I will not be silent.

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:52.705
Thanks to the leadership

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.240
of our president, Joe Biden,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.842
there is a deal on the table

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.845
for a ceasefire and a hostage de

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:01.447
And it is important that we reca

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.950
what the deal involves.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.752
The first phase of the deal

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:08.288
would bring about a full ceasefi

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:09.756
including a withdrawal

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:11.624
of the Israeli military

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:14.527
from population centers in Gaza.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:17.063
In the second phase, the Israeli

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:20.066
with withdraw from Gaza entirely

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.835
and it would lead to a permanent

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:23.970
to the hostilities.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:28.141
It is time for this war to end

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.576
and to end in a way

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.111
where Israel is secure.

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.581
All the hostages are released.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.482
The suffering of Palestinians

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.585
in Gaza ends,

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.286
and the Palestinian people

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:43.289
can exercise their right to free

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:46.359
dignity and self-determination.

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:48.795
There has been hopeful movement

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.562
in the talks

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.532
to secure an agreement on this d

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.533
And as I just told

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.134
Prime Minister Netanyahu,

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:58.137
it is time to get this deal done

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.206
So to everyone who has been

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.075
calling for a ceasefire

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.144
and to everyone who yearns for p

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:08.948
I see you and I hear you.

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:10.817
Let's get the deal done

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.820
so we can get a ceasefire to end

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.689
Let's bring the hostages home

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.892
and let's provide much needed re

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.127
the Palestinian people.

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.297
And ultimately, I remain

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:26.666
committed to a path forward

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:29.669
that can lead to a two state sol

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.338
And I know right now it is hard

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:35.408
to conceive of that prospect.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.444
But a two state solution is the 

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:41.281
that ensures Israel remains a se

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.284
Jewish and democratic state,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.618
and one that ensures

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.754
Palestinians can finally realize

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:50.757
the freedom, security and prospe

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.893
that they rightly deserve.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:55.161
And I will close with this.

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:56.529
Then.

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:57.297
It is important

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.632
for the American people to remem

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.669
the war in Gaza is not a binary 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.971
However, too often

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.974
the conversation is binary

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.943
when the reality is anything but

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.379
So I ask my fellow Americans

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.682
to help encourage efforts

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:17.917
to acknowledge the complexity,

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:18.951
the nuance,

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:21.821
and the history of the region.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.489
Let us all condemn

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.825
terrorism and violence.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:28.661
Let us all do what we can to pre

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.664
the suffering of innocent civili

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:34.734
and let us condemn antisemitism,

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:38.371
Islamophobia, and hate of any ki

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:42.875
and let us work to unite our cou

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.945
I thank you for that, Vice presi

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:46.746
Madam Vice President,

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.114
after after your meeting,

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:49.082
are you convinced that

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:49.749
the Prime Minister

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.452
would like a fire deal?

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:52.885
All right.

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:53.753
There you heard Vice

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:54.687
President Harris

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:56.823
as well as a presidential candid

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:59.258
Harris, as of this week.

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:00.960
talking after meeting with

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.128
Prime Minister Benjamin

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:03.796
Netanyahu of Israel, saying

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:05.431
Israel has a right to defend its

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:06.933
but we cannot allow ourselves

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:09.001
to be numb to the suffering in G

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:11.504
She said it is time for the war 

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:13.172
And she conveyed that

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:14.941
to Benjamin Netanyahu as well.

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.676
Let's bring in Kayla Telsey

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:17.343
from the white House.

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:18.511
Kayla, some strong words

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:19.946
there from the vice president

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:21.347
after her meeting.

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:22.715
And it obviously

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:23.916
is coming at an interesting

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:26.719
political moment for her as well

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:27.019
Pam, it's

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:28.554
been the clearest distillation y

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:30.123
that we've seen of Vice Presiden

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:31.624
Harris's own beliefs

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:33.393
and views on this situation.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:33.926
And I think there's

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:35.428
one line in particular

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:36.696
that sums it up best,

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:37.697
and that is toward the top.

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:38.297
When she said

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:40.433
Israel has a right to defend its

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:43.302
and how it does so matters.

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:43.636
She's

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:47.106
speaking to those who want to se

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:48.674
defend itself

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:49.642
and want this war to end,

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.811
and also those who want to seek 

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:54.180
And she says in no uncertain ter

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.281
I hear you,

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.284
and I see you to those on all si

00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.252
of this argument

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.019
and this debate

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.888
that has inflamed divisions

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:03.156
in this country

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.791
as well as around the world,

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.793
these are the most forceful word

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:07.193
and the

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:09.328
perhaps the clearest position

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:11.330
that's been laid out on this sit

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.965
from this administration so far,

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:14.066
and certainly from the vice

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.101
president herself.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:15.735
And it's worth

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:16.369
noting that

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:18.137
because in listening

00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:19.806
to some of her comments up

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:21.841
until this point, aides

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:23.643
of hers, administration official

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:24.644
and those who know her

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:25.878
very well have noted that

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.847
substantively, she's not differe

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:29.582
from President Biden on this top

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:31.651
But tonally, rhetorically,

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:33.419
she is that she has a tendency

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:35.521
to speak more forcefully on this

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:36.923
that at times has raised

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.257
eyebrows inside the white House.

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:39.025
But then when you look

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:40.526
at the substance of the remarks,

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:42.462
they're actually not that differ

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.863
She is now at a crossroads

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:45.164
where she has to decide

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:47.333
what her nuance is on this issue

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:48.601
whether she wants to break

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.169
from Biden's position

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:52.238
or whether she wants to stay the

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:53.506
with what the administration

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:55.741
has laid out. Fulsomely so far.

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:57.310
This appearance tonight

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.312
appears to be her saying,

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.880
this is where I'm going

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.114
to be on this matter,

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:04.050
that Israel has a right to defen

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.852
and how it does so matters,

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:06.752
and that for people

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:07.920
on all sides of this debate

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.122
that she hears them and she sees

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:12.291
Pam. All right. Kayla, thank you

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.526
And for more reaction to Vice

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:15.061
President Harris's comments,

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:15.728
I want to bring in

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:16.762
Democratic Congressman

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:18.798
Jason Crow, Colorado.

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:20.333
First off, what is your reaction

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.667
What we just heard from Harris.

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:25.738
Well, I agree with your colleagu

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:26.572
that the

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:28.674
the line that we support Israel,

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:31.043
but how it does so matter.

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:32.979
that is a key element to this,

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:34.981
that we can both stand with Isra

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.216
and help it defend itself,

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:38.918
but it has to do so consistent

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:40.353
with its values

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.654
at the level of civilian

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:43.890
casualties has been unacceptable

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.024
and untenable.

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.726
And the humanitarian catastrophe

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:47.493
in Gaza

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:48.694
is also not aligned

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.630
with our values and our interest

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.864
And then finally, her

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:53.432
calling on the American people

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:54.934
to embrace the complexity

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:56.068
of the situation

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:57.003
and the history here

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:58.437
is also really important.

00:08:58.437 --> 00:08:58.638
You know,

00:08:58.638 --> 00:08:59.705
we have to be able to have

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:00.373
that confidence,

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.474
that confidence

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:03.209
to have that conversation.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:03.876
What's this,

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:04.610
a stronger

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.046
stance on Palestinian suffering 

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.648
than we have heard

00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:09.782
from President Biden

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:11.517
in almost ten months of this war

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:12.084
In your view?

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:14.587
Now, I wouldn't compare

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:15.588
it to President Biden.

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:17.790
President Biden has handled this

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.925
in a very complicated

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:20.927
and a very strong way.

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:22.261
but he's clearly

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:24.130
articulating her views on this

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:24.630
and saying

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.232
that we need to have a conversat

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.967
going forward about the complexi

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:28.167
Right.

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:30.970
Calling on the release of the ho

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:31.704
saying that we have

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:33.973
to find a path forward to peace.

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.641
This conflict has evolved

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:38.611
and has evolved from day one to 

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:42.181
you know, 270 now, at this point

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.549
we have to make sure that we're 

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.618
in our conversation along the li

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:47.453
Earlier this week, her campaign 

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:47.920
that was still

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.223
defining her stance over the the

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:52.258
you heard

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:52.792
Harris

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:54.927
say how Israel prosecutes

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.062
this war matters.

00:09:56.062 --> 00:09:57.430
You just talked about that.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.266
Does that signal to you that she

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.301
you know, substantially change h

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:02.935
toward Israel

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:04.704
compared to Biden, using more le

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:06.405
against Netanyahu's government,

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:07.773
especially considering

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:09.475
she's now a presidential candida

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.311
I think what it

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:13.179
means is that

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:14.914
she is going to continue to adap

00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:16.649
as the circumstances change.

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.150
What I learned in war,

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.785
I served as an Army Ranger in Ir

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.120
and Afghanistan is that day

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.322
one is different from day 90

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:25.958
and and different from day 180.

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.727
Wars and conditions change.

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:28.694
And as a leader,

00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:30.062
you have to have the ability

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:31.464
to be able to adapt

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.265
to those changing conditions.

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:37.136
So she, very clearly, conveyed

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.371
a desire

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:39.405
to actually understand

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:40.239
what's going on

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:42.908
and to adapt as necessary going 

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:44.043
and to embrace, again

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:46.145
that complexity of the situation

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.513
that we can hold

00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:49.682
several truths at the same time

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:50.883
that one of these truths is

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:52.151
we will stand by

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.853
and defend the state of Israel.

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:54.654
At the same time,

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.022
it has to do so consistent

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:58.624
with our interests and our value

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:00.760
in the values of the American pe
