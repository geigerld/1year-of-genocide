00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.501
Is rescuing the hostages

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.836
a priority at all?

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.963
I mean, Israeli news media, like Haaretz,

00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:06.756
they say it doesn't seem like it at all.

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:07.757
And frankly, Jake,

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:09.092
if my kids were being held

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:10.093
hostage in Gaza

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:12.137
and as you know, there are Americans

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:14.389
being held hostage in Gaza right now,

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:15.098
I'd want you

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.683
you to send in the Navy SEALs.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.976
What's the conversation

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.770
like in the White House about the U.S.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.023
conducting any sort of operations

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.150
in order to save Americans

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.945
being held hostage in Gaza?

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.613
Well, the president has been very clear

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:32.365
that he has no higher priority

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.700
than getting Americans

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.993
back safe, Americans

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.995
who are being held hostage by Hamas.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.121
The Israelis are bombing

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.414
the crap out of Gaza.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:42.417
And I mean,

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:43.752
it doesn't seem like saving

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:44.586
the hostages are a

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:48.131
priority at all right now.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.507
Well, for President Biden,

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.217
they are a priority.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.428
They're the highest possible priority.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.263
And he has sent hostage

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.015
experts to coordinate

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.767
and consult with the Israeli government

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.226
on hostage recovery efforts.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.729
He's also made sure that our diplomats

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.481
are in touch with third countries

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.440
in the region

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.649
to explore avenues

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:07.734
for their safe release.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:08.735
I have to be cautious

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.445
about how much I can say

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.280
about certain efforts he's undertaking

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.949
because we want to protect those efforts

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.659
to give us the best possible chance

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:17.786
of getting our people home.

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:18.453
Now, Jake, one

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:19.245
important point

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.872
when it comes to the issue of the Navy

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.123
SEALs is

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:22.874
we do not at

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:26.002
this point have pinpoint location

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:27.337
information for where

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:29.089
the American hostages are.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.215
So we have to continue

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.383
to refine our understanding

00:01:32.383 --> 00:01:33.551
of where they are

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.136
and even Jake, who they are,

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:35.845
because we know

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.264
there are 15 unaccounted for Americans,

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.725
but we cannot confirm the precise number

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.519
of American hostages

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.230
being held by Hamas at this time.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.481
All we can do

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:47.649
is to continue to work

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.150
closely with the Israeli government

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.652
on hostage recovery options,

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:51.903
which we are doing,

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.738
and then work through third countries

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:55.824
to see if there are avenues for release.

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.492
Those efforts are underway.

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:58.368
Our hope is that

00:01:58.368 --> 00:01:59.744
they can produce results.

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:01.996
We will continue to stay focused on this.

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:03.164
It's as high

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.666
a priority as the president has.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.376
One senior political operative

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:07.252
with Hamas floated

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:07.961
the possibility

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:08.628
a few days ago

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:11.005
of a potential prisoner swap

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:11.798
with the U.S.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.091
for the release of hostages

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:17.971
with the U.S.. Entertain that.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:21.057
We have not looked at that.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.183
We have not heard from them.

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:23.184
Something like that.

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:24.018
That's not something

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:25.019
that is currently under

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:25.895
active discussion.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.105
It has not been proposed.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.439
What we are focused on instead,

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.942
as I said before, are pursuing avenues

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.485
with third countries for release.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:33.862
I'm not going to get into the details

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:34.112
of what

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.698
that might look like again, to protect

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:37.866
those channels

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.827
in hopes that they can bear some fruit.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.996
But I will say that President Biden

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.038
has shown over the course

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:45.540
of the past few years

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.709
that he will make hard decisions

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.211
to get American hostages home.

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.504
In this case,

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.256
our focus is on working

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:54.799
through those third country channels

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.134
and I'll leave it at that for now.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:56.885
So I think there are

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.137
serious reasons to question

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:00.638
how good any intelligence

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:03.558
about what is in Gaza is.

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.602
I mean, obviously,

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.061
Hamas was able to carry out

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.772
this horrific attack eight days ago,

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:12.859
catching everybody completely off guard.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:14.110
You just said that

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.903
we don't know

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:18.239
where the hostages are in Gaza.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.074
And yet the Israelis claim

00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:24.454
the IDF claims that it is bombing places

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:29.751
that it knows are Hamas

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.836
targets.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:34.672
How can we be sure that that's true?

00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:36.507
I mean, I

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:38.009
Hamas is a terrorist group.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.843
Don't get me wrong.

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:42.222
But how do we know anything about what

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.056
they're hitting?

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:43.765
Given the fact

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.099
that it doesn't sound

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.977
like any of the intelligence inside Gaza

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:52.273
is particularly good?

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:55.193
Well, Jake, Israel has known

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.195
where particular parts

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.321
of Hamas's terrorist

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.989
infrastructure have been located.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.241
They know, for example,

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.617
where rockets are fired from

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:05.078
and they can go back to those locations

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.121
to take out the rocket emplacements.

00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:07.747
They know

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:08.831
from various forms

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:09.916
of intelligence collection

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.043
where certain individuals are located,

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.295
who are senior commanders in Hamas,

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.589
who are part of the bloody

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.840
and barbaric attacks

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.841
that took place against

00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:20.468
Israel last Saturday.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:23.346
So they do have information

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:26.266
to be able to go after specific targets,

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.725
actionable targets,

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:29.394
similar to the way the United States

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:30.436
has been able to do that.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:32.981
In other places, in other contexts.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.900
The United States has taken a very clear

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.567
stand.

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.486
It is a stand that we don't just take

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:39.529
in this situation,

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.322
but we've taken all along,

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:41.864
which is that

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.366
we stand for the rule of law.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.993
We stand for the law of war,

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.869
we stand for the protection of civilians.

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:48.663
And we want to make sure

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.415
that innocent Palestinians

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:51.457
who have nothing to do with

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.668
Hamas, can get to safe areas

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:55.920
where they will be safe from bombardment

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.755
and where they will have access

00:04:57.755 --> 00:04:59.924
to necessities like food, water,

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.634
shelter and medicine.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:02.176
Well,

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:03.052
I mean, you say you stand

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:04.178
for the rule of law.

00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:05.638
Again, Hamas is vile.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:06.973
What they did eight days ago,

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.683
they're targeting civilians.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:09.475
It's horrific.

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:10.935
But what's going on right now

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:13.313
is not just a punishment of Hamas.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.689
More than 700 children

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.983
have been reportedly killed in Gaza.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.484
And obviously,

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.777
electricity, food,

00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:21.612
water, supplies have been cut off

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:25.158
by Israel to the totality of Gaza.

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:25.783
Obviously,

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:27.452
the blockade is not just by Israel,

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:28.953
it's by Egypt, too.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:29.954
Take a listen to what Secretary

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:31.164
Blinken said last year

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.041
when Putin was targeting

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.586
Ukrainian infrastructure,

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.047
heat, water.

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:40.965
Electricity

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:42.508
for children,

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:45.136
for the elderly, for the sick.

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:48.097
These are President Putin's new targets.

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:50.391
He's hitting them hard.

00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:52.060
This brutalization of Ukraine's.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.313
People is barbaric.

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:58.149
Now, look, Israel is not Russia.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.109
Gaza is not Ukraine.

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:01.986
It's a different situation.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.696
But cutting off supplies,

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:04.697
cutting off heat,

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:08.785
cutting off water to civilians.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:12.580
What's the difference?

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:13.664
Well, first,

00:06:13.664 --> 00:06:14.624
thank you for saying that

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:15.666
Israel is not Russia,

00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:17.585
because Israel is not Russia's, but.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.045
Civilians are civilians.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.255
We are civilians to civilians.

00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:23.466
Yes, absolutely they are.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:24.675
And they deserve, as I said

00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:26.260
before, access to water

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.887
and medicine and food.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.263
And we are working actively

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:30.515
to ensure that that happens.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.475
And I can tell you this morning, Jake,

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:33.434
that I have been in touch

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:34.852
with my Israeli counterparts

00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:36.979
just within the last hour

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.481
who report to me that they have,

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:38.981
in fact,

00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:40.066
turned the water pipe

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:42.443
back on in southern Gaza.

00:06:42.443 --> 00:06:43.569
That has been the subject

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:44.445
of discussion

00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:45.947
over the course of the past few days.

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:47.448
The United States is going to continue

00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:49.826
working with Israel, with the U.N.,

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.619
with Egypt, with Jordan,

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.703
and with a lot of the groups

00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:53.496
on the ground

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:54.414
to make sure

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.166
that innocent Palestinians get access

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:58.543
to those basic necessities

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.670
and are protected from bombardment

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.505
because they deserve that

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.674
right, the right to those necessities

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.217
and the right to safety and security

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:06.759
every bit

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.177
as much as Ukrainian civilians

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:09.929
do or civilians anywhere do.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:10.930
And the United States hasn't

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.348
made any bones about that.

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:13.516
We're working hard on that.

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:14.642
We're working to make sure

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:17.645
that that is the case as this unfolds.

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:18.396
And it's something

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:19.605
that has been a high priority

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:20.440
for President Biden,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.150
for Secretary Blinken, and for myself.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.234
But you're not telling the Israelis

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.819
to let the Palestinian

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:30.116
hospitals have power.

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:31.325
Our position is

00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:33.035
that hospitals

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:34.370
should be able to function.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.247
Hospitals should not be targeted.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:37.957
People should be able to get access

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.667
to lifesaving medical care.

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:41.502
We don't qualify this statement

00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:43.045
if we don't say that

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:45.256
there is some kind of caveat to them.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.507
These are simple, clear,

00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:47.884
declarative statements.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:48.926
It is our position

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:49.844
that's consistent

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.387
with the law of armed conflict,

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:52.513
the law of war.

00:07:52.513 --> 00:07:54.265
It's consistent with our view

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:55.725
as we have presented it.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.101
And I would just say, Jake, that there's

00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:58.811
a lot of reports in the fog of war

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:00.188
about things that happen.

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:01.147
We're not going to respond

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.273
to every one of those

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:03.441
because

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.109
we will seek clarity

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:06.736
in the appropriate way.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:08.446
But we will never back off

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:09.780
our basic principles

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.115
and our basic proposition,

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:13.117
which we have made both publicly

00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:14.285
and privately

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:15.369
about our view

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:17.163
about how civilians have to be protected.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.164
I haven't asked you over the any

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.248
the fog of war stories.

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:20.833
I've seen stories

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.126
that blame Israel

00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:23.920
for things that later on it

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.838
turns out Hamas did them.

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:28.090
I get it. I understand.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.759
But we have reports

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.010
and I'm sure you have them, too,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.470
that hundreds of the individuals

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.680
stuck in Gaza are American citizens.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.431
You know that, too.

00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:38.935
There are also hundreds of

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:39.685
thousands

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:41.187
of Americans in Israel

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.855
that are trying to get out also.

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:43.814
And the Biden administration

00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:44.440
is doing a lot

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.983
to get those individuals out.

00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:47.860
29 of the individuals killed

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.571
by Hamas were American.

00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:51.864
And there are, I think

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:53.533
what is it like something like

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.576
40 Americans that are unaccounted for

00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:57.286
who were maybe taken prisoner by Hamas?

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:58.621
But I want to talk to you

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.164
about one Palestinian-American woman

00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:03.167
we talked to named Janine O'Connell.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.752
She's from New Jersey.

00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:05.378
She's got three

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:08.381
kids, eight two and two months.

00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:09.674
I sent you the interview

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:10.841
we did with her earlier in the week.

00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:11.801
She got to the border,

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.135
the Rafah crossing.

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:14.929
She can't get out.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.097
She can't get out of Gaza

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:16.889
because the Egyptians

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.349
won't open the crossing.

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:19.100
Listen to what she told

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.103
me earlier this week.

00:09:22.186 --> 00:09:24.522
We tried to contact the U.S.

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:26.023
embassy so many times.

00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:27.400
Unfortunately, they couldn't

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.568
tell us at all.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.653
I contacted them through the phone

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:31.612
via email.

00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:33.823
I texted and I.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:37.326
I called different numbers, but nobody

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.704
I couldn't hear back from any.

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:42.039
We are all here feeling abandoned

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:43.791
that and we're

00:09:43.791 --> 00:09:47.628
feeling that we're left alone.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.088
I don't know how many billions of dollars

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:51.507
we give the Egyptians every year.

00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:52.592
Why can't you tell

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:53.384
President Sisi

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:57.722
to open the border, to let Americans out?

00:09:57.805 --> 00:09:58.431
We have told

00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:59.932
President Sisi to open the border,

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.434
to let Americans out.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.268
The situation

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:03.144
there at the crossing

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:04.687
is actually more complicated.

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:07.231
The Egyptians have, in fact, agreed

00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:08.441
to allow Americans

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.609
to depart to get safe

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.527
passage through the Rafah crossing.

00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:13.487
The Israelis agreed to ensure

00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:14.488
that the area around

00:10:14.488 --> 00:10:16.365
there would be safe as at least

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:18.492
as far as they were able to do so.

00:10:18.492 --> 00:10:19.201
The question

00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:20.745
when we tried to move a group

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.914
yesterday was actually Hamas taking steps

00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:25.958
to try and stop that from happening.

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:26.917
But we are continuing

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:28.586
to work this around the clock

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.963
and we are doing all that we can

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:31.797
to make sure

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:33.591
that American citizens who are in Gaza

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.092
can get through that border crossing.

00:10:35.092 --> 00:10:36.719
Secretary Blinken, in fact,

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:38.512
is in Egypt today

00:10:38.512 --> 00:10:40.514
meeting with the president of Egypt.

00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:42.433
This is at the top of his list

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:43.017
to help

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:46.020
get those American citizens out of Gaza.

00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:48.606
Anyone on who is a U.S.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:50.191
citizen should have the right

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.609
to free passage through there

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.069
and then have the U.S.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.154
government facilitate their travel home.

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:56.489
Yeah, I don't

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.865
I don't doubt that the biggest problem

00:10:57.865 --> 00:10:58.866
in all of this Escobar's.
