00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.268
the European Union's top diplomat warns

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:03.670
the risk of Israel's war

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.206
spilling over into Lebanon is growing.

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:06.873
Joseph Burrell

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.208
says he's much more worried

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.209
than before, pointing

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.577
to increased bombings

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.212
on both sides of the border.

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.913
Ben Wedeman is in Lebanon,

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.215
where life goes on

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.218
as the shadow of war looms large.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.254
It's a day of joy

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:24.257
and celebration here in South Lebanon.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.059
Israeli forces are just

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.862
about five miles away from here.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:29.929
But nonetheless, here

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.898
in the town of Hezbollah,

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:34.901
there's a wedding going on.

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.371
It didn't seem right to spoil

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.572
this special day

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.941
for newlyweds Tamer and Faten,

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.044
with questions about the dark clouds

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.712
hovering over Lebanon.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.181
But one guest told us off camera,

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.549
we're celebrating here

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.552
while war is around the corner.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.687
Hezbollah has been spared

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.189
the worst of the barrages

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:57.657
and counter barrages

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.026
between Israel and Hezbollah.

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.362
Here they stop anyone from firing

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:03.430
towards Israel.

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:06.032
Parliament member Elias

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:07.634
Gerardi was elected

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.270
to represent Christians in this area.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.505
Majority of the southern people,

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.641
majority of the Lebanese people

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.844
from all sects or religions or parties,

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.347
they are in one way or another.

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.583
They are committed with the Palestinian.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.984
Everyone we spoke with

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:27.987
had a completely contrary opinion.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.623
Few people wanted to speak on camera

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:31.391
about the looming

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.394
danger of war for fear of repercussions.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.430
Off camera, we got an earful.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.333
There is zero appetite for escalation.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.169
Little support for Hezbollah.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:46.172
85 year old Abu Nabeel has seen it all.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.941
War and civil war.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:52.045
Invasions and occupation of weapons of

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:55.081
war is ruination, he says.

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.850
In war, everyone loses.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.451
Even the winner,

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:01.454
Abu Nabeel, knows of what he speaks.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:02.822
Since October,

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.724
Israel and Hezbollah and its allies

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:05.492
have been engaged

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.360
in low intensity warfare,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.629
largely limited to the border.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.265
If full scale war breaks out,

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.566
that war will spread

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.769
well beyond the frontier on both sides.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.039
Last week, Israeli

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.274
generals approved a plan

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.277
to attack Lebanon right now,

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:25.712
while Hezbollah leader Hassan

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.313
Nasrallah recently warned

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.715
if it comes to war,

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.850
the group will fight Israel on land,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.218
sea and air

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:34.821
and also incite Israel itself.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.990
All this webinar covered webinars.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.458
The Iranian backed groups

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:39.893
sophisticated attacks

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.162
have surprised Israeli officials,

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.364
including precision strikes

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.798
on surveillance posts

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:46.966
on the border,

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.969
shooting down high flying Israeli drones

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.005
and knocking out anti-missile

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.940
and anti-drone defenses,

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.009
and posting online

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.178
more than nine minutes of what it claimed

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:58.811
was drone

00:02:58.811 --> 00:02:59.512
footage

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.980
of sensitive military

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.849
and civilian infrastructure in

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.852
and around the city of Haifa.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.090
The bell summons the faithful to mass

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.091
in the predominantly

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:15.094
Christian town of Marjayoun.

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:16.629
More than 90,000

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:17.897
people have already left

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.532
the South for safer ground

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.167
in Hebron.

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:22.302
Among, Amal

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:25.305
says she's determined to stay, but adds

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:27.707
if things escalate to war

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.342
and it reaches here like it did

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.944
before with some shelling,

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:31.578
of course,

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:34.581
like others will have to leave this.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:37.884
But for now they can only pray for peace

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.887
and hope those prayers are heard.

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:49.495
Our Ben Wedeman joins us now from Beirut.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.931
Ben, I want you to pack this for us

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:53.032
because the rhetoric

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:54.968
has definitely changed.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:56.970
There's a sense and major concern

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.671
about potential escalation.

00:03:58.671 --> 00:03:59.539
Israel last week

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.840
approving operational plans

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.609
for potential offensive in Lebanon.

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.776
Netanyahu is saying

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:06.379
they might shift focus to Lebanon.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.382
How are people responding on the ground,

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.717
and what are they reading into this

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:11.851
new rhetoric

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:14.821
about the prospect of a bigger conflict?

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:20.159
Well, people have heard here in Lebanon

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:23.596
for months now, sort of saber rattling,

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.331
coming from Israel.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.899
But I think what has people

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.401
really worried

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:29.702
with was,

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:32.672
what we've heard reported on CNN

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:34.741
that the Biden administration

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:38.478
has expressed its full support for Israel

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.046
in the event

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:41.881
of a full scale

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:44.851
hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel,

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:46.552
which is rather reminiscent

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.154
of the full bodied

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:49.722
support the Americans voiced

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:50.490
at the beginning

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.925
of the disastrous war in Gaza.

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:55.461
So really, that has people worried.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:57.997
And we're already seeing signs of

00:04:57.997 --> 00:04:59.699
of things, for instance,

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.402
cancellations in hotels in Lebanon

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:03.469
in the summer,

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.505
Lebanon is highly dependent on,

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:07.740
members of the Lebanese

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.709
diaspora and tourists

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:10.476
to come here

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:13.713
to bring badly needed hard cash.

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:16.749
There have been many cancellations,

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.752
and at hotels and elsewhere.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.354
we also know that Kuwait,

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:24.357
Sweden and North Macedonia,

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.694
have warned their citizens not to travel

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:28.461
to Lebanon

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.863
under the current circumstances.

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:33.166
And those who are here to leave

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.701
immediately.

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:35.802
this is reminiscent,

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:37.236
of course, of the kind of things

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:40.306
we were seeing back in October last year.

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.607
And finally,

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:44.610
the London Telegraph has put out a report

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:45.411
saying that

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:47.480
the Beirut International Airport

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.880
is being

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.417
used as a storage depot for weapons

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:52.719
by Hezbollah.

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:53.553
Now, Lebanese

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:54.554
officials have come out

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:57.557
and flatly denied that,

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.359
the Minister of Information,

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.526
the Minister of Transport

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:01.828
and the foreign minister

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:05.131
actually led a tour of journalists

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:07.533
and foreign diplomats to show them

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:08.768
there's nothing there.

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:09.936
But people are worried

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.704
that this is a sign,

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:12.672
that, for instance,

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:14.674
there's a target that the Israelis

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:16.042
might hit the airport,

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.310
which is essential

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.112
for this small country,

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:21.914
which only has one international airport

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:22.382
and 90.

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:25.518
Yeah.

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:26.519
Ben Wedeman,

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:27.920
thank you so much for that analysis.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.521
Good to see you.
