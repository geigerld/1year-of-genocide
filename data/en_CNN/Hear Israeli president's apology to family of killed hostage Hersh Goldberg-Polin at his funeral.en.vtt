00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.067
at the white House.

00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:01.735
President Biden

00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:03.169
and Vice President Kamala Harris

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.437
will hold a critical meeting

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:05.005
with the U.S.

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.906
hostage negotiating team

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.708
in hopes of crafting a cease fire

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:10.076
deal to free the people

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.811
Hamas took captive during the October

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:12.579
7th terror

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.747
attack on Israel,

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.483
97 hostages are still being held,

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:18.084
including seven Americans.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.352
Of those Americans, four

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.321
are believed to still be alive.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.422
This weekend's discovery

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:24.224
of six hostages killed in a Hamas

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.926
tunnel underscores the sense of urgency

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.461
Israel calls it, quote,

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.196
cold blooded murder.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:30.830
Minutes ago,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.731
a funeral began

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.466
for the young man on your far

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.402
left Israeli American. Hirsh Goldberg.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.570
Poland, Israel's president,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.573
apologized to the family in his eulogy.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.210
As a human being, as a father,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.245
and as the president

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:46.346
of the state of Israel,

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.648
I want to say how sorry I am,

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.351
how sorry I am, that we

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.354
didn't protect others on that dark today.

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:56.656
I'm sorry I am

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:59.392
that we failed to bring him home

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:02.395
in his life and in his death

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.066
touched all of humanity deeply.

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:07.700
He has changed the world

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.502
and woven his essence of light

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:10.470
and love

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.439
into the story of the Jewish people

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.408
and into our human story forever.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:19.979
This morning I saw a clip of a vigil.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.549
It took place in New York last night,

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.552
appropriate that the crowd was singing

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.755
unevenly time, and some of them,

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:32.225
you and I will change the world

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:35.595
for 23 years of life

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:38.665
that we had with you were blessing.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:43.069
We now will work to make your legacy

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.272
a similar blessing.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.008
You are a really great guy.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:49.476
I love you.

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:53.313
For the families of the hostages,

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.648
it has been nearly 11 months of torment

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.183
and agonizing disappointment.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.252
I want to bring in the parents of 20 year

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.520
old Eden Alexander.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.488
He is an American member

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.822
of the Israeli Defense Forces,

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.057
and has been held hostage

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:04.858
since the

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.693
Hamas terror attack on October

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.995
7th and Yale.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:10.463
Alexander joins joined us

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.631
now from New York.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.134
how is the family holding up?

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.369
yeah. I'll, I'll go to you first.

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.771
And, your response to,

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.141
what's taking place in Israel right now.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.408
Hi. Good morning. Jim.

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:24.644
what happened in Israel

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:27.447
now that everybody at the streets,

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:29.549
there was a strike today?

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.417
Everyone was just screaming

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.419
and being with the family.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.157
And just to make sure that

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.258
they're going to seal

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:38.791
the deal,

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.760
they're going to bring our loved ones

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.128
home.

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:44.564
Safety like, right.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.534
They're doing whatever they can

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:48.768
just to make a noise.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.336
It's not a political issue,

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.672
it's humanitarian issue.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.941
And to see all the crowds

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.944
and on the streets,

00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.445
we are not alone.

00:02:59.445 --> 00:02:59.812
You know,

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:03.583
we are fighting this fight for 332 days.

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.118
It's almost 11 months

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.987
that our son is not with us,

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.489
he's not with the family,

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.791
and we are going to do everything

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.426
in our power

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:14.394
to make it happen

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:15.495
and to bring him home

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:18.498
and to bring the other hostages home.

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:19.465
well,

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:20.200
I just want to say

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.768
that you are definitely not alone.

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:23.002
We're all thinking about you.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:25.438
We're all praying for other safe return.

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:26.506
I do want to play a little bit

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.941
of what President Biden,

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.143
said, just a few moments ago

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:31.311
about all of us. Let's listen,

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:33.079
Mr.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.047
President, if you think

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.114
it's time for prayer,

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:36.883
Prime Minister Netanyahu,

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.618
to do more on this issue,

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:40.286
do you think he's doing enough?

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:42.388
No.

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:43.756
So you hear the president there saying

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:44.257
he doesn't think

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:45.725
the Prime minister is doing enough.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.228
What is your thought on that?

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.029
I think he's absolutely right.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.299
from the get go, the, US government,

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.969
we in touch with the U.S. government.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:56.536
As you know,

00:03:56.536 --> 00:03:58.204
we met Jake Sullivan yesterday

00:03:58.204 --> 00:03:59.739
for 15 times,

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.574
and we don't see the same,

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:04.911
sense of urgency and the same dedication

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:05.812
from the Israelis

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.914
as we see from the Americans.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.849
And, this is devastating.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.919
And it's, actually, very surprising.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.956
Do you think,

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:19.959
what more could be done?

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.194
First of all,

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:24.197
on Netanyahu's government,

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:27.200
they have to stop to move

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.770
the goalpost of the, negotiation.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.272
They have to stop

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.275
to undermine the negotiating team itself,

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.510
and they have to seal the deal.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.245
Enough. It's enough.

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:39.812
Exactly.

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:42.215
They need to bring the hostages back

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:44.150
home. That's it.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.618
It's 11 months.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.053
We don't have time

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:49.088
like we saw on Saturday. What happened?

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:51.057
They murder them over there,

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:52.992
so they need to understand.

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:55.028
That's why we urge them

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.963
since the beginning, that it's.

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:00.433
They don't have time.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.535
They leave it. Hell.

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:04.904
And when you say that Netanyahu

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:06.272
keeps moving the goalposts,

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.741
what do you mean by that?

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:11.210
I mean that I mean by that,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.180
to ramp up additional demand

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:18.084
and, the, Philadelphia,

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:19.218
crossing

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:22.188
as, sticking point of the negotiations.

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:25.358
This is unacceptable.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.493
They put a proposal back in,

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:29.228
May and of May

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:31.264
just stick to this proposal.

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:32.632
They need to move on

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:33.433
and to show us

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.268
that they want the hostages back.

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:38.071
Now, I like

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.138
I don't know,

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:41.841
I don't know if it's going to happened.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:42.408
Right.

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:45.178
And I do want to share some of the essay

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.145
that you both wrote

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:47.080
for the New York Times.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.648
We can show this to our viewers.

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:50.483
It's not just the fear of losing our son

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:52.118
that now keeps us up at night.

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:53.686
It's the fact that his murder

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.788
is becoming the more probable outcome.

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:57.357
And we have no faith in Mr.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.692
Netanyahu's will to change that.

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:01.961
as a parent, reading

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:03.296
that just breaks my heart.

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:07.066
how do you find the hope that Eden

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:07.834
is still alive?

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:10.636
First we have,

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:11.504
some,

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:13.639
eyewitnesses

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.008
that were released back in November

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:18.978
that he's that he alive?

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:21.814
so,

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.015
we just sticking to this

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:24.784
hope that he's a strong.

00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:26.686
He's a strong kid.

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.121
He was a professional swimmer

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:29.088
in high school.

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:31.424
Is like,

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:32.892
we call people flight.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:35.461
And he's a good, like, is amazingly done.

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:36.863
And I'm hoping that is strong.

00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:37.563
And he knows that

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:38.765
we are fighting for him.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:41.768
And he will come back home.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.637
And we're looking at some pictures

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:45.471
of it on now.

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:48.207
And he just looks like a remarkable

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:48.875
young man.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:51.878
tell us a little bit more about him.

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:56.015
he done,

00:06:56.282 --> 00:06:56.716
he done,

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:57.250
I don't know, he's

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.452
got this beautiful smile.

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:02.088
He love, like to be with friends.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.390
He love to party, love to be at,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.925
at the beach.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:09.195
He loved to go to restaurants like this.

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:09.862
Is he done?

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:10.296
You know,

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:12.098
when we've been here in New York,

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.934
we went to art shows like,

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.236
whatever we can to to live life

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:17.737
like this.

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.038
Is he done for us?

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:22.008
And I'm hoping it's going to happen soon.

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:25.278
Like we can reunite the whole family

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.779
and we will continue.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.715
And what has it been like,

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:32.885
being a part of this, community now,

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:34.620
I suppose, of other families

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.622
who are in the same situation.

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:38.124
How do you support one another,

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.725
lean on one another,

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:42.295
to get, try to get through this?

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:42.628
Yeah.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:44.697
We are all big family.

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:46.666
And,

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:49.602
with the lost of heroes on Saturday,

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:50.870
we are devastating.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.804
We were crying.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:54.807
We are broken. We are.

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:57.844
You know, we.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.679
You know, this is really tough.

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:02.682
This is really, really tough.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.118
But at the end of the day,

00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:09.121
you have to have hope in all of this.

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:10.823
Absolutely.

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:11.257
And,

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:14.260
the hope this is what, holding us up.

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:15.828
Hope is mandatory.

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.597
Life is mandatory.

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:21.133
Like, Rachel said and,

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:24.270
but said we don't have a choice.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.671
We are going to continue fighting

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.873
till they all come back.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.377
And what

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:32.745
what would be your message

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:34.647
to Prime Minister Netanyahu?

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.149
you've been very critical of him.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.452
what would be your message

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:40.486
if you could say something

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:41.320
if he were watching,

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.222
if his team was watching,

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:44.390
what would you say?

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.725
He promised us something

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:46.559
on the white House

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.962
in front of Biden and Sullivan last July.

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:51.898
You want to tell him

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:55.034
that he will, proceed the deal?

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.136
But our message.

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:59.005
Do not delay it.

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:01.173
Just do not delay the deal.

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:01.807
Military.

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:03.376
More military pressure

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:06.145
brings more of that. Hostages.

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:07.213
Let's execute

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:10.216
the deal and cross the finish line.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.819
All right, y'all, and Audie Alexander,

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:15.087
parents of Iran.

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:16.956
thank you so much for speaking with us.

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:17.657
As I said earlier,

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:18.558
we're all thinking about

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.458
you and your family

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:20.927
and all of the families,

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:22.361
and praying for the safe

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:23.563
return of those hostages.

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:24.363
Thank you so much.

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:25.531
We really appreciate it.

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:26.532
Thank you for having us.

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:27.233
Thank you. All right.
