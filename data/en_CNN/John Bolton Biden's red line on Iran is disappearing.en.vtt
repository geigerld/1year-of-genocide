00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:00.625
Secretary of State

00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:02.127
Tony Blinken added a surprise

00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:03.878
start to his already packed schedule

00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:04.546
to the Middle East.

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:06.548
He was in Iraq earlier today.

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:07.590
Let's get some perspective

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.925
now from former

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:11.094
Ambassador John Bolton, Donald Trump's

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.013
national security adviser.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.139
Ambassador Bolton,

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.557
thanks very much for being with us.

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.559
What's your view at this point

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.437
on this idea of a humanitarian pause

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.104
in Gaza

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.439
that the Biden administration

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.940
has been talking about?

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.358
That is not something that Prime Minister

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.444
Benjamin Netanyahu wants to hear about,

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.612
but it goes slightly towards

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:30.822
where the Arab leaders

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:31.489
want in the region.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.158
They want a cease fire,

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:34.117
but the Biden administration

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:36.786
is not quite on board with that just yet.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:38.997
Is a humanitarian pause

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:39.789
something in the middle

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:40.665
that that should be

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:41.624
pursued at this point?

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.420
No, I think this is very serious.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.670
I think

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.880
the Biden administration

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.466
is sliding away from its support

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.133
of Israel.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.093
I think nobody's taken into account

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:54.095
how Hamas and

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:54.763
its puppet

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.474
masters in Tehran really are manipulating

00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.017
public opinion

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.227
in the United States and elsewhere.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.812
This is a very serious matter

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:03.897
that's going on here.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.648
And there is no connection

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:07.192
between what Israel is doing

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.778
in the northern part of the Gaza Strip

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:10.987
and opening the border

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.823
for proper shipments of humanitarian aid.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:14.908
This is a problem

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.035
Hamas has caused on both sides,

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:18.787
letting the aid in

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.080
and letting people out

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.581
who want to get out.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.500
So I think Israel is entirely

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.334
justified here

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:24.793
in saying

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:27.170
Hamas is so utterly untrustworthy

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:28.546
that they don't

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:30.673
get the benefit of a humanitarian pause

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:33.093
and certainly not a cease fire.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:33.760
But what about these

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.428
civilian casualties in Gaza

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.055
that are on the rise of ambassador

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:38.431
as the Israeli military

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.059
keeps hitting these these Hamas targets?

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.102
They are

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.895
killing a lot of civilians there.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.230
I mean, we've seen some of the video.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.147
You've seen some of the video

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:47.982
just leaving massive craters

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:50.318
and some very densely populated areas.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:51.486
Children are being killed.

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:52.737
Hospitals are being

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:54.697
flooded with patients.

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:56.199
If you were in the position

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.742
of national security adviser right now,

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.285
would you at least privately say

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.870
to the Israelis

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.288
that they should be more selective

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.581
in their targeting? What do you think?

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:05.708
Well,

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:06.626
I think you have to

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:07.585
think there's evidence

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.379
they're not being selective.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.172
You know, the moral question here

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:14.175
basically centers on who is responsible

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.220
for these civilian casualties.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.597
And the answer is Hamas.

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:21.474
They're the ones that have weaponized

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:22.600
the entire Gaza

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.686
Strip over a 15 year period

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.771
where Israel hasn't even been present.

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.691
They're the ones that put

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.693
their own civilian population

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.319
in jeopardy.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.905
And it would be a cruel irony here

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.240
if the group

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.868
that committed the atrocities on October

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:40.827
the seventh

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.829
by committing further atrocities

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:45.790
is of endangering its own population,

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.126
somehow is allowed to skate free.

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.587
I would call that the terrorists veto

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:52.797
what Israel is doing

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:55.216
and it's always subject to qualification.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.427
But is picking legitimate

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.595
military targets,

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.138
what information tells

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:00.346
it are

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.848
legitimate military targets,

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.601
which it is entitled to do

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.686
in the exercise of its self-defense.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.189
It's not entitled to target civilians,

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:10.356
civilians.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.024
It's picking

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.567
it says it's picking Logitech

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.110
at military targets.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.654
And it's made the decision to

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:19.657
to try and get all civilian casualties

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.951
minimized by giving advance warning

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:23.953
and has made the judgment

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.455
which international law

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.665
permits in armed conflict

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.542
that the military target

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:32.337
is sufficiently serious to justify

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:35.298
the tragic risk of civilian casualties.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.758
And unless somebody can say

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.176
they're doing something else,

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.636
they are entitled

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.179
to do what they're doing.

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.472
And do you think the Israelis though,

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.349
need to at some point,

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.518
perhaps in the near future, make a more

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:49.479
of a transition to ground force,

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.855
ground forces

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.106
conducting house

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:54.192
by house, street by street

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:56.694
searches for Hamas leaders, as opposed to

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:57.862
these bombs

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.197
that some of this bombing

00:03:59.197 --> 00:03:59.864
that has been going

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:00.615
on, these strikes,

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:01.866
these airstrikes that are going on

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.034
which can have

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.369
a pretty heavy civilian toll.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:06.412
Well,

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.914
so so can house by

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.582
house, street by street conflict.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:10.833
I think Israel,

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:12.377
both as a political matter

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.087
and as a moral matter,

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.005
is entitled to try and minimize

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:17.382
its own casualties.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:21.135
I think this focus on on the situation

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:21.636
in Gaza

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:22.637
also obscures

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.305
what's really going on here, as

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:25.723
does all this talk about

00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:28.059
not letting the conflict spread.

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.270
It has already spread.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.230
Well, let's try and summarize

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.856
what's actually happening.

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:36.609
One of America's closest allies

00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:39.696
is under multiple attacks

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.406
and threats of attacks

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.574
by a coalition of some of America's

00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:44.826
greatest enemies.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.995
Now, at least at the political level

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.247
and maybe more, including Russia,

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.416
this is extraordinarily serious.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:54.252
This is not about the Gaza Strip.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:55.378
This is about

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:57.130
the survival of Israel

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.923
and threats to the United States.

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:01.134
And I don't think the administration

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:02.927
either understands it

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.304
or is willing to admit it.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.388
And I think that has

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:07.765
an extraordinarily negative impact

00:05:07.765 --> 00:05:10.351
on our ability to resist this threat.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.270
Let me ask you about this op

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.897
ed that you have in The New York Post.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.065
You said President

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:17.025
Biden is risking

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.359
American lives by refusing

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:19.193
to hold Iran

00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:21.112
responsible for the Hamas

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.406
attacks on October 7th.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:23.906
I mean,

00:05:23.906 --> 00:05:25.199
the president has been standing

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:25.742
pretty shoulder

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:26.784
to shoulder with the Israelis.

00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:28.786
I know you've acknowledged that,

00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:30.830
but do you really want a war with Iran?

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.790
Is that is that the right approach here?

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:35.168
I don't think it's

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.294
a question of what we want.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.503
I think it's a question of what

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:38.212
Iran wants.

00:05:38.212 --> 00:05:40.423
I think there's no doubt here

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.175
that Iran has called the shots

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:42.967
from the beginning.

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:43.509
We don't know

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.845
what their full strategy is.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:46.804
But but the

00:05:46.804 --> 00:05:48.389
the center of this conflict

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.600
is with the mullahs in Tehran.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.101
The administration has said

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:54.312
that they won't tolerate

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.147
attacks on American personnel

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:58.691
by Iranian surrogates, terrorist groups

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.026
in Iraq or elsewhere.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.528
And yet the attacks have continued.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.906
Biden has drawn a red line and the.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:06.491
And it's disappearing

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:07.241
right in front of us.

00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:08.534
I think that does endanger

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.994
American lives.

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.371
Across the region.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.373
We're not talking about

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:14.832
some kind of military option

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:17.627
when it comes to Iran right now. Are you?

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.711
Of course I am.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.047
If if Iranian surrogate groups

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.507
kill Americans,

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.634
the Iranians need to pay a price for it.

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:26.427
They don't take our restraint

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:28.179
as a goodwill gesture.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:29.889
Jim they take it as weakness.

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:32.141
Right.

00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:32.850
But

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.853
knowing what you know about

00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:36.896
the experience

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:37.980
of the Bush administration

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.483
with the Iraq war, the war on terrorism,

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.402
launching a war against Iran,

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.112
entering into a military conflict

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.655
with the Iranians, obviously,

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:46.364
obviously is going

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:50.118
to have major consequences in the region.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.619
Look, nobody wants it.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.162
Israel didn't start this.

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:54.997
We didn't start this.

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:57.166
It's Israel that's under attack now.

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:58.709
It's Americans in the region

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:00.294
that are under attack.

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:02.171
How many are going to be put at risk?

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:03.256
We've been very lucky.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.215
I would have to say

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:07.218
some of the Shia groups in Iraq or

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.344
are incompetent

00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:10.388
would be a polite way to put it.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:12.432
And we haven't had a serious

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:14.475
loss of American life.

00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:16.561
We've had some and some wounded.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.646
But the day could come

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:19.689
when we would see

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.607
significant American casualties

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.651
as a result of the actions

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:26.946
of Iran's surrogates done absolutely

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:27.864
with their knowledge

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.282
and probably direction

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.658
So what do you do then, Jim?

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:32.660
You just say it's too bad, isn't it

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:33.828
too bad?

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.371
Yeah. Let me ask you this. I mean,

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:37.957
that's obviously

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.500
would you have got to go there?

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.001
That's what you're

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:41.085
talking about, a hypothetical.

00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:42.253
Would you retaliate?

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:43.296
I mean, sure it is.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:43.713
That's right.

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.298
But it could happen tomorrow.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.507
Obviously, that

00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:48.009
raises a whole set of issues.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.385
And obviously war options

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:50.178
would be on the table.

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.721
And in a situation

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.347
like that, as you know, Ambassador,

00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:54.348
any American president

00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:55.808
would look at those options

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:57.393
in that kind of situation.

00:07:57.393 --> 00:07:58.352
Let me ask you a couple

00:07:58.352 --> 00:07:59.604
of political questions.

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:00.188
The new House

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:00.688
speaker, Mike

00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:01.814
Johnson, has been tying

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:04.275
aid to Israel to cutting funds

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.193
for the IRA.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.611
Do you agree with that?

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.072
Look, I think that's something

00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:12.200
that Republicans should be doing more of.

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:12.992
I would certainly

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.994
vote in favor of whatever

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.913
aid Israel needs,

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:18.122
but I think we've got to make

00:08:18.122 --> 00:08:18.915
some choices

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.166
reducing domestic

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.584
expenditures, domestic

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.169
welfare expenditures,

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.546
wasteful domestic spending.

00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:28.174
I think the idea that the tying

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.258
the aid to something

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:31.385
that is unpalatable to the president

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.763
may help get the aid to Israel.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.431
These are legislative tactics,

00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:37.600
but I don't see any reason not to be more

00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:39.185
aggressive in that sense.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:40.770
All right.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:41.938
Ambassador John Bolton, thanks

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:42.605
very much for your time.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.107
We appreciate it. Glad to be with.
