00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.134
Breaking news to CNN.

00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:05.739
The Israeli military has just announced
a hostage has been rescued from Gaza.

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:07.440
Jeremy Diamond is following this story.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.443
Jeremy, what do we know?

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:12.078
yeah.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:15.715
We've just learned that,
a hostage who is being held by Hamas

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:20.854
since October 7th has been rescued
in an Israeli military operation.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:25.358
Israeli military just releasing
the details that killed Farhan al-Saadi,

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:28.361
a 52 year old, Bedouin man

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:32.332
from Israel was,
rescued in an operation,

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.736
a joint operation by the Israeli military
and the Israeli, intelligence

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.471
service, the Shin Bet.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.574
they say that he was rescued by Shalit
at 13.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:46.546
That's, the Israeli equivalent
of the Navy Seals, as well as by Air

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.549
Harlem and, Shin Bet forces,

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.986
under the command of the 162nd Division.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:55.622
This happened in the southern Gaza Strip.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:59.993
and that is the extent of the, details
that we have for now.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.597
He's only one of a handful of,
Israeli, hostages

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:08.935
who have actually been rescued in Israeli
military operations in Gaza.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.071
I believe that there have been at least

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.908
six others so far who have been rescued
by the Israeli military.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:18.111
Most of the hostages, of course,
who have actually gotten out of Gaza,

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.081
got out during that November week
long truce.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:24.784
but no doubt that this is incredible
news for his family,

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.620
this 52 year old man, Kaid
Farhan al-Khatib.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.590
He was actually working
as a security guard near

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.560
the Gaza border
on the morning of October 7th.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.729
And that is when he was taken
captive by Hamas

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.799
and whisked away into the Gaza Strip.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.869
He has been there now, for the last,

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.339
ten and a half months
as a captive of Hamas.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.077
So obviously some very rare
and very good news, today, for him

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:55.014
and his family, ten and a half months
in captivity, just incredible.

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:58.751
And of course, we'll, you know,
are awaiting the details of this operation

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:04.991
as to how they were able to pinpoint
where he was, in terms of, you know, the,

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:10.964
the ongoing the, the hostage, release
and ceasefire talks that remain ongoing.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.366
Do you see this

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:17.737
rescue operation impacting the talks
in any way?

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:20.740
Jeremy?

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:23.309
It is really difficult to know the extent

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.111
to which
this will actually impact the talks.

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:28.381
I mean, anytime
something happens on the ground,

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.085
whether it is a strike in Gaza,
a rescue operation or anything else,

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:35.688
it can have some kind of an impact
if not on the talks themselves,

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.491
and certainly
on the psychology of the populations

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.995
that are being represented by the
different parties at the negotiated table.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:45.431
and this will be a boost,
of course, for Israeli morale to see

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:49.369
that another hostage has indeed
been rescued from captivity.

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:53.173
But I think that all of the families
of the hostages are pretty clear eyed

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:57.177
at this point, that they are not counting
on additional Israeli rescue operations

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.479
to get all of their loved ones
out of Gaza.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:03.650
They know and certainly
a big portion of the Israeli government

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.688
knows, that it is ultimately a deal
with Hamas that will lead to the release

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:12.492
of the remaining hostages
and the question is, can that happen

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:16.429
quickly enough for, 
more of them to come home alive

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:20.600
rather than dead, as we have seen a number
of the bodies of Israeli hostages,

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:24.037
some of whom, died only in recent months,

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.373
being brought back to Israel,
in body bags.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:31.110
Sadly, rather than coming home alive,
we know that those negotiations

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.514
are still ongoing
at a technical level in Cairo right now.

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:37.750
the United States has said
that there has been significant progress

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.619
over the weekend towards a deal.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.422
but it is still very difficult to know
whether or not these talks

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:44.224
will actually lead to an agreement

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.626
that would see dozens more hostages
released. Yeah.

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.194
The last rescue that we saw,

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:52.131
happened, in June
where we for captives were released.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:57.170
And that came, amid a major Israeli
air and ground

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.974
offensive where dozens of people,
were killed as a result.

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:05.311
Are we getting any more information
about this hostage rescue operation?

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:05.712
Jeremy?

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.582
As of now, no.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:10.850
I mean, we are looking.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.853
One of the things that I will be looking
for as well is to see,

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:17.523
you know, how heavy was this Israeli
military operation in terms of,

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:20.560
collateral damage
and casualties on the ground?

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.029
We have seen in the past
that when the Israeli military

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:27.533
does carry out these rescue operations,
they tend to, do quite a bit of damage

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:31.304
on the ground, 
bombing the area in order to try and send

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:34.841
their special forces in safely
to rescue these hostages.

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:38.678
But as we saw in the previous instance,
of course, of those four hostages

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:44.384
who were rescued, back in June, dozens
of Palestinians on the ground were killed,

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:48.021
including a number of civilians
who were part of that death.

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:49.055
All right.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:52.458
Jeremy Diamond,
I know this is a developing story, right?

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:56.462
We have, Gideon
Levy with us now from Haaretz.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.497
to talk more about this.

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:01.034
Jeremy, thank you so much, 
for getting up quickly for that report.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:04.037
first off, Gideon,
please give me your reaction

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:08.107
to this latest,
hostage rescue operation.

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:08.574
What do you know?

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.813
First of all, it's a it's a very it's
happy news.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:18.318
I mean, on a humanitarian basis,
everyone is something.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.220
And in this case, it's
a Bedouin of Israel.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.625
I think he got a granddaughter, 
by the time that he was

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:31.364
in, in captivity and, and,
you know, each hostages a whole world.

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:35.001
But it shouldn't change our minds.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:39.172
The hostages will not be released
by such operations

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.908
here and there, here at both the.

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:44.277
They're living hostage.

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:49.315
But the hostages will be released
only in a deal which will end this war.

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.751
There are no shortcuts.

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:55.388
and I'll ask you the question
that I asked Jeremy about, you know,

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:59.625
how do you see
how do you see these rescue operations?

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:00.860
And the last one in June,

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.931
we saw, quite a high number of casualties
on the Palestinian side.

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:10.136
How do you see these hostage
rescue operations potentially impacting,

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.840
the ongoing talks where we know
there are huge sticking points.

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:16.409
First of all, the

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.412
ongoing talks, leading to nowhere.

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.482
So it's not much to put in risk.

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:25.218
But what is in risk, obviously, are lives

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:28.221
of innocent Palestinians
in those operations.

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:30.189
I don't know about this one.

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:34.327
The last operation in which
there were only bodies brought to Israel,

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:37.964
dozens of Palestinians
sprayed in their lives.

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:42.135
And this is obviously unacceptable,
especially when it is

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:46.072
about both these dead bodies
and living hostages.

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:50.076
In this case, I don't know the details yet
because they are not very clear,

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.447
but I hope that not too many Palestinians
in their lives, they don't deserve.

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:58.384
if you are just joining
us, we're following breaking news.

00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:03.089
we have just learned that a hostage
who was abducted by Hamas on October

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:08.161
7th has been rescued, not released,
rescued by the Israeli military.

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:09.729
This happened today.

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.464
his name is Kade.

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:13.499
Farhan. Al Shorty.

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:18.271
he is 52 years old, as we understand it.

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:21.407
And he was rescued by the,

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:25.244
401st Brigade and the Israeli forces.

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:28.915
And moments ago, we heard from a spokesman
from the Israeli government.

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:29.215
Listen.

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:33.586
He's in a stable

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:36.589
medical condition and is being transferred

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:41.027
for medical checks right now
at a Israeli hospital.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.564
His overjoyed family,

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:47.567
has been updated with the details,

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:52.038
and the IDF is accompanying them
at this crucial moment.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:55.374
Israeli security forces will continue

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:58.377
to operate with all means necessary.

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:03.082
All means necessary to bring home
all of our hostages.

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:06.285
This is truly uplifting news.

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:10.122
Everyone that cares about the lives
of our people here in Israel.

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:14.393
And I think right
thinking people around the world,

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:15.995
it's incredible.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.897
But here he is in stable condition.

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:20.900
This is the 52 year old man
who was rescued.

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:23.803
Jim Sciutto is in Tel Aviv,
with the latest.

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:25.404
Hi there Jim. So what do we know?

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:27.740
I know it's early days,
and we're just getting the information

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.077
and a lot of questions about, 
the rescue operation itself.

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:34.113
But what do we know about the
man who is now a free man?

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:36.516
Yeah.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.652
Listen, some rare good news
in this conflict, given that we're close

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:42.855
to 11 months out since the attacks
on October 7th and so many families

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:46.459
in Israel suffering,
waiting for news of their loved ones.

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:50.263
Here's what we know about this
rescued hostage, 52 year

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:52.732
old kid, Farhan al-Khatib.

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.233
He was a Bedouin.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:58.237
and according to the Hostages
Family forum, he was October,

00:08:58.237 --> 00:09:02.208
abducted on October 7th
from a security job at Kibbutz Mugen.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.711
down in the south,
of course, close to Gaza.

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:10.116
you heard the Israeli government spokesman
there saying that his family has now

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:13.986
been given the good news
that he is in stable medical condition.

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:18.558
and, they are continuing to do
medical checks on him at a hospital.

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:23.663
it is, as I say, rare news,
to speak of a live rescue of a hostage.

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:24.830
All these months later.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.302
The last one was on June 8th, when four
hostages were rescued from central Gaza.

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:32.705
This operation, taking place
in southern Gaza, involving both

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:35.808
both regular military units
and Israeli special forces.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:38.978
They have not released further details
as to exactly

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:42.114
how they managed to gain his safety.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.483
but again,
you have to go back to June 8th.

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:47.320
So a number of months
to a successful rescue operation.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.625
Of course, just last week, six hostages,
bodies were recovered from from Gaza.

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:57.129
of course, not the good news
that these hostage families want to hear.

00:09:57.129 --> 00:10:01.734
That leaves the total at 108, 108
that are still remaining there.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:04.870
And Israeli government officials
have acknowledged that many of those 108,

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.874
though they have not specified
a number, are no longer alive.

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:12.144
the Hostage Form
Forum has released a statement

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:15.114
saying that this is nothing
short of miracle.

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:18.517
they go on to say that
military operations alone

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:21.721
cannot be expected to gain the freedom
of all these hostages.

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:25.958
Of course, that speaks to the tension
ongoing here between hostage families

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:29.428
and the government, because hostage
families have been quite impatient for

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:30.429
a deal.

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:34.400
A cease fire and hostage
release deal to gain the release of,

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:38.037
the other remaining hostages,
