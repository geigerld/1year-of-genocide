&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS IS A LIVE LOOK AT THE  RAFAH BORDER CROSSING WHERE  HUNDREDS OF AMERICANS COULD BE  LEAVING GAZA TODAY. ACCORDING TO THIS NEW DEAL  HAMAS, THEY HAVE BEEN TRAPPED  INSIDE THE WAR ZONE FOR WEEKS AS ISRAEL CONTINUES ITS UNRELENTING GROUND ASSAULT. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE  DEVASTATION FROM A SECONDARY  STRIKE IN TWO DAYS ON GAZA'S  LARGEST REFUGEE CAMP. THE IDF SAYS IT WAS TARGETING  HAMAS' COMMAND CENTER, BUT THE  UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS  OFFICE IS WARNING THE HIGH  NUMBER OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES  FROM THE STRIKES ON THE DENSELY  POPULATED CAMP COULD BE A WAR  CRIME. &gt;&gt; HAMAS' DEFENIVE LINES ARE  COLLAPSING AND RETREATING. THIS IS THE LATE HADDEST VIDEO  FROM THE IDF. PRESIDENT BIDEN IS NOW SAYING HE SUPPORTS A HUMANITARIAN PAUSE IN THE WAR TO SAVE HOSTAGES STILL  IN GAZ SA. A PROTESTERS CALLED FOR A  CEASE-FIRE. HE RESPONDED, I THINK WE NEED A  PAUSE. A PAUSE MEANS GIVE TIME TO GET  THE PRISONERS OUT. WE HAVE LIVE COVERAGE ALL  MORNING. PRISCILLA ALVAREZ IS LIVE FOR  US. BUT I WANT TO START WITH  RAPHAEL. MORE AMERICANS WILL BE GETTING  OUT TODAY. WHAT'S THE LATEST IN TERMS OF  PEOPLE GETTING ACROSS THAT  BORDER? &gt;&gt; Reporter: GOOD MORNING, THE  EXPECTATION IS THAT MORE  AMERICANS AND MORE FOREIGNERS IN GENERAL WILL BE ABLE TO PASS  THROUGH A STATE DEPARTMENT  SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED WEDNESDAY  THAT AN INITIAL GROUP OF FOREIGN NATIONALS, INCLUDING U.S.  CITIZENS HAD DEPARTED GAZA AND  MADE IT INTO EGYPT, ALSO HE  DECLINED TO GIVE SPECIFICS ON IF U.S. CITIZENS WERE ABLE TO LEAVE GAZA. HE DID SAY THAT MORE AMERICANS  WOULD BE ABLE TO LEAVE TODAY AND IN THE NEXT DAYS AND THAT THE  STATE DEPARTMENT HAD  COMMUNICATED DIRECTLY WITH  AMERICAN CITIZENS IN GAZA SO  THEY WOULD BE READY TO GO. THERE WAS ALSO CONFIRMATION FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN HIMSELF. HE WROTE WEDNESDAY ON X THAT THE U.S. HAD SECURED SAFE PASSAGE  FOR WOUNDED PALESTINIANS AND FOR FOREIGN NATIONALS TO EXIT GAZA. WE'RE EXPECTING SOME AMERICAN  CITIZENS TO EXIT RIGHT AWAY WITH MORE DEPARTING OVER THE NEXT  COING DAYS. HOW MANY AMERICANS WERE STUCK IN GAZA? AT A SENATE APPROPRIATIONS  COMMITTEE HEARING, SECRETARY OF  STATE ANTONY BLINKEN SAID THERE  WERE APPROXIMATELY 400 PLUS. THEIR FAMILIES, ABOUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE THE IN TOTAL. HE ALSO SAID THERE ARE ABOUT  5,000 OTHER THIRD COUNTRY  NATIONALS IN GAZA WHO WANT TO  GET OUT AS WELL. &gt;&gt; THERE'S BEEN A SECOND STRIKE  SINCE YESTERDAY MORNING, SINCE  WE WERE ON WITH YOU LAST, ON  THAT REFUGEE CAMP BY ISRAEL. HOW ARE THEY EXPLAINING IT AND  DEFENDING IT GIVEN THEY SAID THE FIRST STRIKE TOOK OUT THE HAMAS  TARGET THEY WERE GOING AFTER? &gt;&gt; Reporter: YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES COMMANDER  LAST NIGHT SAID THAT THE PROBLEM HERE IS WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN  FACEING ALL ALONG, HAMAS IS  EMBEDDED IN CIVILIAN  COMMUNITIES, BUILDING THEIR  COMMAND CENTERS, THEIR  INFRASTRUCTURE BEHIND SCHOOLS,  HOSPITALS, AND OTHER CIVIC  CENTERS. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE  TO TARGET THE COMMANDERS AND THE OPERATIVES WITHOUT ANY  CASUALTIES. HE SAID THEY ARE TRYING THEIR  BEST NOT TO HARM ANY CIVILIANS,  SO THEY DO NOT INTEND TO INJURY  ANY CIVILIANS, BUT IT'S A  REALITY THAT THEY ARE FACING IN  THE GROUND. THEY ALSO REITERATED WHAT THEY  SAID A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THAT  THEY HAD ASKED THE CIVILIAN  POPULATION TO LEAVE THOSE COBAT ZONESES IN THE NORTH AND GO  SOUTH, BUT WHAT WE'RE HEARING  FROM RELIEF WORKERS AND DOCTORS  IN THE NORTH IS THAT MANY OF  THESE PEOPLE CANNOT LEAVE, MANY  OF THEM ARE SICK AND BEING  TREATED IN HOSPITALS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FAMILIES  WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET THROUGH. AND THEN AGAIN, THERE'S REALLY  NO SAFE PLACE IN GAZA AT THIS  POINT. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THE REPORTING. &gt;&gt; LET'S GO TO PRISCILLA  ALVAREZ. A PROTESTER IDENTIFIED HERSELF  AND INTERRUPTED PRESIDENT BIDEN  AND CALLED FOR A CEASE-FIRE. &gt;&gt; MR. PRESIDENT? I NEED YOU TO CALL FOR A  &gt;&gt; WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE  PRESIDENT EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS  BEING TOLD TO LEAVE, HE DID  STAND AND ANSWER A COUPLE  QUESTIONS. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE YOU WANTED THE EMOTION AND CALLED FOR A  HAD HE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO SAY  WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HE SAID,  WHAT DOES HE MEAN? &gt;&gt; Reporter: THIS MOMENT REALLY  CAPTURED THE DELL INDICATE  NATURE OF THE CONFLICT AND THE  HEIGHTENED EMOTIONS OF THE WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO NAVIG THE PRESIDENT DID ACKNOWLEDGE  THE REMARKS SAYING, QUOTE, I  THINK WE NEED A PAUSE, A PAUSE  MEANS GIVE TIME TO GET THE  PRISONERS OUT. THAT REFERRING TO THE HOSTAGES  HELD BY HAMAS. SO THE PRESIDENT REALLY  EXTENDING WHAT U.S. OFFICIALS  HAVE ALREADY SAID, WHICH IS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE ISRAEL  ENGAGE IN A HUMANITARIAN PAUSE  TO GET AID INTO GAZA AND TO GET  THE HOSTAGES OUT OF GAZA. BUT THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY,  VERY CAREFUL ABOUT USING THE  TERM CEASE-FIRE, SAYING  CEASE-FIRE, AND EVEN IMPLYING AT ALL THAT THEY ARE TELLING ISRAEL WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO CONDUCT  ITS MILITARY OPERATIONS. SO WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID  LAST NIGHT WAS REALLY AN  EXTENSION OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN  HEARING FROM U.S. OFFICIALS, BUT AGAIN, IT UNDERSCORES HOW  POLITICALLY DIFFICULT THIS IS  FOR THE PRESIDENT. THAT HAPPENING AT A CAMPAIGN  FUNDRAISER IN MINNEAPOLIS. AND ALSO THE PRESIDENT REMINDING THE CROWD THAT THIS IS A  COMPLICATED CONFLICT THAT HAMAS  IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, AND ALSO NOTING THAT HE IS THE GUY  THAT GOT AID GOO GAZA. SO ONE THAT THIS IS FAST MOVING, BUT HE IS THE PERSON TO TALK TO  THESE LOADERS AND TRY TO ARRANGE FOR AID TO GET INTO GAZA AND  WORK TO GET THOSE HOSTAGES OUT  OF GAZA. BUT ALL OF THIS JUST
