00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.301
It appears that Israel is

00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:02.235
setting the stage

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:03.937
for a long feared ground

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:05.605
offensive into Rafah.

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:06.806
The Israeli military

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.908
dropped leaflets urging people

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:10.744
in parts of eastern Rafah

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.879
to evacuate immediately.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:13.947
The IDF calls it

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:15.949
a limited scope operation.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.050
The defense minister

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.051
earlier told troops

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:21.054
to expect intense action and Rafah.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.890
Now many Palestinians are already fleeing

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.724
the area.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:27.727
The southern Gaza city was supposed to be

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:28.928
a safe place

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:29.929
where more than a million

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.998
Palestinians have taken refuge there

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:34.501
after fleeing from other areas.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:35.869
The UN says the area

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.337
where people have been directed to go

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.939
is simply not suitable to live.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:40.874
CNN's Arlette

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.208
Signs is at the white House.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.009
But let's begin with Nic

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.777
Robertson, who's

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.211
following all the developments

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.780
from London now.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.081
Nic,

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.984
this RAF operation was long anticipated.

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:52.352
What are you hearing about

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.421
what Israel is planning to say?

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:55.688
And if this indeed

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.357
is the ground offensive

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.859
that Israel has been warning about.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.161
It has all the hallmarks

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.128
of a ground offensive.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:02.862
And typically

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.264
when Israel has launched

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:05.432
previous ground offensives

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.634
going into Gaza not long after the

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.236
those horrific October 7th attacks.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.039
it took many days before we began

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.741
to get an idea of the scope

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.042
and scale of the operation.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.110
It was a big operation,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.045
but Israel was sort of able to keep it

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.046
pretty much under wraps.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.047
Remembering

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.482
journalists like ourselves

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.451
and other news organizations

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:24.984
are not allowed

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:25.618
by Israel

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:26.753
to go into Gaza

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:27.821
to freely report

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:28.755
and see what's happening.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.924
So there's a level of difficulty

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.192
to to understand

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:33.893
precisely what's happening

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:36.996
in and around Rafah at the moment.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.998
But what is clear,

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.134
these leaflets that the IDF are dropping

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:42.235
are very similar to leaflets

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.070
they've dropped at the heads

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.107
prior to other major military operations.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.809
They've told, Palestinians

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:51.911
and about 12 different,

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.913
blocks of housing.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:55.915
That's about 100,000 people.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.485
The UN estimates to leave their houses

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.520
and go to an expanded, safer area.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.288
And these leaflets, these fliers

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.690
that the IDF are dropping,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.658
tell, tell the residents

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.760
there that their area is going to be used

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.462
as, is going to be

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.564
where an offensive is against terrorists.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.566
And it says that those terrorists

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.168
are going to hide among you.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.503
It's very clear

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.505
that when the IDF goes in that

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:22.342
the scenarios could be it appears like,

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.910
the previous military operations

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.345
where civilians

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.946
get caught up in the operations.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.214
Now, has the operation

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:30.717
military operation actually begun?

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:33.720
It doesn't appear so, but again,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.956
we're we're restricted in what we can see

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.024
and what we can actually

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:40.226
get access to report.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.828
So, we know that

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.463
the negotiations at the moment

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.498
are sort of stalled.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.500
They're not completely broken down.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.470
So is this a last ditch pressure effort

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.839
by, Israel on Hamas

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.741
to, to cede to their terms?

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.009
The gap still remains

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.710
very big at those talks.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.647
So what the UN is describing now and in

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.215
and around the area of Rafah,

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:03.383
where people are being

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:04.617
told to go to these areas

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.152
where there isn't enough food, isn't

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:06.719
enough water,

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.054
isn't enough sanitation,

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:09.556
not the right conditions

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:10.590
for them to go live.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.258
And as we've seen in other operations,

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:15.261
it won't necessarily be safe in these

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:18.364
designated humanitarian safer areas.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:18.798
So the U.N.

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:19.599
is very concerned

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.001
not just about their welfare, physical

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.603
but psychological welfare,

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:27.140
and that this could precipitate panic,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.976
which could mean and in an area

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.845
where there are about 1.5 million

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.080
people living,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.217
that could be a pretty dire consequences.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.151
And Unicef,

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:42.288
Unicef is saying about 600,000 children

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:44.991
there, face a very uncertain time

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:46.125
at this moment.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:47.126
Nic Robertson, thank you.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.428
Let's head over to the white House now.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.429
And Arlette signs.

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.397
What's the view from there

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.099
and what the Biden administration

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.133
is saying about all this,

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:57.136
considering cease fire talks are ongoing

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.705
where the CIA director,

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.374
Bill Burns, is in Doha right now

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:02.508
trying to broker a deal.

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:04.110
Netanyahu has said over and over again

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.511
that deal or no deal.

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:08.715
this ground incursion will go forward.

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:10.016
Yeah.

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:11.251
Amara, there's no question

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.819
that the white House is watching

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.454
these latest moves from Israel

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:15.922
relating to eastern Rafah

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.290
incredibly closely.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.092
It comes as the administration

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:19.692
for months

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.060
now has warned about

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.929
a potential ground operation

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:23.830
in Rafah,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.998
with President Biden

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.799
and others here at the white House

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.101
stressing to Israeli Prime

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:28.868
Minister Benjamin

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:31.271
Netanyahu that they need to ensure

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.139
there is a plan in place

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.440
to ensure the safety

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.643
and evacuation of the more than 1.4

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:38.711
million Palestinian Guineans

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.847
who are in the Rafah area.

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:41.714
at this time.

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:42.849
Now, on Friday,

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.318
we have reported that U.S.

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:45.918
and Israeli

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:47.920
officials had been in conversations

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.791
about Rafah, that Israel provided insight

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.759
into their thinking

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.361
relating to the evacuation of Rafah.

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.030
But sources cautions

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.264
that what was presented

00:04:58.264 --> 00:05:00.066
did not appear to be a final plan,

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:02.368
that there was no full briefing

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:03.670
when it comes to

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.638
what a military operation

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:06.572
would look like.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:07.073
The white House

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.608
certainly has been watching this

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:09.409
with quite

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.510
a bit of concern,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.079
as President Biden's also facing

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:15.114
domestic pressure here at home,

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.749
relating to the way that Israel

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.018
has conducted its campaign in Gaza.

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:21.120
Now, over the weekend, we also learned

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.656
that the U.S. paused a shipment of U.S.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.024
made ammunition

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:25.792
to Israel,

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:28.061
a source familiar with the matter told us

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.762
that this was not due

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:32.565
to this potential operation into Rafah,

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.334
and that this would not impact

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.969
aid going forward to big questions

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.104
about why exactly

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.505
there was that pause in shipment.

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:41.107
Senator Chris Coons,

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:41.407
a key

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:42.408
member of the Foreign Relations

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:43.209
Committee, suggested

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.811
there could have been logistical issues.

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:46.512
But this is all playing out.

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.448
As Nick noted, against the backdrop

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:49.115
of those

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:50.283
hostage

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:52.218
and ceasefire negotiations

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:54.020
that appear to have stalled out

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.821
over the weekend.

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:55.688
CIA director

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:58.057
Bill Burns was on hand in Cairo,

00:05:58.057 --> 00:06:00.760
working as a mediator on this issue.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.328
He then traveled on to Doha,

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:02.795
where he met

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.464
with a guitar Prime minister.

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:05.998
He was set to travel to Israel today,

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.801
but is actually remaining in Doha,

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.503
as the administration

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:11.838
all last week had really been

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:14.140
speaking in quite optimistic tones

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.742
about the prospect of

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.577
a deal coming together.

00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:20.079
But we saw the Israeli and Hamas sides

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:21.614
both really blame each other

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:22.782
for what they viewed

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:24.417
as each other's extreme views.

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.052
So this is something that the white House

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.387
certainly wants

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.755
to try to get an agreement on.

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:29.922
But at the time it appears

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:30.857
that those conversations

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:31.991
are stalled out

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:32.525
doesn't mean that

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.627
they won't get on track at some point.

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:36.229
but also, I would note that today

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.163
President Biden here

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:37.897
at the white House

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:38.965
will be having lunch

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:41.367
with Jordan's King Abdullah.

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:43.136
Abdullah, of course, is a key,

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:44.771
player in the region.

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:45.972
He has warned

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:47.407
and expressed concerns

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.040
about the way

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.941
that this operation

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:50.176
has been conducted in Gaza,

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:51.944
about the humanitarian issues

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:53.079
that are on hand there.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.580
So the president might have a chance

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.881
to hear

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.783
directly from King Abdullah

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:58.017
about his concerns.

00:06:58.017 --> 00:07:00.086
But all of this comes

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.554
as you have big questions

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:02.021
about what

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:04.023
Israel will be doing going forward

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:05.858
when it relates to Rafah, as the U.S.

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:06.826
has been trying to stress

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.461
that they need to take great care

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.229
to ensure the safety of civilians there.

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:10.596
Yeah.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:11.831
so much uncertainty

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:12.598
when it comes to the fate

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:13.299
of the civilians.

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:14.467
Arlette signs at the white House.

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:15.501
Thank you very much.

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:16.602
Now, earlier,

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:17.437
our Max foster

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.938
spoke to Scott Anderson,

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:21.207
the director of Unwra affairs in Gaza.

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:22.608
Unwra is a UN agency

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:23.676
that works to support

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:25.645
Palestinian refugees.

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:27.046
he is currently in Gaza,

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:28.147
and he says people need a

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:30.283
place to escape the fighting

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:32.351
are concerned.

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:32.952
Some 1.4

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:33.820
million people

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.720
that have sought refuge

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.589
from the violence in Rafah,

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.591
people need to be given an opportunity

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.827
to move away from conflict.

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:41.794
if they aren't, I mean,

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:43.229
the results will be catastrophic.

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.665
The impact will be catastrophic.

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.667
to have a fire in such a densely

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.502
populated neighborhoods

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:50.970
that that exists throughout Rafah,

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.405
where I sit and tell us all time,

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:53.406
which is one of the neighborhoods

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:54.941
for to the West,

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:56.742
it's incredibly densely populated.

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:57.977
You see tents and makeshift

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:58.978
plastic structures

00:07:58.978 --> 00:07:59.979
everywhere,

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.214
as if an operation

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:02.715
happened here at any scale.

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:03.516
it's

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:05.084
hard to predict the scale of deaths

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:05.751
other than to say

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.220
it would be catastrophic

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.920
and the impacts

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.855
would be catastrophic

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.990
for people who sought safety here.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.657
The Americans have

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:12.992
obviously warned against

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.062
civilian casualties.

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:20.066
they've given that warning to Israel.

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.067
how much support

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:22.869
you're getting from countries

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.637
other than Israel in your work

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:25.571
to making making

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:28.574
sure civilians are looked after?

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:30.576
I think this is

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:32.378
certainly a concern for everybody,

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:33.613
I think, including Israel.

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:34.780
But innocent civilians

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.416
are not harmed in this conflict.

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:38.718
we've heard very loudly

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:40.186
from the United States, as you mentioned,

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.287
but also many countries

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:42.488
within the European Union

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:44.257
as well as the Gulf states.

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:45.625
So anybody that's a donor here

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.259
or is active

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:47.627
here has the same concern

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:48.661
as the United Nations.

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:49.462
And that is we want

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:51.597
innocent civilians to be kept safe.

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.933
We want children to be kept safe.

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:55.668
And we continue to call on all parties

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:56.702
to the conflict,

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:58.871
to ensure that civilians are safe

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:01.440
and not impacted by ongoing hostilities.
