00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.961
President Biden here in Israel, in Tel

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:03.628
Aviv,

00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:06.172
talking about many different things.

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:06.923
Number one,

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:09.968
that he supports unequivocally Israel

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.302
after that attack

00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:12.345
on October 7th

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.514
and talked about his long history

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:15.974
with supporting this country

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:18.143
all the way back to the 1970s,

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.228
right before the Yom Kippur War.

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:21.521
Talking to Golda meir,

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:22.564
who was the prime minister

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:23.606
at the time, by the way,

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:25.734
the timing of that and the timing of this

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.111
almost exactly the same,

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.863
the anniversary of the

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:30.905
Yom Kippur War,

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:31.740
October 7th,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.743
when the attack happened here.

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:36.995
That has really changed this nation

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.913
and changed his position

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:41.583
as well as changed what it is

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.461
willing to do to Hamas in Gaza.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:45.587
They are trying to,

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:46.838
as all of the Israeli

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.215
officials have said, read

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.468
all of Gaza of Hamas.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.303
I want to bring in our Kaitlan Collins,

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.305
who is standing by and was in the room,

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.182
our David Chalian as well,

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.225
and our Clarissa Ward,

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.644
who is here also in Israel with us.

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:03.313
Caitlin, I'm going to go to you first.

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:04.939
What stood out to you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.399
in hearing from the president?

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.566
I mean,

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.569
this was another unequivocal support

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.946
of of Israel

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:16.326
from the president of the United States.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.286
Yeah, he loves telling that story there.

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:18.787
At the end,

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.205
it was his first time here to

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:21.915
Israel's 1972,

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:22.373
one year

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:23.124
before, of course,

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:25.627
the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:27.378
It had this lasting effect on him.

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:28.046
He often

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:30.006
talks about sitting down with Golda meir

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.091
when she was the prime minister

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:31.883
of Israel.

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:33.593
Obviously, things are very different now.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:34.928
Here he is returning

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.554
as the president of the United States.

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:37.472
Israel is at war.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:38.264
He's the first U.S.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.266
president to visit Israel

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.392
when it is at war,

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:42.602
something that the prime Minister

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.771
Netanyahu noted earlier today.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:45.939
But as the president came out here

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.607
today, Sara, he did make news.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.026
He said that Israel has agreed

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:50.902
to an agreement

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:52.153
to allow humanitarian

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:54.155
aid into Gaza through Egypt.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:54.989
That has been something

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.658
that has been a hold up for

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:57.659
well over a week

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.410
now, despite international talks

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.246
to create some kind of channel

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.163
to allow that aid.

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:02.705
And you've heard

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:03.581
Egyptian officials

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:04.916
say they have trucks

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.668
waiting at that Rafah crossing.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:07.877
That is the only way

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:10.004
to get into Gaza, through Egypt,

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:11.047
waiting to get in.

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:12.132
But it has been held up.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.550
They have blamed the Israelis.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.426
The Israelis have pushed back on that.

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:16.427
The question, of course,

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:17.554
the President Biden did not

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:18.847
note is the timing of that,

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:21.057
when will that aid begin to flow

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:21.850
into Gaza?

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.685
But he did say there is an agreement

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:24.936
and he also said that the U.S.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:27.522
is going to provide $100 million

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.107
in assistance to Gaza

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:30.275
and to the West Bank.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.193
Those are two notable developments

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:33.153
coming out of here.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.279
One thing that we did ask

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.405
President Biden at the end,

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.698
as he did, as you're right,

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.074
he expressed that solidarity

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.868
with Israel once again,

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:40.535
which was something

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.537
his staff previewed on the way over here,

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.164
which was tough questions.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.206
They said he was going to have

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:46.374
for the prime minister.

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:47.834
And when you talk to officials

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:48.251
about what

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.295
those tough questions could be,

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.088
they referenced what's next here.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.840
If Israel does go into Gaza,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.675
if there is that ground invasion,

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.302
what does the timing of that look like?

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:58.928
What is the objective of that

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:01.306
and what happens after that's over?

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.682
You heard Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.433
earlier warning

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.351
that this could be a long road

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.604
to victory was the phrase that he used.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.439
Of course, the question is how long

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.191
and what it looks like after that.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.734
That's President Biden left the room.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.986
He did not answer that question.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.696
He did issue another warning, though,

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.489
about one of his main concerns.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.866
One of the biggest things that I've heard

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:20.408
from officials

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.076
that I've spoken to in recent days,

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:22.869
which is the idea

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.829
that this could escalate into a broader

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.372
regional conflict.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.165
And that is only something

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:27.999
that has become

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.167
really more illuminated

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.585
in the last 24 hours

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.503
since that hospital was hit.

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:33.463
I do want to note

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.297
earlier today,

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.006
the president said

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.633
he did not believe it was Israel

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.176
that was behind that explosion

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.636
at that hospital in Gaza.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:40.386
He said it was someone

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.471
from the other team.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.223
Here he clarified those remarks.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.474
He said he believed that

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.100
based on what he has heard

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.976
and what he has seen,

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.436
that it was an errant rocket

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:50.855
from a Palestinian terrorist group

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.565
so that is an update there

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.524
and a clarification there

00:03:53.524 --> 00:03:54.817
from his earlier remark

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:56.236
that was not very clear

00:03:56.236 --> 00:04:01.032
to what he believes it is.

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:02.659
And that terrorist group

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.826
that he is referring to,

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:05.495
Israel says it was Islamic

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.704
Jihad, not Hamas,

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:07.664
but it is another group

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:08.289
that exists there

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:09.040
that does not believe

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.501
in the existence of Israel itself.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.543
I want to go now.

00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:13.753
Thank you, Caitlin, for that.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:14.254
Stick with us.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.005
I'm going to go now to David Chalian.

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:16.923
David, can you tell us about the

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.967
just the significance that during

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.552
a officially declared war,

00:04:21.552 --> 00:04:23.763
that the president of the United States

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:28.184
came into this country trying to get

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.644
some humanitarian work done,

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.729
coming to just show solidarity,

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.690
but just the significance of of him

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.607
being here

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:35.858
as we have seen rockets

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:36.859
coming into this country

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:38.778
every single day.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.822
And night throughout.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.157
Meantime, there are explosions

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:45.118
going on in Gaza at the same time

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.078
and a huge humanitarian crisis

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.121
going on there.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:48.955
What's the significance

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.416
of him being here now?

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.375
Well, Sara, you

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:55.211
saw the president himself highlighted

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.546
that he was the first president

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.465
to visit Israel in a time of war.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.301
He wanted to make sure

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.760
everybody understood that it is

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.095
indeed a significant move.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.972
And I think it was so clear

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.932
what he was doing throughout his remarks.

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.017
The whole first half,

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.685
as you and Caitlin were discussing,

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:11.853
was that complete

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:12.854
repetition of that

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:16.316
total solidarity with Israel

00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:17.900
standing side by side

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.736
in total support of Israel.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:20.528
And I think

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:21.738
when you talk to folks

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:22.947
around the president,

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:23.865
what they believe

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.241
that position does

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.326
is allow him

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.410
to go into the second

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.453
half of his remarks,

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:31.664
which was to call on the better angels

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:35.293
and the humanitarian sympathies

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:36.461
of the people of Israel,

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:39.756
and not to get to consumed

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:44.135
by their passions and anger in response

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.136
to the terrorist attacks,

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.763
and that they keep in mind

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.431
who they are as a people.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.975
As he was trying to express the need

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.978
for humanitarian assistance, for

00:05:53.978 --> 00:06:01.903
the ability for Israel to

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.237
by urging some restraint.

00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:04.155
And I think when you

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:05.948
when you look at the remarks

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:07.408
and how they were structured,

00:06:07.408 --> 00:06:09.786
you see a president of the United States

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:10.453
doing that

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.163
very thing we've been talking about,

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.624
which is threading a needle here.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.250
Obviously, time will tell.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.668
The future will only tell us

00:06:17.668 --> 00:06:18.920
if that is successful.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.587
But it's clear

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:19.962
that's what

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:21.798
the objective was in its visit

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:22.757
And putting a button

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:26.928
on the visit with these remarks.

00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:27.303
Yeah,

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:29.931
diplomacy is of the utmost importance

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.057
here,

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:34.060
but very, very difficult to actually,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.478
as you put it, thread that needle.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:36.729
I want to go now

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.106
to Clarissa Ward,

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.691
who is here with me in Israel.

00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:42.693
I am curious from your perspective,

00:06:42.693 --> 00:06:43.778
after hearing what you did

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.613
about the humanitarian breakthrough.

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:47.615
Hopefully, although it has not happened

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:48.741
and Gaza by

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:50.076
the hour is getting more

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.369
and more desperate

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.912
for the civilians there.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.705
What how do you think that the

00:06:54.705 --> 00:06:55.957
Arab world,

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.208
you know, Jordan,

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.292
people in Jordan,

00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:00.878
people who are protesting right now

00:07:00.878 --> 00:07:02.505
in Beirut,

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.549
and the response in the West Bank,

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.134
how they're going to react

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:07.510
to hearing

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.719
the president's comments

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:13.683
from Tel Aviv today.

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:14.892
I think the reactions

00:07:14.892 --> 00:07:16.936
will not be positive.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.521
This will be seen as a full

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.148
throated endorsement

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:23.818
of Israel and of Israel's

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:26.529
comportment over the last ten days, which

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:30.283
obviously Arab countries have denounced.

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:32.076
I think there will be a lot of talk

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:34.078
about what wasn't said.

00:07:34.078 --> 00:07:35.955
There was no call for restraint.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:38.958
There was no call for a cease fire.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:39.625
It's important

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.043
to remind viewers

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:43.212
that the leaders of these Arab

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:45.965
countries have many young people

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.300
who are now impassioned

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.885
and outraged and upset

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.428
and are taking to the streets.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:53.055
And so they have to be seen

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:55.099
as taking a hard stance,

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:58.060
as supporting the Palestinian people.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.562
They are also trying,

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.855
just like President Biden,

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:03.316
to thread the needle, if you will.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.567
He did say, as you

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:05.443
mentioned, that

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:07.236
there has been some agreement

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:08.446
on the Israeli side

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.281
to allow the passage of aid

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.575
into Gaza with the

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:15.244
proviso that Hamas does not divert

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:15.828
that aid.

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.872
But he also said that he hoped

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:18.539
that would happen

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:19.957
as soon as possible,

00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:22.960
with no real clarity or sense

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:24.754
of when that might be.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.214
And I agree with David

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.965
that he did issue as well

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:31.969
some gentle warnings to Israel

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:33.846
after the first half of the speech,

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.181
which was all about this

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.058
remarkable display of solidarity

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:37.642
with Israel.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:38.518
He said,

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:41.020
We have felt that rage after 911.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.605
We learned from mistakes

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.398
that were made after 911.

00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:46.067
I believe his quote was,

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.485
while you feel that rage,

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.695
don't be consumed about it.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.739
And make sure that you have clarity

00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:53.366
about your objectives,

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:57.245
that is obviously urging Israel's leaders

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.622
to think very strategically

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.333
and very clearly about what comes next.

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.418
Everybody has been waiting for

00:09:04.418 --> 00:09:05.253
quite some time

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.546
now for this much

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.714
anticipated ground invasion.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.299
There are very real questions,

00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:13.302
I think, being asked by world leaders

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:14.929
from many different countries

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:17.056
about what that looks like,

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.683
what the tangible result

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.184
would be of that.

00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:21.102
The Israelis have said

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.187
they want to essentially dismantle

00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:25.356
and uproot Hamas once and for all.

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:27.108
But still, questions remain.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.776
How do you go about doing that?

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:31.320
Who steps in to fill the void afterwards?

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.489
We have heard previously

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:34.156
President Biden

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:35.533
say in an interview on 60 Minutes

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:36.492
that he does not think

00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:37.535
it would be a good idea

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.538
for Israel to try to rearm, occupy Gaza.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:44.542
And so I think just a subtle warning

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:46.794
that now is also a time to

00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:47.878
take a deep breath

00:09:47.878 --> 00:09:48.921
and think very,

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:50.381
very clearly

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:53.384
about what the next moves might be

00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:55.303
and what the ramifications

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:56.679
of those might be.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:59.140
And also a very stern warning,

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.891
presumably to Iran,

00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:02.977
to Hezbollah, to others in the region

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:04.895
who might be watching this moment,

00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:05.771
he said, who might be

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.064
thinking of attacking Israel.

00:10:07.064 --> 00:10:10.401
He said, quote, Don't, don't, don't.

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:14.572
Sarah.

00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:16.032
Yeah, some incredibly

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.450
salient points from you there.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.368
Clarissa Ward in Ashkelon,

00:10:19.368 --> 00:10:20.828
Caitlin Collins here in Tel Aviv,

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:22.913
and David Chalian in Washington.

00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:24.498
Thank you to you all.
