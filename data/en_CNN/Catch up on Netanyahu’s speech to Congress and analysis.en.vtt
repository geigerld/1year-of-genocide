00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.503
We recently learned from the national

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.605
security director, a director of U.S.

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.741
Director of National Intelligence,

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:08.975
that Iran is funding

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:10.543
and promoting anti-Israel

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:11.678
protests in America.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.314
They want to disrupt America.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.316
So these protesters burn

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:19.319
American flags even on the 4th of July.

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:21.187
And I wish to salute

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.355
the fraternity brothers

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.223
at the University

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:24.557
of North Carolina

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:27.260
who protected the American flag,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.162
protecting the American flag

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:32.132
against these anti-Israel protesters.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:58.858
For all we know,

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.694
Iran is funding the anti-Israel protests

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.630
that are going on

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.432
right now outside this building.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:06.166
Not that many,

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.300
but they're there

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.502
and throughout the city.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:10.503
Well, I have a message

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:12.472
for these protesters.

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.941
When the tyrants of Tehran

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:16.910
who hang gays from cranes

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.811
and murder women

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.578
for not covering

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.180
their hair are praising,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.815
promoting and funding you.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.383
You have officially become

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.285
Iran's useful idiots.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:52.912
Some of these protesters.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:53.880
That's amazing.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.747
Absolutely amazing.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.649
Some of these protesters

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.086
hold up signs proclaiming gays for Gaza.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.621
They might as well hold up

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.624
signs saying chickens for KFC.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.432
These protesters chant

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.968
from the river to the sea.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.936
But many don't have a clue what river

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:19.939
and what sea they're talking about.

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:23.776
They not only get an F in geography,

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:26.779
they get an F in history.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.615
They call Israel.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:31.618
They call Israel a colonialist state.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.320
Don't they know that the land of Israel

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.022
is where Abraham, Isaac,

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.357
and Jacob prayed?

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.592
Where are they on Jeremiah preach,

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:42.595
and where David and Solomon ruled?

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:58.278
For nearly 4000 years.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:00.480
The land of Israel has been the homeland

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.848
of the Jewish people.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.416
It's always been our home.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:05.018
It will always be our home.

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.674
It's not only the campus

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.642
protesters who get it wrong.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:30.810
It's also the people

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.112
who run those campuses.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:36.115
80 years after the Holocaust.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:39.085
80 years after the Holocaust.

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:41.921
The presidents of Harvard, Penn.

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.223
And I'm ashamed to say,

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.959
my alma mater, MIT,

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.760
couldn't bring themselves

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.528
to condemn

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.531
the calls for the genocide of Jews.

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.300
You remember what they said?

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.338
They said it depends on the context.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.807
Well, let me give these

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:03.810
befuddled academics a little context.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:11.117
anti-Semitism is the world's

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:13.052
oldest hatred.

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:14.320
For centuries.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.789
The massacre of Jews was always preceded

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.891
by wild accusations.

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.260
We were accused of everything

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.262
from poisoning wells

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.097
to spreading plagues,

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.164
to using the blood

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:26.733
of slaughtered children

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:29.702
to make Passover martyrs.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.705
These preposterous anti-Semitic lies

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:35.241
led to persecution, mass murder,

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.176
and ultimately to history's

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:39.012
worst genocide. The Holocaust.

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:41.281
Now, just as malicious

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.782
lies were leveled

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.218
for centuries at the Jewish people.

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:46.286
Malicious lies

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.487
are now being leveled

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:50.423
at the Jewish state.

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:52.859
No, no, don't applaud.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:54.727
Listen.

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:56.996
The outrageous slanders that paint Israel

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:59.198
as racist and genocidal

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:01.534
are meant to delegitimize Israel,

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:03.603
to demonize the Jewish state,

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:06.572
and to demonize Jews everywhere.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:07.840
And no wonder,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.075
no wonder we've witnessed

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:11.311
an appalling rise of anti-Semitism

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.713
in America and around the world.

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:15.481
My friends,

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:18.618
whenever and wherever we see

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:20.920
the scourge of anti-Semitism,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.222
we must unequivocally condemn it.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:26.192
And resolute fighting without exception.

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:53.853
And don't be fooled.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:54.954
When the blood libels

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:57.290
against the Jewish state

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.958
come from people who wear

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.961
fancy silk robes and speak in lofty tones

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:05.064
about law and justice.

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:07.100
Here's a case in point.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.967
The prosecutor

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:10.002
of the International Criminal Court

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:12.872
has shamefully accused Israel of eight.

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.907
Americans are still believed

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:16.809
to being held hostage in Gaza

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.311
by the terrorists of Hamas.

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:18.978
Israel

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:20.513
and the United States government believe

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:23.015
that five of those eight are still alive.

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:26.452
Today marks 292 days for parents,

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:27.653
friends and family members

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:28.955
of those hostages

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:30.490
without their loved ones.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.657
Joining us now from Capitol

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:32.458
Hill, Rachel

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:34.060
Goldberg, Poland and John Poland,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.762
they are the parents of the Israeli

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:36.596
American hostage.

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:37.363
Hirsh Goldberg,

00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:37.964
Poland,

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:39.298
along with Republican Senator

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:41.334
Joni Ernst of Iowa.

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:42.535
Thanks to all of you for being here.

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:43.636
Rachel, I'll start with you.

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.471
You and John attended.

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.073
Prime Minister Netanyahu speech.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.508
What was your main takeaway?

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:52.245
Look, as parents of

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.313
one of the American eight,

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:56.082
we were saddened.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.550
We were disappointed.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.752
We really wanted to hear

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:01.421
that the Prime Minister

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:05.291
was on the brink of signing this deal,

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:07.860
or that he was going to announce,

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.362
I have signed

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:12.331
or we are signing right now,

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:14.033
this first phase of the deal,

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:16.369
just to get some movement going.

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.670
And we didn't hear that.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.573
So we are laser focused.

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:21.808
And that's obviously,

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:23.476
as any parent can appreciate

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:26.179
our main objective. We didn't get that.

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:29.081
And so we are

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.083
continuing to be broken

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:32.318
and moving forward

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:34.887
and trying to be hopeful and optimistic.

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:36.389
And John,

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.023
we interview

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:39.292
a lot of hostage families on this show.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.760
and we've heard from many of them

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.028
who believe that

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:43.629
Prime Minister Netanyahu doesn't

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:45.431
actually want a hostage deal

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:46.732
any time soon.

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:47.934
so that the work continues.

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:49.969
He gets to remain prime minister.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.103
I know you're reluctant to wade

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:52.371
into the politics of this,

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.273
but what's your assessment of it all?

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:56.809
My assessment is that the

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:59.111
Prime Minister wants to do a deal.

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:00.313
I think he understands

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.481
that there could be no victory

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.849
without bringing home the hostages.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.717
I think that as the son of an historian

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:05.852
and somebody who himself

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:07.753
appreciates history,

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:08.855
the Prime Minister understands

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.490
that his legacy is going to be

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.890
very much

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.158
shaped by whether or not

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.993
he's able to bring home these hostages.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:16.696
So I know he wants to get this done

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:18.030
as all of the families.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.198
What we're trying to push on

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:22.201
is Doctor King's fierce urgency of now,

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:23.402
and we need this to happen

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:24.570
in the next few days.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.372
We believe there's an opportunity,

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:27.306
and so we hope

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:28.541
that that's going to happen.

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:31.377
And, hopefully today's speech

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:32.612
solidified the support

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:33.779
from both sides of the aisle

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:34.981
that we know has been present,

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:36.716
but that we think that the Prime Minister

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:37.884
is going to take out of Washington

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:38.751
this week,

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:40.653
and it's going to give him the energy

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:41.754
and the

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:43.756
everything he needs to go out

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.958
and get this deal done imminently.

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:46.959
Senator Ernst,

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:47.393
Prime Minister

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:48.494
Netanyahu has been accused

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:49.328
of making the speech

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:51.297
just to shore up support,

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:54.300
back home domestically, back in Israel,

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:55.368
he's also been accused of trying

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.570
to stoke division in the U.S.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.504
domestically because

00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:00.673
obviously his leadership is is,

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:02.341
not universally praised, shall we say?

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:04.977
I think about 80 Democrats from Congress,

00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:05.778
did not attend.

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:06.612
Many of them were

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:08.481
meeting with hostage families.

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.182
how do you see it all?

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:11.717
Well, I do think it's important

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.052
that the Prime minister

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.987
lay out for the United States

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:17.056
what his plan is to return

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.658
not only the American eight,

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:21.294
but also all of the hostages.

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:23.262
And we also did hear a little bit

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:26.299
about the day after plan, what he hopes

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.567
to accomplish

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.036
as soon as the war concludes.

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:32.605
I was able to briefly speak with him

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:34.473
after the speech

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:36.108
and asked him, please,

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:39.211
to get the American hostages home

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:41.147
as quickly as possible,

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:42.214
and he did respond

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:44.550
that they are working on it.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.053
and I also think that the United States

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:48.921
needs to shape and influence

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:49.922
where we can.

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.791
We should not tell Israel

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:53.292
how to run the war,

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:55.428
but certainly we can shape and influence,

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.363
because we cannot forget

00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:59.599
that nearly 40 Americans

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.901
were killed on October 7th.

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:04.437
Eight of them were taken hostage.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:05.871
among those hurt.

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:09.108
So we need to do what we can as America

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:10.776
to help Israel

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:12.545
find a way to win this war

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:14.113
and bring our hostages home.

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:14.680
Well, Senator,

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.849
given the fact that 40 more than 40

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:18.317
Americans were killed on October

00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:19.619
7th and eight

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.120
Americans are being held hostage.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.388
What do you make

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:23.723
of the protesters

00:10:23.723 --> 00:10:25.891
outside the Capitol today?

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:26.926
I don't know what you saw

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:29.829
in terms of images or video.

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:32.164
but an American flag was burned.

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:33.699
somebody's spray painted on the statue

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:34.066
of Columbus

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:34.967
of Christopher Columbus

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:36.502
outside Union Station.

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:39.505
Hamas is coming with one of those,

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:41.540
red, triangles,

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.309
which is a target indication

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.077
for Hamas to hit.

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:48.080
these are presumably Americans,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.682
in the street.

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:50.983
what's your reaction?

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:54.220
Well, we do know that Iran funds a number

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.621
of these demonstrations

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:57.356
through many means and

00:10:57.356 --> 00:10:58.324
and secondary

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.859
and tertiary groups

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:02.862
that claim to be maybe nonprofits.

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:03.829
so I would say

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:05.898
Iran is really stoking

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:08.000
the fire here in the United States.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.101
Let's never forget that

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:10.236
they chant death

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:13.839
to Israel as well as death to America.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.542
it's a really sad situation.

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:17.877
I appreciate that

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:19.412
we have our First Amendment

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:21.213
right to to protest,

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:21.981
but to do it

00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:23.015
peacefully

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:24.450
and not destroying

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.552
other people's property.

00:11:26.552 --> 00:11:28.087
so it's really unfortunate

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:29.221
that we see this,

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:31.590
and I think that many of those protesters

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.924
don't

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:33.059
fully understand

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:35.795
the loss of American life on October 7th.

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:37.430
They probably have no idea

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.898
that eight Americans

00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:40.666
are being helped by Hamas.

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:41.067
Hirsh.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:42.301
We know, was badly

00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:44.937
injured by Hamas on October 7th,

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:47.606
and he has yet to be released.

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:49.141
so I would just challenge

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:50.743
those that are out there protesting.

00:11:50.743 --> 00:11:51.711
Do they truly know

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.312
what they are protesting for

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:56.182
and who they are protesting for?

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:57.149
Rachel, what is it

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:59.685
like for you to see those protesters?

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:00.219
I think,

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:03.122
Senator Ernst, his

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:04.590
interpretation of their ignorance

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.359
is some, I'd say, charitable.

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:09.361
what do you think?

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:09.662
Look,

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:11.864
I think part of living in a democracy

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:13.833
is that you have the right

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:15.901
to express your opinions.

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:18.504
And I don't have to agree

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:19.739
with your opinions,

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.307
and you don't have to agree

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:22.274
with my opinions.

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:24.176
And I think that that is

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:27.847
part of the vibrancy of living in a place

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:29.014
like America,

00:12:29.014 --> 00:12:31.550
where many places in the world,

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.119
you don't have that ability

00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:34.220
to express yourself.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.122
And I do agree with the senator

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:37.123
that unfortunately,

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:39.225
I think many of the people,

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:40.159
not all,

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:42.027
but many of the people protesting,

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:43.129
don't even understand

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:46.298
the core source and the real,

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:50.069
very textured, complicated background

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:53.072
and history of this conflict.

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:56.675
John, tell us about Hersh.

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:57.476
What do you miss most

00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:58.177
about him right now?

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:00.613
So there's so many things

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:01.480
that I miss about Hersh

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.348
all day, every day.

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:04.316
But what it boils down to is

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:05.718
I miss what I would call

00:13:05.718 --> 00:13:07.319
the simple moments in life

00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:08.854
sitting around the dinner table,

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:10.322
sitting at the breakfast table,

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:13.125
just relaxing on the couch at night.

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.995
Hersh is a guy who really is

00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:17.463
universally liked for,

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.631
I would even say loved

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.432
by people of all ages.

00:13:20.432 --> 00:13:22.201
And it's not because he has a need

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:23.903
to be a big personality

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:25.171
or to take over a room.

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:27.072
He doesn't walk in a room and immediately

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.707
make his presence known,

00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:31.577
but he, in not a long period of time

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:32.211
after walking

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:34.046
in, will have made his way

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:37.016
into everybody's hearts. And,

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:38.551
we hope we'll be home soon.

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:40.519
And we always say

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.254
we're not looking to go to Disney World

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:43.289
or anything big.

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:44.757
We want to get him home,

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:47.393
and we want to relax at home quietly

00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:48.527
and with all due respect,

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:50.563
Jake, not be talking to you much more.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:52.231
Right.

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:53.032
Well, I'm not going to

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:53.799
take offense at that

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:54.800
because I know I know how

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.368
you mean it, but,

00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:57.937
we're going to keep covering Hersh

00:13:57.937 --> 00:13:59.104
and the other four Americans

00:13:59.104 --> 00:14:00.573
and the other hostages.

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:03.075
and I know it's not easy to talk about.

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:03.943
I can't imagine what

00:14:03.943 --> 00:14:06.145
you're going through, but but thanks to

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:07.146
thanks to you guys.

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:08.581
And thank you, Senator Ernst,

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:10.416
for talking to us today, I appreciate it.

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:11.150
Thank you.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.784
Thank you.

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:13.185
Here are the names of the five

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:14.520
Israeli American hostages

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.088
thought to still be alive in Gaza.

00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:17.857
20 year old Ethan Alexander.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.658
22 year old Omar Neutra,

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:21.160
23 year old Hirsh Goldberg.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:21.961
Poland, whose parents

00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:23.195
you just heard from

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:26.198
35 year old Siggy Declan and 65 year

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.133
old Keith Samuel Segal,

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:29.602
whose wife we interviewed yesterday.

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:31.971
We do all hope that they get home soon

00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:34.206
and there is peace in the region.

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:35.374
The Israeli Prime Minister,

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:36.609
Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:38.544
just gave a fiery speech

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:39.511
in front of a U.S.

00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:40.412
Congress deeply

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:42.681
divided over the war in Gaza.

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.049
That speech earlier today,

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:44.550
our chief

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.085
national security correspondent,

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:48.287
Alex Marquardt, is joining us right now.

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:48.988
Alex, as you know,

00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:50.456
there was a lot of speculation

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:51.790
about how Partizan

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.358
the speech

00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:55.361
would be like his speech back in 2015

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:56.295
at Congress.

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:57.363
What happened today?

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:57.730
Well, Wolf,

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:58.764
and that's because that speech

00:14:58.764 --> 00:15:00.799
nine years ago was quite bombastic.

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:02.301
And the Obama Biden administration

00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:03.569
was furious afterwards.

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:06.205
This time, it was not nearly as Partizan.

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:07.806
There was a lot of thanks for the U.S.

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:09.875
for their support of Israel, particularly

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:10.976
during this war in Gaza.

00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:11.477
There was a lot of

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:12.578
thanks for both

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:15.481
President Biden and President Trump.

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:17.850
he spent a lot of time Netanyahu did,

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.385
speaking about the hostages

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:20.185
and bringing them home.

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:21.720
Critics of Netanyahu say

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.488
that he's not doing

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:23.622
nearly enough to bring them

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:25.891
home, in fact, that he's delaying it.

00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:27.159
I have just learned, Wolf,

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:30.162
from a source that there are talks about,

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:31.196
getting the negotiations

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:33.265
back up and running early next week

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:34.433
with the top mediators,

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:37.436
including the CIA director, Bill Burns.

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:39.271
Now, as Netanyahu was speaking,

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:40.339
protests were raging on

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:41.373
the streets of Washington.

00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:41.941
And we've seen these

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.076
anti-Israel protests for months.

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:45.511
Netanyahu painted these

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:46.712
anti-Israel protesters

00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:49.782
as supporters of Hamas and pawns of Iran.

00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:50.849
Take a listen.

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:51.817
I think that

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:53.953
I think many anti-Israel protesters,

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.723
many choose to stand with evil.

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.959
They stand with Hamas.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.127
They stand with rapists and murderers.

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.662
You have officially become

00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:06.532
Iran's useful idiots.

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:07.366
Useful idiots.

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:08.534
That's going to be one of the phrases

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:09.568
remembered from this speech.

00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:11.737
Now he is referencing newly released U.S.

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:13.472
intelligence that says

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:15.307
that Iran has been cementing

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:17.242
and financing some of these anti

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:18.811
anti-Israel protests here in the U.S.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:19.745
but that intelligence,

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:21.347
notably Wolf, goes on to say

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:22.081
that Americans

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:23.015
who participate in

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.917
these protests are in good faith,

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:26.719
expressing their views

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:28.220
on the conflict in Gaza.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.388
Now, Netanyahu also pushed

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:31.123
back on the civilian death toll

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:32.224
and the lack of aid

00:16:32.224 --> 00:16:33.325
for Palestinians in Gaza.

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:36.328
Take a listen to this.

00:16:37.563 --> 00:16:38.130
Despite

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.133
all the lies you've heard,

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:43.168
the war in Gaza

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:45.104
has one of the lowest ratios

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:45.871
of combatants

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.206
to noncombatants

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:48.540
casualties

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.342
in the history of urban warfare.

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:52.378
If there are Palestinians in Gaza

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:54.346
who aren't getting enough food, it's

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:56.415
not because Israel is blocking it.

00:16:56.415 --> 00:16:58.050
It's because Hamas is stealing it.

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:00.753
Now, Wolf, a bit of a fact check there.

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:02.488
The the death toll in Gaza

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:04.323
is believed to be close to 40,000,

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:06.392
even if we take out the number of Hamas

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:06.825
militants.

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.293
Israel has argued

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:10.095
that they have killed some 14,000.

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:10.996
The civilian death

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:13.499
toll is still more than 1%

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:15.401
of the overall population of Gaza,

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:16.268
likely higher.

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:18.237
That is shockingly high, Wolf.

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:20.172
As far as the aid goes, U.S.

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:22.107
officials continue to argue that it is

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:23.675
Israel's military operation

00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:25.110
that makes it very difficult

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.079
for the aid to be distributed,

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.580
and has caused a breakdown

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.716
in the security in the Gaza Strip.

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:31.683
Wolf.

00:17:31.683 --> 00:17:34.353
Jonathan, you came from this address.

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:36.455
You were in the hall in the,

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:37.923
the House chamber.

00:17:37.923 --> 00:17:40.926
What was your impression of the speech?

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:44.129
Knowing that he had multiple audiences

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:44.596
there?

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:46.398
Yeah, it was pretty extraordinary, Diana.

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:47.132
I mean, to be there

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:48.500
in the chamber watching

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.968
Prime Minister Netanyahu deliver

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:51.136
those remarks were few things

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:52.237
that stood out for me.

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:54.573
Number one, it was a unity message.

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:55.174
Like, literally,

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:57.376
you had Democrats and Republicans

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.211
standing up and applauding.

00:17:59.211 --> 00:17:59.511
You know,

00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:00.512
I thought there was going to be

00:18:00.512 --> 00:18:01.413
lots of empty seats.

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:02.581
There simply weren't.

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.683
It was a pretty full house.

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:05.551
And he complimented

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:06.985
President Biden and praised him,

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:08.687
as Jamie said, and

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:09.221
of President Trump

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:09.855
of the Abraham Accords.

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:12.724
So he was sort of finding a way to praise

00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:13.325
both sides.

00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:14.359
That's number one.

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:14.993
Number two,

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:16.995
he talked about anti-Semitism.

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:18.130
He talked about what's happening

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.098
on our college campuses,

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:20.699
what's happening in the streets,

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:22.768
and how that is not just about protesting

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.236
policies of the government.

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:25.237
You're seeing people going

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:26.271
after Zionists

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:27.639
and Jews and literally

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:30.008
while he was speaking outside

00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:30.843
the Capitol,

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:31.443
you had people

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:33.112
burning American flags

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.481
in front of Union Station.

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:36.648
I saw signs

00:18:36.648 --> 00:18:38.383
as I came over here to the studio.

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:39.618
People saying things like,

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:42.354
any resistance is justified.

00:18:42.354 --> 00:18:44.022
I mean, comparing that

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:45.757
those kind of that kind of language,

00:18:45.757 --> 00:18:47.025
when you think about the babies

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:47.759
who were burned

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:49.261
and the women who were raped.

00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:50.395
So he talked about that.

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:51.597
That was important.

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:52.331
And then thirdly,

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:54.199
I think he laid out a path forward.

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:55.400
He talked about hostages

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.568
and the needs to get them home.

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:57.769
They talked about what a future

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:58.270
could look like

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.873
for Israel and a demilitarized Gaza,

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:02.040
like a vision of peace.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.475
That, to me was really quite welcome.

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:04.443
But there are a lot of

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:06.512
dozens of Democrats boycotted the speech,

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:07.346
didn't show up.

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:08.280
A lot of those seats

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.181
where the Democrats

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:10.415
would have been seated

00:19:10.415 --> 00:19:11.717
were congressional staffers

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:12.584
just showing up.

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:13.285
They're sitting there.

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:13.519
You know,

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:14.653
there may have been some empties,

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:16.255
but I watched Hakeem Jeffries

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:17.156
stand and applaud.

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:18.290
I watched Chuck Schumer

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.258
stand and applaud.

00:19:19.258 --> 00:19:21.293
I watched almost every Democratic senator

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.294
stand and applaud.

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:24.363
So I hear what you're saying.

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:25.197
But I got to say,

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:27.065
I saw unity in that room.

00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:28.967
I saw him try to appeal to both sides,

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:29.334
and I saw

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:30.802
people from both parties respond.

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:31.069
What you

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:32.571
what you do at

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:35.174
the ADL is try to stamp out hate.

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:36.508
Of course, anti-Semitism,

00:19:36.508 --> 00:19:39.344
some hate against racism, phobia,

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:40.946
Islamophobia, racism, all of it.

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:44.183
How do you think that

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.919
Netanyahu's attempt to do that in

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:49.154
his speech is going to play?

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:51.156
I mean, I was getting a text from,

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:52.558
one American Jew

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:53.525
who said, okay,

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:53.992
it's fine

00:19:53.992 --> 00:19:56.528
to call people useful idiots,

00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:57.162
but how about,

00:19:57.162 --> 00:19:58.564
like, a slight nod to people

00:19:58.564 --> 00:20:01.567
who are genuinely upset about the,

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:03.602
what's happening in Gaza?

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:04.469
Well, I, I'm not.

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:05.370
And understanding

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.738
that you're also seeing

00:20:06.738 --> 00:20:08.407
the signs that you just described,

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:09.908
which is just plain hate.

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:11.376
And he talked about the director

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:12.811
of national intelligence

00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:14.346
acknowledging a few weeks ago

00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:16.815
that Iran is involved in these protests,

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:18.016
something we've been seeing NATO

00:20:18.016 --> 00:20:18.684
for a long time.

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:19.918
But he did something very interesting.

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:21.019
Diana, before

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:22.854
the speech really got started.

00:20:22.854 --> 00:20:24.189
He called out some of the folks

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:25.090
that he had brought over

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.525
as part of his delegation,

00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:28.093
including, for example,

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:29.828
a Bedouin soldier.

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:30.729
Which was interesting cause

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:32.631
I think most Americans don't realize

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:35.701
there are Israeli Muslims in the IDF.

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:38.437
Many had an Ethiopian Israeli soldier

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:41.273
who ran eight miles on October the 7th.

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:42.274
So I point this out

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:43.542
because he demonstrated

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:45.510
the diversity of Israeli society.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.812
I think you pointed this out earlier

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:48.647
in a way that surprised a lot of people.

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:49.715
He could have come with

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:51.416
just decorated Jewish veterans.

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:53.819
He didn't do that.

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:55.420
He brought a more diverse delegation.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.122
And I think that sends a message.

00:20:57.122 --> 00:20:58.357
I just

00:20:58.357 --> 00:20:59.124
to push back

00:20:59.124 --> 00:21:00.025
just a little bit

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:02.594
about about all the unity.

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.563
You know, several Israelis

00:21:04.563 --> 00:21:05.964
from both sides of the aisle

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:07.733
were texting me during the speech.

00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:09.301
And what I heard from them

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:11.837
is that that was, in effect,

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:14.539
a very celebratory speech.

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:17.409
that really does not fit

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:18.944
and that there is an alternate

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.879
reality on the ground

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:21.713
that's going on

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:23.448
both in Gaza and in Israel.

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:24.082
As we know,

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:24.683
in the north,

00:21:24.683 --> 00:21:28.553
60,000 plus Israelis, are displaced.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.989
There has been an extraordinary impact

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:32.190
on the economy.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.025
And then, of course,

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:35.994
there is the devastating reality

00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:38.497
of the number of deaths in Gaza.

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:41.500
Palestinians, the humanitarian disaster.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.803
So, he had a welcome

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:49.408
audience there today, but he did ignore

00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:51.877
what I'm hearing from Israelis

00:21:51.877 --> 00:21:55.781
is a very dire reality on the ground.

00:21:55.881 --> 00:21:56.081
Look,

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.449
there is no question

00:21:57.449 --> 00:21:58.717
that that is an incredibly

00:21:58.717 --> 00:22:00.185
difficult situation.

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:01.653
And every civilian life

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:03.255
lost is a tragedy.

00:22:03.255 --> 00:22:04.356
Every Palestinian

00:22:04.356 --> 00:22:05.691
woman or child

00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:07.426
who is killed inadvertently,

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:09.127
no matter what the IDF tries to do,

00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:10.228
that is a tragedy.

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:11.496
We should mourn every

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:13.165
one of those deaths.

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:15.267
But he talked about, for example,

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:17.135
the dire situation in Gaza

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:18.103
and how they are trying

00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:19.471
to bring in supplies.

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:20.672
He talked about the situation

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:22.140
in the North, like you're pointing out,

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.375
and the need to bring those people

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.276
back to their homes,

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:26.745
60 or 80,000 Israelis.

00:22:26.745 --> 00:22:27.813
And he talked about the need

00:22:27.813 --> 00:22:29.815
to bring the hostages home.

00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:30.048
I know

00:22:30.048 --> 00:22:31.316
at ADL, again,

00:22:31.316 --> 00:22:32.718
we're folks at fighting aid here at home,

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:34.353
but we all wear the dog tags

00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:36.121
because we want these civilians,

00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:37.356
these innocent people back.

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:39.524
Including, by the way, doesn't have a

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:39.991
I think

00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:42.160
maybe it's eight Americans at this point.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.862
So I think he tried to address

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:44.296
that, Jamie.

00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:46.665
But look, if you've lost a child,

00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:47.132
if you are,

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:48.100
I think about my friends,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.668
the Poland I was with the Nazis

00:22:49.668 --> 00:22:50.836
before we came on.

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:53.405
Their their sons are both held in Gaza.

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:56.074
I can't even begin to grasp

00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:57.042
the unspeakable pain

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.276
they deal with every day.

00:22:58.276 --> 00:23:00.245
We have got to get those kids home.

00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:03.081
So I hope they get a deal very fast.

00:23:03.081 --> 00:23:05.283
So we can see on air.

00:23:05.283 --> 00:23:07.185
And we can see Hersh back

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:08.520
home, safe and sound.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.188
And all the hostages, once and for all.

00:23:10.188 --> 00:23:11.223
Hope there's a deal

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:12.758
that will bring those hostages

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:14.359
home as quickly as possible.

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:15.961
Jonathan Greenblatt, thanks very much.

00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:18.597
Jamie, thanks to you as well.

00:23:18.597 --> 00:23:20.198
I want to go to CNN's Miguel Marquez.

00:23:20.198 --> 00:23:22.334
He's been covering the demonstrators

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.136
out there in the streets of Washington.

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:25.537
Jamie, give us a sense

00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:26.638
of what's been going on.

00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:31.176
lots and lots of

00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:32.377
demonstrators and protesters

00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:33.245
throughout the Capitol

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:34.713
around the Capitol building.

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:35.347
But I want to show you

00:23:35.347 --> 00:23:37.315
all of the here at Union Station.

00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:38.984
This is the remnants of one U.S.

00:23:38.984 --> 00:23:40.452
flag that was burned here

00:23:40.452 --> 00:23:41.253
over in the distance.

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:43.155
So you can see the the ashes there.

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:45.190
That's the remnants of another flag.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.857
I want to show you

00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:47.159
sort of the bell over here, though.

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:49.327
The liberty, the copy of the Liberty Bell

00:23:49.327 --> 00:23:51.363
that's out in front of the station

00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:53.231
that's been covered in graffiti.

00:23:53.231 --> 00:23:54.499
And then the Columbus Memorial

00:23:54.499 --> 00:23:57.035
has also been covered in graffiti here.

00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:57.536
And, Jonathan,

00:23:57.536 --> 00:23:59.404
if you can show all three of U.S.

00:23:59.404 --> 00:24:00.772
flags on the three flagpoles,

00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:02.307
massive flagpoles out in front of Union

00:24:02.307 --> 00:24:03.809
Station have been pulled down

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:05.510
and Palestinian flags

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.512
have been put up in their place.

00:24:07.512 --> 00:24:08.947
Most of the protesters

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.048
a few dozen,

00:24:10.048 --> 00:24:12.150
maybe 100 or so, still gathered here.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.952
Most of the protesters have left,

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:14.886
but you can see the number

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:15.821
of police officers

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.556
in front of Union Station.

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:18.390
And I'm looking over

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.491
to across the way here.

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:21.226
And there are lots of

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:23.128
police with shields now

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:24.296
and heavy vehicles.

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:25.330
So it looks like

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.898
most of the protesters are leaving

00:24:26.898 --> 00:24:28.433
and police will come back in

00:24:28.433 --> 00:24:30.302
and bring this place back to order.

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:31.236
Well,

00:24:31.236 --> 00:24:31.770
all right, Miguel,

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.104
let's hope it's peaceful over there.

00:24:33.104 --> 00:24:34.506
Bigo Marquez reporting for us.

00:24:34.506 --> 00:24:36.141
Thanks very much. Now.

00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:37.008
Thank you so much.

00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:37.476
And with us

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:38.977
now is Republican Senator

00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:41.313
John Thune of South Dakota.

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:41.813
Senator,

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:43.114
thank you so much for being here.

00:24:43.114 --> 00:24:44.115
Really great to see you

00:24:44.115 --> 00:24:45.617
and to have you here.

00:24:45.617 --> 00:24:48.420
first, generally speaking, your reaction

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.589
to Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks,

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.591
strong speech.

00:24:52.591 --> 00:24:54.326
And, as as is

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:55.460
usually the case with,

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.261
the Prime minister,

00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:58.630
very well articulated.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:59.664
and I thought he

00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:00.899
he hit all the right points.

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:02.767
Dan, I think the one thing that he needs

00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:04.202
to do for people in this country

00:25:04.202 --> 00:25:05.904
and for that matter, people,

00:25:05.904 --> 00:25:06.905
all around the world,

00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:09.007
is connect the dots back to Iran.

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:10.709
And the fact that Israel

00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:12.010
is the only thing standing

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.012
between Iran and the United States,

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:14.813
which they consider

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:16.181
to be the great Satan.

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:17.949
And so Iran is behind

00:25:17.949 --> 00:25:20.352
all the mining activities in that region.

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.253
whether it's Hezbollah

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:22.287
in the, in the north

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:24.523
or the Houthis in Yemen,

00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:26.825
or Hamas, right there in the Gaza Strip.

00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:28.827
But I thought he was really effective

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:30.228
in in that in particular.

00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:31.563
And also articulating a vision

00:25:31.563 --> 00:25:32.964
of what it could like,

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:34.232
could look like in the future

00:25:34.232 --> 00:25:36.001
if you had an integrated Middle East

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:39.004
and a radicalized, demilitarized,

00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:40.472
Gaza and that,

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:41.406
of course, means that you've got to

00:25:41.406 --> 00:25:42.707
get rid and eliminate Hamas.

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:45.410
I want to get back to

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.978
what you were just talking about.

00:25:46.978 --> 00:25:48.179
Back to the Prime Minister's

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:48.947
speech in a second.

00:25:48.947 --> 00:25:49.981
I'm not sure if you were able

00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:52.317
to hear our reporter, Miguel Marquez,

00:25:52.317 --> 00:25:53.618
who was talking about

00:25:53.618 --> 00:25:55.153
the protesters outside.

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:56.855
Specifically, he was reporting on

00:25:56.855 --> 00:25:58.189
and showing,

00:25:58.189 --> 00:25:59.758
the American flag being lowered,

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:02.060
the Palestinian flag being raised.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.863
We even saw some red triangles.

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.298
we're showing it now.

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:07.399
I don't know if you can see it,

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:09.367
but we even saw some red triangles

00:26:09.367 --> 00:26:11.703
on some of the statues.

00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:13.338
what's your reaction to that?

00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:16.141
Well, I think it's it's disgraceful.

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:17.642
It's, shameful

00:26:17.642 --> 00:26:19.277
and the kind of thing that we shouldn't

00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:20.011
see in this country.

00:26:20.011 --> 00:26:20.512
But again,

00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:22.280
as the Prime Minister pointed out

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.149
today, a lot of these activities

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.783
that are happening here

00:26:24.783 --> 00:26:25.550
in the United States,

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.352
Iran is behind them.

00:26:27.352 --> 00:26:28.887
They are trying to create

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:32.591
tumult and instability and chaos and,

00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:35.327
use in fueling all these protests

00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:36.761
and the violence, particularly

00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:37.929
the anti-Semitic violence

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:39.230
in this country.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.832
that's Iranian activity.

00:26:40.832 --> 00:26:42.968
And that's why they have to be stopped,

00:26:42.968 --> 00:26:43.234
and that's

00:26:43.234 --> 00:26:44.069
why it's so important

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:46.037
that we continue to support Israel,

00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:48.340
including, as the Prime minister said,

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.808
give us the tools faster

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:51.743
and we will finish the job.

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:53.244
they've got to get this, this thing

00:26:53.244 --> 00:26:55.213
over with and,

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:57.115
and send a clear statement to the world

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:58.683
that this kind of behavior

00:26:58.683 --> 00:26:59.417
and the kind of thing

00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:00.785
that we're seeing right here in the U.S.

00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:02.854
and right here in this city today,

00:27:02.854 --> 00:27:04.456
just can't be tolerated.

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:04.823
Senator,

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:07.425
one of Prime Minister Netanyahu's

00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:09.628
predecessors, Ehud Barak,

00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:11.329
who we understand

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:12.297
and we should tell our viewers

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:13.064
who might not know, is

00:27:13.064 --> 00:27:14.532
not from the same party

00:27:14.532 --> 00:27:17.035
as Prime Minister Netanyahu.

00:27:17.035 --> 00:27:18.770
but nonetheless, he has somebody he's

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.939
somebody who has been intimately involved

00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:22.607
in trying to get to peace.

00:27:22.607 --> 00:27:24.042
He almost got there,

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:24.776
when Bill Clinton

00:27:24.776 --> 00:27:25.276
had him

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:26.945
and Yasser Arafat in 2000,

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.513
here in the United States,

00:27:28.513 --> 00:27:29.247
he said

00:27:29.247 --> 00:27:30.815
very, very strongly

00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:33.118
and very clearly to Wolf

00:27:33.118 --> 00:27:34.919
that he does not believe

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:36.688
that Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:38.223
actually wants to end the war

00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:39.557
because it would mean

00:27:39.557 --> 00:27:40.091
the end

00:27:40.091 --> 00:27:43.094
of his own political viability at home.

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:44.729
And that might even mean,

00:27:44.729 --> 00:27:47.232
that hostages stay longer.

00:27:47.232 --> 00:27:48.967
Are you concerned about

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:50.035
I mean, you're politician.

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:52.437
You understand what's going on in Israel?

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:55.306
Are you concerned about the notion

00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:57.142
that Bibi Netanyahu

00:27:57.142 --> 00:27:58.109
isn't trying as hard

00:27:58.109 --> 00:28:01.880
as he can to get this deal because of

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:05.650
his own concerns about his own future?

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.685
I don't think that

00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:07.919
I've met with him in Israel.

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:10.321
I've met with, Ehud Barak in Israel,

00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:11.456
previously as well.

00:28:11.456 --> 00:28:12.691
And obviously they have

00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:13.925
political differences there.

00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:15.527
But those aside,

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:17.662
my sense coming out of this was is

00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:19.297
he is desperate to end this

00:28:19.297 --> 00:28:21.733
because this is putting the lives

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:22.801
of Israeli citizens

00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:24.636
at risk every single day.

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:27.372
He continued to bring back to Iran,

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:29.607
the country that is,

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:32.610
by all accounts, funding and supporting

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:35.580
not just, Hamas in Gaza, but Hezbollah,

00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:38.583
in the north, in Lebanon and,

00:28:38.583 --> 00:28:39.117
the Houthis.

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:40.185
So this is

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:40.719
this was

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:42.454
another really important over

00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:45.690
arching theme, you know, that Netanyahu,

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.492
understandably, has been obsessed

00:28:47.492 --> 00:28:49.694
with the the growth and the strength

00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:51.963
and the determination of Iran

00:28:51.963 --> 00:28:53.364
to eradicate Israel.

00:28:53.364 --> 00:28:55.200
And what he did here

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.668
was to continue to connect

00:28:56.668 --> 00:28:57.769
for an American audience

00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:58.903
and an Israeli audience.

00:28:58.903 --> 00:28:59.571
But Israel

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:01.139
doesn't need to be educated on this,

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:03.274
but more for an American audience

00:29:03.274 --> 00:29:06.211
that Iran isn't just out for Israel.

00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:07.879
Iran is out for American

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:09.280
to topple American democracy.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:09.948
No. That's right.

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:12.150
And he called the protesters

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.285
Iranians useful idiots.

00:29:14.285 --> 00:29:15.186
Relish going

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:17.388
after, the protesters,

00:29:17.388 --> 00:29:19.124
saying that they didn't

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:21.659
realize did not know the history.

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:22.460
You know the context,

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.362
know how oppressive

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:26.431
the Iranian regime is.

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:27.332
And he relished it.

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:28.133
I mean, this was,

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:29.100
you know, he was going

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.903
after these protesters, going after,

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:33.304
the leaders of some of these schools.

00:29:33.304 --> 00:29:35.974
He called them befuddled, academics.

00:29:35.974 --> 00:29:37.609
We're ten months into this conflict.

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:38.743
We're 100 days out

00:29:38.743 --> 00:29:40.445
from a presidential election.

00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:41.312
In some ways,

00:29:41.312 --> 00:29:43.548
the conflict has fallen off the radar

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:44.516
of many Americans.

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:45.917
It's going to start back up, right.

00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:47.585
If you think about what's happening

00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:48.453
in the context

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:50.088
of some of these campus protesters,

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:52.123
they're going to go, back to school.

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:54.259
There's going to be a DNC convention

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:54.993
in Chicago,

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:57.295
expected to be a lot of protesters there.

00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:58.429
So this is very much

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:00.031
going to be top of mind,

00:30:00.031 --> 00:30:01.666
heading into this election.

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:02.767
And we don't quite know.

00:30:02.767 --> 00:30:03.568
We don't have,

00:30:03.568 --> 00:30:04.302
you know, an idea

00:30:04.302 --> 00:30:04.803
yet of what

00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:06.571
Trump would really do in office.

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:08.540
It's something he hasn't really detailed.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.208
And we also don't know,

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:11.309
what a Kamala

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:12.977
Harris administration would do

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:14.012
and how that would be different

00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:15.113
from a Biden administration.

00:30:15.113 --> 00:30:16.114
Think of that reception

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:17.682
he received in the Congress.

00:30:17.682 --> 00:30:18.583
So that was powerful.

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:19.651
It was powerful. Listen.

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.186
And these are Republicans

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:23.054
mostly, a lot of the Democrats income,

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:24.322
although some Democrats were there

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:26.391
and they were standing up and cheering.

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:28.393
And listen, there is a sense,

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:29.294
that Americans do

00:30:29.294 --> 00:30:30.962
need to be more educated

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:32.030
on what's going on

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.698
there, on the history of anti-Semitism,

00:30:33.698 --> 00:30:34.799
on the ways

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:35.600
in which,

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.035
anti-Semitic Semitic tropes

00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:38.102
led to the Holocaust.

00:30:38.102 --> 00:30:39.571
And so there was a teachable

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:40.839
moments, right?

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:42.440
when he was trying to educate people

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.441
in terms of the history.

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:45.510
Jeremy Diamond is in Israel.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.611
And, Jeremy,

00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:49.781
I wanted to ask you about the hostages.

00:30:50.114 --> 00:30:53.551
And I talked to right before this speech

00:30:53.551 --> 00:30:56.321
to the parents of one of the,

00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:58.723
Israeli and American hostages.

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:00.825
Don Alexander.

00:31:00.825 --> 00:31:02.861
And there were they the parents?

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.495
Were there other family

00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:06.297
members of hostages were there?

00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:06.931
We didn't.

00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:09.834
We did see the Prime minister.

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:11.402
call out some of them,

00:31:11.402 --> 00:31:12.837
acknowledge some of them.

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:13.738
And then when it comes

00:31:13.738 --> 00:31:15.940
to the big question that they all have,

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.475
when are my family members

00:31:17.475 --> 00:31:19.978
going to come home? He did promise that.

00:31:19.978 --> 00:31:21.546
But just like David

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:24.048
and Barack were saying, not a lot

00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:25.316
knew that.

00:31:25.316 --> 00:31:26.117
We heard from him

00:31:26.117 --> 00:31:28.152
about getting to that point

00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:30.288
with a deal with Hamas,

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:33.291
with the help of Qatar and America.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.527
Yeah, that's right,

00:31:36.527 --> 00:31:36.961
that I think

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:37.595
the Israeli prime

00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:39.163
minister paid a lot of lip service

00:31:39.163 --> 00:31:40.832
to the issue of the hostages.

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:41.566
He talked about it

00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:43.234
during a section of his speech.

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:43.801
But if you look

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:46.070
at the overall context of the speech,

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.405
the overall content of what

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:49.107
the Israeli prime minister said,

00:31:49.107 --> 00:31:50.675
he talked far, far

00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:52.610
more about achieving victory

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.078
in this war against Hamas,

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:55.813
about destroying Hamas's

00:31:55.813 --> 00:31:57.982
military capabilities and,

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.218
vowing we will fight

00:32:00.218 --> 00:32:01.686
until we achieve victory.

00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:04.689
He said some, a phrase

00:32:04.722 --> 00:32:05.390
like that

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:06.691
a few different times

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:07.625
throughout the speech.

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:08.493
He talked about that

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:09.961
far more than he did.

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:12.063
This ceasefire agreement, which U.S.

00:32:12.063 --> 00:32:14.232
officials, as well as Israeli officials

00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:15.800
have indicated to me in recent

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.436
days, is very much within reach.

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:20.305
One official actually told me

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:21.572
that it's now up to Israel,

00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:22.974
and it's now up to the Israeli prime

00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:24.542
minister, effectively, to decide

00:32:24.542 --> 00:32:26.911
whether or not he actually wants a deal.

00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:28.313
And as Barack was saying there,

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:28.980
the Israeli prime

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.848
minister has told his delegation

00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:32.884
to hold off on traveling,

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:34.986
to, meet with the mediators

00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:36.120
and share Israel's

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.322
latest response

00:32:37.322 --> 00:32:38.056
until after

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:40.224
he meets with President Biden tomorrow,

00:32:40.224 --> 00:32:42.360
effectively pushing off,

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.928
that trip by the delegation

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:45.630
most likely until after Shabbat.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.832
So that would probably be on Sunday.

00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:49.167
But I think beyond that, Dan,

00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:50.835
I think what we also need to do here

00:32:50.835 --> 00:32:51.336
is fact

00:32:51.336 --> 00:32:52.036
check a few key

00:32:52.036 --> 00:32:53.137
things that the Israeli Prime

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:53.871
Minister said

00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:55.807
because he made several claims here

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:56.374
that attempted

00:32:56.374 --> 00:32:57.875
to not only defend the Israeli

00:32:57.875 --> 00:32:59.610
military's conduct in Gaza,

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.412
but that also flew in the face of

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:02.880
many of the facts on the ground

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.382
when he was talking about,

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:05.583
the ICC's claim

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.752
that Israel is starving people of Gaza.

00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:08.286
You know, he

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:09.988
he talked about big numbers of aid

00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:10.488
getting in.

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:11.723
But there is just very,

00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:12.991
very clear evidence.

00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:15.426
You talk to any humanitarian organization

00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:16.961
that actually works on the ground

00:33:16.961 --> 00:33:19.030
in Gaza, the United Nations.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.132
And even when you look at Israel

00:33:21.132 --> 00:33:21.632
in the way

00:33:21.632 --> 00:33:22.767
that they have turned on

00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:25.169
and back off the faucet of aid to Gaza,

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:26.204
there is clear evidence

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:28.639
that Israel has not always allowed enough

00:33:28.639 --> 00:33:29.307
aid in that.

00:33:29.307 --> 00:33:30.875
They have not done enough

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:32.443
to conflict militarily,

00:33:32.443 --> 00:33:33.644
to provide safe routes

00:33:33.644 --> 00:33:35.313
for that aid to get in.

00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:37.081
And you also have to remember that

00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:38.750
ministers, members of his

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.284
of Netanyahu's own government

00:33:40.284 --> 00:33:42.487
called for starving the people of Gaza

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:44.389
in the earliest days of the war.

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:45.623
Then he also made this

00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:47.058
frankly laughable claim

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:48.493
that there are practically

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:50.361
no civilians who were killed in Rafah.

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:51.629
I can think of several strikes

00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:53.097
in which civilians were killed.

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:53.831
So that just doesn't

00:33:53.831 --> 00:33:55.233
even pass the smell test.

00:33:55.233 --> 00:33:57.001
And then he once again cited,

00:33:57.001 --> 00:33:57.635
this West Point

00:33:57.635 --> 00:33:59.203
expert, John Spencer, claiming

00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:00.338
that Israel has the lowest

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:01.672
civilian casualty ratio.

00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:03.508
You talk to any other expert

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:05.343
on the conduct of militaries in warfare,

00:34:05.343 --> 00:34:06.577
including how the United States

00:34:06.577 --> 00:34:08.079
has carried out its campaigns.

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:09.247
And they will all say that

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:11.215
Israel has not taken,

00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:12.750
nearly as many precautions

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.219
as most modern militaries do,

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:16.621
in warfare in Gaza.
