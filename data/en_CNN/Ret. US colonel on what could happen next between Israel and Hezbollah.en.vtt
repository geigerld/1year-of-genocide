00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:05.038
Tonight, the Pentagon is ordering two
American carrier strike groups to remain

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:09.542
in the region after a major flare up
of strikes between Israel and Hezbollah.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.479
Here to help me break it
all down is retired U.S.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.280
Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.851
So let's start with this order
for the Pentagon to have these carrier

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.652
strike groups remain in place.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.321
What is the significance of this?

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:25.258
It's huge, actually, Paula,
because when you look at this part

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:29.162
of the Middle East
and you see Israel here in Lebanon, here

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.564
the eastern Mediterranean
is a perfect jumping off

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:35.335
point for the US to exercise
some degree of influence.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.405
But more importantly,
it also, these carrier strike groups

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.708
also allow the US to collect intelligence
in this area.

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.878
They can provide
tactical intelligence to the Israelis

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.681
so that the Israelis better defend
themselves through the Iron Dome system

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.452
and other systems that they have to
protect themselves from a missile attack

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.721
or any other kind of rocket attack.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.224
Now, we saw attacks coming from
both Israel and Hezbollah.

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:01.428
Talk about the significance
about this exchange.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:06.266
So when you have this is very interesting
because you had Israel,

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.436
of course, doing
preemptive actions in Lebanon.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:12.739
So they would be attacking
areas in the south right along here.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.707
This is where Hezbollah is concentrated.

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:18.044
So what the Israelis did was
they made a preemptive strike

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.579
against all of these areas.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.714
They employed over 100 aircraft,

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:25.318
and these aircraft would go in and attack
these areas.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:29.155
One of the types of aircraft
that they used was this F-35.

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:33.126
They used this along with several other
aircraft, including F-16s, aerial

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:37.964
refueling, to actually conduct operations
in this area.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:41.568
Now, what was important here
was they struck these areas first.

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:46.406
But what Hezbollah was doing
once the Israelis attacked

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:50.343
Hezbollah, attacked targets
or tried to attack targets in Israel.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.514
Now, they weren't able to actually strike
many of the targets in Israel.

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:57.650
And what they were able to do with the
Israelis were able to do was

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.221
they were able to intercept almost
all of the missiles that were coming in

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:05.391
that were going to strike certain military
targets or certain civilian areas.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.659
And that was a key

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.597
element in what what the Israelis
were able to do in this particular case.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.398
Another key question here.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:15.902
What is the possibility
of a possible response from Iran?

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.373
Well, that is something
that is actually quite possible

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:24.577
because, Hezbollah,
this is Lebanon right here,

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:29.048
is of course, concentrated right here,
but they are a proxy for Iran.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.352
Iran has this vast land area right here.

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.554
But we'll remember back in April,

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:39.826
they used over 300 missiles
and rockets and drones to attack

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:44.430
Israel, basically about a thousand miles
from the Iranian border to Israel.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:46.266
And they were able to do this.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:51.204
But all of this was intercepted through
the Iron Dome system that the Israelis

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:55.875
had. And the Iron Dome system
is designed to detect incoming,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.711
missiles, rockets,

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.681
drones and really find out where they are.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:06.286
They kind of have algorithms that predict
exactly where these rockets might strike.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.555
they assess
whether or not that's going to happen.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.824
And when they intercept
this using the Tamir missile, for example,

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:15.295
they will hit the missile, right where,

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.997
at this point,
but they won't hit it directly.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:21.367
What they'll do is
dismissal will blow up in the proximity

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:25.038
of the incoming projectile,
and it will actually take things out.

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:28.408
So when the Iranians,
did this, this strike

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:32.111
back in April,
they loved a lot of stuff in Israel.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.714
but because of the Iron Dome and U.S.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:38.518
intelligence and radar activity,
and allied activity,

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:43.289
they were able to keep all of these,
the Iranian, efforts, really?

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:47.460
They held them at bay and made the Iranian
strike ineffective at that point.

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.697
What are you watching for
over the next 48 hours?

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:54.367
So over the next 48 hours,
one of the key things to look for is

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:56.169
what happens next with Hezbollah.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.471
They're going to be operating
still in this area.

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:01.541
Are they going to use some of the missiles
that they have in the

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:05.845
in the northern area of, of Lebanon,
right in this area right here?

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:11.184
this area is an area where they store
some of their intermediate range missiles.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:15.755
they could launch some of those
just from a tactical military perspective.

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:19.225
but the other thing is
what is happening in the peace talks

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:22.295
which are happening here in Cairo,
are they going to

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:25.298
the ones that are affecting these,
the peace talks affecting Gaza?

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:28.301
Are they going to have any impact on what,

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:31.371
Hezbollah does,
but broadening this out to the region?

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:35.608
what is Iran going to do
if Hezbollah is satisfied?

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.511
Iran might be satisfied,
at least in the short term.

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:42.315
And if the peace talks, actually
bear fruit, Iran might

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:46.452
hold their fire for a while and might not
be acting in an offensive fashion.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:49.455
but that remains to be seen
whether or not they actually do that.
