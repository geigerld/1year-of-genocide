00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.801
HERE TO DISCUSS IS -- Sanam Vakil

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.637
DIRECTOR OF THE MIDDLE EAST

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:05.972
PROGRAM AT LONDON'S CHATHAM

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:06.840
HOUSE THINK TANK.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.941
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.810
DO YOU FEEL, LIKE APPARENTLY

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.644
THE SECRETARY OF STATE DOES,

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:12.846
THAT THINGS ARE REALLY

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:13.947
TEETERING ON THE EDGE RIGHT NOW

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:15.582
IN TERMS OF THE WAR EXPANDING

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:16.816
FROM GAZA AND ACROSS ISRAEL'S

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:18.918
NORTHERN BORDER INTO LEBANON?

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.854
&gt;&gt; THERE IS A DEEP CONCERN.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.556
WHAT IT'S BECOME ALMOST

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:24.758
NORMALIZED, SIMMERING TENSIONS

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:25.859
COULD REALLY BOIL OVER.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.594
THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE ARE.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:28.895
WE'VE HAD ATTACKS COMING FROM

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.565
THE HOUTHIS IN YEMEN THAT HAVE

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.733
ATTACKED MARITIME SHIPPING.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.569
WE HAVE SEEN BACK AND FORTH

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:39.572
BETWEEN HEZBOLLAH AND ISRAEL AT

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:42.575
A DANGEROUS LEVEL DESPITE THE

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.677
REGULAR MESSAGING FROM HASSAN

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:45.812
AS LAURA THAT THERE IS NO

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:46.813
INTENTION OF REGIONALIZE-ING

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:47.647
THIS WAR.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:51.885
ATTACKS AND, SYRIA TAX AND IRAQ

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.621
AND THIS COULD WELL LEAD TO A

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:55.155
MISCALCULATION.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.723
&gt;&gt; CAN I JUST POINTED EMPHASIZE

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.759
WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT NO

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:00.593
STRATA, --

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.762
WE READ-BASED JOURNALIST

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.631
TWEETED THAT HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.833
HAVE SIGNALED REPEATEDLY THAT

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:10.603
THEY WANT TO VOID WAR --

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.605
AT SOME POINT THEY WILL

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:13.106
MISCALCULATE.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.542
THIS WAS AFTER THE

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:16.309
ASSASSINATIONS WE'VE JUST BEEN

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:16.810
TALKING ABOUT.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.579
YOU KNOW THE REGION.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.615
EVERYBODY THINKS THEY HAVE --

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.651
THEY ARE PLAYING A VERY CLEVER

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.554
GAME, TARGETED JUST SO,

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:28.755
CALIBRATED JUST SO.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.791
BUT IS MISCALCULATION SOMETHING

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:32.358
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:34.561
THE ISRAELIS ON THE LEBANESE

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.895
EVERY WENT HAPPENED ACROSS THAT

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.697
BORDER IN 2006, MOST NOTABLY.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:39.699
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE CLEAR RISK AND

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.668
THIS WAS PART OF ANTHONY

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.803
BLINKEN'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:45.672
THIS TRIP.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:48.575
TO MESSAGE THAT ESCALATION IS

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:49.742
NOT AN ANTIBODIES INTEREST.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.678
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY ARE

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.513
TWO DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:55.582
TIMELINES UNDERWAY IN THE

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:56.616
REGION.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.818
NO COUNTRY, NO STATE OR NON

00:01:58.818 --> 00:01:59.819
STATE ACTOR UNDER REGION IS

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.721
REALLY PUSHING FOR ESCALATION.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.790
WHEREAS THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.659
IS TRYING TO RESET IT'S

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.695
DETERRENCE LEVELS SINCE OCTOBER

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:11.564
7TH AND THAT REQUIRES THEM NOT

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.733
ONLY TO TRY AND DECAPITATE

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:17.570
HAMAS LEADERSHIP, WHICH WE KNOW,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.805
94 DAYS ON FROM OCTOBER 7TH,

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:19.973
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.908
BUT ALSO TO TRY TO PUSH BACK

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:23.576
HEZBOLLAH MADE CLEAR THAT

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.578
THEY'RE PORTERS ARE SAFE AND

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:26.846
THAT IS WHAT IS ONGOING RIGHT

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:27.580
NOW.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.583
WHERE IS THE REST OF THE REGION,

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:33.620
UTERINE, YET HEZBOLLAH, BEAT

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.556
THE WIDER ARAB PARTNERS OF THE

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:38.625
UNITED STATES, HAVE NO INTEREST

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:39.859
IN SEEING THIS EXPLODE BECAUSE

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.594
IT COULD TAKE THINGS INTO A NEW

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:41.961
ORBIT.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.696
&gt;&gt; REMIND EVERYBODY, I COVERED

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.665
THE 2006, WAR IT WAS NOT A

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.734
VICTORY BY ISRAEL OR HEZBOLLAH.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.603
AT BEST IT WAS DETERMINED TO

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:51.738
HAVE BEEN FOUGHT TO A DRAW.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:54.541
THERE WAS A U.N. RESOLUTION,

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.576
1701, THAT REQUIRED THEM TO

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:57.277
MOVE BACK FROM DEMARCATED

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:57.644
LANDS.

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:04.517
APPARENTLY NONE OF THEM KEPT TO

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:05.051
THAT COMMITMENT.

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.554
IS THERE A POLITICAL SOLUTION

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:09.355
THAT ACTUALLY CAN REINFORCE AND

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:12.325
DE-ESCALATE THE LEBANON OR

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:15.328
HEZBOLLAH ISRAEL TENSION RIGHT

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:15.662
NOW?

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:18.498
&gt;&gt; HAMAS HOCHSTEIN, ANOTHER

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.366
U.S., OFFICIAL WAS JUSTIN

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.467
LEBANON FOR THIS VERY ISSUE.

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.403
TRYING TO FIND A FACE SAVING

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.338
SOLUTION TO PUSH HEZBOLLAH

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:25.705
BACK.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.774
ACCORDING TO U.N. RESOLUTION

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:30.543
1701, PASSED THE LAW TONY

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:30.910
RIVER.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.446
AND ALSO FIND A FACE EVENING

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:34.547
WAY FOR HEZBOLLAH TO DO THAT.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:37.550
THERE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTIONS

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.352
THAT HEZBOLLAH IS PULLING BACK,

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:40.486
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU SEE

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:42.388
ISRAELIS KEEP PRESSING AND KEEP

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:45.325
STRIKING AT COMMANDERS IN

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:45.725
LEBANON.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.361
THIS MIGHT BE LOW-LEVEL

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.296
ESCALATION, BUT THERE WILL BE,

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:53.499
ONE DAY WHERE THIS GOES TO.

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:54.467
FIRE THIS COULD BE A VERY

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.469
DIFFERENT MORE THAN 2006.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.472
&gt;&gt; THEY SPOKE WHEN ALL OF THIS

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:00.473
FLARED UP TO THE LEBANESE

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:02.375
FOREIGN MINISTER WHO AT THE

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:03.643
TIME WAS IN WASHINGTON, GOING

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:04.777
TO VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE AND

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:05.578
TALK ABOUT THESE TENSIONS.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.448
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID TO ME.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:11.517
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT ANY ESCALATION

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:11.985
IN THE WAR.

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:13.519
WE DON'T WANT WHAT IS HAPPENING

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.687
IN THE SOUTH COULD BE SPREAD

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:15.488
OVER LEBANON.

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:18.358
WE DON'T LIKE A REGIONAL WAR,

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:19.392
BECAUSE IT IS DANGEROUS TO

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:19.826
EVERYONE.

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.661
DANGEROUS TO LEBANON, DANGEROUS

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:26.532
TO ISRAEL AND TO THE COUNTRIES

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:27.133
SURROUNDING ISRAEL.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:28.468
&gt;&gt; HE HAS PRETTY MUCH LAID IT

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.736
OUT, BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:31.304
FOR THE PRIME MINISTER OF THAT

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.505
COUNTRY, AN ALLY OF THE UNITED

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.507
STATES, TO BE SAYING THAT.

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:38.478
HOW DOES ISRAEL, IF IT DOES

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:40.446
BROADEN INTO A BIG, OR HOW DO

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:41.547
YOU SEPARATE A WAR AGAINST

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:43.349
HEZBOLLAH FROM A WAR AGAINST

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.318
LEBANON ITSELF AND THE

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:46.819
WESTERN-BACKED LEBANESE ARMED

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.321
FORCES WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:48.755
TARGETED?

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:51.324
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK YOU CAN,

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:51.724
REALLY.

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.559
&gt;&gt; THE ISRAELIS SAY WE'RE NOT

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.594
STRIKING THE LEBANESE STATE.

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:57.397
&gt;&gt; THIS WILL BE SEEN AS A

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:57.864
BROADER WAR.

00:04:57.864 --> 00:05:00.433
IT IS A WAR THAT WON'T JUST BE

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.402
ABOUT HEZBOLLAH.

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.470
THIS WILL INVOLVE THE WHOLE

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.340
SYSTEM, HEZBOLLAH ITSELF IS

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.508
EMBEDDED INTO THAT SYSTEM AND

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:11.344
IT IS PART OF THE GOVERNING

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.346
SYSTEM, WHETHER THE

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:14.314
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OR THE

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:14.981
LEBANESE LIKE IT OR NOT.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.750
THAT IN ITSELF IS THE PROBLEM.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.519
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:20.019
OF QUESTIONS.

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.521
AND THE TIMES OF LONDON THE,

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:22.622
SUNDAY THE SUNDAY, TIMES YOU

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:23.756
MIGHT HAVE READ, IT THERE'S A

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:24.691
FRONT PAGE ARTICLE BY AN

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:28.394
ISRAELI JOURNALIST WHO TALKED

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:30.363
ABOUT THE STASH OF PAPERS AND

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:32.298
DOCUMENTS AND MAYBE OUR DRIVES

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:33.566
THAT SOME OF THE ISRAELI FORCES

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:36.502
HAD FOUND APPARENTLY IN HIYASSY

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.438
NOIR'S OFFICE.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:42.508
IT TALKED ABOUT HOW, FROM A

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:45.311
COUPLE YEARS AGO, TALKED ABOUT

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:47.313
TRYING TO DISRUPT ANY

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:48.348
NORMALIZATION AT THE TIME

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.449
BETWEEN TURKEY AND ISRAEL.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.420
AND IT TALKED ABOUT THEIR

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.355
STRATEGY.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.558
BEFORE, THERE IS ALSO, I THINK

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:00.393
CHAD AMASSED EVEN PUT THIS OUT,

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:02.395
BROWN WHEN MATT EXCUSE TO BE A

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:03.329
JOURNALIST HAD INTERVIEWED,

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:06.366
YEARS AGO, THE HAMAS LEADER WHO

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:06.899
IS ASSASSINATED.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:10.336
HE HAD SAID TO HER THAT OUR AIM

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:13.506
IS TO RADICALIZE, IN HER WORDS,

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:14.741
THE PALESTINIAN POPULATION.

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:17.477
SO THAT THEY DO NOT GO TOWARDS

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:17.844
PEACE.

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:22.315
HAMAS WANTS TO DELEGITIMIZED

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:23.416
THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AND

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:26.386
SORT OF DISABLE ANY SENTIMENT

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:26.886
TOWARDS PEACE.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.388
DO YOU THINK THAT IS STILL WHAT

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.422
THEY THINK?

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:33.359
IN WHICH CASE, HOW DOES ONE GET

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:33.793
OVER THIS?

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:35.528
HOW DOES ONE GET TO A DAY AFTER?

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:38.531
&gt;&gt; CERTAINLY THERE ARE ELEMENTS

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:41.401
OF PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP,

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.969
HAMAS LEADERSHIP THAT HAVE MORE

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:43.569
RADICAL SENTIMENTS.

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:50.109
WHERE WE ARE TODAY,

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:52.044
NORMALIZATION HAS SLOWED IF NOT

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:53.112
STOPPED COMPLETELY.

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:55.148
IT WILL BE VERY FAR AND HARD TO

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.249
ACHIEVE WITHOUT A CEASE-FIRE

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.383
AND WITHOUT ATTENDING TO THE

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:59.318
HUMANITARIAN ISSUES ON THE

00:06:59.318 --> 00:06:59.685
TABLE.

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:03.055
AS WELL AS WITHOUT A PLAN THAT

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:05.024
ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:06.192
PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD THAT HAVE

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:07.260
BEEN COMPLETELY ABANDONED.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.163
THAT'S, I THINK, A PRIMARY TASK

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:10.530
HERE.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.031
BUT BEYOND, THAT WHAT IS

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:14.200
URGENTLY NEEDED IS A PATHWAY

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.071
THAT CREATES A PROCESS FOR

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.139
PALESTINIAN LEADERS TO WORK

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.042
TOGETHER FOR REFORM,

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:24.343
ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNANCE WITH

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:27.046
ELECTIONS AT THE END OF THIS

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:27.447
PROCESS.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.316
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PALESTINIANS

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:32.185
THEMSELVES TO ELECT FUTURE

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:36.055
LEADERS SHOULD CERTAINLY BE AN

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:36.656
OPPORTUNITY GIVEN TO

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:38.257
PALESTINIANS, NOT ONE THAT

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.193
THEY'VE HAD FOR WELL OVER TWO

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:40.660
DECADES NOW.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.095
&gt;&gt; THEY HAVEN'T GONE TO

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:43.529
ELECTIONS.

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.198
LAST QUESTION, YOU'RE AN EXPERT

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:47.400
AND A STUDENT OF THE IRAN PIECE

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.401
OF THIS WHOLE PICTURE.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:52.071
IT ALSO SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.272
BE STAYING OUT OF A DIRECT

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:53.773
CONFRONTATION.

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:55.408
HOW LONG CAN THAT LAST?

00:07:55.408 --> 00:08:00.246
WHAT REALLY DOES IRAN WANT OUT

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.214
OF ALL OF THIS?

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:02.348
&gt;&gt; IRAN'S MOTIVATIONS ARE

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:03.249
MULTIPLE.

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.184
ULTIMATELY, THE ISLAMIC

00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:06.185
REPUBLIC HAS ALWAYS BEEN DRIVEN

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:07.220
BY ITS OWN SENSE OF SURVIVAL

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.055
ABOVE ALL AND ITS SECURITY AND

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:10.089
STABILITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:10.523
PARAMOUNT.

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:14.060
IT HAS RELIED ON THE ACCESS OF

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.127
RESISTANCE, THIS NETWORK IT IS

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.262
CULTIVATED AND CREATED OVER A

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:17.230
NUMBER OF DECADES.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.199
AS ITS PRIMARY TOOL OF

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.368
DETERRENCE AGAINST ISRAEL AND

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:23.169
THE UNITED STATES.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.104
TWO COUNTRIES THAT IT HAS

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:26.472
DEFINED AS ITS THREATS IN THE

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:26.873
REGION.

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:30.076
IT WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.377
ACCESS OF RESISTANCE, BUT AT

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:34.046
THE SAME TIME, HERENDA SEE THE

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:35.281
U.S. AS A DECLINING INFLUENCE

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:35.781
IN THE REGION.

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:38.284
HATE DESTABILIZING REGIONAL

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:40.152
INFLUENCE ABOVE ALL.

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:44.156
AND IRAN HAS OVER THE YEARS

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:45.324
RESTORED TIES WITH THE GULF

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:47.226
ARAB COUNTRIES AND IS LOOKING

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:49.262
TO FORGE STRONGER ECONOMIC

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:51.197
LINKAGES AND BE PART OF AN

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:54.100
INTEGRATED MIDDLE EAST AS WELL

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.269
THAT, OF COURSE, IT'S HARD TO

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:57.303
ACHIEVE THIS OPPOSITIONAL

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.038
STANCE WITH THE UNITED STATES,

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.306
ACCELERATING NUCLEAR PROGRAM

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:03.075
AND, OF COURSE, THIS UNDERLYING

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:06.012
TENSION WITH ISRAEL THAT IS, I

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:07.346
THINK, TEHRAN'S CALCULATING IT

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:09.081
WILL INCREASE OVER THIS YEAR IN

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:09.549
PARTICULAR.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.284
&gt;&gt; VERY BRIEFLY BEFORE I LET

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.152
YOU GO, DO YOU THINK THERE IS A

00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:15.154
WAY TO PULL THINGS BACK?

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:17.089
THE ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:18.190
TOLD THE U.S. FOREIGN MINISTER

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.191
TODAY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOME

00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:20.226
KIND OF DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:24.230
&gt;&gt; YES, I THINK THERE IS, AND

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.565
IT BEGINS WITH THE CEASE-FIRE.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:26.299
THAT CEASE-FIRE CAN SET THE

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:28.034
PATHWAY FORWARD TO RELEASE

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:29.135
HOSTAGES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.237
COMPLETELY NEGLECTED, AS GIDEON

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.072
LEVY BROUGHT UP IN YOUR

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:33.673
PREVIOUS INTERVIEW.

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:36.142
BEYOND THAT, OF COURSE, THE

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:38.077
ARAB STATES, PARTNERS OF THE

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:39.211
UNITED STATES, ARE GOING TO

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:40.313
NEED TO PLAY A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:42.048
AND INTEGRAL ROLE IN

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:44.050
GUARANTEEING PALESTINIAN

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.085
SECURITY, ISRAELI SECURITY,

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.087
PROVIDING A BRIDGE TO IRAN AND

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.088
MAKING SURE THEY ARE NOT A

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.356
SPOILER AND WHAT COMES NEXT.

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:52.058
THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:53.326
PROCESS WAITING FOR THE DAY

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:54.126
PROCESS WAITING FOR THE DAY

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:55.261
AFTER TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS A

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.295
BIT TOO LATE TO.

00:09:56.295 --> 00:09:58.197
OR &gt;&gt; SANAM VAKLI, CHATHAM

00:09:58.197 --> 00:09:59.398
HOUSE, THANK YOU INDEED FOR

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:00.766
JOINING US.
