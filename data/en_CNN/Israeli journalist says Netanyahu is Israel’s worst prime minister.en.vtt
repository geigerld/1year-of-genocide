00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.126
President Biden

00:00:01.126 --> 00:00:01.876
is not alone

00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:03.336
in expressing his frustration

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:04.921
over how Netanyahu is conducting

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:05.797
this war.

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:07.424
Many Israelis are also angry

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:08.425
and voicing their outrage,

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.010
holding nightly protests, demanding

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.052
not only that, the Netanyahu

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:12.846
government focus more on a deal

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.848
to bring home the remaining hostages,

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.057
but also many of them

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:16.975
calling for Israel's

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.978
longest serving prime minister in history

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.645
to resign.

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:22.063
My next guest

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:23.023
says, quote, Benjamin

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.107
Netanyahu is Israel's

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.026
worst prime minister ever

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.277
and that Netanyahu's obsession

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.194
with his own destiny

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.654
as Israel's protector

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:33.950
has caused his country grievous damage.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.535
And Angela Pfeifer joins us

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:36.327
now from his ranch.

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:37.537
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:38.288
In your article,

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:38.997
you write that

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:39.497
Prime Minister

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:40.498
Netanyahu, had

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:43.752
he accepted defeat in 2021, perhaps today

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:45.211
he would have been remembered

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:45.920
as one of Israel's

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.338
most successful prime ministers.

00:00:47.338 --> 00:00:49.215
Instead, you write, quote,

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.051
He has brought far right extremists

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.302
into the mainstream of government

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.553
and made himself and the country

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.763
beholden to them.

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:56.514
His corruption is flamboyant

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:57.515
and he has made terrible

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.433
security decisions

00:00:58.433 --> 00:00:59.768
that brought existential danger

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:00.310
to the country

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.936
he pledged to lead and protect.

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:02.479
Above all,

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.481
his selfishness is without parallel.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.024
He has put his own interests

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:09.736
ahead of Israel's at every turn, unquote.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.780
Do you think that Netanyahu is

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.364
dragging this war on out

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:14.783
longer than it needs to be

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:19.370
for his own political survival?

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:19.913
I think that

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:20.663
it's very clear

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:23.666
by now that the way the war is going,

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.793
which on one side

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:27.337
it's now is talking about a total victory

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:30.507
and the need to press on

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.926
to do the operation in

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.553
the way that he's conditioning

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:36.763
a hostage agreement

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.681
or release agreement for it,

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:40.892
for a temporary ceasefire

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:43.311
with some kind of bigger military push.

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:44.270
Well, at the same time,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.022
we're seeing on the ground

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:47.774
that the military isn't carrying out

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.484
that push and is scaling down

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.027
with Israeli forces.

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:52.445
It looks like a recipe

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.864
for a much longer war.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.574
And the main reason for that happening

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:57.909
is that it's in the out

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.619
feels that as long as this war

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.830
is as long as this, we can say that

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.705
the war

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:04.124
it it'll be much more difficult

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.750
for his political opponents

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.335
to demand an early election

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:09.546
which will probably remove him.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.548
So it's just a factual matter

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.800
that Netanyahu's survival as prime

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.720
minister depends on some anti-Arab

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.681
zealots in his cabinet,

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:20.849
Ben-Gvir and Smotrich.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:21.808
Primarily,

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.768
he needs their support to stay in power.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.186
If he alienates them,

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:25.895
they can leave

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.355
and he and there will be a new election.

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:28.690
He'll he'll not have support

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.732
to be prime minister.

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:32.110
How much do you think that's the reason

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.861
that not enough

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:37.657
humanitarian aid is getting into Gaza?

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.242
I don't think that's the main reason.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:41.244
I think the reason that not enough

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:42.370
humanitarian aid got into

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.081
Gaza is a combination of reasons,

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.499
which partly it's

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.625
the trauma that Israelis

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.460
were feeling in the aftermath

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.796
of the of October seven.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:53.381
Partly, it's

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.674
the way that the Israeli military

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.050
was focused

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.718
on them,

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:57.927
on the military campaign,

00:02:57.927 --> 00:02:58.553
and didn't

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:00.555
think that the humanitarian side of

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.265
it was something that they,

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.308
as the army needed,

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:05.435
needed to to prioritize.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.019
And yes,

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:06.728
the third element,

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.731
I think, is this political

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.858
paralysis at the heart

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.026
of Netanyahu's cabinet.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.403
He can't make any major decision

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.155
because he's scared of

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:20.783
angering either the the far right

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:22.452
wing of his government, without whom

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.536
he doesn't have a majority

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.830
or the pragmatic wing.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.874
And, of course, the Biden administration.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.834
That leads to indecision.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.377
And what we're seeing

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.045
now is that

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.297
there needed to be some kind of proactive

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:36.507
take on the humanitarian front

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:38.593
and that that has been absent

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.011
from Israel's decision making.

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.054
And that

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.180
and Netanyahu

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.140
is the man responsible for that.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.225
So President

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.809
Biden had a tough conversation

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:47.769
with Netanyahu

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:48.394
in which he said

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:49.520
it was going to be tough

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.438
for the United States

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:52.398
to continue to support Israel

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.858
if Gaza keeps going the way it is.

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:57.445
The campaign. What do you think

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.656
Netanyahu is going to do?

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.866
Our friend Barak Ravid

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.910
is reporting that

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.536
Biden said out, out and out.

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:06.829
If he doesn't change it, it's

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.000
going to be tough to support you.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.168
Well, that's also what

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:13.461
the White House readout said.

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:15.004
And we saw already

00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:16.005
what Netanyahu did

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:19.676
immediately after his very tough

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.885
phone call with it,

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.929
with the president, that he rushed

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.222
to the Israeli cabinet

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.349
and immediately passed a decision

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.352
to open up the main routes through Israel

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.520
for supplies to Gaza.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.480
This is something that for six months

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.273
the Israeli government

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.399
hasn't done is in the out,

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.609
did this literally within minutes

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:37.610
of speaking to Biden.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.613
So we can see that this call

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.825
had a major effect on the.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.451
But it's interesting that Netanyahu

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.328
rushed to vote at the beginning

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.038
of the cabinet meeting now.

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:50.832
Votes usually take place

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.209
after a debate is is held.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.876
In this case.

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:55.753
The Senate was so scared

00:04:55.753 --> 00:04:57.005
of one of his far

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.756
right ministers written by Ben-Gvir

00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:00.550
who had been delayed and wasn't yet

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.843
at the cabinet meeting

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.177
that he rushed to have the vote

00:05:03.177 --> 00:05:05.138
before Benjamin came.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.515
So on the one hand, he could,

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.183
he hopes, appease Biden

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:10.852
by making those decisions

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:13.229
and the other hand avoid a confrontation

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.064
with one of his partners.

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:15.815
Fascinating.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.108
Anshel Pfeffer, thank you so much.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:17.358
Come back.
