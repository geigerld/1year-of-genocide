00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.934
We want to go now to

00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:03.470
Gaza, because right now in Gaza,

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.372
there is no electricity.

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.307
The head of the power authority tells CNN

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:08.908
that the one power station

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:09.809
has run out of fuel

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.611
and that it's no longer working.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.847
It's part of Israel's promised siege

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.648
of the Palestinian enclave.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:17.584
And of course, the death toll in Gaza,

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:18.351
as we have it,

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:21.421
above 1000 people, injuries

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.390
mounting above 5000.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.058
Now, all this together

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:26.359
making the humanitarian,

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.627
humanitarian situation

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:30.663
there even more dire for civilians.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.033
Gaza's hospitals and morgues,

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.634
we are told, are filling up.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:35.568
CNN's Salma

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.103
Abdelaziz is following the story

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.071
from London.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:38.438
Salma,

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:39.506
tell us what you're learning

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.808
from the Gaza side of this story.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.676
And you've just revealed

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.211
some of those numbers.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.179
More than a thousand

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.815
killed so far, one in ten Gazans over

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.750
nearly a quarter million people

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.185
essentially have been displaced

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.053
from their homes.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.220
Hospitals say

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.655
that they're running on generator power,

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.090
but soon they'll run out of fuel.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.892
Morgues are overwhelmed.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.660
People have nowhere to go in.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.661
All of this

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:04.030
is only the beginning

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.166
of a lengthy conflict.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.333
You heard there from our colleague

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.001
Jeremy Diamond

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.169
speaking about the reservist

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.702
on the ground.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.071
So far, all you're seeing

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.006
is Israel's air assault,

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.575
a continuous battering of the strip.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.477
You haven't yet seen a ground in courage.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.412
And, of course, that's highly expected.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.314
And would only amplify

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:22.215
the suffering there.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.216
It's important to know

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:24.484
that there are about 2 million

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.186
Gazans, 2 million people

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:26.953
who are trapped

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.621
in that tiny coastal strip.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.690
There is even before this conflict,

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.959
a blockade that's existed there

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.561
for more than 15 years.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.495
It imposes

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:36.596
travel restrictions

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.131
that make it nearly impossible

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.933
for most average people to leave.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.468
And you have to remember that

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:42.602
Hamas treats

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.939
Gaza like it is its own back yard.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:48.274
There have been no elections in Gaza

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.109
for many,

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.043
many years now

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:53.012
since Hamas seized control in 2007.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:55.081
So the people there have no say

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.249
in what Hamas does,

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.251
but they absolutely bear

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.320
the brunt of the consequences

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.523
of the consequences of this conflict.

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:04.858
You already have rights groups

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:05.792
ringing the alarm,

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.427
saying that the siege that Israel

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.795
has imposed, cutting off food

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.663
cutting off fuel, cutting off water,

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.465
that that is collective punishment,

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:12.932
that it is

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.001
a violation of international law.

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:17.270
But Israel is undeterred.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.305
The defense minister was on the border

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.840
just a few hours ago

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.542
meeting with Israeli troops, saying

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:23.676
the gloves are off.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.411
There are no restraints.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.714
Gaza will never be the same again.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:29.015
Of course, these words

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.217
are haunting the many families right now

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:32.318
living under bombardment

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.256
Is there any sense now

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:39.459
when we look at these strikes, is Israel

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.529
still giving warning of the strikes

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.765
in advance to allow for civilians to move

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:47.233
from the buildings,

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.301
their homes

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.336
or elsewhere before the bombs drop?

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:52.705
I think what you're referencing

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.073
is the knock on the door.

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:55.975
It's actually a form of strike

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:56.843
that, you know, in

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.678
the past has been used on homes

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.413
to give them some warning.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:01.281
Actually, an Israeli

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:02.949
official was asked about that

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.018
by CNN and his response was,

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:05.585
well,

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.453
Hamas did not give us a knock

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:08.855
before they carried out

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:09.889
their surprise attack,

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.125
before they carried out their assault.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:12.926
So the answer

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:14.227
sort of vaguely there being

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.528
no civilians

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.263
are not being given a heads up.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:19.132
We've also heard eyewitness accounts

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:20.700
of the same on the ground.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.334
Israeli officials

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.669
have also been asked about cutting off

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.671
food cutting off fuel, cutting off water.

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.306
Is this not collective punishment?

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.874
And their response has also been

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.943
we cannot be expected to provide

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:33.713
for the Gaza Strip while we are at war

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.981
with the Gaza Strip.

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.883
And that's absolutely the problem here.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:37.884
Again, 2 million

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:38.384
people

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.852
trapped in this deeply

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:41.387
impoverished enclave

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:42.989
are absolutely caught in the middle

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.524
They have no say

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:45.892
when Hamas fires a rocket,

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.194
but they will get the vengeance for it.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:49.529
And summer,

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:50.697
we've been hearing just awful

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:52.165
stories of people who were in Gaza

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.166
who say you know,

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:53.433
they hear

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:54.200
from the authorities,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.668
go to the south, they go to the south,

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:56.369
and then the south

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:57.437
is hit with airstrikes.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:58.271
They hear from authorities,

00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:59.439
go to the north and in the north.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.106
And so,

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:00.340
you know,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.074
for all of the folks

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.008
that are in Gaza,

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.043
more than 2 million people,

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.878
just just really difficult days ahead.

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.680
Sam Abdul Aziz, thank you, Salma.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.281
And Christiane

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:09.983
is on the other side of the screen.

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:10.650
We can see

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.252
as the sun is setting

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.821
in Gaza, you can see just how dark it is

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:16.022
as they mean

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:18.124
the one and only power station in Gaza.

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:20.493
Reports that the power is out

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:21.461
and generators

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.428
that are there,

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:23.630
they will have

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.431
or will soon be running out of fuel.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:26.165
This is our first

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.501
look at what power out in Gaza

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.036
is going to mean.

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:33.573
And to your point about how civilians

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:35.341
that want to get out of harm's way

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:36.843
want to get out of Gaza,

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:38.011
what they're up against.

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.812
In doing so,

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.581
there are these third party talks

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:42.649
about potentially

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:45.385
getting humanitarian corridors out.

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:47.587
An IDF spokesperson was on with us

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.856
earlier this earlier in the show.

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:52.292
And I asked her where she

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:53.793
where the IDF thinks

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:56.162
that civilians in Gaza should go

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:57.063
if they want to get out

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:58.164
of the out of harm's way.

00:04:58.164 --> 00:04:59.065
Let me play what she said

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:02.001
Of course, I would

00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:02.302
say that

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.203
if they do receive any kind of advance

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:05.772
warning to simply put distance

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:06.506
from where they are

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:07.640
and go somewhere else,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.609
even within the Strip

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:11.311
and beyond that there is another border

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.513
that the Gaza Strip has with Egypt.

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:15.548
And, you know, I can't speak to that

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:17.884
to that situation at this stage,

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.887
just showing kind of

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:21.487
to your point,

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.523
the lack of clarity on exactly

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:24.724
what it's going to look like

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:25.758
going forward.

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:26.726
It's not open.

00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:28.895
The other side is not open.

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:30.296
And the people in Gaza

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:31.864
do not have anywhere to go.

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:32.899
The Israelis have said

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:33.599
they are going to try

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.368
to warn people when they bomb.

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:37.670
But we were talking to a doctor inside

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.905
Gaza last night

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:40.173
who said the warning amounts

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.974
to a sort of a first tap,

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:44.410
the quote unquote, small rocket

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.511
warning people

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.313
and hopefully they can get out in time

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:48.481
before the big ones,

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:51.317
the big bombs come down and and level

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:53.019
the the buildings,

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.587
which is what's happened.

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:56.823
They are, according to the U.N.,

00:05:56.823 --> 00:06:00.026
some 150 or so thousand Gazans

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.994
who've already taken refuge at U.N.

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:03.663
facilities, including UNWRA,

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.131
as it's called, schools

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:06.632
and other such facilities.

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:08.901
But that's only a small percentage.

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:10.036
And I think really,

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.537
it goes to the question

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:12.705
that Sara also asks,

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.107
what is the end game?

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:15.408
Because it is,

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:16.376
for instance, Hamas

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.310
setting up traps

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.445
for Israeli forces as is being warned.

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:21.114
Does it want to try to drag

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:23.116
Israel into a quagmire?

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:25.752
Does it want to spark a regional conflict

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:28.621
conflagration by doing this

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:29.622
and more importantly,

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:33.259
even if Israel manages to decimate Hamas,

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:34.827
then who takes over?

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:36.562
Does Israel re-occupy?

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:37.230
Who then?

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.864
What then?

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:39.932
There's so many questions,

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:41.401
but Israel's aim right now

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.002
should not be misunderstood.

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:45.738
It is to retain and regain rather

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.640
the deterrence that it

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.275
has lost since Saturday.
