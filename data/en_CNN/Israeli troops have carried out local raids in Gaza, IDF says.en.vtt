00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.101
I want to go back to Israel.

00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.536
CNN's Nic Robertson is live there.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.605
Nic, what are you learning

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.640
Well,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.208
we've just learned

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.709
from the Israeli Defense Force

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.111
that they have put

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:15.115
some troops across the border into Gaza

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.083
in the past 24 hours.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.818
They call it a.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.887
A local.

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:22.956
A local.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:24.758
Looking for the language here.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:27.093
Exactly. A local raid.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.462
And so a limited incursion.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.930
A local raid is a language

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.132
they use

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:33.366
to describe the troops

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.435
that they've sent across into Gaza.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:36.469
It's not clear

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.505
how many they've sent across.

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:39.606
It's not clear yet

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.241
what their mission was.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.242
It's not clear yet

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.110
if that mission was successful.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.178
It's not clear yet

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.213
if they had any casualties.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.249
But this is the first time

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.383
since the weekend,

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.619
since this big buildup of forces

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:53.286
that we've heard

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:56.356
from the IDF, that they have in fact,

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.292
sent troops inside the Gaza Strip.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.561
This, they say, was over the past

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.063
24 hours.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.432
The indication seems to be

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.767
that this was limited.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.136
And the indication seems to be

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.037
that it is over

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:12.605
now that those troops are out.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:13.473
And that would perhaps

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.842
be within the sort of expected operation

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:16.509
or parameters

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.644
for something like this, that

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.512
the IDF would not announce

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.315
something like this while they had forces

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:25.218
over the border inside of Gaza itself.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.288
It really is interesting

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.957
that they did make this public.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.059
And you said very clearly

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.128
that we don't know what the mission is

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:36.129
right now.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.464
I mean, you would think it might be

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.933
twofold. One is to try to get hostages.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.401
Another is

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:42.368
that they located

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.104
some of the of the terrorists

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.572
or some of the

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:46.973
higher ranking

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:48.942
officials in Hamas they are looking for.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:49.209
But

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.212
what does it tell you

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.514
that we know this information right now

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:58.818
There's a

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:00.120
there's another thing to add

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.122
to that mix of what it might be as well.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:06.059
It might be going into recover bodies.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:09.062
It might be going in to recover soldiers

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:12.599
who are who who died over the weekend

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:13.233
and have been

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.001
on the other side of the fence

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.303
It could be as simple as that.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.573
But what it speaks to what it speaks to

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:23.042
is that Israel is more

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.244
and more on a footing

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:26.613
where it can go into this

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:29.048
very dangerous area for troops

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.650
and be ready to protect itself

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.251
and carry out

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.785
a mission that it's indicative

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.220
that there will be more missions

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.321
like this to come.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.490
I think until we get the details of

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.558
precisely what it was,

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:39.692
if it was more than just,

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.828
let's say, a body recovery,

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.597
then then then that that will tell us

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:45.498
that there

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:46.833
that they're really on a forward

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:47.667
footing at the moment.

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.203
Thank you so much for that, Nic.

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.304
I want to bring back

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:52.539
Colonel Cedric Leighton,

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.607
who will hopefully continue

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:55.742
to give us a bit

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.443
bit of perspective

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.612
on what Nic just reported.

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:00.780
What are your thoughts?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.681
So, Dana, the

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.017
the key indicator here is that

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.052
this was a series of small raids

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:06.719
and every single

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.555
one of the options you talked about

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:09.455
a, you know,

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.658
possibly a hostage recovery mission,

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:12.592
possibly

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.661
the business about going after

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.496
the senior leadership of Hamas

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.565
and or the recovery of

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:21.568
the remains of dead Israeli soldiers.

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:23.570
All of those are possibilities.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.538
I am thinking it's either number one

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.540
or two at this point.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.341
In essence,

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:29.642
what they're looking for is

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.511
it would be a perfect thing

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.614
for Israeli intelligence to recover its

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:39.052
lost luster in the wake of the debacle.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.453
On the strategic front,

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:41.754
if they have a good tactical

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.056
intelligence success

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.390
where their special operations

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.458
forces come in

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:47.560
and they actually have

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:49.462
a successful mission, of course.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:50.396
We don't know yet

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:51.331
whether or not the mission

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:52.498
has been successful.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.200
We have no idea,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.669
you know, what the actual targets were.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.303
But it seems

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.405
as if this is the kind of mission

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.140
where special operations

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.342
forces would go in

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:05.845
and have very final find its targets,

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:07.547
finite targets that would go in,

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.716
and they would be able to take

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:10.717
actions on them

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:13.419
and meet limited objectives in that way.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:13.786
Colonel,

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:15.388
I'm just being told in my ear

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:17.890
that the IDF says that they were,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.891
in fact,

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.693
searching for hostages

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:21.794
as part of this raid.

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:24.664
We do not know if that was successful.

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:26.065
Again, what does that tell you

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:27.867
as a former intelligence officer?

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:30.036
So the likelihood is very high

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.471
that we might be disappointed

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.006
with the outcome of this, Dana,

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:34.040
because of the way

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.842
in which Hamas operates.

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:39.912
But we could see hopefully some success.

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.581
But I don't want to give anybody

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:44.050
any false hope at this point in time.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.120
It's very early in this, the IDF.

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.389
If things are successful

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:49.956
at some point,

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.425
the IDF is clearly going to announce

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.460
that they have rescued hostages.

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:55.628
And of course, that would be

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:56.696
a big political

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:58.531
as well as military victory

00:04:58.531 --> 00:04:59.432
for the Israelis.

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:01.134
And it would also clear the way

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.102
for further incursions

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:04.704
from an operational standpoint

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:06.039
on the military side,

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.206
further incursions

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:08.875
of a more conventional nature

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:11.144
if they choose to do them into Gaza

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:12.912
so that, you know,

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:14.614
we're kind of in this environment now.

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:16.282
So if this was a hostage

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.116
rescue mission

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.384
or trying to find out

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:19.952
where the hostages are

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:20.987
that would be a classic

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.622
special operations mission

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:23.723
and it would be something

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:26.059
that would have a high payoff

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.161
for the Israeli political

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.962
and military leadership.

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:32.165
More on that breaking news into CNN.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.167
The Israeli Defense Forces

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.235
say they have carried out

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.971
some raids in the Gaza Strip.

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.473
They say that they are

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:42.442
searching for hostages.

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.110
I want to bring in Matthew Chance,

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.244
who is across this story

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:46.713
following the developments

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:48.815
reporting today from Tel Aviv.

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:49.982
Matthew, what do we know

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:53.252
Well, I mean, look,

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:55.521
I mean, we're all bracing, of course,

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.857
for the I'm coming back in my ear here.

00:05:58.324 --> 00:05:59.158
We're all bracing

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:01.661
for the possibility of a large scale

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:03.363
Israeli invasion

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.531
by land into the Gaza Strip.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:06.432
But, of course,

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:07.533
we have to remember

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:10.103
that complicating that military operation

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:13.373
is the fact that there are between 100

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:14.874
and 150

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.209
Israeli hostages

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.311
that have been hidden by Hamas militants

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.912
after they were seized inside Israel,

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:21.881
all across that territory.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.016
And I think what we're seeing now,

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.685
according to the IDF,

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:27.720
small, limited incursions

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:29.021
into the Gaza Strip

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:31.190
with the express purpose of,

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:31.858
you know,

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:32.392
first of all, trying

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.626
to neutralize

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:35.027
terrorist locations

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:36.162
is the first thing to say,

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:38.064
but also to try and locate

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.098
the whereabouts

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:41.200
of some of those hostages In fact,

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:43.936
the newly appointed hostage affairs

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.639
coordinator here in Israel

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.241
gave me a statement earlier

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:49.041
saying that they were doing

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:51.477
everything they could on every level

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:52.578
to try and,

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:52.845
you know,

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:54.447
search every area of ground

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:55.681
to try and find

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:57.617
where these people are,

00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:59.619
where people are located.

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:01.521
And I think this is this is a part of it.

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:03.589
But to be clear, it is not

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:06.826
we don't think the beginning of the large

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.428
scale land invasion

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.096
that that everybody's braced for

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.697
But again, to reiterate,

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:13.099
when that happens,

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.134
the presence of those

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:17.970
captives in the Gaza Strip is something

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:19.238
that the military planners

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:20.006
are going to have to take

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:21.040
into account already.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.407
Hamas

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:22.675
militants say

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:24.243
that as a result of the ferocious

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:25.378
air strikes

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:26.746
that have been pounding areas

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:27.747
of the Gaza Strip

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:29.248
for the past several days,

00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:32.251
at least 13 of the hostages they took

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:33.252
have been killed.

00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:34.253
That's not been corroborated

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:35.121
by the Israelis

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.255
or by the United States,

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:38.424
but it does underline

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.827
what a precarious situation

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:42.662
the military planners are

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:44.597
and we all are currently

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:45.798
involved in, Becky.

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:48.534
Yeah, and diplomatic sources

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:49.101
had told me

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:50.403
earlier in the week, can confirm

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:52.305
now by the prime minister of Qatar

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.206
speaking alongside

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:55.274
the US secretary of state today,

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:55.741
saying that

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:56.976
there are efforts

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.212
that they are mediating between Israel

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:02.415
and Hamas to try and effort

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:04.650
the release of those hostages

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.785
earlier on in the week.

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:07.353
We were told that

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:08.287
the efforts were around

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:10.189
an exchange of hostages,

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:11.224
women and children,

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:14.060
Israeli women and children in Gaza

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.631
for women and youth in prisons.

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.132
In Israel.

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:22.134
So we know that that is ongoing.

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:24.871
We also know that the Secretary of State,

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:27.974
Antony Blinken, who's been in Jordan

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:30.676
and is now in the Gulf, doing the rounds,

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:32.945
trying to ensure

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:33.946
that there is some sort

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:37.416
of humanitarian corridor set up for

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.686
and some sort of safe zones set up

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.355
for these gardens.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:42.822
Gazans,

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:43.956
we just spoke to the

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.591
Jordanian foreign minister

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:46.592
who said,

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:46.826
you know,

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:47.827
the Gazans need

00:08:47.827 --> 00:08:49.362
to stay within the country

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.763
as far as Jordan is concerned,

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:51.931
within the enclave,

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:53.966
as far as Jordan is concerned.

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:55.902
They don't want to see the spillage

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:58.871
of Gazans outside of the enclave.

00:08:58.871 --> 00:08:59.939
But clearly,

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:00.239
you know,

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:03.075
as they are told by the IDF to move

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:05.378
from northern Gaza, one assumes,

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:06.045
you know,

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:08.080
because there is this imminent air

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.449
assault by ground and air

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:13.819
forthcoming, the IDF trying to ensure

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:16.656
that Gazans are evacuated out of the way.

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:17.757
Hamas, of course,

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:21.127
telling Gazans to stay in place.

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:23.329
There is an awful lot going on.

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:24.730
The secretary of state

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.498
not only looking

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:26.966
at the humanitarian corridors

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:30.002
and the hostage issue, also speaking

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:30.803
to the Israelis

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:33.439
and the region about how to de-escalate

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:36.809
what is going on, both in the short

00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:38.744
term, in the hours to come

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:40.246
and trying to ensure

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.981
that this conflict,

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:44.550
what is going on here now

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.986
in Israel and in Gaza, that does

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:50.823
not spill outside of these borders.
