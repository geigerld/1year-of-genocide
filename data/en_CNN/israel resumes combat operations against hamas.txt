THE TRUCE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND  HAMAS IS OVER. ONCE AGAIN, EXPLOSIONS ARE  ROCKING GAZA AND GIANT PLUMES OF SMOKE ARE RISING OVER THAT  SKYLINE. THE FIGHTING STARTED JUST  MINUTES AFTER THE SEVEN-DAY  TRUCE EXPIRED AT MIDNIGHT  EASTERN TIME. ISRAEL ACCUSED HAMAS OF BREAKING THE DEAL BY FIRING A ROCKET. THE HAMAS-CONTROLLED MINISTRY OF HEALTH IN GAZA SAYS TODAY'S  STRIKES HAVE ALREADY KILLED AT  LEAST 32 PEOPLE. THIS IS THE AFTERMATH OF A  STRIKE IN SOUTHERN GAZA THIS  MORNING.  &gt;&gt; SO, WHAT HAPPENS NOW? QATAR'S MINISTRY OF FOREIGN  AFFAIRS, THE KEY INTERMEDIARY  SAYS NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDER WAY  TO PAUSE THE FIGHTING AGAIN. THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER? ISRAEL SAYS 137 HOSTAGES ARE  STILL MROOEFD TO BE IN GAZA. A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS  BEFORE THE TRUCE FELL APART IN  THE FINAL HOURS LAST NIGHT,  HAMAS IS CLAIMING IT DID NOT  HAVE ANY MORE WOMEN OR CHILDREN  HOSTAGES TO EXCHANGE. ISRAEL SAYS THAT IS NOT TRUE AT  ALL. THE SAME OFFICIAL TELLS ME HAMAS DID NOT EVEN SUBMIT A LIST OF  POTENTIAL HOSTAGES FOR RELEASE  LAST NIGHT. SO, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE  CIVILIANS IN GAZA? THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS  PRESSURING ISRAEL TO HELP  PROTECT PALESTINIANS. THE SECRETARY ON STATE ON THE  GROUND YESTERDAY TALKING ABOUT  EXACTLY THAT. ORREN LIEBERMAN STARTS US OFF. THE IDF IS DROPPING LEAFLETS IN  SOUTHERN GAZA. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE SCALE  OF THE OPERATIONS UNDER WAY  RIGHT NOW? &gt;&gt; Reporter: PHIL, ISRAEL AND  HAMAS INDICATED THEY WERE READY  TO RESTART FIGHTING IF  NEGOTIATIONS FELL APART. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AROUND 7:00 THIS MORNING. WE HAVE SEEN THE SKYLINE OF  GAZA, WE HAVE HEARD THE STRIKES  THE IDF IS CARRYING OUT IN GAZA. THE WAR IS BACK ON AS ISRAEL AND HAMAS PROMISED. WE HAVE SEEN ISRAEL CARRYING OUT STRIKES IN SOUTHERN GAZA, WHERE  THEY SAID THEY WOULD FOCUS THE  SECOND PHASE OF THEIR OPERATION. ACCORDING TO HEALTH OFFICIALS IN GAZA, 32 PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN  KILLED IN GAZA IN THE FIRST  HOURS OF THE RESUMPTION OF  FIGHTING. ISRAEL HAS DROPPED LEAFLETS IN  PARTS OF SOUTHERN GAZA. INTERESTINGLY, THEY HAVE A QR  CODE THAT BRINGS YOU TO A MAP  WITH GAZA BROKEN UP INTO VERY  TINY PARCELS. IT SEEMS AS IF ISRAEL IS TRYING  TO EVACUATE THESE PARTS IN AN  ATTEMPT TO AVOID CIVILIAN  CASUALTIES AS THE FIGHTING  RESUMES AT PACE. SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN WAS  JUST HERE. HE SAID ISRAEL HAD TO HAVE A  CONCRETE PLAN TO PROTECT  CIVILIANS BEFORE THEY LAUNCHED  THE SECOND PHASE OF THEIR  OPERATION. THAT IS NOW HERE. HE ALSO SAID ISRAEL NEEDED A  PLAN FOR MORE HUMANITARIAN  ASSISTANCE AND AID TRUCKS  OUTSIDE OF GAZA, WHICH HAVE  ALREADY BEEN INSPECTED BY  ISRAEL, HAVE NOT GONE IN SINCE  PHIL, IT IS VERY MUCH A QUESTION OF WHETHER THAT HUMANITARIAN AID HAS BEEN CUT OFF WITH THE  FIGHTING RESUMED. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS, ARE  THEY ONGOING AT THE PACE THEY  WERE TO EXTEND THIS FROM FOUR  DAYS TO SEVEN DAYS OR HAVE THEY  STOPPED AS WELL? &gt;&gt;.  &gt;&gt; Reporter: POPPY, NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING, ACCORDING TO QATARI AND U.S. OFFICIALS. THE EFFORT IS VERY MUCH THERE. IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING WE GOT TO THE TRUCE THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS  DURING FIGHTING. WHY DID THEY BREAK DOWN? ISRAEL BELIEVES THERE ARE ENOUGH WOMEN AND CHILDREN HELD BY HAMAS IN GAZA TO CONTINUE FOR AT LEAST A DAY LONGER. HAMAS NOT CLEAR THEY AGREE WITH  THAT SENTIMENT. THEY BLAMED ISRAEL FOR A  BREAKDOWN IN NEGOTIATIONS SAYING THEY WERE READY TO BEGIN TALKS  ON THE OTHER GROUPS, ELDERLY  WOMEN AND SOLDIERS, WOMEN AND  MEN, TO CONTINUE THE TRUCE AND  RELEASE MORE OF THE HOSTAGES. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A BIGGER  DEAL HERE. THAT'S WHAT THE INTERNATIONAL  COMMUNITY IS PUSHING FOR AS  WELL. BUT WITH NO LIST HANDED TO  ISRAEL OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN  THAT COULD BE RELEASED, THE  FIGHTING HAS ONCE AGAIN STARTED. WE'LL SEE IF POSSIBLE AND HOW  LONG IT MIGHT TAKE TO GET TO  ANOTHER POINT WHERE THERE IS  ANOTHER PAUSE. &gt;&gt; ORREN LIEBERMAN IN TEL AVIV,  THANK YOU. LET'S BRING IN RETIRED AIR FORCE COLONEL CEDRIC LEIGHTON. ISRAEL IS NOW DROPPING LEAFLETS  ON KHAN YUNIS IS LOCATED SOUTH  OF THE LINE THAT IS BEFORE WHERE ALL THE RESIDENTS WERE TOLD TO  EVACUATE FROM THE NORTH TO THE  SOUTH. SO, NOW THEY'RE DROPPING  LEAFLETS IN KHAN YUNIS SAYING  THIS IS A FIGHTING ZONE,  EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY. WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE THE IDF IS  ABOUT TO DO? &gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, POPPY. WHAT WE'RE SEEING ARE MOVEMENTS  DOWN TO THE SOUTH. KHAN YUNIS IS RIGHT DOWN HERE. WHAT THAT DOES IS IT SHOWS THEY  ARE TRYING TO MOVE EVERYBODY  INTO THIS AREA. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS MAP RIGHT  HERE, THIS IS THE DAMAGE MAP  THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE  PREVIOUS STRIKES, RIGHT IN THIS  AREA. THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE DAMAGE  HAS OCCURRED IN THE NORTHERN  PART OF GAZA. THERE IS SOME DAMAGE IN THE  CENTRAL PART. BUT KHAN YUNIS AND THE AREA  AROUND RAFAH, THEY'VE HAD  MINIMAL DAMAGE. THEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE EVERYBODY INTO THE SOUTHERN AREAS. SO, ALONG THIS -- THESE  EVACUATION ROUTES RIGHT HERE,  THE COASTAL ROAD RIGHT HERE,  WAW WADI GAZA IS THE DIVIDING LINE. NOW THEY'RE MOVING INTO THE  SOUTHERN PART. WE BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO TRY  TO HAVE SOME AREAS RIGHT IN HERE THAT ARE AREAS WHERE THEY'RE  GOING TO BRING THE CIVILIAN  POPULATION INTO THEM. BUT HAVING SAID THAT, THEY ARE  ALSO GOING TO BE MOVING THEIR  MILITARY FORCES IN THIS AREA. THE IDF WILL BE DOING THAT  PROBABLY AS NEXT PHASE OF THEIR  OPERATIONS.  &gt;&gt; WE HAVE SPOKEN OVER THE LAST  COUPLE DAYS ABOUT THE INTENSIVE  BEHIND-THE-SCENES TALKS. U.S. HE FISHLS TRYING TO  PRESSURE ISRAELI COUNTERPARTS TO SCOPE, SHAPE, BE PRECISE ABOUT  OPERATIONS IN THE SOUTH. WHY ARE THEY TARGETING THE  SOUTH? &gt;&gt; THE REASON THEY'RE TARGETING  THE SOUTH, PHIL, IS THAT RIGHT  IN THIS AREA THEY BELIEVE THAT  ALL OF THE HAMAS FIGHTERS RZ  BASICALLY MOVING IN HERE. THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL STAY IN THE NORTH, ALTHOUGH IT'S  EXTREMELY DAMAGED. IN THE SOUTH THEY'RE EXPECTING  THEM TO BE THERE. WHAT THE IZ REALLIES ARE DOING  IS BASICALLY CALLED SHAPING  OPERATIONS. THESE SHAPING OPERATIONS ARE  DESIGNED TO MOVE PEOPLE IN  CERTAIN DIRECTIONS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE  THE ISRAELIS ARE WORRIED ABOUT  HERE. THE REFUGEES, THE CIVILIAN  POPULATION, BUT FOR THEM, MORE  IMPORTANTLY FROM A MILITARY  PERSPECTIVE, THE HAMAS FIGHTERS. AND THEY BELIEVE THOSE FIGHTERS  WILL BE MOVING IN THESE AREAS AS WELL, TO BLEND INTO THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND AVOID BEING  STRUCK. &gt;&gt; WE APPRECIATE IT.  &gt;&gt;&gt; 21-YEAR-OLD MIA SHEM WAS ONE OF THE FINAL HOSTAGES RELEASED  IN THE LAST HOURS OF THE TRUCE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HER BEING REUNITED AT  AN AIR FORCE BASE IN SOUTHERN  ISRAEL. THIS IS BEFORE AND THIS IS HER  EXITING A CAR BEING HANDED OVER  TO THE RED CROSS TO BE TAKEN  BACK HOME. THAT'S HER MOTHER THE MOMENT SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT HER RELEASE. MIA ATTENDED THE MUSIC FESTIVAL  WHERE SHE WAS KIDNAPPED. SHE APPEARED IN THE FIRST  HOSTAGE VIDEO RELEASED BY HAMAS. HER ARM SEVERELY WOUNDED AND  BANDAGED NOW. SHE IS BACK HOME.  &gt;&gt;&gt; THIS MORNING WE ARE GETTING  NEW REPORTING ABOUT THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION'S ATTEMPT TO  SHAPE ISRAEL'S NEXT OFFENSIVE IN GAZA, A PHASE UNDER WAY NOW THAT THOSE TALKS TO EXTEND THE PAUSE  HAVE FALLEN APART. SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY  BLINKEN MADE THREE HARD REQUESTS WHILE ON THE GROUND IN ISRAEL  YESTERDAY. YOU SEE HIM THERE SPEAKING WITH  PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU. ALSO MET BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  WITH NETANYAHU AND HIS WAR  CABINET. THE FIRST OF THOSE THREE  CRITICAL ELEMENTS CONTINUE TO  EXPAND THE CURRENT SURGE --  CURRENT AND EXPAND THE CURRENT  SURGE OF HUMANITARIAN AID. THERE'S BEEN A MAJOR SURGE  DURING THE PAUSE IN HOSTILITIES. SECOND TRYING TO FIND NEW WAYS  TO HAVE HUMANITARIAN AID. THIRD, A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS  PLAN TO MINIMIZE CASUALTIES IN  THE SOUTH. JOINING US SO DISCUSS IS DAVID  SANGER. I WANT TO START WITH THAT LAST  POINT BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN DUAL TRACK TO SOME DEGREE. THERE HAVE BEEN THE INTENSIVE  DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS  TRYING TO EXTEND THE PAUSE THAT  HAD BEEN IN PLACE, THE HOSTAGE  SWAPS, AND THEN A SECOND TRACK  OF U.S. OFFICIALS WORKING WITH,  TALKING TO, IMPRESSING ISRAELI  COUNTERPARTS WHAT THIS OPERATION IN THE SOUTH WILL LOOK LIKE. HOW MUCH LEVERAGE DO THEY HAVE  HERE? &gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, PHIL. THE MAIN WEAPON IS U.S. HAS  WEAPONS AND GOING TO CONGRESS -- OR THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING  TO CONGRESS FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $14 BILLION IN AID. ONE OF THE DEBATES UNDER WAY IN  CONGRESS RIGHT NOW IS WOULD  THERE BE CONDITIONS PLACED ON  THAT AID? SOMETHING YOU WRITE IN THE LAW  COULD BE A LOT CLUNKIER THAN  SOMETHING THAT THE SECRETARY OF  STATE CAN NEGOTIATE OUT WITH THE ISRAELIS. IF YOU JUST BACK THIS UP OVER,  SAY, THE PAST SEVEN WEEKS OR SO, WE'VE GONE FROM THE PRESIDENT  SAYING I'M UNAMBIGUOUSLY BEHIND  ISRAEL TO THE PRESIDENT SAYING,  DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKES WE  MADE, THE EXCESSES WE MADE AFTER 9/11, TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE  IN HIS VISIT SAYING, THERE ARE  FAR TOO MANY PALESTINIANS BEING  CALLED, TO NOW THE STATE  DEPARTMENT SAYING, HERE ARE  THREE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS. THEY ARE TRYING TO PUT THE  SQUEEZE ON THE ISRAELIS, IN  FARTHER, BY MAKING PUBLIC  EXACTLY WHAT THESE DEMANDS ARE.
