00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.568
Right now, we are seeing

00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:03.670
smoke coming out there.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.738
We're looking at

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.439
these live pictures of Gaza City.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:07.073
We're seeing smoke

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:09.476
coming out of Gaza City at this moment.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.312
What do you believe

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.147
could be happening right now

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:17.250
as we are talking about this?

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.451
We've seen already

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.120
quite a few air strikes

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.956
occurring in Israel, throughout Gaza,

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.724
but the vast concentration of them

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:26.192
are in Gaza City.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.961
What do you think is happening tonight?

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:28.762
Okay, so that's one thing

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:29.329
you're seeing right now.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.798
That's a result of direct

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:34.067
15 and 35 Israeli Air Force

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.235
selective fire

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.936
there, special operations, Air Force

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.705
commandos, a unit called Shell,

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.241
very elite Tier one asset.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.043
It's called the Kingfisher Unit.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.878
And they are on the ground

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.846
helping to put those missiles

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:50.550
into specific Hamas buildings

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.719
to completely dismantle

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.154
Hamas's infrastructure.

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:56.523
So that immobilizes them completely.

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:57.991
That's what the smoke is from

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.192
the other thing.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:00:59.492
The reason

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:00.593
why this is happening at night,

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:01.828
it allows

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.196
clandestine operations

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.632
to be conducted within Gaza,

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:06.866
using deception

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.768
for operatives to be able to get inside

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:10.136
they're tapping

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:10.603
cell phones,

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.138
putting down recording devices.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:16.142
So Israel is setting an entire pre

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.610
raid operation here for two things.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.511
One, for one

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:19.946
that counteroffensive starts

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:20.547
and then to

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:22.415
and the most important thing for us

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.818
the able to get those hostages back.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.653
Let's take a listen here.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.054
You can hear those bombs going off

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:29.556
in the background in Gaza City.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.997
We don't always hear

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.199
or see

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.500
at this time

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.368
if you're on the ground right now.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.303
But you can.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.504
Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:46.206
Can you even tell based on listening

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.640
to that, the force

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.576
the magnitude of what they are?

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.110
Yeah.

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:50.944
I mean, look, there's

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.212
going to be a lot of destruction.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.346
A lot of people are going to get killed

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:53.880
and hurt.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.748
It's happening on the Israeli side.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:56.716
The Palestinians will make something

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:57.183
really clear.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.218
Israel has no issue

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.119
with the Palestinian people.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.054
In fact, the Palestinian people

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:02.122
ideally would want to be able

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.390
to cross the southern border of Gaza

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.758
to get into Egypt.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:06.359
But they can't.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.094
Hamas is keeping them closed in there.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:11.297
And like a like a whatsername said.

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:12.665
That is a problem

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:13.700
if they're starting to be used

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.400
as human shields.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.802
And it creates

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:20.073
immense levels of risk to the Palestinian

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:22.075
And so we do our best to follow

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:23.743
international law.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:26.346
When we look at the the before

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.981
and after of some of these spaces,

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:28.781
it looks like

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:31.351
just an enormous amount of rubble.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:35.288
Do you see a tactical strategy in the

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:36.189
you know, the flattening

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.357
of some of these buildings?

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:38.725
Absolutely. All of that.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:39.392
Absolutely, yeah.

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.894
So the flattening of the structures,

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:41.928
the artillery pieces

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:42.996
that are going in there,

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.431
they're starting to open up lanes,

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:46.533
if you will,

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.801
for this massive counteroffensive

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:49.903
that's being prepared.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:50.236
The other thing

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:50.670
that we're doing

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.839
is we're tiring out Hamas.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.641
We're treating this as what we call

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:55.675
like a pressure cooker.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.277
And we've got a civil affairs.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.244
And that pressure cooker

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.713
is designed to try and slow things down

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:02.415
so that we can collect intelligence

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:03.917
and so that we can tire out

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.251
this terror group.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:07.820
And a tired terrorist

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.122
is a better terrorist.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:09.856
Who's holding

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.491
innocent women and children.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:13.426
So taking our time and doing the best

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:13.693
we can

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.094
to collect info, try and slow this thing

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:16.696
down, opening up lanes

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.830
for the Givati Brigade,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.933
which is equivalent to the US Marines.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.334
They're the ones who are in charge of the

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.069
of the Southern Command,

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.436
and they're

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:24.337
the ones who have been

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.405
into Gaza previously

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.140
in the last war in Gaza.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.875
And so those were they're opening up,

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.178
parting ways, if you will,

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:33.413
so that the Israelis

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:34.714
will be able to move in there

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.282
as safely as possible

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:38.851
to get to the terrorists and

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:40.687
is it safe to describe

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:41.854
what we are seeing tonight

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:43.756
and hearing tonight

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.925
in in the skies over Gaza

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.760
as a prelude potentially

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.963
to a ground invasion?

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:50.763
Well well,

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:51.331
I can tell you

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.900
that a ground invasion is is is imminent

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:55.802
when it's going to happen.

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:56.569
I couldn't tell you.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.937
I'm not I'm

00:03:57.937 --> 00:03:59.372
not I'm not going to speculate.

00:03:59.372 --> 00:03:59.872
I don't want to give it

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:02.875
any information that might

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:03.743
be inaccurate.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.012
But the fact that 300,000 reservists

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:06.813
have been mobilized,

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.014
the fact that the Givati Brigade

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:08.514
is down there,

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:09.349
the fact that the share

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.216
that the Israeli SEALs

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:11.618
are already operating on that coast,

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:13.219
you can

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.287
bet that they're preparing

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.421
for the inevitability

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.056
of having to go in there.

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:18.591
And the unfortunate part,

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.193
like Anderson said

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:23.329
very gently and eloquently.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:25.031
It's going to be vicious.

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.132
You can hear there.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:27.734
You can hear the missile fire

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.569
you can hear that hitting the rubble.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:30.036
It's going to be

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:30.470
there's going to be

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.972
a lot of violence of action.

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:36.809
There will be a lot of death and trauma

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.479
but we believe there could be over

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.980
150 hostages in there.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.547
So we're

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:43.683
looking at two multiple assaults.

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:44.450
And, Aaron,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.786
I just want to emphasize for our viewers,

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.521
if you've been joining us tonight, leave,

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:52.025
we do not always hear bombardment

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:55.228
at this hour of this strength,

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.431
this seems to be

00:04:58.431 --> 00:04:59.866
there's intense

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:00.967
fighting that's happening right now.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:01.401
Those are the

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:02.702
I hear artillery pieces

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:03.603
that are going off.

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:05.171
Again, that's to soften the

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.340
and open up the runways for

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:10.076
for those infantry units that

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:11.744
that will eventually go in.

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:14.614
I hear the call to prayer right now also.

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:15.581
And

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.350
the other thing we're hearing

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.786
is that selective missile fire.

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:20.420
There's potentially

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.521
Israelis inside Gaza right now.

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:22.889
These are special operations forces.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:23.523
They're doing everything

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:25.224
they can to get intelligence

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:27.293
to prepare for the counteroffensive.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:30.697
And unfortunately, this is the price

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:33.900
that Israelis pay and that Palestinians.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.302
Piers, let's listen for just a moment

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.303
As you just said,

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:41.207
this is called to prayer

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.810
or

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.921
you're listening and watching.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:36.889
These are images of Gaza City

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.858
as the bombs light up the night sky.

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:39.759
There,

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:41.594
we're hearing

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:43.463
what sounds like a call to prayer,

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:46.165
even some sirens in a few moments ago

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.201
as the bombs are dropping right now.

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:51.971
This is the population center of Gaza.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:55.107
About almost 600,000 people live here

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:57.076
and the intensity of the bombardment

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.110
seems to have picked up

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.612
just in the last couple of minutes.

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:00.780
As we've been

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:01.814
speaking to you

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.382
and watching these images.

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:06.953
That sign, according to my guest

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:09.121
here, Aaron Cohen,

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:10.823
that potentially this is picking up.

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:13.125
And as he says, as you've said, Aaron,

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.128
perhaps a sign that this

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:16.863
ground invasion

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:17.663
could be imminent,

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:18.197
as is

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:19.365
the Israeli defense

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:21.901
forces are moving more aggressively,

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.402
it seems, tonight

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:25.905
to prepare to soften

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:28.908
this ground for the

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:33.179
some 300,000 troops who are amassed

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.815
along the border. Get ready to go in.

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:36.349
That's right.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:36.849
That's right.

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:37.583
And

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:40.920
Gaza is an incredibly densely

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.688
populated area.

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.891
Hamas has had years to keep

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.025
building it up.

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:47.693
This is one of the most dangerous

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:48.995
places on earth.

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:50.062
I just want to make it really clear,

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:52.865
the Israelis,

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:54.800
as an IDF soldier,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.636
as a veteran of the IDF,

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:57.570
we don't have an issue

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.772
with the Palestinians

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:01.340
and we want to do what

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.809
we can to get Hamas away from them.

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:04.877
And so we're going to use

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:06.012
as much selectivity.

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:06.546
Is the difference

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.080
with the footage that you are showing

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.016
is that we're not going to

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.851
indiscriminately hurt anybody.

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.819
However, lines have been crossed

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:14.987
and decisions have been made.

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:17.557
Leadership will roll.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.991
Intelligence heads will be gone.

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:20.293
We don't we're not focusing on that

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:20.793
right now.

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:23.362
But this is

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:25.464
the most significant hostage

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.400
siege in the history of modern warfare.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.834
Let's talk about that for a second.

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:31.103
Again, I mean, the hostages, if

00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:35.107
is it necessary for there to be surgical

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:39.045
operation and to try to find and free

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:42.481
those hostages prior to any kind of war,

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:45.751
a large scale ground invasion

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:46.819
of the idea?

00:09:46.819 --> 00:09:47.520
Yes, it is.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.254
It is

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:51.190
it is critical to continue to soften

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:54.060
as much of the Hamas infrastructure

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.228
within Khan Younis within Rafah

00:09:56.228 --> 00:09:57.496
within Gaza City

00:09:57.496 --> 00:10:00.633
and all of the small villages in between

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:05.071
in order to reduce risk to those larger

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:05.972
infantry units

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:07.807
they're going to move into Gaza

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:10.443
in order to minimize

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.111
getting killed.

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:14.680
Urban warfare is incredibly complex.

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:16.415
This is essentially a symmetrical

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:18.584
or 90 degree angle fighting.

00:10:18.584 --> 00:10:21.654
And so bringing down those buildings

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:23.656
means less walls for

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.024
terrorists to hide behind.
