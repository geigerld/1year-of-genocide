00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.503
The Israeli military is assessing claims

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:06.172
made by Hamas

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:08.466
that the youngest hostage,

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:12.470
ten month old care givers and his mom

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:13.722
were killed.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.015
Hamas is claiming

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:15.724
that they were killed

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.976
by an Israeli air strike.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.770
Obviously, whoever kidnaps

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.231
a baby and a mom, they're responsible

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.941
for what happens to them

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.527
regardless of how they were killed.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.028
I'm wondering

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.779
if any of you want to

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.532
comment on this awful news.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.617
Again, we don't know if it's even true.

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:35.326
Right.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.911
I think the family came out

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:37.746
with a statement

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:40.165
saying that they are looking at the facts

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.709
and hoping for good news.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:43.585
But that's part

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:46.087
of the psychological warfare

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:47.756
that Hamas is doing.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:49.841
And going back to Liz's comment

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.218
about the International Red Cross.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.345
They need to be the witness.

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:55.930
They are the conscience

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.640
of the international community

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.517
and need to speak up

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:02.687
and be vocal about what they are saying

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.522
and calling them out

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:05.607
for these types of acts

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:06.733
that they are doing.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.986
The whole world needs to speak up.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.321
We don't feel that the

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.323
international community is appalled

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.366
the way they should be.

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.327
It's humanitarian crisis

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:20.497
at the highest level and there don't seem

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:24.084
to be enough outrage out there.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:26.169
Now, over 30 different nationalities

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.129
being held hostage today.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:29.172
And I think,

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:31.382
you know, we've seen the success

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:32.133
with the release

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.468
of some hostages

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:35.261
over the past several days.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.598
And the US government, Israel, Egypt,

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.642
Qatar are working together

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:43.061
and I'm really grateful for that.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:43.770
That's how

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.188
my aunt Aviva,

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.649
how Abigail have been released.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.069
But there's so many other hostages

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.779
who have not yet been released

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.823
and time is of the essence.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.282
Do any of you think that

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:59.285
President Biden is not doing enough,

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.080
that he needs to be doing more?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.248
It's okay if you feel that way.

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:04.582
If I had a

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:06.084
loved one in captivity,

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:07.085
I probably would think that

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:10.338
nobody's doing enough.

00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:10.964
We have heard

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.967
President Biden expressing

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.011
the hostages is top priority,

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:19.097
but we're still sitting here

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:21.349
54 days later

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.852
with eight of us, eight families

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:25.603
still waiting for their loved ones.

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.398
Think Biden administration, they do

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:34.112
more than enough since the first day.

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:37.198
But the math shouldn't fool us,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.533
which means

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:41.536
if every day ten people being released,

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.496
it doesn't mean necessarily

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.290
that the two weeks from now

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.916
their remaining 140

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.294
something hostages will be out.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.546
So that's the main concern.

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:52.213
You talked about

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.089
how you don't think that you're

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.092
getting enough support from the world.

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:57.010
And I'm sure you know

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.428
that one of the reasons that is

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.513
and there are probably many reasons,

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:01.347
but one of the reasons

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.308
that is, is because

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:04.184
many people in the world

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.728
think that the IDF's response

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:07.687
has killed too many

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.607
innocent Palestinians.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.025
The IDF says

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:12.442
they're going

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.819
after Hamas and Hamas embeds

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.905
with the population

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.657
and they're not trying to kill civilians.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:23.286
But Hamas goes where the population is.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.704
That's the reason.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:25.997
Do you think that the IDF

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.749
should be focusing more,

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.167
not just the IDF, that Netanyahu

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.210
should be focusing

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.754
more on the hostages, getting them out,

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.339
saving them,

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.633
and the time for going after Hamas

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.509
should come later

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.013
at the beginning of the conflict.

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:43.514
I think the Israeli government

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:47.185
was more focused on going after Hamas.

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:50.563
I think the fact that the families

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:51.940
have come together,

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.775
we each feel collectively

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:57.320
that we have 240 new family members.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.614
And I think the success of the families

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:03.534
being together and being able to unite

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:07.413
around the hostage issue and getting the

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:08.039
people of

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.042
Israel behind us

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:12.794
has changed the perception

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.545
of the government of Israel.

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:17.715
The hostages have been 54 days.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.968
Somewhere in the dark in Gaza,

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.469
it is

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:22.720
an immediate need,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.471
the immediacy

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.056
of getting these hostages out.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.516
A young man like Hirsch,

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.768
who had his arm blown off,

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.812
he doesn't have days to wait.

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:31.813
And so

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:32.897
little people,

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:35.316
big people, mothers, brothers,

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.567
young women

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.569
who we know are not being treated

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.113
well in Gaza.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.739
They need to get out.

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.449
And so when we talk about it,

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.492
none of us are talking about

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:45.076
this politically.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.578
We're talking about it as a human crisis.

00:04:47.578 --> 00:04:50.832
And so for me,

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.584
the issue of how do we finish

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:55.503
with the work of Hamas

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.630
and getting rid of them,

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.173
let's put it aside for a second

00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:00.383
and let's just focus on

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:03.011
getting these 150 folks,

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:06.472
people, our family, our relatives out

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.474
and getting them safe.

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.976
That should be everyone's priority

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:10.601
right now.

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:11.269
All I can say is

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.062
I hope that your loved ones

00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:14.522
get home soon.

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:17.525
And I know for the ones of you that have

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.153
men being held hostage

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.946
who are not top priority

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.323
because women and children

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.658
and older people are being

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:30.580
prioritized, and people in the IDF,

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:31.956
they will be last on the list.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:34.500
And I'm so sorry for that.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.336
It's time to change this equation.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.379
Right? Who said that?

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.923
You know, we where is it coming from?

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:43.301
We believe collectively

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.886
that anybody from any group

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.137
should be released.

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:49.140
Should be a mixed group from now on.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.515
Yes.

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:52.685
We 100% agree that children being

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.479
the sensitive souls that they are,

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.147
should have been released first.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:58.900
But from now on, they should be

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.903
a consideration of men and women.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.821
Old and young

00:06:03.821 --> 00:06:05.198
soldiers and civilians

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.324
still should come out.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:07.575
They're all the same.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:08.743
There should be representation

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:11.704
of each and every group coming out.

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:14.374
What do you want anybody watching

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:18.294
right now to know about your loved one?

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:18.753
What should

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.880
somebody who's watched this

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.882
and is sitting at home afterwards?

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.967
What should they know about him?

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:26.803
He don is American kid.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.596
He graduated last year

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:31.849
from Tenafly High School.

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.226
He love parties.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.769
He's got tons of friends.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.522
He's a professional swimmer.

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:40.149
He loved the good Life is a real foodie.

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:42.068
Like he knows all the restaurants.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.445
Like we've been in concert everywhere.

00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:47.657
Like

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.867
he doesn't belong there.

00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:51.702
Like dance with a family.

00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:52.662
As simple as that.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.372
Yeah. Tell us about that.

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.456
What do you want

00:06:55.456 --> 00:06:56.999
people to know about Homer Omar

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:58.751
As a kind person?

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.795
But when it comes to the room,

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.214
he just captured everybody's attention

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:04.882
just because of his

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:06.926
sheer size and kindness.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.429
And. And

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.721
he loves

00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:12.557
playing basketball and admires

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:13.933
the NBA and the NFL.

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.685
Just the American kid.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.353
He belongs at home.

00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:18.646
What about Ed?

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:20.106
What do you want us to know about other?

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.607
He's a very talented kid.

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:22.942
He sings. He dances.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.820
So he's typically the life of the party.

00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:28.906
He has been in the Boy Scouts

00:07:28.906 --> 00:07:30.032
until the age of 18.

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:32.034
So he mentors young kids.

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:35.246
And maybe the most important part of his,

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:38.499
he and his older brother play NBA, too.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:41.085
Okay, so

00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:43.921
I get my ass whipped by my eldest son,

00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:45.673
so he needs his youngest

00:07:45.673 --> 00:07:46.924
younger brother to come back

00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:48.676
so he could go back and play with them.

00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:49.802
NBA, too.

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:51.637
Emily, tell us about your Uncle Keith.

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.222
What do you want us to know about him?

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:57.685
My Uncle Keith is a really gentle,

00:07:57.685 --> 00:08:01.022
kind father and grandfather.

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:03.357
He grew up in North Carolina.

00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:06.027
That's where I'm from.

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:08.654
And family is just everything to him.

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:10.364
And he needs to be returned

00:08:10.364 --> 00:08:12.366
to be with his grandchildren

00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:15.119
and his wife and his children.

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:17.330
I want them all home. So.

00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:18.414
Thank you for talking to us.
