.  &gt;&gt;&gt; IT'S A HEART WRENCHING STORY CNN HAS BEEN FOLLOWING, THE  FATHER OF AN 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL  SAID HE WAS RELIEVED WHEN HE WAS TOLD HIS DAUGHTER WAS KILLED  BECAUSE HE BELIEVED BEING HELD  HOSTAGE WOULD BE A WORSE FATE  THAN DEATH. ISRAELI OFFICIALS TELL HIM HIS  DAUGHTER WAS MOST LIKELY  KIDNAPPED AND IS STILL ALIVE IN  GAZA. ED LAVANDERA JOINS US. MY HEART SANK WHEN I SAW THIS  UPDATE. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM THE  FATHER RIGHT NOW? &gt;&gt; Reporter: WELL, THOMAS HAND  SAYS THAT FAMILY AND FRIENDS CAN ONLY CONSOLE HIM WITH A HUG AND  THE WORDS, THERE ARE NO WORDS. BUT THOMAS HAND FOUND THE WORDS  WHEN HE SPOKE WITH US. &gt;&gt; FROM THE MORNING OF THE 7th  UNTIL NOW IS A NIGHTMARE ROLLER  COASTER, TRAGEDY.  &gt;&gt; THE ANGUISHED THOMAS HAND HAS LEFT HIM TREMBLING FOR WEEKS,  THE JOURNEY OF DEATH AND A HOPE  OF RESURRECTION, HE SAYS IS  IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE.  &gt;&gt; ON THE DAY IT WAS RUSSIAN  ROULETTE WHETHER YOU MADE IT OR  NOT.  &gt;&gt; Reporter: ON OCTOBER 7th  HAMAS FIGHTERS S STORMED THE  KIBBUTZ BE'ERI. HIS 8-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER EMILY  WAS SLEEPING AT A FRIEND'S  HOUSE. THOMAS COULD NOT REACH HER AS  HAMAS FIGHTERS TOOK OVER THE  KIBBUTZ. DAYS AFTER THE ATTACK, THE  IRISH-BORN FATHER SPOKE WITH  CNN'S CLARISSA WARD ABOUT THE  MOMENT HE WAS TOLD HIS DAUGHTER  HAD BEEN KILLED. &gt;&gt; THOMAS WAITED TWO AGONIZING  DAYS BEFORE GETTING THE NEWS. &gt;&gt; THEY JUST SAID WE FOUND  EMILY. SHE'S DEAD. AND I WENT, YES. I WENT, YES. AND SMILED. BECAUSE THAT IS THE BEST NEWS OF THE POSSIBILITIES THAT I KNEW  SHE'D BE IN A DARKROOM FILLED  WITH CHRIST KNOWS HOW MANY  PEOPLE, AND TERRIFIED EVERY  MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, AND POSSIBLE  YEARS TO COME. SO DEATH WAS A BLESSING. AN ABSOLUTE BLESSING.  &gt;&gt; THOMAS SAYSEAEADERS OF THE  BE'ERI'S KIBBUTZ TOLD HIM THE  BODY WAS SEEN IN THE AFTERMATH. A MONTH AFTER THE MASSACRE,  THOMAS WAS GIVEN THE NEWS THAT  ALMOST MADE HIM COLLAPSE. THE ISRAELI ARMY TOLD HIM IT'S  HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT EMILY IS  ALIVE AND A HAMAS HOSTAGE.  &gt;&gt; HOW WERE YOU TOLD THE NEWS  THAT EMILY MIGHT BE ALIVE? &gt;&gt; THAT WAS OFFICIAL FROM THE  ARMY. WITH ALL THE INFORMATION THAT  THEY HAVE, THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY HAVE, IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT SHE'S BEEN TAKEN TO GAZA. &gt;&gt; THOMAS SAYS HER BODY IS NOT  WITH THE REMAINS OF THE VICTIMS, AND THERE'S NO BLOOD INSIDE THE  HOME WHERE SHE SLEPT THE NIGHT  BEFORE. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SPOKE WITH CLARISSA  WARD A FEW WEEKS AGO, YOU SAID  DEATH WOULD BE A BLESSING IN  THIS SITUATION.  &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW I FELT AT THE  TIME, YEAH.  &gt;&gt; Reporter: HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE WHERE YOU ARE NOW? &gt;&gt; EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT HER,  OBVIOUSLY. WHAT CONDITIONS SHE'S BEEN HELD  IN. SHE'S, YOU KNOW, MORE THAN  LIKELY IN A TUNNEL SOMEWHERE  UNDER GAZA. YOUR IMAGINATION IS HORRIBLE. AND IT'S HER BIRTHDAY ON THE  17th OF THIS MONTH. SHE'LL BE 9. SHE WON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT DAY IT  IS. SHE WON'T KNOW IT'S HER  BIRTHDAY. THERE WILL BE NO BIRTHDAY CAKE,  NO PARTY, NO FRIENDS. JUST BE PETRIFIED IN A TUNNEL  THAT'S HER BIRTHDAY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THOMAS IS NOW  FLOODED WITH THE HOPE AND THE  DESPAIR OF WHAT HIS DAUGHTER  MIGHT BE ENDURING. HE PRAYS SHE CAN SOMEHOW HEAR  THESE WORDS TO HER. &gt;&gt; IF EMILY IS WATCHING, JUST TO LET HER KNOW THAT WE LOVE HER,  ALL OF US. WE'RE ALL WAITING FOR HER TO  COME BACK SAFELY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE SURVIVORS OF  THE KIBBUTZ ARE TEMPORARILY  LIVING IN A HOTEL. IN THE LOBBY, THERE'S A VIGIL TO ALL THE KIDNAPPED HOSTAGES. NOW EMILY'S FAMILY SAYS THE  YOUNG GIRL'S PHOTO WILL BE  PLACED NEXT TO THE OTHERS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU DESCRIBED AS  BEING A HOSTAGE AS WORSE THAN  DEATH. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE SO. THE UNKNOWN IS AWFUL. THE WAITING IS AWFUL. BUT THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO DO  NOW. PRAY AND HOPE THAT SHE COMES  BACK IN SOME BROKEN STATE, BUT  WE CAN FIX HER. WE'LL FIX HER SOMEHOW. &gt;&gt; Reporter: DO YOU ALLOW  YOURSELF NOW TO THINK ABOUT  HOLDING EMILY AGAIN? &gt;&gt; IN MY HEAD, I CAN SEE, YOU  KNOW, LIKE A BEACH SCENE, HER  RUNNING TO ME, AND ME RUNNING TO HER, JUST PICKING HER UP, NEVER  LETTING HER GO. &gt;&gt; Reporter: REMARKABLY THOMAS  HAND SAYS HE FEELS NO ANGER  ABOUT THIS ROLLER COASTER OF  EMOTIONS HE'S BEEN ON. HE BIEVES THE LEADERS OF THE  KIBBUTZ WERE DOING THEIR BEST IN THE HARROWING EARLY DAYS OF THE  ATTACK. HE HARBORS NO ILL WILL. HE'S NOT ANGRY. HIS FOCUS IS SOLELY ON GETTING  HIS DAUGHTER BACK. HE IS GRATEFUL FOR THE  OUTPOURING OF LOVE AND SUPPORT  HE'S GETTING FROM COUNTLESS  PEOPLE HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND  AROUND THE LOVE. &gt;&gt; E
