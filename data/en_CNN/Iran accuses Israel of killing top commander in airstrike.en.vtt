00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.036
We are tracking
breaking news out of the Middle East.

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:06.172
An attack on Iran's consulate
building in Syria.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.578
Iran's ambassador was not hurt,
but he told reporters in Damascus at least

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:16.182
five people were killed and blamed
Israeli warplanes for the strike.

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:20.487
Now, CNN cannot independently verify
those claims.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.088
Our Nic Robertson, though, is here

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.958
and is following
all the breaking news story on this.

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.993
And Nic, this is a significant target.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:29.362
What more
are you learning about this attack?

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:32.198
Well, the ambassador says
he was an eyewitness to it

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.433
because the embassy is right

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.436
next to the consular building,
the consulate building destroyed.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.205
He says at least five people were killed.

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:43.443
One of them, according to Iranian state
media, was Brigadier General Mohammad

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:46.413
Reza Zaidi, who is a very, very senior

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.449
IRGC top military commander.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.188
Has commanded the IRGC Army ground forces
before, the air forces before.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:59.526
And it is believed at this time
that he is the most senior IRGC

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:03.296
figure to be killed since the Quds Force
commander, Kassam Suleimani, was killed

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.432
by the United States in a drone
strike early.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.300
20. 20.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.638
Take that with the fact that this was
a diplomatic building that was hit.

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.573
That hasn't happened before.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:18.511
Now, the ambassador, Syrian media,
Iranian media are blaming Israel

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.113
typically in these situations

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:24.050
because there have been situations like
this before where Israel has been blamed

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.822
and has actually accepted responsibility
for some strikes against Iranian targets.

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:30.390
Inside of Syria.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.393
Typically,
the Israeli government at the moment

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:37.397
is saying that we don't comment on
what foreign media is saying.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.632
The Iranians and the Syrian media.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:45.472
So this is a sort of a a statement
that we can expect Israel to give.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.209
But the indications are this would be

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.412
a target of high value to Israel.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:55.882
And the ambassador said that it was,
as you mentioned,

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.252
Israeli fighter jet, F-35,
that fired in six missiles.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.054
I mean, broaden this out then.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:05.558
If it is Israel and we we don't know
at this stage if it is Israel.

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:09.062
The implications here for a region
that already

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:12.098
is, you know, on the edge,
what will this mean?

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:15.768
How will Iran, you know,
how will Iran react to this,

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:20.006
to set the scene
from Israel side for a moment,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.476
they've been talking
about the northern northern border,

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:26.312
their northern border,
the southern border of Lebanon.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:30.250
As being a place
that needs a diplomatic solution.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.918
And there are tensions with Hezbollah.

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.453
That's a proxy of Iran.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.122
And they've been saying that window
opportunity has been closing

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.792
and they've been saying that the window of
opportunity is going to be closing soon.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:42.128
And the discussion
has been about mid-April.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:45.331
So Israel at the moment

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:49.502
is really on the front foot in terms of

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.972
wanting to have power strikes
against Hezbollah

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:58.678
if they are responsible for this strike
on such a significant Iranian target.

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:02.248
And the ambassador said that
that would be a decisive response.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:05.251
The Iranian foreign ministry spokesman,
according to Iranian

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:09.055
media, is saying that they have a right
to take a response.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:12.192
The Iranian foreign minister is saying
the international community

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.493
should do something.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:16.095
This potentially stokes up the tensions

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:19.499
between Iran and Israel.

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:23.670
And in that context,
Israel would anticipate that

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:27.373
that response
could very likely come from Hezbollah.

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:30.243
And if it did, then that would give Israel

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.380
a rationale to strike Hezbollah harder.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.783
And this is what the United States fears.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.419
This is what European Union officials
fear.

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:40.687
This is why Secretary of State

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:43.890
Antony Blinken is meeting tomorrow
with with the French president in Paris.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.095
And they will discuss this issue of
of Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Iran.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:50.530
It's in

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.499
this context, the tensions on it
very, very high right now.

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:57.537
Yeah, the risk of escalation here
clearly, clearly very high.

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:58.438
And this is something like you

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:00.707
said, that Secretary Blinken
has been going to the region.

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:02.976
They're going to accept No. Five, six.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:06.746
I can't remember
trying to keep a lid on this.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.282
So we're looking I mean, what is the US
saying at this juncture?

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:13.486
That I haven't heard
what they've said so far?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.856
And it's not clear

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:20.393
if Israel was to take
responsibility for it,

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:24.364
then I think we could expect to hear
something publicly from

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:26.599
from the United States.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.201
If you go back to just after Christmas,

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:31.738
there was a senior IRGC figure,
not anywhere near as senior as this one,

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:35.341
an adviser to two Syrian forces

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:38.144
who was killed by a strike

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:41.014
around Damascus just just after Christmas.

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.183
Again, Israel at that time
said they weren't responsible.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.655
But later on, Israeli officials
admitted that they were responsible

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.323
for that strike.

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:54.227
The United States is trying its best
to de-escalate those tensions.

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:55.728
It wants the cease fire.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:59.699
And in Gaza,
meanwhile, Israel has got 100,000 people

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.768
who can't go home
along the northern border

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:04.470
because it's too dangerous
because of the escalation in tensions.

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:08.508
And there is some in the military
and political establishment

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:11.611
in Israel
who believe that this is a necessary time

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:16.749
to to take out to take out
Hezbollah's military capability.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:19.352
So it's it's it's coming.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.123
Is this a spark to set off the tinderbox
Everything we've seen so far,

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.760
Israel has calculated
and I was just looking at an interview

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.265
I did with a former head of Israeli
military intelligence a few months ago.

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:36.135
And he said so far everything
Israel has done has been within a red line

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:41.107
not to cause Iran to escalate
because Iran knows it has a lot at stake

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.275
at the moment.

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:47.447
Is this another calculation by Israel
taking it right?

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:49.382
So the one we don't know.

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:53.720
And what is Iran's response
How big response?

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.155
When Kassam Suleimani was dead.

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:58.991
Let's start with a conversation
about the breaking news.

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:02.562
We led the hour with the apparent strike

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:06.466
on the Iranian consulate
building in Damascus, Syria.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.602
The Iranian ambassador
pointing the finger at Israel.

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:13.639
Israel says it doesn't comment
on foreign media reports.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.074
What do you make of the attack

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:17.543
and the likelihood
that this was potentially the IDF?

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.313
Well, it seems that's

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:23.316
the highest likelihood that it was
the IDF.

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:26.152
Not a certainty.

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:30.990
It's a fascinating
and in some ways a risky move

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.093
You're going to now bet

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:37.130
about how the Iranians will respond.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.901
The Israelis,
until now, have taken the position

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:48.341
that they will go after Iranian commanders
or anyone else who they believe

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:52.178
were masterminds
behind the attacks on Israelis

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.281
from Lebanon and all that.

00:06:55.715 --> 00:07:01.087
But the problem is here that they are
still deeply engaged in Gaza.

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:06.392
And the whole effort has been to keep
this war from spreading to the north.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:10.863
And this may well give the Iranians
an excuse to do that.

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:14.267
Until now, as you've heard from Natasha
Bertrand.

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:17.770
We've seen something of a calming down

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:23.142
and this could undo all of that
and inflame the situation pretty quickly.

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:26.012
David, put that into context for us

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:31.984
in the prism of where Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is right now,

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:36.255
because he is at a point of vulnerability
as we've watched these protests

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:40.526
escalate over recent days
and especially into the weekend, as we saw

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:44.730
with Melissa Bell, with tents being set up
outside the Israeli parliament.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:48.100
What is the significance
of the timing here?

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:50.236
Well,

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:53.406
there are two possibilities
that come immediately to mind.

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:56.476
One is that the timing was merely
a military

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.846
moment of opportunity.

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:02.715
Where they knew
where these commanders were

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:05.952
and they had an open shot at them
and and one where

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:09.155
they thought they might be able
to minimize civilian casualties, although

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:12.692
right now we don't know what
those casualties may have been.

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:16.395
The other is that Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:22.568
sees the risk of an expanded war
as politically beneficial potentially

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:28.975
to him, that, you know, his entire reason
for staying in office

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:34.780
has been to defend Israel
in the wake of the October seven attacks.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.917
And, of course,
the American concern is that

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:41.854
he has done this in the hardest
possible way,

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:46.492
in a way that has cost
at least 30,000 lives so far.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:52.532
And those protests that you saw Mark,
sort of the end of that period of grace

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:58.771
that Netanyahu had, where the Israelis
sort of took the view that

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:02.942
even if he was not their preferred leader,
he was their wartime leader.

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:04.777
And you're now seeing that fracture.

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:07.847
He may see some benefit
in the war revving up.
