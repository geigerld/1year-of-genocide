00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.134
The Israeli military

00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:01.835
is mobilizing

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:03.670
a record number of reservists,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.740
some 360,000 as observers

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.507
are anticipating

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.843
a ground operation in Gaza.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.544
The IDF is also amassing

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.045
tanks

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.380
and other military vehicles

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.447
near the border

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.116
with the Palestinian territory.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.851
And Prime Minister Benjamin

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.020
Netanyahu has vowed retaliation on Hamas

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:21.654
like never before.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:22.589
Keep in mind,

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.025
a ground operation could get complicated.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:28.161
Gaza is very densely populated.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.429
It puts civilians

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.331
in the middle of urban warfare

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.832
where Hamas can utilize narrow

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:33.633
city streets

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.969
and a complex network of tunnels

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.203
that can be used to move

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.004
fighters,

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:38.772
store weapons

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.241
and launch a series of attacks.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.542
We want to discuss the situation

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:43.777
now with a military expert

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:44.744
who knows firsthand

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.713
the hazards of urban combat.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.548
We're joined now by General Wesley Clark.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.382
He was the supreme

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.117
allied commander of NATO's

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:52.886
during the Kosovo war.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.120
General, thanks so much for sharing

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.422
part of your afternoon with us.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.258
We saw this drone video of Gaza

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:58.892
earlier today.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.661
This is the aftermath of aerial strikes

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:03.029
on the territory.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.563
I'm wondering

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.266
what an Israeli ground operation

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.168
in this region is going to look like.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.371
Well, first of all, I've

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.872
got to pick some targets

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:13.239
on the way

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.307
you would probably do

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:17.077
this is to section off Gaza,

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:18.978
maybe block by block,

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.046
figure out how to go

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.481
in, isolate

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.783
that area and work from the outside.

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:24.417
And you've got to

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.319
work against the tunnel network

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.987
and you've got to work against snipers

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.789
and other people on the high ground.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.458
Now, you've created a lot of

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.093
rubble in the city right now.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:33.960
So you've got to stay away

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.228
from those streets

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:36.296
if you're trying to move

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.331
are armored vehicles in there.

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:40.467
So that adds to the obstacles there.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.902
It's going to be a very tough,

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.038
slow, painstaking operation.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.674
Got to do it with maximum protection

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.109
for your own troops

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.211
because you have to understand that Hamas

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:52.345
this is not going to be

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.180
a surprise to Hamas.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.348
They knew that

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:57.183
this is what they were going to get.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.119
This is what they want.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.186
They want to bring that

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:01.988
Israeli ground force in

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:04.224
and attack it from every direction

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:07.160
and put more casualties on to show

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.062
that it lacks credibility.

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.230
So Israel has to do

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.030
this, has to do it

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.465
well as to maintain

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.200
its military credibility.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.536
Extremely difficult operation coming up.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:18.738
General, you describe

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:22.008
the targeting of tunnels and areas

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:23.376
along that border.

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:27.313
There were civilians in Gaza that were

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:31.017
trying or rather were told to evacuate

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.652
a certain crossing

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.954
and this Rafah crossing right here.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.323
And it's been complicated,

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:40.860
partly because it was targeted,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.494
obviously.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:42.962
You mentioned some of the complications

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:44.364
regarding a ground operation.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.032
What about the fact that Hamas is holding

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:48.568
some 100 to 150 hostages,

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.436
potentially some American citizens?

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:51.704
How does all of that?

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.306
The difficulty of getting civilians out

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.541
and the fact that there are hostages

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:55.441
in Gaza.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.610
Alter the calculus for the Israeli

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.312
Defense Forces?

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.246
Well, obviously,

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:00.980
you'll have teams

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.781
standing by

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.516
that could do an emergency hostage

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.951
rescue operation

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.486
if you could identify

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.188
where the hostages are.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:11.124
If you could get entrance into that area

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.526
with sufficient force to rescue them.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.795
But those capabilities will be there.

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:16.963
And we'll be monitoring

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:17.997
all the electronic

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.432
and visual intelligence

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:19.966
we've got

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.602
will be looking for other people, talking

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.471
and communicating people on the ground.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:26.940
We'll do everything we can

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.974
to locate them.

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:29.642
But, you know, it's in Hamas interest

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.878
not to execute those hostages.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.279
They need those hostages

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.548
as bargaining leverage at the end.

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.784
So you're going to hear a lot of threats.

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:40.019
You may have some outer control people

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:42.422
who do want to kill the hostages.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.890
But my bet would be that

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.291
the Hamas leadership

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:48.461
will not want to give up those hostages

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.196
for the sake of

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.564
the families of those missing.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.566
General, I hope you're right about that.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:54.934
I do want to share with you

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.402
some new satellite images

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:59.806
we have of the Erez crossing complex.

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:01.107
So essentially

00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:01.841
what we're looking at,

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:04.777
this right here is Gaza.

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.913
And this is Israel

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.581
This is part of the border.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.148
And on it,

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:11.217
you can see craters in some areas

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:12.452
where Israel

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:14.187
launched retaliatory strikes.

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.556
What really stands out to me are breaches

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:18.458
in the border wall

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.726
where Hamas broke through.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:22.795
And you can see them in these circles

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:23.229
I'm drawing.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.164
This is where Hamas militants

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.166
were able to get into Israel.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:29.335
It's striking partly

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:30.570
because of the scale

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.839
general of the attack.

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.841
They executed an attack

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:36.876
unprecedented in the history of Hamas

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.911
without Israeli intelligence

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.513
having a clue

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:42.048
that this was going to happen.

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:43.383
How is that possible?

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:47.086
It's possible by just

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:49.188
working with people you trust,

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.491
keeping the circle of knowledge small

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.760
and only talking face to face,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.795
no electronic communications

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.997
nothing in writing that can go out.

00:04:57.997 --> 00:04:58.665
If you do that,

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:00.800
you can maintain security.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.535
But, you know, Hamas has been there for

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:04.003
for a long time.

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:05.705
We cannot underestimate

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:07.173
their sophistication.

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.207
It's a mistake

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.310
to think that they're just terrorists

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.545
out there waving AK 47.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.748
This is a sophisticated military force

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:17.550
It's had training.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.652
It's had assistance from the Iranians,

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.287
maybe some Russian equipment in there.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:22.488
For all we know,

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:24.524
they can monitor communications.

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:25.792
They have cyber

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:28.061
they have anti-aircraft missiles.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.063
They have anti-tank missiles.

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:32.432
Got a lot of stuff buried underground.

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:33.533
Are they prepared for this

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:34.934
for a long time?

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:35.935
So I think, you know,

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.670
we have to anticipate

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.739
this is not like going

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:40.973
when the United States

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:42.942
Army raced through Baghdad

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:46.112
in 2003, shattered the Iraqi guards

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:47.914
and the people in Iraq were like,

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:49.649
oh, yeah, well, some of us liked him.

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:50.817
Some of us didn't.

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:52.685
Let's see what happens now.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.020
That's not what this is.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.155
This is a force for Syria

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:57.757
that's been prepared.

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.792
How many Hamas fighters are there?

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.828
15,000. 20,000.

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.996
We saw maybe 2000 committed

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:05.264
in this operation.

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:05.665
So we've got

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:09.302
lots of forces left behind and ready

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:11.070
and no doubt

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.506
willing to sacrifice their lives

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.541
to take Israelis with them.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.243
So this is going to be a tough fight.

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:19.078
And at the same time, of course,

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:20.313
we've got the northern border

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:21.114
to worry about

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:21.614
the president's

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:22.382
talk about maybe

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.584
sending another carrier battle group in

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.252
And don't forget,

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:26.719
the North

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.287
Koreans are now shipping

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:29.989
artillery and ammunition

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.091
by rail to the Russians

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:34.494
to put the pressure on Ukraine.

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:35.928
We can never neglect that

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.830
because that fight in Ukraine

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.099
is very much in America's interest.

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:42.001
They're fighting our battle.

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:43.836
They're against Russian aggression.
