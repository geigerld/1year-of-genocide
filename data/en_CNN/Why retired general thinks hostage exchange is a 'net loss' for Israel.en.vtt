00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.334
Let's bring in now

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.086
this is General Wesley Clark,

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:03.920
former NATO's

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.714
NATO's supreme allied commander

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:07.424
and CNN military analyst.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:08.466
General, good to have you.

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.968
I just want to first start

00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:11.386
before I ask you a question.

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.263
We've just got an update from Israeli

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.306
officials on the number of hostages

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:16.516
they believe

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.560
are still being held by Hamas.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.397
That number is 201.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.317
They they know that this is inconsistent

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.069
with the number that has happened before.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.154
But these numbers,

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:29.821
as you know,

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.781
and our viewers can understand, fluctuate

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.616
based on information coming in

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:34.993
so that Israel

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.996
now believes there are 201 hostages

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.083
taken October 7th who are still in Gaza.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.627
Let me ask you about the strategy

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:46.004
moving forward

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.339
and what the military is gaining

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.342
and losing during this period.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.136
The surveillance drones for a

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:57.015
period are not flying over Gaza.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:58.850
They're not bombing the tunnels

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.519
as they have been for seven weeks.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.938
At the end of this truce,

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.483
is it a net gain or loss

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.193
as it relates to that mission

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:09.736
of ending Hamas?

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:10.862
They'll lose potentially

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:11.738
some intelligence

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.698
but gain some from the hostages.

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:14.324
What do you see

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.700
we get at the end of this?

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.870
From the Israeli perspective.

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:20.830
I think from the military perspective

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.792
in Israel, it's a it's a net loss.

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:25.668
And military in Israel

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:26.753
is going to look at this

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:31.174
as first Hamas is has been

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.551
dedicated to the destruction of Israel.

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:34.677
They proved

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:36.846
they're willing to go very far along,

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:38.264
which they are considered

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.058
an existential threat.

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:42.102
And if Israeli military

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.728
looked to the north

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:45.313
and they see Hezbollah

00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:46.773
and they ask themselves

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.484
if Hamas gets away with this and survives

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:52.445
this, what will that say to Hezbollah?

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.615
And what can Hezbollah do on the north,

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.407
to Israel

00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:57.575
if they decide

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:59.410
to follow the same tactics?

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.746
And so there's a lot riding on this.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.248
But the Israeli military

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:05.792
has got to listen to political authority.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.544
There's a lot of political pressure

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.045
coming from Washington

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.172
and also from the Israeli public.

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:13.049
Get those hostages free.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.885
Then we'll worry about what happens next.

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:17.345
Hamas knows this.

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:20.140
Hamas is playing it like a fiddle.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.683
They release hostages.

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:23.643
They're prepared to squeeze

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.603
if they don't get exactly what they want.

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:27.897
They want more food. They want more fuel.

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:31.693
They ultimately want global opinion, too,

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:34.112
and an Israeli opinion

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:38.116
to hold the Israeli military operations.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.994
Hamas then emerges victorious.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.913
There are heroes in the Islamic world,

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.166
or at least in the Palestinian view.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:50.086
And this then gives them a major victory.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.047
Israel maybe gets its people back.

00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:54.674
Maybe not all of them.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.843
And Israel shudders.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.387
Israeli military shudders, thinking

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:01.014
what's going to happen next,

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:04.017
especially if Iran gets a nuclear weapon.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.102
So if you think this truce is a net loss

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.061
for the IDF,

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:07.979
let me ask you plainly,

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.482
do you think the President Biden is wrong

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.527
in his suggestion that

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.988
this truce should be extended

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:20.617
at the end of the four days?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.619
I think President Biden is

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.537
walking a narrow line.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.998
On the one hand, our military

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.374
and the Israeli military know

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.376
what needs to be done with Hamas.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.587
But it is ugly.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.756
It's causing civilian casualties.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:37.091
There is no way to go after a mosque

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:39.385
without inflicting a certain amount

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:40.720
of casualties

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.640
on civilians who are not Hamas.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.600
And so this puts a lot of pressure

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.018
on the United States.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.896
We've got other global objectives.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:53.566
We're not solely dedicated to Israel.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.360
We've got to worry about our relations

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.904
with allies, relationships in the region.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:58.696
And our longer

00:03:58.696 --> 00:03:59.948
objective, longer

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.367
term was to get the Saudis,

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.701
the Kuwaitis and others

00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:04.577
in the region

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.329
aligned with Israel

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.748
so that we could end this issue.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.250
So we've got the longer term

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.875
to think about.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.461
It's a tough position for the president.

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:16.005
Got to get the American hostages out,

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.216
try to prevail on the Israelis

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:21.010
to limit the damage to civilians.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.846
Ultimately, the Israelis have to decide,

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:24.973
are they going

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.141
after the destruction of Hamas

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:28.810
at all costs

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.520
or do they have to balance this

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.438
with their relationship with the West

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.357
and especially with the United States?

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:36.067
And is the destruction of Hamas

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:37.902
even an achievable goal?

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.238
The the political and military

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.615
angle of it may end, but the ideology,

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:43.449
could it come back?

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.951
Will it come back in some other name

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.452
or form? General Wesley Clark.

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.704
Thank you so much for being with us.
