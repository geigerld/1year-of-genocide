To someone who has experienced the terror of October 7th Ahiad Ben-Yitzchak is a survivor and he was enjoying life with friends on the beach when bullets and missiles began to rain down around them. He and his friends did manage to escape and get to an army base and they weren't safe at all when they got there. He decided to leave and make a run for his car, eventually having to abandon it even after he was shot. He wrote this harrowing story of survival and he joins us now to remind people of what happened on October 7th and to remember his friend who was killed. First and foremost, how are you doing? How is your injury, but more importantly because I see you standing here before us mentally. [11:46:14 AM] mentally. How are you doing? &gt;&gt; I'm fine. I'm really excited to be here. To give me an opportunity and it's part of my healing process to talk about it and it's really helpful. You know, I need some time. I think about it a lot. It's -- it's tough, but I'm fine. Like, generally fine. Most of the time I'm sad because I just heard about the bibas family, it's the first time I hear about it and it's -- it's break moi heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I'm fine. I'm okay. &gt;&gt; You are here with us. You're here. You're breathing. You're alive and that's really the most important thing. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; This is a lot to go through. I read your -- I thought it was a journal entry, but it just came out of you. You wrote it first in hebrew and then it was translated and I want to read a bit of that because it really struck me this morning and had me at that point where I was choking up and I could feel the fear in your [11:47:14 AM] could feel the fear in your words. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You say in a bit here. You had gotten to this military installation. You left because you could see that they were going to be overwhelmed and the fighting was coming and you say this, I hear the most dreadful boom as you're running away, pinging, echoing against the metal of the vehicle that you had gotten into be followed by successive gunshots and popping sounds of death. Even before I started driving I thought I had brought extinction to all of us. Here we are being slaughtered in an intimate, personal manner, more intimate than sex. Whoever is shooting at us, knows us and wants to kill us one by one. We are a target. A prize. They're shooting at us with lust. I know they wouldn't let go. This is a new feeling. The feeling of ending. We have no chance and here you are. I'm a very lucky guy. &gt;&gt; How did you get through it? &gt;&gt; It was a miracle, to be honest. It was a miracle, and I didn't think I could get out, not [11:48:16 AM] think I could get out, not alive, not in one piece, but I'm here and I am stand on both feet. I feel really luck, and I still -- like, I am overwholewomaned. Still overwhelmed. &gt;&gt; There's a sense that it's too much to go through. &gt;&gt; It was too much. &gt;&gt; It's too much. Speaking of too much, you and some of your friends did survive, you had someone driving and screaming at him and then you run into the gunmen who are shooting at you and turn around, jump out of the car and it catches fire. It's something out of a horror movie, really, but one of your friends did not survive. Can you tell us about her? Her name is molgava. I missed her a lot. She was walking with me. She was a cook like I did. We had supposed to have a shift the same evening together. She was beautiful. She was so kind, and I just missed her a lot. [11:49:18 AM] missed her a lot. It's so sad. I think about her a lot, and she's missing, and I want -- I want people to know this story for a memorial, and that's it. She's a very good friend of mine and it break my heart every day to think about her. &gt;&gt; She's not here. You did survive. Your friends did survive. You helped them survive and you had no idea, but something pushed you to make it, and I'm -- I'm so glad you're here. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Me, too. &gt;&gt; And able to share stories.
