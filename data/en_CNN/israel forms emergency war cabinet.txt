&gt;&gt;&gt; Top of the hour. I'm John Berman with Kate Bolduan and Sara Sidner. We just learned Israel has a government in the war cabinet, this is Benjamin Netanyahu who made the announcement moments ago all of this as hundreds of thousands Israeli reservists are staged outside Gaza. Let's get right to become Anderson who is in tel aviv who can explain this shift inside the government and what it means. Becky? &gt;&gt; This is really important. What we understand is that these discussions have now being on for some days, and I have to say there was some speculation. We got this news yesterday, but clearly, these negotiations on who is in this unity government and particularly in what will be this war cabinet have been very, very difficult, but as we [10:02:06 AM] very difficult, but as we understand it now, this is Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, in unity now in a coalition government in a car cabinet with Benny Gantz who is the leader of the national unity party and opposition leader and former defense minister, of course, and the defense minister Yoav Gallant this is an emergency situation that is being addressed now by those who have experience of war in government here. What isn't clear is what the makeup of this wider group will be and sources have been telling me that there has been much discussion and demands made by those in opposition that the right wing ministers, the finance and security ministers being veer, will not be part of [10:03:09 AM] being veer, will not be part of it. All we know at this time is that Benjamin Netanyahu is now in unity with Benny Gantz and the defense minister here gallant to to address what happens next and the sense is here that what you didn't have in the cabinet, in the government until Saturday morning was experience. And what you need is Spencer and authority of characters in position who reflect the unity of -- of the Israelis. I am being told now, I am just getting reporting on this. This is an emergency cabinet, a war cabinet at this point. &gt;&gt; Becky, for those who -- I mean, who aren't familiar with the players within Israeli politics so much, just some [10:04:10 AM] politics so much, just some background here of what a G deal this is as you describe it because these are political parties and these are men who are until now, deeply hostile with each other and it does underline the scale of the crisis and how much has changed in Israel since Saturday. Just the background, if you can offer kind of -- Earth shattering is what Saturday was with the hamas terror attack and this as a response to it. Just the perspective on that. &gt;&gt; If we step back and consider what's going on for months and months as being this deep, deep division and reflected on the streets of tel aviv and reflected in this country with hundreds of thousands of Israelis demonstrating and [10:05:11 AM] Israelis demonstrating and protesting against what has been Israel's most right-wing government ever. This sense now that there is an absolute need to bring those who are running this country together in a war cabinet that can now address the security concerns that Israel now face Wes experience. There has been much talk around the judicial reform about how Benjamin Netanyahu and his right wing have want been focused on what Israelis themselves believe is important for them and on Saturday morning, you know, that was revealed. Security and protection. Where was -- why was there such a failure of intelligence? Why is it now that Israelis feel such a sense of insecurity and [10:06:12 AM] such a sense of insecurity and vulnerability? And it was to the prime minister, to organize around him, to ensure now the fingers of blame are pointed to him squarely on what happens going forward and now the crucial nature of what is in play here. The complexity of what happens next with regard of any incursion, ground incursion into gaza. The sense now that the decisionses that are made here in Israel about what happens in the days and weeks ahead should not be left to a government that, frankly, didn't have the experience in cabinet to address these issues. So that now looks like the makeup that we have in what is this new war cabinet, if I can describe it as such with the current defense minister, the [10:07:13 AM] current defense minister, the former defense minister Benny Gantz and Benjamin Netanyahu and heading up the decision making for the state of Israel to address, as I say, the complexities of what happens next. Let's just consider those. They have a ground incursion on the table. They have described by the idf saturated the southern border with troops no in anticipation, one assumes, of a ground incursion. We're not seeing that as of yet, but the complexities we've been reporting now for hours in that you have these hostages being held in various locations as described by hamas around gaza and then the wider story which is the plight of the Palestinians who are in gaza. We have a thousand dead and a total siege of gaza and hospitals being bombed and no fuel now to the palace station [10:08:17 AM] fuel now to the palace station there. Palestinians do work with H generators in gaza. So there will be some generation of electricity and provided by generators, but you know, considering what it is that Israel faces is decision making now and it has been clear for some time that there was a need for -- I don't want to call it levelheadedness, but experience, and this will be -- this will be demands from the outside -- from the international community, from capitals around the world, particularly from Washington demands that this war cabinet
