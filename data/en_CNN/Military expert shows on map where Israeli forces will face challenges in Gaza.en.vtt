00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.670
As questions about hostages remain it appears
preparations for a ground offensive in gaza

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.670
are under way.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.559
Let's take a closer look at gaza with retired
major Mike lions.

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.719
Appreciate you being here.

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.160
To start, we hear constantly about just how
tight it is in gaza for lack of a better term.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.340
About 2 million people, an area about the
size of Chicago.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.310
What complications does that bring for any
type of ground offensive?

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.310
&gt;&gt; Tremendous.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.320
I think we're going to potentially see casualties
and civilian casualties like we haven't seen

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.599
since the second World War, just based on
what Israel has said.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.030
They declared war here.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.550
Are use the word like siege.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.640
Siege from military perspective means flatten.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.489
We're going to surround, choke off the supply.

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.870
I want to talk about the courageous CNN crew.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.760
They're sitting right here.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.480
And they're so close to that gaza border here.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.190
What -- missile fire coming from on the other
side.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.190
Hamas is still firing rockets

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.190
[6:26:34 AM]

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.620
Hamas is still firing rockets inside of Israel.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.479
And so, the airframes you hear are Israel
forces on kind of stationed ready to go ready

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:05.479
to knock them out.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.759
Just shows me they still have capacity.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.120
They have not stopped with regard to attacks
Israel.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.650
&gt;&gt; What are the biggest challenges for Israeli
forces?

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.720
If we do see the ground incursion, nic made
a very good point because he had years of

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.210
experience covering the region, that in his
estimation, they are not amassed enough at

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.220
this point for an imminent incursion, that's
his read on the ground.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.090
When ever it may happen if it does what are
the challenges they face once they get inside

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.090
gaza.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.280
&gt;&gt; It will take them a while to wound up.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.780
It will take days in order of 300,000 reservists
mobilized.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.320
What are their objectives?

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.860
Attack from different sides?

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.830
Going to come from this side here, cut off
hamas troops?

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.610
Obviously this is where the center of gravity
is here with regard to where the hamas troops

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.610
are.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.610
I think Israel has to be very

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.610
[6:27:34 AM]

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.299
I think Israel has to be very concerned overall
about from a strategic perspective.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.570
They have enemy here coming in this direction.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.850
They have Hezbollah coming up from the north.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.690
If they can mass troops in the west bank,
this is the problem trying to fight war on

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.080
three fronts.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.790
That's why they call 300,000 troops up.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.370
Once they go back to gaza, once they get into
this location here, it's going to be street

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.040
fighting, house to house and again large civilian
casualties.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.599
&gt;&gt; We talk about the strikes that we have
seen over the course of the last several days.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.830
There have been air strikes.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.970
We have seen numerous strikes very specific
facilities, at least according to the idf

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.210
and what their targets are.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.710
What do those tell you?

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.360
&gt;&gt; They're going after if you look at some
things.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.170
These are mosques now.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.690
They're taking everything off the table with
regard to collateral damage again.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.370
Normally the military wouldn't attack these
kinds of targets.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.430
They're saying they are clearly military targets.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.530
And in this case they're leaving nothing behind.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.750
You know, in the past they would be more discriminate
with regard they would go after, specific

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.750
[6:28:36 AM]

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.750
they would go after, specific things.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.019
Here they are literally leveling all the kind
of targets they going after.

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.019
There's nothing left now.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.939
&gt;&gt; Those are both mosques you're showing in
the before and after.

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.160
&gt;&gt; On Saturday, there was rockets fired from
Hezbollah southern Lebanon into Israel and

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.690
bit of a pause secretary blinken said and
yesterday seeing more.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.690
Can you speak to the complication of trying
to fight Hezbollah in the north of Israel

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.599
while doing the rest?

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.599
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.560
That's really what Israel has to be concerned
about because they'll have to put troops to

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.560
the north here.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.370
This is where they would come from here.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.300
Also, it would introduce, we warned now, the
Syrian government says, look, if Hezbollah

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.330
decides to come in, they're good fighters.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.450
They've been part of the Syrian civil war.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.390
They have that kind of experience.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.930
Opens up a front where Damascus becomes a
target in this area here.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.000
I think Israel will be forced to put ground
troops up there.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.950
What Israel's advantage here is shock effect.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.250
They bring tanks, air power.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.730
The problem is the enemy is not fighting that
kind of battle.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.730
&gt;&gt; This isn't conventional.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.730
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.730
[6:29:36 AM]

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.730
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.340
They prepared for a war that they didn't get.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.859
&gt;&gt; What are Hezbollah's capabilities compared
to hamas?

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:09.859
&gt;&gt; Better.

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.220
Better, more, greater capability.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.860
Again, still don't really have that shock
effect, but they're good fighters.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.860
There's more of them.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.079
Israel has to be concerned.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.680
This now creates -- if they come in from E
north here, and the attackers are coming from

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.949
the
