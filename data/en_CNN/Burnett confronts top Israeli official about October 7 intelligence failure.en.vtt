00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.500
According to

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.901
The New York Times, Israel

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.570
obtained Hamas's battle

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.672
plan for October 7th,

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.374
more than a year in advance.

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:08.241
And I've seen

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.310
some of the documents myself,

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.513
ones I saw were dated October 20, 22.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.681
The Times points out

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.715
that Hamas documents

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:16.616
that they saw

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:20.120
are shockingly close to reality.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.755
They called for a barrage of rockets

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.356
at the outset of the attack.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:24.824
Hamas did that.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:25.125
They called

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.693
for breaking through the wall.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.128
Hamas did that.

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:29.229
They called for entering via

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.931
a paraglider. Hamas did that.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.933
They called for entering via motorcycle.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.002
Hamas did that.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:36.269
Mark,

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:42.042
to know why this document was dismissed?

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.109
Well, it's clear

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.580
there was an amazing mishap, a failure.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.716
There's no excuses for it.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.085
And we have to look into this.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.787
We paid for our mistakes

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:54.320
on October

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.121
7th in blood

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.289
in the blood of

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.657
over 1200

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.093
Israelis who were who were murdered

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.562
and another 240 that were kidnaped

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.631
and taken to Gaza.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.133
So we have to take this very seriously.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.437
And we can't accept such a failure.

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:13.239
We pride ourselves as Israelis

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.174
for having excellent

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.308
intelligence services.

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:17.010
And in this case,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.211
maybe the information there,

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.112
it wasn't understood.

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:20.313
It didn't go

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.248
up the chain like it should have.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.349
We have to investigate that.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.950
We have to find out

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.318
exactly what happened.

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:27.787
You know, 50 years ago, Erin, there was a

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:31.324
a similar colossal intelligence failure

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.327
when we were attacked in 1973 on the

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.029
Yom Kippur War

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.063
from the south by Egypt,

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:38.898
from the north, by Syria.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.134
And we were then taken by surprise.

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:42.268
And we had after that,

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.104
we had a commission of inquiry

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.506
and lessons were learned

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:49.275
and it was important process for Israel

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.610
and we will probably do the same thing

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.545
now, I'm sure, when this war is over.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.347
We have to look very carefully

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:55.648
at what happened.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:56.883
Where was the information?

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.651
Why wasn't it understood?

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.220
Who is responsible?

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.223
Well, so in July, a veteran intelligence

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.224
veteran I'm sorry, Israeli

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:05.225
intelligence analyst said

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.627
that Hamas had conducted an intense day

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:08.995
long training exercise.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:09.596
And the analysts said

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:10.597
this appears similar to

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.432
what was outlined in the blueprint.

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.199
Now, the analyst,

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.301
we understand, works for Unit 8200,

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.302
which is Israel saying

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.303
signals intelligence

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.772
agency went ahead and warned higher ups.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.341
And according to encrypted emails

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:22.709
reviewed by The New York Times,

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.077
two things then happened.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:24.911
One, Mark,

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:26.012
is that a colonel in the Gaza

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:28.148
division brushed off the concerns.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.115
And two

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.217
is that veteran analysts commented,

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:31.985
and I quote,

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.419
I utterly refute that

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.588
the scenario is imaginary.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.824
You can almost hear the frustration

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:38.791
in the words

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:41.494
that that analysts chose to use.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:42.295
Mark, I'm curious

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:43.263
as to what you think as to

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:45.899
why there was such disbelief

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.066
when Israel at that point

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.168
had the battle plans

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.903
and then visual proof of the plans

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:50.737
being practiced.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:55.175
Why was there still such disbelief?

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.709
So all these questions need

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.044
to be looked at seriously

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:00.413
and professionally and objectively

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:01.981
and will do this.

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:03.449
It's our obligation.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.184
I mean, ultimately,

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:07.187
Israel will continue to live in a in a

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.222
in a challenging neighborhood

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:09.789
and some other

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:10.523
some would even say

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:11.858
a dangerous neighborhood.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:12.625
And therefore, it's

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:13.626
our obligation

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:14.994
that our intelligence services

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:15.662
have to be good.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.230
And if there are failures,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.064
we have to understand

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:19.532
where the failures happened

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.034
and why they happened.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.202
So was the Prime Minister

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:26.372
Netanyahu aware of the Hamas document?

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.241
I'm not aware that he was.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:31.244
I don't know that he was aware he would.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.513
He's said, like everyone else,

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.248
that when when the

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:36.382
in their investigations

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:37.650
after this war exactly what happened,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.184
he will, of course,

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:39.752
be there to answer questions

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:41.521
and tell exactly what he was given

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:43.289
and what he wasn't given.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.190
But at this point, you

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.692
and he haven't even had a conversation

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:45.925
as to

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:47.460
whether he was aware of these documents.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.996
The New York Times reporting about.

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:51.864
No, not this specific document.

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:52.732
But we have

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:53.933
we have had conversations

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:54.801
on this general level.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.803
But once again, these discussions

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:58.805
we need to discuss

00:03:58.805 --> 00:03:59.372
at the right

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:00.240
time in the right time

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.675
will be after this war at the moment.

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.577
I think all of Israel is focused

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:05.411
on winning this war.

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.413
We have to win this war against Hamas

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.581
so that October 7th

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.782
can never happen again.
