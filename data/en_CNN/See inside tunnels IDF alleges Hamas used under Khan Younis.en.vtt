00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.201
As we've

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.035
very clear here, is

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.370
sure to be a topic tonight

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.138
in the debate is Israel

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:06.006
how much support

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:06.973
the United States is willing

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:08.575
to give Israel specifically

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:10.977
and how conditional is that support?

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:12.212
So much of that war tonight

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.613
still being waged below ground.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:14.347
And now

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.215
and it is important

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:16.049
right ahead of this debate,

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.817
CNN has gotten incredible access

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.019
for the first time

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.454
going deep inside captured Hamas tunnels.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.023
In fact, the first Western television

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.657
crew allowed to go inside.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.060
Khan Younis was our Nic Robertson,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.827
and he got a rare

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:28.294
look at where

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:29.763
hostages were held underground.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:30.930
And as part of this access,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.532
which did come from the IDF,

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.067
it is important that, you know,

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.735
that CNN did agree to report

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.738
from Gaza under IDF escort at all times

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:39.806
as a condition for journalists

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.141
to join the embed with the IDF.

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:41.775
Media outlets

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:42.609
must submit footage

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.010
filmed in Gaza to the IDF

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.845
for Security Review.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.314
Now, CNN did not submit its final report

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:49.082
to the IDF

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.151
and retained editorial control,

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.652
but we want to be very transparent

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:53.453
with you.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.654
Nic Robertson is OUTFRONT

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.056
with this incredible report

00:00:56.056 --> 00:01:01.094
that you will see. First, OUTFRONT,

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.663
Hanh Yunis, a gunner's view,

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:04.664
driving in,

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:06.332
scouring the landscape

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.734
for threats,

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.203
problem for these IDF troops.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.872
Enemy is mostly hiding in tunnels.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:13.740
They say

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.607
the biggest issue

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:15.241
is the fact

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.911
that we are actually maneuvering

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.213
above ground underground.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.816
Golfers who commands Israel's biggest

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:26.352
military division ever is adapting.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.288
So you use all your senses that you have.

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.623
You use your vision sensor,

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:31.991
you use your field sensor,

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:34.127
the smell sensor.

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:36.029
You know, he's invited

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.399
CNN to go deep into the tunnels.

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.233
We are told

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.769
this is the heart of Khan Younis,

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.003
and the hostages

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.439
are likely underground nearby

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.742
and that some were held here.

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:53.446
This tunnel we're going in here is one

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.516
where some of the hostages were held,

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:58.751
that first round of hostage releases.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.588
Some of them came out from down here.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.723
So how deep does this tunnel go?

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:06.860
Our first time to get up close to what?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.628
Shaping this war.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.029
We are moving underground.

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.064
We maneuver underground.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:11.865
We get a reach

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.032
every each

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:15.001
and every militant

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.337
or each and every terrorist underground.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:18.271
No modern army

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.806
has had to fight aboveground

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.808
an underground like this before.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.010
How how is that to do it?

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.078
It's difficult

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.680
and it's just going to be a very, very

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.885
hard, long fight to see just how hard.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.520
He takes us deeper.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.555
So we came down a metal ladder.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:37.357
We've come down one flight of stairs.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:38.191
We're going down

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.993
a second flight of stairs here.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.061
It's a double flight, it looks like.

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:42.896
And down here,

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.097
command and control

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:47.100
was running all the way down.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.435
It's a deep, deep system.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.603
How deep are we underground,

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:51.804
do you think, right now?

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.940
At the moment, we are more or less

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.775
between 10 to 15 meters underground.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:57.043
10 to 15 meters.

00:02:57.043 --> 00:03:00.046
And now we're going down another level,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.582
down more steps

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.350
about to go down again.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.055
Another level.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.423
So my head keeps

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:13.426
banging off the roof.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:14.527
What are we looking at here?

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:17.330
This is a small room, okay?

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.032
With some kind of air ventilation system

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.133
and ventilation system.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.267
This goes up and boom,

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.502
metal frame around the door.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:24.270
These metal frames,

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.305
this can be

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.173
as much as this is a small room.

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:30.977
This is how the different

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:34.080
cages that they put the kidnaped.

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:35.515
So they were held in cages.

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.283
In cages you

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:40.053
hidden and utterly cut off

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:40.887
and found here.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.189
You really can't hear anything.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.859
What's going on in the outside world

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:47.160
now?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.129
We must be 20 or 30 meters down.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.064
We're almost 20.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.233
Almost 20.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.934
So they have tunnels three times

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:57.870
as deep as this time.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.405
What's clear here?

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.173
The money,

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:03.176
planning and preparation invested

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:06.112
for a long siege

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:07.347
with 20 meters

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.716
underground here, 20 meters.

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:13.553
And there's a fully flush toilet.

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.155
And it's even painted a nice place

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.590
for a light bulb.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.027
And light switches the tiles.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.129
The labyrinth keeps going.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.231
Okay, now it's so low,

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:26.432
we're getting down on our knees

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:27.267
to get through.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.434
All right. Yeah.

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:29.068
Gold for us.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:30.236
Pauses,

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:33.673
lays out his path to victory underground.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.775
It's Hamas,

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.777
and we have to reach

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:42.582
this Hamas core

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:44.384
to finish them off.

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:45.918
But those Palestinian people

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:47.420
aboveground are also dying.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.722
So I understand that.

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:50.356
I understand.

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:50.623
That's why

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.125
we're trying to do it as fast as we can.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.726
Yesterday,

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:54.560
there were mortars

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.897
and rockets fired from north of Gaza

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.399
to the southern state of Israel

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.734
into the civilian part of Israel.

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:02.902
So as long as those rockets

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:03.970
are coming out of northern Gaza,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.371
the people of the south

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:06.306
who have moved to the south

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.240
can't go back to the north

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.341
as long as we haven't

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:09.242
carried out our mission

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:10.209
all the way,

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:12.679
as long as we haven't finished this

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:13.780
this mission,

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.782
I don't think we will leave here.

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:18.751
We had back half an hour underground.

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:21.587
We've seen only a fraction of this war

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:25.458
changing labyrinth gold versus challenge.

00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:29.329
Find all the others.

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:30.463
All right,

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:33.232
Nic, 65 feet underground where you are,

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:36.302
it just even comprehend that your head

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.270
hitting the ceiling.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.970
I mean, it's amazing

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.505
you were even able to withstand that,

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:41.674
to experience that yourself.

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.810
But when you're down there,

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.946
how is it that the IDF says or knows

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:47.714
that they're so close

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:49.816
to Hamas hostages in those tunnels

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.617
or in tunnels next to them

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:56.222
and yet isn't able to get them out?

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.090
And that's the

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.191
that's the difficult thing.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.726
How do you fight the battle

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:00.493
when you're fighting

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.061
in several dimensions?

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:02.462
You know,

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:04.230
I said to him, normally in a battle

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.698
you would outflank your enemy.

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:07.233
You get around the side of them.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:08.368
But down there,

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.902
he said, you know,

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:10.737
we don't even know

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:12.138
we can be standing on top of them.

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:13.439
They can be underneath us.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.274
So we've got to try to fight

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:17.243
in all these different dimensions.

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:19.679
But they do have good intelligence

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:21.280
that's part of the picture.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.582
And in that tunnel, at least,

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:25.585
they were able to extract DNA evidence,

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:26.552
blood

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.855
hair of the previous of the hostages

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.323
that actually been held down there.

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:31.491
So there's a lot of technical

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.625
equipment use as well.
