00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:00.291
With the

00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:01.418
dire conditions in

00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:03.420
Gaza, babies born prematurely

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.170
and their mothers

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.880
are facing huge challenges

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.133
as they try to find adequate care.

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.217
CNN's Larry Meadows

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:13.763
takes us inside one hospital.

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:15.515
Every breath is a miracle

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.017
for these babies born

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.643
prematurely during the war

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:20.228
in the Gaza Strip.

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:21.187
They're here

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.439
because Israeli forces

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.982
ordered the al-Shifa hospital

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.692
in the north evacuated,

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:26.317
claiming

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:29.696
Hamas terrorists operated from there.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.489
Baby formula is the only source

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.033
of nutrition here.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:33.908
Many of the mothers

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:35.660
have not been found yet.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.581
Nobody knows if they're alive or dead.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:41.583
Saima Abu had just arrived

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:42.709
and is meeting her daughter

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.002
for the first time

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.422
since she was born 38 days ago.

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:48.256
And you can

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.507
you can tell me,

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:50.967
your father says to tell you

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.218
that he loves you.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.180
She tells Bibi Kanda, her voice breaking.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.473
This is the closest

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.600
she can get to her own child.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.601
She was intubated as

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.895
soon as she was born.

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:04.939
And has that impression that.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.775
We were under siege in the north.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.526
I didn't know anything about my daughter.

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:10.320
We had no connectivity.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.196
When the truce came,

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:13.782
I found out that she was in Egypt.

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.658
Kanda and 11 other preterm

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.202
babies from al-Shifa

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.369
came to the new Capital

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.205
Administrative Hospital in Cairo

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.415
over two weeks ago.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.250
Nine more have arrived from across

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.044
Gaza since.

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:26.920
How relieved

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.588
are you to be able to see your baby

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:31.132
finally didn't come? Camden.

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:33.343
I'm very happy, thank God.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:34.427
Today I felt like a mother

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.513
because I've never seen her before.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.556
I just want to hold her and touch her.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.100
The Muslim

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.017
doctors say

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:44.020
she'll be able to hold her daughter soon.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.773
All the babies in this neonatal intensive

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:47.816
care unit

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.567
are under six weeks old,

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:50.902
and yet they have already been through

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:53.696
so much in their short lives.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:54.781
A war

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.991
and a risky journey across the border

00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:59.077
from the Gaza Strip to here

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:01.579
in the Egyptian capital.

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:02.288
SASSON Abu

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.249
Hamza gave birth to twin girls

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.542
two months early,

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:06.751
just six days

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:07.919
after the Israel-Hamas

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.796
war started in the north.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.381
Behind the Gaza.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:12.549
There were airstrikes

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:13.883
and heavy bombardment,

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:15.385
the dead everywhere.

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:16.719
It all weighed down on me.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.097
So I had labor pains and cramps.

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.890
They took me to Shifa Hospital.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.351
And I spent a week in the ICU

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.811
before then.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:25.645
One of the girls

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.522
has been discharged from the night cue

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:28.690
and she can breastfeed her

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.858
in the nursery.

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:30.775
But the twin sister

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:32.652
remains in an incubator.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:33.153
Their mother

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.697
never thought she would see them again.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.323
Not in my heart.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.117
Shifa was under siege.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.660
Out of despair, I lost hope.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.744
And I left.

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:43.705
I wanted to take my girls with me.

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.373
But the doctors said if I did,

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.666
they would die.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.667
They said to leave them

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.336
and God would protect them.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.421
Doctors say all the

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.839
babies are doing better

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.632
than when they arrived in Cairo.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.176
But most of cases are growing

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.802
and will increasingly end

00:02:57.802 --> 00:02:59.929
with the general condition.

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.973
Political feeding.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.641
Some problems and some vision.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.435
Not too much.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.603
In fact, eight

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.896
have made it out of the night cue

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.397
into this nursery.

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:11.274
But reuniting them with their parents

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.610
might be harder than saving their lives.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.111
We not only is a name.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:16.112
For the mother,

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.530
but we don't know

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.408
where is the mother is now.

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.952
