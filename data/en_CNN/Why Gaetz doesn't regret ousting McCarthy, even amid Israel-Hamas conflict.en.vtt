00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.251
The House finally get a speaker

00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:03.044
so that it can get back to work.

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:03.878
Friday, Ohio

00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:04.963
GOP Congressman Jim

00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:07.298
Jordan was nominated to be speaker

00:00:07.298 --> 00:00:08.383
after garnering support

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:09.175
from both deposed

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.176
speaker Kevin McCarthy

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.387
and from Fox anchor Sean HANNITY.

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:13.596
Without a leader of the GOP

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:14.139
has frozen

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.098
the chamber during several

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.599
looming crises from Israel's

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.101
war against Hamas

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.060
to a potential government

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.354
shutdown now just 34 days away.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:21.938
It's unclear

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:23.481
if Jordan can win enough support

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:24.816
from the entire House

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:27.402
to get the requisite 217 votes

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:28.862
in a secret ballot on Friday.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.448
He still had 55 Republicans opposed.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:32.949
Joining me now is the person who started

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:33.992
this whole chain of events

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.827
by pushing for McCarthy's ouster,

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.704
Florida Representative Matt Gaetz.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.831
Congressman, do you regret ousting

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:40.707
Kevin McCarthy

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:41.583
given that Israel

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:42.834
is now at war with Hamas

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.919
and we don't have a speaker?

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.087
Absolutely not.

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:47.714
The United States stands with Israel.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.424
Israel has a right to defend itself,

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.468
and there is no need expressed

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:52.844
by Israel that the United States

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:54.179
has not been able to meet.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.097
That's because we have an Israel

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:57.766
essentially on autopay

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.309
as a consequence of legislation

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.935
that was passed by Senator

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.771
Marco Rubio of Florida.

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.106
The administration is pre authorized

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:06.066
to meet any need

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.275
that Israel could

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:09.944
possibly express in this particular phase

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:10.862
of the crisis.

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:12.781
My expectation is that we will elect

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.407
speaker designate Jim Jordan

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.909
as House speaker next week

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.452
and we'll be prepared to move forward

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:19.537
with resolutions of support.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:20.872
But those are non-binding

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.415
expressions of our opinion

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.708
when it comes to the movement

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:25.376
of specific material

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:27.670
and the coordination on intelligence.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.838
We are authorized

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:29.798
because our relationship

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:31.883
with Israel is that unique.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.176
How how do you think that

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:34.177
Jordan crosses

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:36.221
the finish line with True 17?

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.264
If there were 55 votes against him,

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.266
as is being reported, you were there

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.768
55 votes against him

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.437
on that second ballot last night?

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.188
Well, I think it's important

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.190
to understand how that math moved.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.607
Initially,

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.943
there were 81 votes against Jim Jordan,

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.611
and then about 30 minutes later,

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:52.904
there were only 55 votes

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:53.738
against Jim Jordan.

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:55.073
So on that trajectory,

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:55.990
he seems to be gaining

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.575
a good amount of momentum.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:58.660
Also, it's important to note

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.702
that those 55

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:02.080
no votes on Jordan were on a secret

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.456
anonymous ballot,

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:04.749
like in the basement

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.501
of the Longworth Office Building.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:07.961
It's quite a different thing

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.254
to stand on the floor

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:10.755
of the House of Representatives

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:12.590
and vote against the second

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.424
most popular

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:15.426
living Republican in America.

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:16.719
I know how hard it is

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:17.679
to stand on the floor

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.430
and vote against the party's choice.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.850
I did it to extract concessions

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.350
that I thought

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.017
were meaningful

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:24.936
that unfortunately the former speaker

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.104
did not live up to.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:29.023
But my my expectation is that next week

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:30.441
we will elect Jim Jordan.

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:31.151
Frankly, Michael,

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:31.568
I think we

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.403
probably could have done it last night

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.363
and I would have preferred that path.

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:36.656
But Speaker

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.492
Emeritus McCarthy said that he wanted Jim

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.619
Jordan's family to be able to be there,

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.454
his supporters to be able to be there.

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:44.497
And I guess one thing

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:45.748
that Kevin McCarthy and I agree

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:47.000
on, Jim Jordan's going to be

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.751
the next speaker of the House.

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:50.378
You've heard the criticisms, right,

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:50.920
from people,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.172
including in your own caucus.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:52.881
I think one member

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:53.464
who said that,

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:54.632
that it's a group of idiots

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.050
who have led us down this path.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.677
Others say we look Third world

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:58.720
ish at a time

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.180
when we need to be looking

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.098
as a model for democracies

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:03.099
around the globe.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.059
How do you respond to those who say that

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.395
the whole perception of the United States

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.314
and the dysfunction of Congress

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:10.732
is what has arisen

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:13.359
out of your ouster of Kevin McCarthy?

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.486
I find it a little ridiculous, right?

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:17.405
Like, Oh no, the world is ending

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:18.823
because the House of Representatives

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:19.741
isn't passing

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.451
ceremonial resolutions this week.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:22.994
The entire United States

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.913
Senate was out all week.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.039
The House of Representatives

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.082
takes seven weeks off

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:29.167
every single year

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.044
for essentially a summer vacation.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:31.669
There are days

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.297
when all we vote on are procedural votes

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.590
and post offices.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.134
So I think that the chaos narrative

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:39.594
is a bit overplayed,

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.221
particularly in the Beltway,

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.430
because the lobbyists

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.723
and the special interests

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.099
want someone in the speakership

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.935
that they totally control.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.937
They had that in Kevin McCarthy.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.188
And just because lobbyists

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:51.105
and special interests

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:52.941
have been disempowered

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.192
by the motion to vacate

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.777
doesn't mean it was the wrong decision.

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:56.736
And it doesn't mean that

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.029
like we're in chaos

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.530
because there were ten days

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.365
when the lights were off

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.157
on the House floor.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.825
We have not put our pencils down.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:03.534
This last week

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:04.994
we were getting classified briefings

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.496
on the evolving situation

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:07.288
in the Middle East.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.666
I was taking depositions of former

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:10.541
and current Department

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.709
of Justice officials

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.920
as pursuant to our oversight work.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.879
So don't believe that

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.006
just because there isn't floor action

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:17.632
that somehow

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:18.925
all of our representatives

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:19.634
aren't working.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:20.218
We, in fact,

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.095
are continuing the work of the Congress.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.388
I heard the point that you made.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.222
Everybody heard the point

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.807
that you made about a quote unquote,

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.350
autopay for Israel.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.601
To the extent

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.186
there's congressional action

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:33.398
required of any kind vis a vis Israel,

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.775
will you be seeking to tie it

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.777
to support for Ukraine?

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:41.781
Well, no, I'll be seeking to to untether

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.616
any question about Ukraine

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.617
from any question on Israel.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.077
And it's important to ask that question

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:46.619
because when what.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.578
Does that mean?

00:04:47.578 --> 00:04:47.829
Well,

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.455
I think that they deserve their own vote

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:50.540
and their own dignity. Right.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.166
However you feel about Israel

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:54.168
and however you feel about Ukraine,

00:04:54.168 --> 00:04:56.004
I think that a responsible

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.256
and reasonable government

00:04:58.256 --> 00:04:58.965
ought to address

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.216
those questions separately.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.801
They shouldn't be lashed together.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:02.343
For example,

00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:03.344
I would support

00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:04.929
meeting additional requests

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:06.556
for from Israel for aid.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.266
I would not for Ukraine.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.518
So, you know, mushing things together,

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:11.894
log rolling them.

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:13.646
That is the old way of Washington.

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.148
That's what I'm trying to change,

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.691
whether it's our budgeting process

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:17.734
or our foreign aid.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.235
I want individual votes

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.029
on separate and disparate questions.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.863
I don't want. Okay.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.865
But many of your colleagues,

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.033
many of your colleagues

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.326
don't share that view.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.577
Is that your understanding?

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:28.578
In other words,

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.038
those who seek to diminish

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:32.290
United States support for Ukraine

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.084
are now looking to this Israel issue

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:37.045
as a means of doing so.

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:37.628
Unless

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:40.631
unless we get a reduced role for Ukraine,

00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:41.632
we're not going to support

00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:43.509
Israel to the extent you'd like us to.

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.345
That's a sentiment that I'm hearing.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:45.762
Well,

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:46.846
that is not the sentiment

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:47.805
from the administration.

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:49.682
The administration is trying to combine

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:50.475
the question.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.268
I am trying to separate the question.

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:53.603
And one of the concessions

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:54.896
that we did get in House

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.356
rules that will outlast Speaker

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.649
McCarthy is the ability in the Rules

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:59.776
Committee to be able

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.110
to raise points of order

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.320
and raise questions

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.613
to try to separate those things.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:04.113
In fact,

00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:05.239
when we had our defense

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:07.241
bill are $886 billion

00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:08.117
defense bill,

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:09.994
Marjorie Taylor GREENE was successful

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.579
in getting a separate vote

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:13.373
on the 300 million for Ukraine

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:14.457
because of those single

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.251
subject concessions we got in January.

00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:18.795
That 300 million for Ukraine

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:19.962
still passed,

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:20.755
but it passed

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.632
with a majority of Republicans

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:23.591
voting against it.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.343
So now we have

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:27.678
for anyone to move legislation

00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:29.013
to support Ukraine,

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:30.431
they would have to roll

00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:32.183
a majority of the Republicans

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:32.767
who now believe

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:33.393
we should be less

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.685
involved in that conflict.

00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:35.603
But that in no way

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:38.064
diminishes our support for Israel,

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.524
which is very strong but

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:41.734
in a bipartisan fashion.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:42.819
Final quick question.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.320
What's your answer to my poll

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.321
question today?

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:46.614
Should the Biden administration

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:47.865
encourage, quote unquote,

00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:50.201
de-escalation in Gaza?

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.619
I knew I was getting this question.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.995
I think the Biden administration

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:54.372
should be most focused

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.373
on really

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.041
putting pressure on Egypt to set up

00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:58.960
refugee camps and passageways.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.837
You only de-escalate

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.588
after the military operations

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:03.548
are concluded.

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:04.715
So my answer to the question

00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:06.259
would be no today.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.760
But I think our diplomatic efforts

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.678
should be focused

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.555
on humanitarian passageways

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.515
to get civilians out of Gaza.

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:15.560
If we have a pile of dead Muslim kids

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:16.602
that could increase

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.104
the amount of terrorism in the world,

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.147
not decrease it.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.982
Though I understand Israel's

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:21.816
very sincere

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.025
and legitimate efforts

00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:25.987
to destroy Hamas once and for all.

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:26.654
But Catherine,

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:27.947
put the social media up there.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.031
It's probably a complaint

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.451
either about Gates or me hosting him.

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.369
So maybe he'll want to respond.

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.288
Quote, Jordan is the worst

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.415
of the bad choices for speaker.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.291
Further proof

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.751
that the GOP cannot govern effectively

00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:42.253
for all of America.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:43.838
You'd say what to that person.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.006
Add X.

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.508
Yeah. At x76.

00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:47.884
I guess.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:48.468
I'm glad you're

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.010
not a member

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.261
of the United States Congress

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.762
because if you were, you'd know that Jim

00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:54.390
Jordan is a good man, a virtuous man,

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.184
someone who is broadly respected

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:57.935
across the Republican conference

00:07:57.935 --> 00:07:59.353
and you know where he stands.

00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:00.438
That's a distinction between

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:01.939
Jim Jordan and Kevin McCarthy.

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:02.773
It's one of the reasons I'm

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:04.901
so excited to make him House speaker.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:05.234
Right.

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:06.194
But people like me

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:06.652
say, hey,

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:07.612
McCarthy was willing

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:08.738
to reach across the aisle

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.031
and keep the government functioning.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:10.781
McCarthy was willing

00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:11.741
to reach across the aisle

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.075
and raise the debt ceiling lest

00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:14.660
we would have suffered default.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.370
Those are those are good things.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.789
10 seconds, you get the final word.

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:20.416
Well, I think that Kevin McCarthy

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:23.169
was ousted by Democrats and Republicans

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.337
because he made multiple

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.963
contradictory promises

00:08:25.963 --> 00:08:27.673
that he never intended to keep.

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:29.050
Jim Jordan puts us back

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.760
on a path to fiscal sanity

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.345
and he gets the Republican Party

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.638
back into the fighting posture

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:35.056
we need to be in to win elections

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:37.308
and push our policy objectives.

00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:38.351
Congressman Gates, thank

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.560
you for coming back.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.228
Thank you, Michael.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:40.937
Always good to be with you.
