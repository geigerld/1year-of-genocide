00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.202
&gt;&gt; Out front now, doctor

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:08.969
Barbara's end.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.071
And doctors, and it is

00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:10.837
incredible to finally see.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:12.339
I know you are literally on

00:00:12.807 --> 00:00:14.141
your way, back home.

00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:16.077
I can only imagine the

00:00:16.343 --> 00:00:17.144
conflicted feelings you have

00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:19.213
about that, you are eager to be

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:20.314
going home, but of course leave

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:21.315
behind so much suffering.

00:00:21.816 --> 00:00:22.316
How do you feel right now?

00:00:22.817 --> 00:00:27.421
&gt;&gt; Well, just as you said, I

00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:28.322
feel mixed.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.357
I am relieved to be on my way

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:33.360
home, I know being there, I

00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:34.361
couldn't do anything to help

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.329
what was going on.

00:00:36.097 --> 00:00:40.167
But also, yeah, just so sad for

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:41.235
the people of gaza, and

00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:42.503
concerned about what is going

00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:43.838
to be going on in the next

00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:45.172
weeks to months to, however

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:49.176
long it takes to getome peace

00:00:49.443 --> 00:00:49.844
there.

00:00:49.844 --> 00:00:52.179
&gt;&gt; And, there is so much

00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:52.946
suffering.

00:00:53.314 --> 00:00:54.315
I know Barbara while you are,

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:55.382
there it was so hard for you to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.350
get any contact.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.519
I mean, your husband, Paul who

00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:01.055
we respect to every day,

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:02.256
sometimes he got a text from,

00:01:02.857 --> 00:01:03.357
you sometimes he couldn't even.

00:01:03.457 --> 00:01:04.125
And he was obviously quite

00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:04.891
distressed.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.194
But you know, there were times

00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:08.195
he told us you are sleeping in

00:01:08.462 --> 00:01:10.131
a car with six other people.

00:01:10.397 --> 00:01:12.133
You had reported that food and

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:13.334
water were in short supply.

00:01:13.868 --> 00:01:15.202
You have seen people fighting

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:16.137
over food outside of the

00:01:16.403 --> 00:01:17.338
compound where you were.

00:01:17.872 --> 00:01:19.073
And you talked about a toilet

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.142
shared by 800 people, which

00:01:21.408 --> 00:01:23.077
just to imagine the thought of

00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:24.145
that what that means for,

00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:25.146
people the duress.

00:01:25.412 --> 00:01:27.214
What more can you tell us about

00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:28.349
the conditions inside gaza

00:01:28.883 --> 00:01:31.085
right now, doctors and?

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.222
&gt;&gt; Well, it is great that the

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:36.357
aid is moving in, but there is

00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:37.391
so much more aid that is

00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:37.991
needed.

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:40.294
And so, it's so difficult.

00:01:41.028 --> 00:01:41.362
The --

00:01:41.362 --> 00:01:42.296
ran out of water.

00:01:42.563 --> 00:01:44.031
And we were getting short on

00:01:44.298 --> 00:01:44.798
water.

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:45.432
And at one point, we only

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.433
thought we had about two more

00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:47.401
days of food left.

00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:50.104
And, we were able to have

00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:53.174
someone risked their lives and go to north, gaza and get some

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.940
food for our.

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:56.377
Group and we were the fortunate

00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:57.244
ones.

00:01:57.244 --> 00:01:59.180
Really, people were just having

00:01:59.446 --> 00:02:00.314
trouble just getting food,

00:02:00.581 --> 00:02:02.049
finding food in the grocery

00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:02.816
stores.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.550
And getting water.

00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:05.186
A friend of mine there today

00:02:05.452 --> 00:02:07.321
says he is drinking the tap

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:10.257
water, which is salty, and not

00:02:10.524 --> 00:02:12.059
safe, 80% of the water there is

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:12.826
unsafe.

00:02:12.927 --> 00:02:14.061
So it is concerning, it is

00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:14.929
concerning about the health.

00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:17.198
And like you said, the toilet

00:02:17.464 --> 00:02:20.067
issues, the sanitation, that's

00:02:20.334 --> 00:02:20.935
--

00:02:20.935 --> 00:02:22.069
dysentery for those, especially

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:22.937
the children there.

00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:24.138
And you know, that's half of

00:02:24.405 --> 00:02:25.339
the population.

00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:28.075
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes and of course the

00:02:28.342 --> 00:02:29.009
population to which you have

00:02:29.343 --> 00:02:32.079
dedicated your career, and your

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:32.947
life and your care.

00:02:32.947 --> 00:02:34.014
For doctors in, I mention your

00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:35.282
husband Paul, and I just want

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:36.083
to bring him into the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.850
conversation.

00:02:37.084 --> 00:02:39.220
Because he was with us, and

00:02:39.486 --> 00:02:40.020
everyone watching every day,

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:42.156
sharing any update he had, from

00:02:43.157 --> 00:02:44.024
you throughout this entire

00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:45.025
ordeal.

00:02:45.292 --> 00:02:47.094
I know you can see Barbara,

00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:48.295
literally on her way to come

00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:50.097
home to you.

00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:52.233
How does it feel to finally be

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.034
in this, moment to see her, to

00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:55.169
know that she is safe, and you

00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:56.103
know that she is on her way

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.171
home to you?

00:02:57.438 --> 00:03:01.041
&gt;&gt; Well it's incredible.

00:03:01.308 --> 00:03:04.178
It's one of those things where,

00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:06.180
I knew it would happen, but it

00:03:06.447 --> 00:03:08.249
seemed like time was dragging

00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:09.015
on.

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.186
And then at some point, I did

00:03:12.453 --> 00:03:13.254
get pretty pessimistic.

00:03:14.054 --> 00:03:16.123
But otherwise, I am just very

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.259
happy that she is on her way

00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:19.025
home.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.997
&gt;&gt; Doctors in I mean, I know

00:03:23.264 --> 00:03:24.331
that you can talk.

00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:25.266
But here in this moment.

00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:27.268
I mean, is there anything that

00:03:27.534 --> 00:03:29.069
you would want to say to Paul,

00:03:29.336 --> 00:03:30.404
before you get on that plane.

00:03:31.138 --> 00:03:32.339
And, obviously you'll be with

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:35.142
him tomorrow, right at this

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.909
time?

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.147
&gt;&gt; Yeah I you know, I think

00:03:40.414 --> 00:03:41.215
it's harder to --

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:43.551
we had challenges here.

00:03:44.018 --> 00:03:47.221
But you know, it's harder to --

00:03:48.088 --> 00:03:51.091
and so I really, I really

00:03:51.358 --> 00:03:52.159
appreciate all the love and

00:03:52.426 --> 00:03:54.161
support --

00:03:54.428 --> 00:03:55.029
and.

00:03:56.163 --> 00:03:57.231
And I just am also there for

00:03:57.498 --> 00:03:57.998
them.

00:03:58.032 --> 00:04:01.168
&gt;&gt; Well they had such

00:04:01.435 --> 00:04:02.369
incredible care for.

00:04:03.103 --> 00:04:06.173
You doctors, you mentioned your

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.441
conflicted feelings, because of

00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:09.176
what you are leaving behind.

00:04:10.044 --> 00:04:11.312
This was not your first trip to

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:12.446
gaza, you have been several

00:04:12.713 --> 00:04:14.181
times before, to help children

00:04:14.448 --> 00:04:14.948
there.

00:04:15.115 --> 00:04:18.252
Do you think you will go back?

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.188
&gt;&gt; I have to talk to Paul about

00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:21.955
that.

00:04:22.122 --> 00:04:24.058
I definitely want to come back,

00:04:24.325 --> 00:04:26.060
and continue to work with

00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:27.561
Palestinian children.

00:04:28.262 --> 00:04:29.196
But, we will have to make that

00:04:29.463 --> 00:04:32.132
a family discussions, right.

00:04:33.067 --> 00:04:33.567
&gt;&gt; Paul?

00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:38.205
&gt;&gt; Yet we'll, we'll have

00:04:38.472 --> 00:04:40.207
vigorous discourse on that,

00:04:40.474 --> 00:04:40.974
yes.

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:45.079
&gt;&gt; I can only imagine.

00:04:45.346 --> 00:04:47.147
I guess I'm glad that, I guess

00:04:47.414 --> 00:04:49.083
I'm glad eavesdropping on your

00:04:49.283 --> 00:04:50.084
conversation here, it made us

00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:52.086
all smile, in such a moment of

00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:53.087
darkness and pain and

00:04:53.354 --> 00:04:54.088
everything that you have

00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:55.155
witnessed and endured, doctors

00:04:55.422 --> 00:04:55.922
and.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.224
My thoughts are with you.

00:04:58.092 --> 00:05:00.160
And police have a safe trip

00:05:00.427 --> 00:05:01.228
home, and we will all be so

00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:02.429
glad that the two of you will

00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:04.298
be reunited, and your son as

00:05:04.565 --> 00:05:05.065
well.

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:05.799
So thank you, again.
