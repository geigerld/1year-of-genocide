00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.935
fears of an expanding

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.570
conflict in the Middle East.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.238
After Israel's foreign minister

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:06.606
warns Hezbollah

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.274
it would be destroyed

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.944
if all out war breaks out.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:14.514
Israel Katz his comments online follow

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.049
Hezbollah's release of a purported

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.118
nine minute drone video

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.453
that shows sensitive military locations

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.522
and civilian areas in Haifa

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.357
and other Israeli cities.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.358
And while tensions

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.727
percolate along the northern border

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:29.195
with Lebanon, there's a brewing

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.297
diplomatic rift between

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:32.932
the Netanyahu government

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.868
and the white House.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.437
We are connecting the dots on this

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.072
for you with Ben Wedeman back with us

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.640
this hour from Beirut.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.509
Paula Hancocks is in

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.476
Jerusalem, and Loren

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:46.846
Fox is in Washington on Capitol Hill.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.315
Let me start with you, Ben.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:53.086
just describe to us the importance

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:58.058
of this purported video, shot by, drones.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.092
Hezbollah says,

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.729
from Lebanon

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.832
over Israeli cities, including Haifa,

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:06.966
which of course, serves

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.201
as a crucial gateway

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.202
to the rest of the world.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.438
And maybe more importantly, for Israel.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:14.207
How does Hezbollah manage to fly a drone

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:17.544
in such strategic locations?

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:19.979
And is this psychological warfare

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.982
that we're looking at here?

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:24.217
Well, basically,

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.819
I think the Israelis are also trying

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.020
to figure out how it is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.089
that Hezbollah was able to fly

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:29.856
those drones

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.859
over some very sensitive military,

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.962
positions, military industries, the port,

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:40.033
where we see huge oil storage facilities.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.469
They got it all. Now, for one thing.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:43.770
What we've been seeing from

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.704
almost

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.539
the beginning of the back

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.607
and forth skirmishes

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.476
between Hezbollah and Israel,

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:49.776
is that

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.878
Hezbollah has been targeting

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:53.580
Israel surveillance

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.281
and observation equipment

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.916
all along the border.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.017
The Israelis, in fact,

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:00.186
in brought in cranes

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:02.122
to replace the destroyed

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.456
surveillance equipment.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.492
And Hezbollah took those out as well.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:06.292
So clearly,

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.328
there are holes in their ability

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:11.831
to see what enters Israeli, airspace.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:13.933
But above and beyond that,

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.068
clearly Hezbollah

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.937
has the technical capabilities,

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.673
to collect this sort of sensitive

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:21.541
information.

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.710
Well, inside,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.180
Israeli territory, it's about 30km

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:30.250
from the nearest point on the Lebanese

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.119
Israeli border, to Haifa.

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.288
Was it a propaganda video?

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:36.489
Well, the actually,

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.691
if you looked at the text in the video,

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.793
there wasn't anything about attacks.

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:43.463
It was just very sort of factual

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:44.364
explaining what

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.732
this location is,

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:48.134
what it served, what you're seeing.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:49.502
And it really is a message

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.070
to the Israelis,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.706
that, you know, don't don't mess with us.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:57.810
We not only have the ability to collect

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.612
intelligence inside,

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.915
deep inside your territory

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:04.884
on very sensitive, sites, but

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.252
along with that

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:08.755
probably comes other capabilities

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:11.424
that we've seen slowly unveiled

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:13.059
in the last few weeks.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.860
For instance,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.862
Hezbollah in the last few months

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.197
has been able to that fire

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:17.897
shoot down

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:21.267
three Hermes 900 Israeli drones,

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:22.936
very sophisticated drones

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.705
that can fly as high as 30,000ft.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.941
They took those out with anti-aircraft

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.842
missiles two weeks ago.

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:31.611
They were able to strike

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.046
according to Hezbollah.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.414
But the video would also seem

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:36.482
to confirm that an Israeli

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.750
Iron Dome battery,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.253
the Iron Dome, is really the back

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:42.722
backbone of Israel's missile

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.524
defense system.

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:46.759
So even though Israeli officials

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:47.860
like the foreign minister

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.296
talking about destroying,

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.397
Hezbollah, Hezbollah

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:55.468
is showing that it's, not a foe

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:58.137
that should be underestimated

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:01.040
in any sense of the word. Becky.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.274
Yeah.

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:02.342
This is,

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.243
this is not Hamas

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.544
we are speaking about here.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.446
Paula, let me bring you in here

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.281
because as we discuss with Ben,

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:10.750
what is going on on that northern front,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.053
which is a, you know, a clear issue.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:18.224
for the Israelis, there is a serious rift

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:19.759
beginning to open up now

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.361
between Benjamin Netanyahu

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:24.364
and the Biden administration.

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.566
So listen to what he had to say

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:28.835
about Secretary of State

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:30.403
Antony Blinken yesterday.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.673
It's inconceivable

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:35.642
that in the past few months,

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:37.243
the administration has been

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:39.512
withholding weapons and ammunition stores

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:41.648
from Israel, America's closest

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:41.981
ally,

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:42.915
fighting for its ally,

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:44.284
fighting against Iran

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.552
and our other common enemies.

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:47.954
Secretary Blinken assured me

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:48.688
that the

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:50.089
administration is working day

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:52.492
and night to remove these bottlenecks.

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:54.460
I certainly hope that's the case.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.130
It should be the case.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.599
What's the perspective in Israel

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.169
about why it is that Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.806
released that video yesterday

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.675
very pointedly,

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.344
speaking there about a conversation

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:14.347
with Antony Blinken.

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:16.516
And speaking in English, Becky.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:17.450
So it's very clear

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.152
that the audience is American.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.620
The audience is international.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.523
This is not for domestic considerations.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:25.024
Now, it's it's no secret

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:26.592
that there are differences

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:28.294
between the Israeli leader

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:31.264
and the the US president, Joe Biden.

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:32.765
They've certainly

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:35.368
had their differences over recent months,

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:36.936
not least because the U.S.

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.738
has been pushing Israel

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:40.840
to to be more careful in Gaza

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.176
to to push for this cease fire,

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.711
something that the Israeli prime

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:46.112
minister has not openly

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:47.980
said that he will agree

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.916
to this ceasefire hostage deal

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:51.851
and also pushing for a Palestinian state,

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.952
something that the Israeli prime

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:55.521
minister has said he does not support.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.422
So the differences

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:58.324
between these two sides,

00:05:58.324 --> 00:05:59.425
are very pronounced.

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:00.360
It is surprising, though,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.461
that he would come out and

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.228
and do this

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:03.863
so publicly

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.032
washing dirty laundry in public,

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:06.632
if you like.

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:08.167
And and it did have,

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.702
quite a surprised response

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:11.437
from the Biden administration as well.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:12.038
Listen to this.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.775
We, as you know,

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:18.778
are continuing to review one shipment,

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:22.715
that President Biden has talked about,

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.952
with regard to 2,000 pound bombs

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:28.054
because of our concerns about their use

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.723
in a densely populated area like Rafah.

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:33.626
That remains other, under review.

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:35.895
but everything else is moving

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.063
as it normally would move.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.798
We generally do not know

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.500
what he's talking about.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.503
we just don't.

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:44.904
And there's

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.172
no Israeli official at this point

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.173
that's going on the record

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:48.074
to speak about this.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.176
No one appears to want to have their name

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:53.112
next to this video. Becky.

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:55.948
So, I mean,

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:57.483
Lauren, let me bring you in,

00:06:57.483 --> 00:06:58.084
at this point,

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.286
because all of this happening

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:03.823
just ahead of Benjamin Netanyahu's visit

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.858
to Washington,

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:09.095
in July to address Congress,

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.264
we have seen some pushback already

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.099
with some lawmakers saying

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.034
that they will boycott that.

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.602
Have a listen to Senator

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:17.837
Elizabeth Warren earlier.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:19.872
Do you

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:21.274
plan to attend

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:21.741
Prime Minister

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:23.142
Netanyahu's address to Congress?

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:25.144
No. Look,

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:27.046
we need a cease fire.

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:28.981
We need to get those hostages back.

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.983
We need humanitarian relief,

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:33.319
and we need to be giving both parties

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.488
a big shove toward

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.290
getting to the negotiating table

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.625
and working out a peaceful solution

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:40.760
to the president made clear

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.261
that he should not address Congress.

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:43.095
Netanyahu.

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:44.864
Like that's up to the president.

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:46.199
But I'm not going.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:46.666
Well, Joe

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:49.836
Biden facing some quite serious backlash

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:53.639
within his own party, on this, isn't it?

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:54.373
And he's

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:55.007
really looking

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:57.977
at a dilemma ahead of November's

00:07:58.044 --> 00:08:00.513
election. Explain, if you will.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:00.813
Yeah.

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:01.280
I mean,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.015
this is still a month away,

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:04.317
and I think it's clear

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:05.718
that there are many progressive

00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:08.221
Democrats who plan to boycott

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.388
Netanyahu's speech

00:08:09.388 --> 00:08:10.556
when he comes to address

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:12.492
Congress in July.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.560
But this is really coming from

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.162
two different places.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.797
You know, on the one hand,

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:19.465
there is just disagreement

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:20.867
with Netanyahu's

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.635
handling of this conflict

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:23.436
in the Middle East.

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:24.437
On the other,

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:25.938
there's also this feeling

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:27.106
from some liberals

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:29.575
that you are putting Joe Biden

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:30.743
in this position

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:32.478
where someone who has been

00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:33.246
critical of

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:33.813
the president

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:35.047
is coming and addressing

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:36.449
Congress just months

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:38.117
before the November election.

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:39.418
So it's really sort of

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:40.786
the politics abroad

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:42.455
and also the politics at home

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:43.556
that they don't agree with.

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:44.624
You have to keep in mind,

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:46.225
this is happening in the context

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:47.593
in which the House speaker, Mike

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:48.327
Johnson,

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:49.362
has put a series

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.797
of really tough votes on the floor

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:53.065
that have fractured

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:54.834
Democrats in some cases.

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:56.536
Now, there's really typically

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:57.737
just a small number

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.438
of Democrats that vote with Republicans

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:01.140
on some of those proposals.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.775
But it has been

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:05.678
one of the most difficult conflicts for

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:06.445
the leader,

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:07.980
the Democratic leader in the House,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.582
Hakeem Jeffries, to manage

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:10.750
within his conference.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.417
And so,

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:11.717
you know,

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:12.652
I expect that there's

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:13.886
going to be a large number

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.254
of Democrats boycotting

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.023
Netanyahu's address to Congress.

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:18.958
We should note that about a decade ago,

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.493
when he came to Capitol Hill,

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:22.929
there were also dozens of Democrats

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:24.130
who boycotted the speech.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.865
So that's not precisely new,

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:27.867
but I think the numbers might be larger.

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.502
It's also possible

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:30.770
that they have press conferences

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.139
or some kind of other counter programing

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:34.640
when he comes to speak.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.808
So it would go beyond

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:37.810
just not showing up for the speech.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.111
It would be sort of more of

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:40.680
a tacit opposition as well.
