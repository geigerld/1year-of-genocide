00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.458
Joining me now

00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:01.543
in studio is Israeli

00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:03.461
ambassador to the United States,

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:05.171
Michael Herzog.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.256
Before I start, of course,

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:08.466
I want to offer my deepest condolences

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.926
to the Israeli people

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:13.388
about what happened eight days ago.

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:15.306
Just a horrific, horrific attack,

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:17.350
a terrorist attack.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.435
I think I speak for

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:19.602
for all of my viewers

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.730
and everybody at CNN when I say

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.565
our hearts are just broken

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:24.399
by what happened.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:25.608
Thank you very much.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.318
I really appreciate.

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:28.611
The

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.698
the this ground incursion

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.909
that we expect in the next.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:35.702
Do we? Do we.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:36.619
Can you give me any sort of

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:37.370
sense of timing?

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.955
Let's next week.

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:40.290
I know you have 300,000

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.583
reservists on the border.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.543
And is it an operation

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.836
to rid Hamas

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:45.795
of its military

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.714
capabilities, its terrorist capabilities,

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.507
or is it an operation

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:52.510
to destroy Hamas completely?

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:56.181
So, as you noted, Israel was attacked.

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:58.058
Hamas waged war on Israel

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.434
and they carried out

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:00.435
one of the worst

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.103
terror attacks in world history,

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:04.064
if not the worst.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.108
And we have no choice but to strike back.

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:08.651
And we are determined

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:09.944
to destroy the Hamas

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:10.737
war machine

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.740
so that they cannot threaten us again.

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:16.576
We do not want to be in that game where

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.286
every few years

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:22.457
they launch war against us or provoke us.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.416
That's over.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:24.667
And we are determined

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:27.045
to destroy the war machine.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:29.005
We are preparing a ground operation.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:30.965
I'm not going to go into details

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:33.093
and timetables and all that,

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.260
but we are at war

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.096
and we're going to fight that war.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.806
And what is the plan

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:40.350
for after you accomplish the objective?

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.601
What does the end state

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.019
after the operation look like?

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.606
Will Israel reoccupying the Gaza Strip?

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:47.982
Will any

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:50.110
Palestinians who fled Gaza

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.861
be allowed back in?

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:55.156
So we have no desire to occupy

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:56.741
or re-occupy Gaza.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:57.617
We have no desire

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.536
to rule over the lives of over

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.162
2 million Palestinians

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:01.955
and certainly

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.790
want people to go back to their homes

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.126
or talking about innocent civilians.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.129
And we are doing everything we can

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:11.840
to keep them out of harm's way.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.550
Well, Hamas is doing everything

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.635
it can to keep them in harm's way.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.595
That's a situation we are at.

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:19.389
I think talking about the day

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.559
after is a bit premature because

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.768
crushing the Hamas war

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:26.229
machine will require time.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.606
And the question you raise are valid.

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:30.275
And I think

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.277
we will have to enter discussions

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:33.736
with our partners,

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.947
with the international community about

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.615
the day after.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.075
Haaretz editorial this

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:40.451
week said, quote, Israel's

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:42.370
most urgent task is to bring back

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.746
the Israelis

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.039
held by Hamas and Islamic

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.749
Jihad in the Gaza Strip.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:47.500
And they point out

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.210
that your finance minister,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.547
Bezalel Smotrich, reportedly argued in a

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:53.047
in a cabinet

00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:54.507
meeting for Israel to, quote,

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.092
strike Hamas brutally

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:58.386
and not take the issue of the captives

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.972
into account too much.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:04.058
And what Haaretz is arguing is, why not?

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.727
Why isn't the

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:06.728
why aren't the captives

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.646
why aren't the kidnaping victims

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.857
the number one priority?

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.609
Well, certainly

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:13.902
the issue of the kidnaped

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:16.446
Israelis and others is

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:19.574
is very much it's high on our agenda.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:20.408
We are well aware

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.243
that we're still in the process

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:23.828
of forming a picture, understanding

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:25.163
how many people are there,

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.623
what is their condition,

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.666
what is their identity.

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:31.085
And certainly this is a consideration.

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:32.837
I don't want to comment about

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:36.507
statements by this or that politician.

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:39.260
All we say is that Hamas perpetrated

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.636
a war

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.429
crime and crimes against humanity

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.014
and taking hostages

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.350
and that we hold them accountable

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.143
to any harm that comes to

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.895
any of the hostages.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:49.812
Hamas is claiming

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:51.356
that Israeli airstrikes have killed

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.608
at least 13 of the hostages in Gaza.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.485
Do you have any idea if that's true?

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:56.027
I don't know.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.195
I would be very careful

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.739
about what they say.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.824
There's a lot of misinformation

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:03.576
and propaganda there.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:06.579
And so I would be very careful and take

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.206
I would take what they say

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.916
with a grain of salt.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:10.583
You said a week ago

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:11.751
it was premature to discuss

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.629
any deals for exchanging hostages.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.546
Has that changed?

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:17.048
Is there any discussion about any

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:20.051
any prisoner swaps, hostage swaps?

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:21.636
We're not in that phase.

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:24.305
And as I said, we're in the middle of war

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.349
and we still have to know

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.059
how many hostages there are

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.061
and what is their condition.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.854
So you obviously distinguish

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:33.147
between Hamas

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:35.858
and the 2.3 million Palestinians,

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:37.777
many of whom are prisoners of Hamas

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.404
in Gaza.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.864
Israel has warned the 1.1 million

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:45.618
in northern Gaza to evacuate.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:47.412
And and the U.S.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.663
officials, the U.S.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:49.998
has even said that's a tall order.

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:50.415
The U.N.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:51.708
has said it's impossible

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:52.834
to get them all out.

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:53.918
What's the latest

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.212
on these humanitarian corridors

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:59.215
and letting the innocent victims of

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.551
of Hamas in many ways get out?

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.928
So I'm glad you asked the question.

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:05.138
Our enemy is Hamas.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.473
It's not the Palestinian people.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.058
It's not the innocent civilians.

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:10.059
Many of them are dying

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.228
because of Israeli bombardment.

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.939
They are used by Hamas as human shields.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.899
That's why we call on them

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:17.900
to leave their homes,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.152
because as we intense

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:22.322
intensify the war against Hamas and Hamas

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.072
war machine,

00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:24.907
we don't want to harm any civilians.

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:26.534
And we ask them to move

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:29.829
to the south of Gaza from us.

00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:30.997
In contrast,

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.290
asking them to stay

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.000
is forcing them to stay.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.752
Right there, setting a blockade.

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.129
They are conscious, they confiscating

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.465
car keys and so on. We see all that.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.091
They want to use them as human shields.
