00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.168
Nearly 40 tons of medical aid

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:02.836
and disaster

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.295
relief supplies for Gaza left

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:06.006
India for Egypt this morning.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.549
This is according to India's

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:09.342
Ministry of External Affairs.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:10.593
Despite the Rafah crossing

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:12.345
opening for a short time

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.722
yesterday to allow trucks

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:16.099
with aid, 20 trucks to be exact,

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.975
to pass through.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.393
It remains unclear

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:22.272
if or when the border will reopen today.

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:23.940
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.607
joining us now

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.819
with how President Biden is responding

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.237
to the humanitarian efforts.

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:32.782
Priscilla.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.325
Well, in a statement just yesterday,

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:34.909
the president

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.328
attributed this to days

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.955
of diplomatic engagement

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:39.914
at the highest level.

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:41.499
Of course, these attacks.

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:43.293
But eight trucks passing through happened

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:44.753
on the heels of President Biden's

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:45.670
trip to Israel,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.172
as well as secretary of State

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.465
Antony Blinken.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:49.966
High stakes shuttle diplomacy

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.676
over the last several days.

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:52.969
Now, in a statement,

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.137
the president went on to note

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:55.847
that this is a critical and urgent need,

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:56.681
saying, quote,

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:57.515
I made it clear

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.266
from the outset

00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.476
of this crisis in both

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:00.518
my public statements

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.062
and private conversations

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.521
that humanitarian assistance

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:05.523
was a critical and urgent need

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:07.108
that had to get moving.

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:08.068
And I express my deep

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.319
personal appreciation

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.779
for the leadership of President

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.781
al-Sisi, of Egypt, Prime Minister

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.741
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.700
and the United Nations

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.368
to allow the resumption

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:18.286
of this assistance.

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:18.703
And, of course,

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:19.412
we should also mention

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.497
that President Biden

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:22.957
did speak with Egypt's president

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:23.625
this week,

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:26.169
where the two agreed for this crossing

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.920
to be opened.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.130
But, of course, this remains a challenge.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.799
We have heard from aid organizations

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.050
who have welcomed

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.592
the trucks

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:33.218
that have been able

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.178
to pass into Gaza so far.

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:36.346
But they note

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:38.389
that this can only be the beginning.

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:40.475
They still need so much more.

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.185
So the White House still working on

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:43.436
trying to facilitate that,

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.979
working with their counterparts

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.022
in the region, while

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:48.108
also keeping a focus

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.276
on getting Palestinian Americans

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.528
out of Gaza,

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.571
which they have still not been able

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:54.614
to do.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:54.948
Amara.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.450
Victor Alvarez for us, thanks so much.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.826
Joining us

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.452
now is the Belfast

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.121
spokesperson for the Palestine

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.914
Red Crescent Society.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.332
Thank you for being with us.

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:08.086
Let me start with the 17 trucks in Egypt

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.213
waiting at the Rafah crossing,

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.173
hoping to get into Gaza.

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:14.259
Our reporters have spoken with those.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.302
Truck drivers say they're optimistic.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.470
What can you tell us about

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.514
what's on the trucks and the probability

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:21.307
that they'll get across that

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:24.352
border today?

00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:25.019
Good evening.

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.146
Thanks for having me.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:26.729
So, yes,

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:27.689
as you highlighted,

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.940
there are dozens of the trucks

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.525
who are still waiting after

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:33.778
crossing the border, waiting to get

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:34.821
into Gaza.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.239
What we have received up

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:36.614
to now

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:38.575
is a tow truck hoping

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.827
this will be a glimpse of hope

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.037
for the entry of the rest of the trucks,

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:44.205
because

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.124
20 trucks is only like a drop

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.625
in the ocean of need.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:51.296
We still need a lot in terms of food,

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.088
even water.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:54.048
2 million Palestinian civilians

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:56.968
now are with no food or even water

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.720
besides electricity,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.347
as well as not only one hospital,

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:04.225
all hospitals in Gaza are witnessing

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:04.851
a collapse,

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.936
the state of having shortages

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:07.687
and medicine,

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.938
medical supplies,

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:11.566
as well as running out of the fuel.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.569
And by the way, if fuel was not also

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.404
delivered by the first shipment

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:17.864
of the humanitarian aid,

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.449
which included food,

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.951
water, medical supply and medicine,

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.411
but not fields.

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.871
Are you getting any indication

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:25.955
as to when,

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:29.209
if at all, there will be a sustained

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:36.049
delivery of aid into Gaza?

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.634
So basically, all the

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.594
international organizations,

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:40.595
along with countries,

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.430
have been working

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.892
due to all the last week long

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.852
to get the aid there.

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:50.813
And hopefully now after this aid

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:52.106
was already in

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:52.899
to continue

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.400
working and advocating

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.736
for the entry of the humanitarian aid.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.739
This this should not be a one time.

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:02.367
We need a humanitarian corridor

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:05.203
to allow the entry of medical supplies

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.913
and the humanitarian aid

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:09.916
at all the time in a safe way

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.252
to guarantee to fulfill the needs

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.504
of the humanitarian situation

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:15.588
now in Gaza,

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.674
because the humanitarian situation

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.676
is literally catastrophic,

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.053
whether in terms of extreme

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:24.013
shortages of food and water

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:25.640
or even hospitals

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.101
who are now running out of fuel.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.728
And without the fuel, simply

00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:32.689
all hospitals can't operate.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.525
And that electricity means

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:36.693
killing thousands

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.320
of Palestinian civilians who were injured

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.864
and now inside the hospital.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:44.867
So all of the aid does not include fuel.

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:45.493
That's why

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:46.411
we still count

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.913
on the international community

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:51.165
to keep advocating for the entry

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:52.875
of the humanitarian aid,

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.169
not only from the border,

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.504
but from all borders

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.756
to control the from the Israelis,

00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:01.259
because as an occupying power

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.761
has a responsible military to ensure

00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:04.595
to provide

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:05.680
the essential needs

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.390
for civilians in Gaza,

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.685
as well as hospitals who are implementing

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.896
their health care worker services.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.566
And this should be not continued.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:16.899
Health

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:18.735
care facilities and hospitals,

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.820
along with civilians,

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.989
should not pay the price

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:26.034
and should be protected and respected

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:26.743
according to the.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.287
Item that the Israelis concern

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:30.413
is that the fuel, if it gets

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.457
in, will make it to Hamas.

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:34.375
Let me ask you about the latest

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:36.210
leaflets dropped by IDF

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.213
that and the Israelis contest this

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:40.631
CNN translation.

00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:41.758
But it is that if

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:42.842
Palestinians do not move

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:43.843
south, they may be seem

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.720
partners of the terrorists.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.306
What can you tell us about

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:51.809
your organization's ability to provide

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:53.478
aid to northern Gaza

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.730
if the order from

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.607
the IDF is to move south?

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:58.816
We know that there are still

00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:01.819
many thousands of Palestinians who are in

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.906
northern Gaza.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:07.116
Yeah, let me clarify something.

00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:08.618
In the targeted area

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.119
where Israel and threatened

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:12.038
to be evacuated

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.041
around a million and 200,000 Palestinians

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:18.961
who are live and the Gaza and the north.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.589
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:24.926
were still stuck in Gaza, in their homes

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:27.428
or any schools or even hospitals.

00:06:27.428 --> 00:06:28.763
They couldn't find their way

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.306
to evacuate themselves

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:31.349
simply because of that

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.225
and asking people

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.976
to evacuate themselves

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:36.396
under continuous bombardment.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.773
Besides, there is no transportation,

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:39.899
complete destruction

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.776
of the roads and infrastructure.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:45.321
So absolutely, they have no way to go to.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:46.572
They don't have an option

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:48.199
to choose either.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.200
It's the same case

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.743
for hospitals because Israel

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:52.870
not only asking civilians

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.372
to evacuate themselves

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:56.374
under continuous bombardment,

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.875
evacuation orders

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.044
from Israeli occupation forces

00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:03.339
for around a 20 foot hospital in Gaza

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:05.466
and then ordered to evacuate,

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:08.094
which are absolutely impossible

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.514
to implement W at all, has announced that

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:14.559
evacuation orders for hospitals

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.269
are impossible to implement

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.813
and they constitute a death penalty

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.064
for the patients.

00:07:20.064 --> 00:07:22.316
Our hospital is one of the hospital

00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:24.777
that have received the evacuation order.

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:26.654
We have 500 patients,

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:29.031
some of them in the intensive care unit,

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.868
and we will not be able and accept

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.120
to rest the lives of our patients,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.288
most of them, or to.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.498
Ensure an impossible situation

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:39.125
for those hospitals as well.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.377
Nebel of gaza. Thank you very much.
