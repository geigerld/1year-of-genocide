00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.267
Tonight, explosions

00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:02.669
continue to rock Gaza.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.771
The pause in fighting is now delayed

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:05.538
24 hours

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:06.473
ahead of the expected

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.341
release of women and children

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:11.044
being held hostage by Hamas terrorists.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.946
And even after this hostage release,

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.180
the fate of the vast

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.115
majority of those

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.183
still being held captive remains

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.651
very much in question.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:19.285
The White House

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:19.986
saying today

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:20.754
that President Biden

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.956
has been, quote, personally engaged

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.391
in negotiations.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.425
Alex Marquardt is OUTFRONT

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.259
in Washington for us.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.760
Alex,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.761
what are you learning about

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:28.962
the status of negotiations

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.163
for the rest of the hostages

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.531
held by Hamas?

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.500
Well, Kate, we've heard repeatedly

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.000
from U.S.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.001
officials that they say

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.236
they will not rest

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:39.472
until the rest of the American hostages

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:40.440
come out, aside

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.541
from these women and children

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:41.941
that the U.S.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.309
will stay very much engaged

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.412
for all of these hostages.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.613
But those conversations

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.581
really have not begun in earnest yet.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.583
The main focus really has been on

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.918
getting these women

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:52.685
and children out,

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:55.188
making sure that this mechanism works.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:56.056
It is believed

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:59.059
that the easiest negotiations with Hamas

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.561
were to get these women and children out.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.762
And that's assuming, of course,

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:03.730
that this all goes

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.965
according to plan, that these 50 or more

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.967
actually come out in the coming days.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.903
I was speaking with an official

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:10.837
who is

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.205
involved in these conversations,

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:14.307
briefed on the ongoing negotiations,

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:17.110
who told me that this first swap of 50

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.511
people is the most crucial

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:19.045
to make sure

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.980
that this mechanism is working

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.215
as was agreed.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.150
So assuming this goes smoothly,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.885
you then have, as you say, the vast

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.353
majority of the hostages who remain

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.855
and they really do fall into three

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.657
distinct buckets.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.591
You have

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.493
men who are both elderly

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.662
and non-Israeli nationals.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.230
Then you have Israeli soldiers,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.465
both men and women.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:39.566
And then you have bodies,

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.467
people who were killed

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.736
either on October 7th or since then.

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:44.204
And U.S.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.538
and Israeli officials agree

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:46.506
that the most difficult

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.374
negotiations are going to be around

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.375
the Israeli soldiers,

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.877
both the men and the women.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.245
No one in Israel

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:53.313
certainly has forgotten

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:54.747
the exchange

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:57.750
of Gilad Shalit back in 11 2011.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.319
He was held for years by Hamas.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.087
And when he was exchanged,

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:03.356
Hamas was able to get more than 1000

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:05.959
prisoners out of Israeli prisons.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.995
So it is possible that the conversations

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:10.096
about the rest of the hostages

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.331
begin soon,

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.333
but it could be quite some time

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.767
before the rest of those hostages

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.470
come home Kate. Yeah. For weeks. Months.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.805
How is described to me

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.406
by a couple of people just today.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.241
It's good to see you, Alex.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.342
Thank you so much.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.776
OUTFRONT with me now, Jonathan Dekel.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:24.611
Chen, his son

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:25.912
Siggy is is among

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:27.981
those kidnaped by Hamas now

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.649
nearly seven weeks ago,

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.718
still captive in Gaza.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:32.385
Jonathan,

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.053
thank you for coming on tonight.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.422
Given what we know about this agreement,

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:37.590
it does seem unlikely

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.992
that Siggy will be among

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.294
those released in this

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:44.063
and in this in this moment.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:45.165
What what then does

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:48.968
this moment feel like for you?

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:52.338
Well, I think it's two poles.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:55.642
The first pole is assuming that

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.210
that Hamas can deliver

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.745
on its promise here

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.847
that these 50 women and children

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.416
will be released. I'm overjoyed for them.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:04.517
And keep in mind

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:05.552
that from my kibbutz

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:07.854
alone, for my one community alone,

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.756
there are still 75 hostages

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:11.124
being held by Hamas

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:11.858
since October

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:15.562
7th of the list that's been published.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:16.930
And there are multiple,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.232
multiple children and women

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:19.832
and moms,

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.568
including Leah, at the facility

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:22.669
who you spoke with her

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.137
dad a few minutes ago.

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.872
These are all my neighbors,

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:26.606
my friends,

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.807
my kids friends, my

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:29.909
my grandchildren's friends.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.046
So I couldn't be more pleased for

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:33.947
those families

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:36.149
because it's like my extended family

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.318
coming home, on the other hand.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.086
And again,

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.355
it it it's very difficult to say

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.224
in terms of Siggy and the other

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:48.261
109, the hostages, again, 190 hostages

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:50.597
who weren't referred to at all

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:53.700
in this stage of the agreement.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.268
It's almost impossible to

00:03:55.268 --> 00:04:00.106
say, given Hamas as a

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.874
sort of a barbarian terrorist

00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:03.409
organization with no regard

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.876
for human

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.144
life, Israeli

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:07.113
or Palestinian, for that matter.

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:09.649
What this first stage might say

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:13.286
about the coming stages.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:15.722
Do you allow yourself

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:18.725
to think about

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:20.627
that moment when you're when you will see

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:21.794
Siggy again?

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:23.162
It seems just like

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.265
I keep thinking of this, Jonathan,

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.066
because it's like this

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.735
suspend this moment of like his

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.336
being in suspended nightmare.

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:31.771
I almost envision

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.640
it feels like being just seven

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.807
weeks, nearly

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:35.708
seven weeks now

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:38.911
since that horrible, horrible day.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.380
And I just wonder if

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.081
if you allow yourself

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:45.385
to think about that moment.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.053
Well, there's not a waking

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:48.187
or even a sleeping moment

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:50.056
that I'm not thinking about, Siggy,

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:51.291
in some measure.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.126
And I can certainly visualize

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.461
and love visualizing

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:57.897
his two little girls, running into

00:04:57.897 --> 00:05:01.367
leaping into his arms when he comes home

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:04.470
and in a hope in hopes that he comes

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.071
home quickly.

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:07.440
But if not, then meeting his third

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.975
little girl who set to be born

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.376
in a couple of weeks.

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:12.912
So I absolutely have that in mind

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:13.980
as something

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.617
that I'm working for and or towards

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:18.918
together with the release

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:20.653
of of all of the hostages

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.322
to his poor wife

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.456
and what she's going through

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:24.691
and about to bring

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:25.591
another beautiful child

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.560
into the world in the midst of this.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.128
Just unbelievable.

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:30.096
How is she doing?

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:31.798
How's the rest of the family handling

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:32.532
handling this

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:34.500
and handling this news right now of

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.869
of this deal?

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:37.704
Well, you know,

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:40.273
we're doing the best we can.

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.075
It's a it's a multi level

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.176
crisis, really,

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.344
because

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.278
not just Sergei's

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:47.714
family wife and two two young daughters,

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:49.182
but I have another daughter

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.049
who lives on the kibbutz

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:51.718
with her young family.

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:53.753
So there are four little kids

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:56.055
between the age of two and six

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:58.157
who were utterly traumatized by this

00:05:58.157 --> 00:05:58.958
hell on earth

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.928
that befell the kibbutz on October 7th.

00:06:01.928 --> 00:06:05.298
So, you know, missing our loved ones,

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:06.933
those that were murdered.

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:08.101
All of my grandkids,

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:09.936
again, from age 2 to 6,

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:12.004
have close friends

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:13.439
who are no longer alive,

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.909
who were murdered in their beds

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:18.378
on October 7th.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.546
So we have to deal with that.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:21.447
And we also have to deal

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.082
with the fact that our community

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:25.218
as a whole, our cooperative farm,

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:29.489
like many others around the Gaza Strip

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:32.191
and not just were massacred,

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:33.993
but rather also had

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:36.729
all of their property stolen by hundreds,

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.165
thousands of looters actually from Gaza.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.867
And then whatever could not be looted

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:42.402
was burned to the ground.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.837
So there's no going home

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:47.073
for any of these kids or the adults.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.809
Our home as we knew it no longer exists.

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:53.045
It's a series of tragedies

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:54.180
for us,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.047
Israeli civilians

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:55.915
and honestly,

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.284
for the Palestinian civilians as well.

00:06:58.284 --> 00:06:59.919
And who find themselves

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.421
in this horrible situation

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.822
not of their making,

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:04.824
but by Hamas is making.

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:06.359
We keep ourselves busy.

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:09.362
I mean, in thinking about what the future

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:11.063
will bring for us.

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:14.700
For me personally, working with the press

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.635
and with governments

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:19.305
in Israel and abroad, and keeping laser

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:19.906
attention

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:23.743
focused on this humanitarian universal

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.312
issue and challenge of our hostages

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:27.914
in the hands of Hamas

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:30.416
and taking care of the little ones

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:31.317
the best we can,

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:32.985
and trying to help them

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:35.121
make sense of shattered life

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.055
and make sense of

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:39.692
what is impossible to make sense of.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.260
Jonathan, thank you so much.
