Half a world away from all

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:12.912

of a new world order,

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.611
a world prioritizing

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:47.147
Palestinians over Western backed

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:48.681
pitting the Putin Sea

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.120
Russia and China

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.422
refusing to strongly

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.290
condemn the Hamas attack.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.193
blame on the US for the conflict

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:01.528
not Hamas gunmen

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:04.831
who also took Russian lives

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.267
both Beijing and Moscow

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:09.369
criticizing Israel's actions

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.071
condemning Tuesday's deadly

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.072

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.279
of dehumanization,

China says Israel

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.451
played a part in provoking

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.952
Palestinian rage.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.387
Decades of diplomacy

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.022
without a two state solution.

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:29.756
You say that

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.458
Israel has the right to establis

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.492

overflowing with pro-Palestinian

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:42.502
and plenty of anger

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.437
aimed at Israel and the U.S.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:47.574
the Middle East

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:48.408
is for the Jews

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:48.775

President Mahmoud Abbas in June,

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.451
part of Beijing's bid for a bigg

00:01:58.451 --> 00:01:59.853
in Mideast diplomacy

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:02.222
and its desire to reshape the U.

it brokered

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:06.526
this year,

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:07.427
restoring ties

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.629
between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

positioning themselves as possib

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.774
Peacemakers,

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:24.377
both ignoring the irony of Putin

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:25.411
brutal war,

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.279
spilling blood

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.348
on the battlefields of Ukraine.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.682
Far from the front lines,

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:30.950
the leaders and representatives

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.318
of some 140

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.720
nations are expected here

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.954
in the Chinese capital.

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:36.890
Leaders of key Western allies

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.324
noticeably absent

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.426
a perfectly timed distraction

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.428
from Putin's problems at home,

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:43.530
parading himself

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.931
before flocks of friendly

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.432
state media outlets.

powerful leader and Russia's

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.839
loyal patron, Xi Jinping,

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:53.940
a running mate, Russia.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.742
And he makes long term plans

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:56.910
for the future.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.178
It's what differentiates

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.379
the true world leaders

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.214
from what we call temps.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:03.049
Temps only show off on the world

stage

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:04.918

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:07.120
before becoming lost to world hi

Putin and she possibly leaders f

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.092
predicting a global power shift.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.361
The decline of democracy.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.730
The rise of strongman rule

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:20.900
you could hear in

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.801
Vladimir Putin's interview

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:22.569
the disdain

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.970
he has for democratically

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.804
elected leaders.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:25.205
And President

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.072
Biden has said

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:26.973
that this battle, Aaron,

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:27.840
between democracy

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.474
and autocracy

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:29.876
will be the defining

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.679
battle of this century.

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:34.714
All right.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:35.848
Well, thank you very much.
