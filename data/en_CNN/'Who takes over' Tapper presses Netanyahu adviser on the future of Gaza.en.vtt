00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:05.120
&gt;&gt; CNN's Becky Anderson in Doha

00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:07.423
are, Qatar, we appreciate it.

00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:09.058
Senior adviser to Israeli prime

00:00:09.425 --> 00:00:10.926
minister Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:00:11.427 --> 00:00:13.729
and ambassador to the united

00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:14.530
Kingdom, mark Greg is with us

00:00:14.797 --> 00:00:14.997
in tel aviv.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:19.034
First, let me ask you, military

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:20.436
people in Israel not just the

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:22.037
United States have their own

00:00:22.438 --> 00:00:22.705
language.

00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:25.040
When the idf says that military

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:27.443
ground excursion has expanded,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.045
ground operations expanded, I

00:00:30.446 --> 00:00:32.114
didn't know, what does this

00:00:32.448 --> 00:00:34.049
mean that ground operation is

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.516
expanding.

00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:37.119
Doesn't mean Israeli troops,

00:00:37.453 --> 00:00:39.455
soldiers on the ground in gaza?

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:39.988
?

00:00:39.988 --> 00:00:41.056
&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna go into

00:00:41.457 --> 00:00:43.459
anything operational especially

00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:44.793
if the operation is ongoing.

00:00:47.463 --> 00:00:48.931
But I can say that, yes, we're

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:49.598
beefing up the pressure on

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:49.998
hamas.

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:53.469
That pressure increase and

00:00:53.736 --> 00:00:54.670
continue to increase until we

00:00:54.937 --> 00:00:55.604
achieve our goal.

00:00:56.472 --> 00:00:58.474
&gt;&gt; Is there are a ground,

00:00:58.674 --> 00:01:00.476
ground operations expanded does

00:01:00.743 --> 00:01:01.677
that mean it's happening it's

00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:03.479
what it sounds like to me again

00:01:03.746 --> 00:01:06.548
I don't speak military lingo

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:08.484
whether it's in the Pentagon,

00:01:08.684 --> 00:01:09.551
idf what is it mean?

00:01:09.818 --> 00:01:11.487
&gt;&gt; I said a moment ago

00:01:11.687 --> 00:01:14.490
operations are ongoing.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.624
&gt;&gt; I still don't know that

00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:16.024
means.

00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:17.493
&gt;&gt; What about this barrage of

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.627
airstrikes going on in gaza

00:01:18.894 --> 00:01:19.561
right now.

00:01:19.828 --> 00:01:22.498
&gt;&gt; I cannot go into anything

00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:24.500
technical, I can say this we

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.503
are focused on our goal which

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.505
is the elimination of hamas,

00:01:29.772 --> 00:01:32.508
the destruction of its military

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:34.510
capabilities, military machine,

00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:36.512
and the end of its political

00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:37.646
control over the gaza strip.

00:01:37.913 --> 00:01:39.515
&gt;&gt; The idf released earlier

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:45.521
toy, a 3D map of command and

00:01:45.654 --> 00:01:48.524
control center of hamas, the

00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:50.659
idf says it's under a hospital

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:51.059
in gaza.

00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:55.063
It's not photographs, it's a

00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:57.132
graphic depiction, where does

00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:59.067
it where it is that information

00:01:59.535 --> 00:01:59.735
come from?

00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:02.137
&gt;&gt; That information is enclave,

00:02:02.538 --> 00:02:04.540
based on Israeli intelligence.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.075
If you ask the gazans who are

00:02:07.543 --> 00:02:08.544
honest with you, they'll tell

00:02:08.544 --> 00:02:09.545
you for years they've known

00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:13.015
that how mask uses hospitals,

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.017
in this case a sherpa hospital

00:02:15.551 --> 00:02:16.218
for their command and control.

00:02:17.152 --> 00:02:18.554
The idf spokesperson and people

00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:20.155
in gaza must have seen it, when

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:23.158
the war started on the 7th of

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.027
October with that massacre,

00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:27.029
they expected Israel to strike

00:02:27.563 --> 00:02:27.696
back.

00:02:27.696 --> 00:02:30.032
There was a surge of hamas

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:31.567
activists, terrorists, scores

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:32.568
of them finding shelter.

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:37.573
&gt;&gt; So, obviously, it's been

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.577
known and it's been reported,

00:02:41.577 --> 00:02:42.578
Anderson's been to gaza, it's

00:02:42.644 --> 00:02:46.181
known that hamas fires rockets

00:02:46.582 --> 00:02:49.585
from civilian centers from

00:02:49.585 --> 00:02:50.586
apartments, et cetera --

00:02:50.586 --> 00:02:52.254
&gt;&gt; From schools, U.N.

00:02:52.588 --> 00:02:52.721
Facilities.

00:02:52.988 --> 00:02:54.590
&gt;&gt; It's been reported, it's not

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.592
just idf claiming it but it's

00:02:56.592 --> 00:02:58.594
been reported by independent

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.595
journalist on the ground.

00:02:59.728 --> 00:03:01.597
This is real consider hospitals

00:03:01.663 --> 00:03:04.600
to be targets, there are also

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.201
as you will acknowledge,

00:03:06.602 --> 00:03:09.204
patients, doctors, nurses in

00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:09.738
these hospitals.

00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:12.207
&gt;&gt; We were pointing out the

00:03:12.608 --> 00:03:13.609
facts, we want the world to

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:14.610
understand the enemy that we're

00:03:14.877 --> 00:03:15.611
up against.

00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:17.613
A ruthless enemy that has been

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:20.282
reported widely, has no trouble

00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:22.284
massacring Israeli civilians,

00:03:22.618 --> 00:03:25.287
they did so in all the gruesome

00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:27.623
reality that we saw on October

00:03:27.623 --> 00:03:27.689
seven.

00:03:27.956 --> 00:03:30.225
They have no qualms whatsoever

00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:32.628
about impending themselves and

00:03:32.694 --> 00:03:34.229
humanitarian buildings like

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.897
hospitals.

00:03:34.897 --> 00:03:36.632
Which it shows us exactly what

00:03:36.698 --> 00:03:37.633
we're up against.

00:03:37.633 --> 00:03:39.635
When this is over and we have

00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:41.637
defeated hamas, we've destroyed

00:03:41.703 --> 00:03:43.305
it's military machine, we've

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:44.640
removed it from the position of

00:03:44.706 --> 00:03:46.642
power it holds in gaza today.

00:03:46.642 --> 00:03:48.644
I think not only we doing

00:03:48.644 --> 00:03:49.244
Israelis of flavored freeing

00:03:49.645 --> 00:03:51.179
these terrorists from the south,

00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:53.248
or doing the people of gaza

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:54.650
favor, or freeing them from

00:03:54.783 --> 00:03:57.653
this extremist dictatorship run

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.255
by a bunch of cutthroat

00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:00.722
terrorists.

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.659
&gt;&gt; Who takes over in gaza when

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.661
and if you defeat hamas?

00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:06.662
Who takes over?

00:04:06.662 --> 00:04:08.664
&gt;&gt; We will defeat hamas, will

00:04:08.664 --> 00:04:09.665
eliminate them.

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:10.265
&gt;&gt; Who takes over?

00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:11.667
&gt;&gt; We have contingency plans.

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:14.269
We're looking at different

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.337
scenarios, we've been

00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:16.338
discussing them with friends

00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:18.273
and allies, like Washington, at

00:04:18.674 --> 00:04:19.675
this stage I cannot go into

00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:19.741
details.

00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:21.677
The focus at the moment is

00:04:21.677 --> 00:04:22.344
defeating hamas.

00:04:23.278 --> 00:04:26.682
And anything is superior,

00:04:26.682 --> 00:04:28.350
preferable to continue hamas

00:04:28.684 --> 00:04:29.284
ruling in gaza.

00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:31.286
We've seen what it brings, it

00:04:31.687 --> 00:04:33.355
brings them a spare we saw on

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:34.022
Israel and October seven.

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.691
We don't want to go back there.

00:04:35.757 --> 00:04:37.693
&gt;&gt; Senior hamas official says

00:04:37.693 --> 00:04:39.227
hamas is ready to --

00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:40.696
defeat troops if they enter

00:04:40.696 --> 00:04:40.829
gaza.

00:04:41.163 --> 00:04:43.231
He went on to say, quote, the

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.301
resistance is ready.

00:04:47.235 --> 00:04:49.304
What I laid out what your

00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:52.708
soldiers are gonna be facing in

00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:56.244
gaza, it's it is, the

00:04:56.712 --> 00:04:59.247
challenges this vast network of

00:04:59.715 --> 00:05:00.716
200 kilometers of tunnels that

00:05:00.716 --> 00:05:01.717
they've been building for 20

00:05:01.917 --> 00:05:01.984
years.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.724
It's very sophisticated, the

00:05:08.724 --> 00:05:09.725
defense minister said to me

00:05:09.925 --> 00:05:11.393
earlier today, all the money

00:05:11.727 --> 00:05:13.729
going to gaza over the years

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.731
not to build university, not to

00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:16.732
build factories, to build

00:05:16.732 --> 00:05:17.132
tunnels and by rockets.

00:05:21.203 --> 00:05:23.205
A ruthless terrorist group

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:24.273
Wellington blow themselves up

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.211
and do anything, use their own

00:05:29.745 --> 00:05:30.746
people as a human camouflage,

00:05:30.746 --> 00:05:31.747
urban where fair or the

00:05:31.813 --> 00:05:34.283
toughest warfare there is, 2

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.350
million civilians you do not

00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:37.352
want to Cal, you don't want to

00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:38.287
hurt them, you're unfortunately

00:05:38.754 --> 00:05:39.754
killing them.

00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:40.222
But you do not want to.

00:05:42.758 --> 00:05:43.759
We're making an effort not to

00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:44.760
like your killing a lot of

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.826
them.

00:05:46.962 --> 00:05:50.899
This is a task, it's seeming

00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:51.900
impossible and you are sending

00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:53.035
soldiers and duet.

00:05:53.302 --> 00:05:54.970
&gt;&gt; Obviously, --

00:05:55.237 --> 00:05:57.105
&gt;&gt; On top of a humanitarian

00:05:57.372 --> 00:05:57.773
crisis ongoing.

00:05:57.906 --> 00:05:59.241
&gt;&gt; First of all, the entire

00:05:59.775 --> 00:06:01.043
situation wherein is precisely

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.912
because hamas attacked us on

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:05.914
October 7th, were responding to

00:06:06.181 --> 00:06:06.248
hamas.

00:06:06.782 --> 00:06:08.250
I have no doubt that we're

00:06:08.784 --> 00:06:10.118
going to battle facing risks,

00:06:10.385 --> 00:06:12.054
you're 100 percent correct.

00:06:13.121 --> 00:06:14.990
The enemy is horrific and it's

00:06:15.257 --> 00:06:19.928
barbarity, it's fanaticism, and

00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:21.063
it's disregard rules of war,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.064
that's clear.

00:06:22.864 --> 00:06:26.068
The young soldiers going, you

00:06:26.335 --> 00:06:27.936
need to do this why, the

00:06:28.203 --> 00:06:31.940
current status quo, this

00:06:32.207 --> 00:06:33.075
terrorist I.S.I.S. Enclave in

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:34.876
our southern border is

00:06:35.143 --> 00:06:35.344
unsustainable.

00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:36.945
We will not live like that any

00:06:37.212 --> 00:06:37.346
longer.

00:06:37.813 --> 00:06:38.947
We saw what they are capable of

00:06:39.214 --> 00:06:39.281
doing.

00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:41.950
We saw a gruesome, terrible

00:06:42.217 --> 00:06:43.085
horrific violence.

00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:46.021
We refuse to live with that

00:06:46.288 --> 00:06:47.089
neighbor anymore.

00:06:47.356 --> 00:06:50.092
We are now going to a redo
