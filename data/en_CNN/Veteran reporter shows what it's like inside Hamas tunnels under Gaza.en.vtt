00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:00.375
The U.S.

00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:02.043
says it still knows nothing

00:00:02.043 --> 00:00:06.256
about the condition of the Americans
believed to be taken hostage by Hamas.

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:08.883
And while their whereabouts
remain unknown,

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:11.803
some do believe that they could be held in
Gaza's tunnels.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:15.056
My next guest
has actually walked through those tunnels.

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:19.144
I want to bring in veteran foreign affairs
correspondent Reena nine and Reena.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:22.605
These tunnels are kind
of a bit of a source of some mystery,

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.315
but they are believed

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:27.485
to be just literally
under the feet of the Palestinian people,

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.988
as you can kind of see here,
under buildings, under apartment.

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:32.949
We also have some somewhat rare video.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.492
This is from 2017.

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:38.872
Can you walk us through what we are
looking at here, what you've been to to

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:42.042
You know, I have to tell you,
these tunnels are far more elaborate

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:42.959
than the ones I went down.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:45.503
The ones I went down
were built by teenage boys

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:48.965
that essentially were made of dirt
and are probably one time usage

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.967
but you could see
the potential of hostages

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:54.804
being in these tunnels
fortified here with concrete.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.017
What's also so
troubling is as incredible as Israeli anti

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:02.979
detection systems are for these tunnels,
which they do have, it's really hard.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.232
Hamas has gotten smarter over the years
about their ability to get in

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.650
and destroy these tunnels.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.904
So you see how fortified it
is, the concrete,

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:14.115
the fact that they can go down into here
and go undetected.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.242
I'm going to show a few more pictures
here.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:21.247
And you see the dirt around here, the ones
I went through were essentially I'm 54.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.332
I was able to go down

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:26.169
the whole entire route of these tunnels
and then it slowly started to cave down.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:29.756
These are far better
engineered and constructed

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.424
because the tunnels are likely.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.511
These hostages are,
I bet, are potentially the ones that have

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:38.264
are not intended for one time use
their intended for this type of warfare.

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:40.683
Meanwhile, the other story here
is about the civilians.

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:42.769
They are now being asked to evacuate.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:45.814
We're looking here at this evacuation

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.900
not there's really only one place
for them to get out.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.776
And it would be right here.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.570
This is the Rafah crossing
that leads straight to Egypt.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.448
I'm going to show
another kind of image here.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.741
This is what it looks like up close.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.160
What are the challenges here for civilians
trying to get out?

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.413
Well, one, it's incredibly unpredictable
and incredibly dangerous.

00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:03.623
We know that there have been

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:07.460
Israeli airstrikes and so you constantly
don't know what could happen in this area.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.294
State Department

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.381
has also said that if and when the Rafah
crossing eventually opens,

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:15.635
what could happen is it won't be open
for a long, extended period of time.

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:17.679
It'll open quickly
and could potentially close.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.765
You've got all these people
here in the Gaza Strip looking to get out.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.267
That's the one exit point right now

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:25.687
is this Rafah, which enters into Egypt's
Sinai Peninsula there.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:28.815
So you've got the unpredictability
it's dangerous.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:32.610
And also, Abbi, the fact that we've heard
that we don't know how long it could be.

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.822
And of course,
this is a very significant distance here.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.365
It's a small it's a small space.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:40.034
But it's a significant distance
if you don't have a lot of means.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.162
If you don't have a lot of means,
and also you don't know how long

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.663
you're camping out there for.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:47.083
So the fact that these people could be
down there trying to get humanitarian aid,

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:51.212
the Egyptians also don't want over
a million people absorbed into Egypt.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.463
So that's a big concern.

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:55.425
While they said they'll allow
multinational people come into Egypt,

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:59.304
leave via Cairo, these Palestinians
coming through don't have that option.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.723
All right. Rana, and thank you so much.
