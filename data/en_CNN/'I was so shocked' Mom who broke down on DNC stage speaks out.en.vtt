00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.266
one of the

00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.135
most moving moments of the DNC

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:03.336
unfolded last night.

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:05.305
It was not the stirring speech

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:06.473
of a gifted politician,

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:07.907
but the heartbroken words

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.576
of this man's parents,

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.444
23 year old Hirsch Goldberg.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:12.846
Poland is an Israeli

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.081
American hostage held by Hamas.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.416
He is one of eight Americans

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.651
still held nearly 11 months.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.320
That's right, 11 months

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.489
after the terror attacks on Israel.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:22.956
Last night,

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:23.890
they took to the stage

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.325
wearing the number 320

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:25.859
for the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.862
number of days he's been held prisoner.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.032
In an inflamed Middle East.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.533
We know the one thing

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.535
that can most immediately

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.270
release pressure

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.273
and bring calm to the entire region.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.776
A deal that brings this diverse

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:46.379
group of 109 hostages home

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.515
and ends the suffering

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.717
of the innocent civilians in Gaza.

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.730
So there you go.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.964
Such an incredible moment.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.933
And John and Rachel Goldberg, Poland,

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.234
join me now.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.235
Rachel, we should note

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.870
you're both wearing 321.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.305
You were wearing 320 last night.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.373
It's not 321.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.575
Did we change it every day? Yeah.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.777
And what did that moment mean to you

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:20.080
last night?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.483
I was so shocked and overwhelmed

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:27.220
because we had been told to anticipate

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:32.025
in neutral to negative reception.

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:33.993
Yeah.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.662
and when we walked out and

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.897
suddenly there were

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.433
thousands of people who got to their feet

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.703
and started to chant, bring them home.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.173
We were just

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.109
swelled with support

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.011
and it was overwhelming.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.314
And I just started to weep.

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:57.884
Yeah, I think a lot of people were, John,

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.954
how did that,

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.056
how did that, resonate with you

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:03.823
seeing that?

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.992
I mean, because I know this week

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:07.093
what we've been hearing is

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.661
obviously there are protests here.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.630
There's a lot of deep opposition

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.831
to the war in Gaza.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.067
but there's still

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:17.237
in the hearts of a lot of folks

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:17.871
in this country.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.472
Just pain and agony

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.307
for what you're going through.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.877
It's so easy to politicize everything.

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:24.844
And that's the danger

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:26.613
and that's what's been happening.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.781
But it was heartening last night

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:32.018
to see that even before we spoke a word,

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.553
I think people understood that

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:35.989
there's a human side to this story.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.557
It's not just an issue.

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:40.493
It's not just numbers and ambiguity.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:43.897
These are 109 real human beings

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.031
with loved ones,

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.766
with families waiting for them,

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.735
their innocence on all sides.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:49.202
In the Middle East,

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:50.904
conflict to our suffering.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:52.539
And I think the people in the room

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.907
understood that last night.

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.942
Yeah, that was what was so important.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.044
And you've emphasized the diversity

00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:59.879
of the hostages, right?

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:00.980
Well, I think that there's

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.649
a real misunderstanding

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:03.183
of who

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.552
this hostage cohort is

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:06.953
that this is a monolithic

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:08.254
group of people.

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:09.522
And as I mentioned

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.223
last night,

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:13.393
they are from 23 different countries.

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:14.794
They are Christian.

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:15.862
They are Jewish.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.831
They're Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists.

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:21.201
And this is something that gets lost

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.237
when someone has a very specific reason

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:26.873
to create a narrative a certain way.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:27.707
And we all so

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:28.675
very much

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:30.443
are constantly saying

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:33.346
we are extremely concerned

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:34.214
and heartbroken

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.217
for the innocent civilians in Gaza

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.419
and the innocent civilians

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:39.986
in Gaza

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.021
who were dragged there on October 7th.

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:43.690
You don't have to choose

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.191
one or the other.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.694
This is a humanitarian issue.

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:49.162
Absolutely.

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:51.264
and everybody's feeling it.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.031
Everybody's feeling.

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:55.702
And John Hirsh lost part of his left arm

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.170
in the text.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.604
We do.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:04:00.607
We know of any idea how he's doing,

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:02.675
how how he's holding up?

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.510
120 days ago,

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.979
we saw a video

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.047
that Hamas released of Hirsh.

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.549
It was the first sign of life

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.718
we had on him in 201 days,

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:13.886
and the last we've had since.

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:15.622
But that video is something

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:16.723
that no parent would ever want

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:19.492
to see of their kid with a limb missing,

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:22.095
bruising on their face, looking pale.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:23.596
But at the

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:24.497
same time, when that's

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.633
what you get after 201 days,

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.101
it just gave us strength

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.169
to see him, to hear him,

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.939
and it continues to carry us now

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.974
that he's a fighter and a survivor

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:36.276
and he's going to keep on going.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.277
And we need him to know

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.211
and all the hostages

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:38.945
to know

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.380
that we are not stopping

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.382
until we get them all out.

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:45.118
And, Rachel, I know I was asking this

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.052
during the commercial break,

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.186
but do you have any sense?

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.121
I mean, there are these talks

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.255
that are going on right now.

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:50.223
Do you have any sense

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.457
as to where they're going?

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.792
Are they finally going

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.060
to get to some kind of resolution

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.561
so we can bring your son

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.664
and the rest of those hostages home?

00:04:57.664 --> 00:05:00.066
Well, we're not any more privy to

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.534
what is going on

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:03.569
behind the scenes than any,

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.038
any regular person

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:07.240
watching the news or following.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.442
We are always hopeful and optimistic.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:13.112
We know that many of the

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.948
people who are participating

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:17.116
in the negotiations,

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.184
and in

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:19.952
everything that's happening,

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:21.921
are really trying to lean forward.

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:23.389
At the end of the day,

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.959
this is up to two men from the two

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.896
primary parties.

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:30.863
Yeah, Prime Minister

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:34.434
Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Senor.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:39.572
And, I think until each of them decide

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:43.142
that it's time for our children,

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:46.145
our loved ones, the whole entire

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:47.947
mass of people

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:48.581
who are caught

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:51.050
in the crosshairs of this conflict

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.053
no longer should be pawns in this game.

00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:56.689
It won't end.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:57.957
And it's so important.

00:05:57.957 --> 00:05:59.926
And I do want to go back to that moment

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:03.196
last night that people understand

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:06.199
that the human element of this,

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.534
they're real families suffering,

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:10.503
real families in the dark.

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.472
And to have that outpouring of support,

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.107
it just must have meant so much

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:16.876
that it's still there,

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:17.777
have spite everything

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:19.312
that's in the political,

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.513
you know, spectrum right now,

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:21.647
the dialog that's happening

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:23.816
and so much bitter opposition

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:25.118
to what's taking place that

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:25.752
it's still there,

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:26.753
that I mentioned

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:27.320
in my remarks

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.820
last night,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.389
that really one of the things

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.256
that has carried

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:31.457
all of the hostage families

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:32.625
to get up every morning

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:35.628
and keep on pushing and keep fighting

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.631
is the tremendous support,

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:39.699
strength prayers

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.001
we get from literally all over the world.

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:43.603
And last night was a microcosm of this.

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:44.537
I don't know, 2020

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:46.506
5000 people in the building.

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:49.008
Not only were they supporting us

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:49.642
as we spoke,

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:52.111
but afterwards just people stopping us.

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:53.646
And as we walked out

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:54.881
shouting, we're with you,

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:55.748
we're supporting you,

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:58.351
our prayers are with you. Keep going.

00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.619
It was really none of the

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:00.453
none of the reaction

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:02.288
that you were prepared for that

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:03.890
they told you you might receive.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.358
Correct.

00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:06.926
That's that's so important.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:07.760
Yeah. It's so important.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.461
And and I'm

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:11.164
sure it sustains you to some extent.

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:13.466
It's not. It doesn't do everything right.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.368
But it's obviously helpful.

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:19.238
And I think it is really important.

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:20.907
We don't all have to agree.

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:23.376
And that was a big theme last night

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:26.045
that a lot of the different speakers

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:27.280
discussed.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.949
But we have to try to understand.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.117
We don't have to agree.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.386
We just have to try to understand

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:36.055
those with whom we don't share

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:38.357
the same opinions.

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:39.158
That's all right.

00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:39.525
That's what

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:41.794
we have to try to understand each other.

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:41.994
Yeah.

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:42.795
There was a lot of talk

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.397
about looking out for your neighbors,

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:44.864
you know,

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:47.867
and that that crosses our boundaries.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.068
You know, nations.

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:50.770
We honestly did not even know

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.905
that we were speaking on the night

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:54.807
that was under the freedom theme.

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:55.541
Interesting.

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:56.843
But

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.878
it makes sense, right?

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:01.547
That's that's what we're pushing for.

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:01.881
That's what

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:03.983
we've been pushing for 321 days

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.117
and are going to continue

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:06.152
to fight for it.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.920
Well, thank you very much to both of you.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.589
Really appreciate I know we say it,

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:10.990
time and again, but,

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.758
we are thinking of you

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:13.826
and praying for you.

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:14.260
Thank you.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.161
Thank you very much.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.596
Thank you, thank you. Appreciate it.

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:17.730
Rachel and John, thanks so much.
