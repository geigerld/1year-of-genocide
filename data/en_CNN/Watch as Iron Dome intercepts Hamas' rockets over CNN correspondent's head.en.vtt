00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.567
I can't

00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:01.501
think of a scenario

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.335
where I've been sort

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.371
of looking at rockets that are outgoing

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:05.705
and a colleague.

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:06.373
Dear colleague,

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:08.441
you are being underneath it.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.477
And if it's a bad, eerie feeling

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.177
and I just

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.145
when I see the rockets

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:12.779
coming out of that,

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.080
I want to be picking up the phone

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.882
and said, guys, they're coming.

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:16.416
They're coming.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:17.784
But I know the defense system

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:18.785
here is so strong

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:19.953
that you get

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:21.021
as I'm seeing them come

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:21.421
up, you're

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.123
getting the sirens immediately.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.858
I mean, you're getting those intercepts

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.226
right over your head.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.460
We're actually from where we are.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.596
We can actually see the rockets

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:32.098
Iron Dome rockets themselves taking off

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.400
and making those intercepts.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.534
And we've been looking.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.769
I know you're trying to figure out

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:36.536
if you can get to

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.338
underneath the cloud of smoke, but John's

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:39.806
pointing at that cloud of smoke now.

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.641
We've been watching it get bigger.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.309
It was small, dark cloud of smoke.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.211
Now it's like big and billowing

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.813
and the smoke is gone kind of gray.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.281
But something's on fire there

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.682
because it hasn't gone out.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:50.450
It's it's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.318
it's it's putting out more smoke.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:52.619
But, yeah,

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:53.586
when I see those rockets

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:54.888
going out there and the intercepts

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:55.789
above your head,

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.157
I'm just thinking about you

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:01.461
and your team, Brant and Clayton.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:02.962
And I'm hearing I'm

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:03.563
and I'm hearing

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.765
small arms fire behind me there.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:07.901
That's that's

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.103
the Israeli Defense Force, I believe,

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.871
will be firing towards Gaza.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.006
I don't know if I've seen anything.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:13.540
Small arms

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.507
fire, guns,

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.911
heavy machine guns, small machine guns,

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.379
okay. Thank you.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:20.080
Absolutely. Nic.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.481
No, we can hear that small arms fire.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.016
We heard a right over your shoulder.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.451
Have you been hearing

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.652
have you been hearing that

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.020
since the rockets

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.855
since this barrage kind of started up?

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.757
Right.
Basically, right at 10 a.m.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:31.658
eastern

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.662
Yeah.
No, not really.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:36.663
I mean, we don't get much

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.198
small arms fire, but,

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.432
you know, we had it in this town

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.500
siren two days ago.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.034
We had it

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:44.104
and we knew that the IDF was going after

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.473
some Hamas militants in the town

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.475
because that is coming from towards Gaza.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:49.442
Does that mean some Hamas

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.910
militants have been spotted

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.011
maybe at the border fence

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.379
trying to get through the border fence?

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:54.848
If they have, they popped out a tunnel?

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:55.915
We're seeing intercepts.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:56.950
Clarissa,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.351
I believe that there is missiles

00:01:58.351 --> 00:01:59.552
coming your way

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:00.720
because I'm seeing intercepts

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.921
above your head.

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:04.157
So take take cover here

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:05.391
that they're going up.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.360
They're intercepting right there.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.328
Okay.

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:10.430
Yeah, you can see right here.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.097
There you see a

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:13.566
right above us.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.369
That's the Iron Dome intercepting,

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.739
just sort of crashing your balcony.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.275
But you can see the plane

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:23.877
Clayton.

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:26.646
Just keep a little bit inside. Yeah.

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.248
So this is just the sirens

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:31.351
went off a matter of seconds ago.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.252
And

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.921
now we're hearing

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.122
as those

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.290
rockets, it looks like

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.359
most of them were intercepted by the Iron

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.026
Dome up there.

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:43.229
You can see the plumes of smoke

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.730
from where

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.065
they were literally stopped

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.401
in their tracks.

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:51.871
Seems that maybe it's

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:53.873
a little bit quieter right now.

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:56.109
Not clear out.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.810
There's another one.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.578
Hold on.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:02.015
You can hear a jet overhead now as well.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.450
It's not uncommon in these situations.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.885
You'll hear the intercepts, you'll hear

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:06.953
the Iron Dome at work.

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:08.121
And then pretty quickly after

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.255
that, you'll hear jets

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.157
and then the distant

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:14.227
thought of a strike and Gaza

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.764
still hearing

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.801
those rockets being intercepted

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.736
and just gives you a feel

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.072
for the the volume

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.375
of rockets that are being used.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.010
I think many people initially

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.413
had been surprised

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.716
by how many,

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:37.650
how many rockets,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.620
how extensive the stockpiling up.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:42.589
And here another

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:44.190
sorry,

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.593
how extensive the stockpiling

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:47.393
and how effective

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.495
it's been in terms of the sheer

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:52.565
amount of rockets and some of them longer

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.801
range rockets and missiles as well.

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:58.671
So now appears to be

00:03:58.671 --> 00:03:59.672
a little bit quieter.

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:02.275
We can still see those plumes of smoke

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:04.544
from where the Iron Dome was activated.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.679
We can still see a plume of darker

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:09.082
smoke lower on the horizon from where

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:11.551
one of those rockets appears to have made

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.721
impact earlier on.

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.856
But clearly, Hamas

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:20.126
trying to send a very sobering message

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:23.463
to the people of Ashkelon today.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:24.631
They warned people,

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:27.033
they told them leave by 5 p.m..

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.902
And it has been pretty unrelenting in the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.005
I forget how long

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:32.939
we've been out here now,

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.007
but what are we talking?

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:37.710
35 minutes of pretty sustained,

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:41.080
I would say barrages of rockets

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:44.117
coming in to this cease port city.

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:47.453
Really remarkable for us as John Berman

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:48.721
here, we're seeing in real time

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:49.922
the Iron Dome

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:53.092
interceptor those rockets over your head.

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:54.394
And if we can just show people

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:55.461
this map very quickly

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:56.829
so we can remind people

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:57.730
where Clarissa is.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.899
She is in Ashkelon right here.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:00.900
Our Nic Robertson

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.069
and this is really also remarkable.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.038
Nic Robertson was here in Central

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:06.773
looking over Gaza

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:09.309
as the rockets were being shot out

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:11.010
into Ashkelon.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.312
Where Clarissa is.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.847
Clarissa, we hear heard

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:16.916
explosions and blast there.

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.252
Was that from the sky?

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:21.554
Can you distinguish between intercepts

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:23.122
or whether there was any impact

00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:24.724
on the ground from that last barrage?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.562
Yeah, you can usually

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:30.129
you can usually

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.998
distinguish is a slightly different sound

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.132
when they're intercepted in

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:34.267
the sky as opposed to

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:36.069
when they make a direct hit

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.870
I will say the first barrage

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.072
right at 5:00

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:40.273
was the most sustained,

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:41.407
the most intensive

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:44.210
and the most amount of direct hits.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.111
From what we heard,

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.213
we don't know where those hits

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:47.880
may have happened,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.816
with the exception of that one location

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.651
where it appears

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:54.454
that one of those rockets hit again,

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.922
we don't know exactly

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:56.823
what was there,

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.891
but we've been going out every day now

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:01.627
and seeing the the impact and effect

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.730
that some of these rockets have.

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:04.997
They destroy cars.

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:06.165
They destroy homes.

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:09.168
They just leave craters in the streets.

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:09.802
And, of course,

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:12.772
they have a very palpable effect

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:15.208
on the psyche of ordinary people.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.877
I think I hear a drone now.

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:19.345
Again,

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:20.613
drones are very common

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:22.749
at the moment for obvious reasons.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.418
We heard some jets before as well.

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:27.520
We had been hearing pretty much constant

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:28.654
jet activity

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.224
yesterday, but

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.593
more so even the day before.

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:33.960
And it

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.395
is this utterly disco

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.829
bar violating sense

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:39.365
for people who live here between

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.801
on the one hand, sirens going off

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.703
and people are frantically running

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:46.339
to try to get to shelters and crouching.

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.608
And then you hear explosions in the sky

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.277
and then 5 minutes later,

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:52.979
everything feels quiet again.

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.847
You can hear the sea.

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:55.648
It's

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:58.351
it's hard to imagine

00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.385
how people can live

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:01.821
like this day in and day out.

00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:03.389
It's extremely difficult

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.559
to kind of find any sense of equilibrium.

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:09.095
And we have definitely notice

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.631
that the tempo in Ashkelon today,

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:12.532
this afternoon

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:14.534
has has dramatically escalated.

00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:15.201
John

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.538
Clarissa, thank you.

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:19.505
Stand by for a second.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.407
Let's go back to Nic Robertson instead.

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:23.743
Nic, you were hearing firing.

00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:25.378
Describe what you were hearing

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:27.513
and what you think it might have been

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:31.884
what we were

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:32.485
hearing, what

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.921
sounded like small arms fire,

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:36.789
machine gun fire,

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.858
and that typically the Israeli

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:39.592
Defense Forces

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:41.194
won't fire their machine guns

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:43.463
unless they're close to a target.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.464
And then we could hear

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.832
what sounded like exchange

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.967
exchanges of fire, sustained,

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.235
sustained bursts of fire

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:50.303
coming from

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:53.105
that direction towards the border fence.

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:53.573
There are several

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.308
we're saying it's literally

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.210
2700 meters, I think is

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.711
what is what you said, Sara?

00:07:58.711 --> 00:07:59.412
The distance

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:00.680
between where we're at

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.614
and the border fence

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:02.748
and if Hamas is still

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:04.016
trying to make incursions.

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:06.219
We were down in that area today.

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:06.986
We were probably

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.621
about 700 meters

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:10.756
from the border fence earlier today.

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:13.359
And there are a lot of Israeli troops

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:14.760
down in that area,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.530
combat troops and jeeps and tanks

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:18.965
and armored vehicles.

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:21.100
They're ready for the potential

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.435
of more Hamas

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:24.303
militants trying to slip inside Israel.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:25.371
So it's possible

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:28.074
that that's what we've just heard there.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.076
But the fact that the gunfire is subside

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.744
subsided tells me that

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:33.513
whatever that contact, to use the

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.581
military parlance, was

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:39.352
the contact is broken at the moment.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.220
They're not engaged in a firefight.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.189
So that is over

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:44.790
unless we hear it start up again.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.894
But what we did hear during when Clarissa

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:49.629
was under that bombardment again,

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:50.997
just in the past few minutes,

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:53.266
we did hear a lot of artillery fire

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:54.500
being fired

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.702
from the Israeli forces into Gaza.

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:58.738
That's a very accurate artillery

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:00.573
that they used to try to target

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:01.707
the firing points

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:03.509
to try to get the the

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:04.710
the Hamas militants

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.012
who are firing the rockets.

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:07.446
And further south in Gaza,

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:08.581
I did hear a series

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.650
of even bigger explosions

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.184
and those may have been associated

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:13.753
with that fighter jet.

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:15.254
And I'm hearing another

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.557
sound explosion, detonation ripple

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.190
through the air

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.525
that may have been associated

00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:21.127
with the fighter jets

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:21.928
that both Clarissa

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:24.630
and I heard flying in over Gaza

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.798
just in the past few minutes.
