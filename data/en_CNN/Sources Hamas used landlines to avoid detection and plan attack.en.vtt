00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.534
One big question since

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:05.038
October 7th is, is how how did H

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:06.206
carry out

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.975
such a successful, sophisticated

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:09.843
if you can call it that,

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.544
terrorist attack while

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.246
keeping it all so secret?

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.114
And today, we're learning

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.849
that old school technology

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.150
may have played a major role.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.053
CNN's chief investigative corres

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.722
Pamela Brown, joins us now from 

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.125
Pamela, what does the intelligen

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:25.859
Well, Jake,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.660
sources are telling me and my co

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.796
at Cohen that a small group of H

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.498
operatives used hard

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:32.899
wired phones in the tunnels

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.100
beneath Gaza

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.968
to communicate

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.170
over a period of two years.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.805
That's according to intelligence

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:39.305
with U.S.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.474
officials Now, those old fashion

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.610
landlines allowed Hamas leaders

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.211
to communicate underground with 

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.346
another in secret.

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:47.947
They avoided using computers

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:48.915
or cell phones

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:50.617
in order to keep from being trac

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.886
by Israeli or U.S. intelligence.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.487
According to these sources, and 

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:55.655
it worked, Jake.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.957
Instead, they held meetings in p

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:58.992
among a small group

00:00:58.992 --> 00:00:59.993
and they stayed off

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:01.861
all digital communications.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:03.596
So this partially explains

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:04.831
why Israel and the U.S.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:05.165
were caught

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.933
so off guard by the attack

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.135
and how 1000 Hamas fighters

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.937
were able to pour across the bor

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:13.073
without being stopped shown here

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.307
And this propaganda video

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:15.809
released by Hamas.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.410
Now, all of this communication h

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.345
in the miles of underground

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.914
a tunnel system beneath Gaza

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.316
that the IDF nicknamed the Gaza 

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:24.684
You heard the hostage

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:25.285
there in the story

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:26.119
you just played, Jake,

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.054
talking about the spiderweb of t

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:29.022
That's where

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.124
apparently these phone lines

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:32.692
were hard wired underground.

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:33.259
And another way

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:33.993
Hamas was able

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.595
to keep this under the radar

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.197
is that they kept the planning

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.465
of the October 7th attack

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.567
a secret even from other members

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.268
Only a very small group

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:43.570
knew about this mission

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.872
until just before it was carried

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:48.141
Hamas ground unit commanders and

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.442
were in training for many months

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.343
and they were kept

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.978
in a state of general preparedne

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:52.712
I'm told,

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:53.780
but only found out

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.115
about the specific plans

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.049
just a few days

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.584
before the terrorist attack.

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:58.918
And one of the sources said

00:01:58.918 --> 00:01:59.352
some of their

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:01.488
training above ground was observ

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.156
by Israeli officials,

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:04.891
but did not ring major alarm bel

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:05.391
The thinking

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.793
was, I'm told, was, oh, Hamas

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.528
always tradespeople like this.

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.762
It didn't look different.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.664
But of course, we know now, Jake

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.068
and Pamela, Israel

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.870
actually found these hard wired

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.004
phones in Hamas

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.840
strongholds in the past, though,

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.575
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.511
Israeli military found a similar

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.012
of communication system

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.147
when they raided a city

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:27.881
in the northern West

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:28.748
Bank over the summer,

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:30.750
according to an Israeli official

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.484
They called this

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.453
a joint operational command cent

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.755
and it had hard wired communicat

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:36.756
and closed

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.057
circuit surveillance cameras

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:38.892
to give advance

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:40.927
warning of Israeli troop movemen

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.594
So clearly,

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:42.795
this is something that has been

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.564
in their playbook, Hamas

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:45.632
has had in their playbook,

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:46.766
and they used it

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.334
to execute this operation,

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:52.305
as you pointed out, successfully

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:52.639
All right.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.873
Pamela Brown, thank you so much.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:54.641
I want to bring in Mark

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.376
Regev with me here in Tel Aviv.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.378
He is the senior adviser

00:02:58.378 --> 00:02:59.212
to Israel's Prime

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:00.480
Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.549
also a former Israeli ambassador

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.616
to the United Kingdom.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.984
Thank you so much for being here

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.352
I really appreciate it.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.187
If Shin Bet,

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:07.620
the Israeli

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.354
security service,

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.857
if it knows so much about Hamas,

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:11.357
why wouldn't

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.092
they know about these tactics?

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:14.894
How could Shin Bet

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:17.664
and the IDF not have seen Octobe

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.465
coming in anyway?

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:20.133
So it's clear

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.702
there was an intelligence failur

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:23.203
It's clear

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.305
we were taken by surprise and we

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.140
a terrible price for that.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:28.541
What is it,

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.010
1400 people killed

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.513
and more taken hostage?

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:36.015
I think we when this is over

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.650
now we're focused on winning thi

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.518
and we will win this.

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:39.452
But when this is over,

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:40.853
there have to be an investigatio

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:42.288
and thorough investigation

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:43.590
lessons learned.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.425
Why was there an intelligence fa

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:46.559
Why was it so easy

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.528
for them to cross over the fence

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.230
which was supposed to protect us

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.131
with all the high tech and so fo

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.733
And why did it take the IDF

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.736
so long to force them

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.770
back to the other side

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.972
and kill the people

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.940
who had come over to our side?

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.141
There are all sorts of issues

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.476
that need to be investigated.

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:04.077
In the past,

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.078
when we've had security

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:05.979
mishaps like this,

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.447
and this is more than a mishap, 

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.281
a major problem.

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:10.583
We've had investigations,

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:11.751
we've had committees of inquiry.

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.353
We've had parliamentary inquirie

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:15.054
I'm sure when this is over,

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:15.888
when we've won this,

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:17.790
we'll have those sort of investi

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.058
Ultimately, we're going to conti

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:19.892
to live here.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.027
We live in a tough neighborhood,

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:21.828
and we have to make sure

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:22.795
we're at the top of our game.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:23.896
And it's clear we weren't.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:26.633
When you heard the freed hostage

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:27.634
Yoli Lifshitz.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:28.468
85 years old

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.702
this morning,

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:30.436
saying this wasn't

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:32.705
just an internal intelligence fa

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.340
There had been warnings in the w

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.710
before Hamas doing things, the f

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:40.213
not strong people calling

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.549
the security forces, warning the

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:46.753
And these complaints, these warn

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.789
the kibbutzim around they're ign

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.025
So it's clear

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:53.993
she's speaking for many Israelis

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:54.594
I mean, we

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:55.595
we pride ourselves

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:55.962
on having

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.630
very good intelligence services.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.398
The Mossad has

00:04:58.398 --> 00:04:59.899
an international reputation.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.735
The Shin Bet is the same.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:05.071
And yet here it's obviously

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.506
we weren't up to par.

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:08.541
And I think Israelis expect more

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:10.310
and there will be investigations

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.577
and there will be lessons learne

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:12.779
Why do you think Hamas

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.013
has been releasing hostages?

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:15.415
That's four hostages released.

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:17.517
Obviously, two of them are Ameri

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.319
I'm not sure about the nationali

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.286
of these recent two.

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:21.487
Are they Israeli? Yes.

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:22.655
They're both just purely Israeli

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:23.856
That's what I understand. Okay.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.458
Why are they releasing hostages?

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:27.093
Because they're under immense pr

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:28.261
and their allies are under

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.829
immense pressure.

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:33.166
Look, Hamas wants a cease fire.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:33.733
They hit us.

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:34.434
They hit us hard.

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:35.435
And now they want a cease fire

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:36.035
to protect them

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:37.537
so we don't destroy

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:39.138
their military machine.

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:40.206
But they're not going to get wha

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:41.307
We're going to continue

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:42.275
keeping up the pressure.

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:44.077
We're going to continue to targe

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.011
And with the international

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.013
diplomatic pressure on their all

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.781
we think we can get more people 

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:49.415
Do you think they're going

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:50.216
to be more hostages

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.485
released in the next week, two w

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:53.019
I can't

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.954
I can't speak for Hamas, obvious

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:55.888
but we'll keep the pressure

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:57.690
up in the past over the last wee

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.392
Pressure has got people out.

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:00.093
Keep the pressure

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:00.626
up, increase

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:01.561
that pressure,

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:02.795
make Hamas feel the heat,

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:05.264
make their allies feel the heat.

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:06.632
You'll get more people out.

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:08.167
So last night you told CNN's

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.602
Kaitlan Collins

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:10.103
that Israel

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.170
is not going to authorize

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.339
fuel to enter Gaza

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.906
because it will just

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.074
fall into Hamas's hands,

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:16.743
even if it's meant for the hospi

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:19.112
Correct? Meant for humanitarian 

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:19.979
Hamas will take it.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.848
They control Gaza. Correct.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:24.217
Only then this morning, the IDF

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:26.552
chief of staff said it will

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.888
it will enter fuel,

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.523
enter Gaza, but only for civilia

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:31.891
Then just minutes ago,

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.025
an IDF spokesperson

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:35.228
said no fuel full stop

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.095
because it will end up

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:37.497
in the hands of Hamas.

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:39.732
That's three different positions

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:42.301
in less than 12 hours, I think.

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:42.969
Why?

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.638
What's going on and what is ther

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:46.506
Are you going to end

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:48.241
on one of these positions at som

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.376
So the government decision

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:51.177
that has been taken

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:52.445
by our security cabinet

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.947
is we're in favor of humanitaria

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:57.583
which is water food and medicine

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.284
Right.

00:06:58.284 --> 00:06:59.419
The trouble with fuel

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.020
and I know that they say they ne

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.522
for the generators in the hospit

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:04.290
and that's a genuine need.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.491
Is that the same fuel

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:07.126
is taken stolen by Hamas?

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:08.060
And as you've said correctly,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.928
they control Gaza.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.229
The only people with guns,

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:11.597
they can take what they want.

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:12.565
They take that off

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:14.000
for their military machine

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.269
and they use that for rockets.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:16.936
For rockets

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:17.703
and for their underground

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:18.871
network of tunnels. Right.

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:20.706
For the oxygen in the tunnels, c

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:20.973
Right.

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:22.975
And we obviously want to deny th

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:24.110
But I want you to know,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.312
we we put out a statement earlie

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:29.849
The IDF, there is actually a hug

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:31.017
of fuel inside

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:33.553
Gaza today, which Hamas has.

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:34.921
Now, if you could tell me

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:37.223
give me assurances, guarantees

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:40.460
that fuel going into Gaza would 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.595
for civilian purposes, that's fi

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:43.663
But I don't think anyone can giv

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:44.163
that guarantee.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:45.832
And we saw last week, CNN report

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:46.899
I remember

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:47.967
there were six truck

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.936
loads, six tankers went in with 

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:51.471
And we know for a fact

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.973
that Hamas hijacked and stole

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.007
part of that fuel.

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:55.741
And so we're dealing

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:56.943
with a formidable enemy.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:58.611
There should be no shortage

00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:00.446
whatsoever for the hospitals in 

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:02.548
but Hamas is stealing that fuel

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:03.483
from the people of Gaza.

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:04.584
Can you clear something up for m

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:05.551
Because I really can't get

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:07.053
a straight answer on this.

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:09.422
There are about five or 600 Amer

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.457
stuck in Gaza.

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:13.059
They've a lot of them are at

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:14.360
the Rafah crossing. Right.

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:16.162
These are Americans.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.563
They have American passports.

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:19.932
Some of them are Palestinian-Ame

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:20.967
But but, you know,

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:22.201
they have homes in Massachusetts

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:23.402
They have homes in New Jersey.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:24.303
They've been calling the U.S.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:25.638
State Department.

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:27.473
Why can't they get out?

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:29.342
So I can give you a clear answer

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.543
Hamas won't let them out.

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:31.244
In many ways,

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:32.645
I think Hamas is also

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:34.113
keeping them hostage.

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:36.148
I remember Secretary Blinken rai

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:36.649
that issue.

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:38.017
What was it, over a week ago

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.252
before the president was here,

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:40.353
before you were secretary of def

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.153
It was one of the issues

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:42.255
that came up with us

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:43.823
and we said from our point of vi

00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:44.790
we'll do everything we can

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.059
to facilitate their immediate re

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.261
but only out of Rafah crossing,

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:50.296
because all of your crossings ar

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:51.631
and they've been destroyed.

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:52.999
That functioning, that's a war z

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:53.533
Right.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.201
We've had very serious firefight

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:55.768
I understand.

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:57.803
I'm just said we're we're happy

00:08:57.803 --> 00:08:59.605
and eager to facilitate their re

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:00.773
their exit.

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:02.441
That's a promise to the American

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:03.509
We're serious about that.

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:05.378
But Hamas has decided to play ga

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:05.978
with these Americans.

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:08.114
But it's not el-Sisi. It's not E

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:10.416
It's Hamas. Yes, definitely.

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:11.183
All right.

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:12.285
Former Ambassador Mark Regev,

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:13.519
thank you for your time today.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.153
I really appreciate it.
