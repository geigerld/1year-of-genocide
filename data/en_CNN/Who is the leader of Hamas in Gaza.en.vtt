00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.334
Want to tell you about a man

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:01.634
who is said

00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:02.736
to be the Hamas leader

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.170
who is central to this war

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.438
and the release of hostages.

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:07.140
He's also a key target for Israel.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.208
Sam Kiley has more

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:11.211
on the leader of Hamas in Gaza.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:14.581
What Israel wants this man dead.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.949
Yayha Sinwar

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.817
The leader of Hamas in Gaza.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:22.022
In the face of evil in the end

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:22.922
is Yayha Sinwar

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.458
Well, that man is in our sights.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.661
All his team are and will get to them.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.830
He was first convicted in 1988

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.732
for the murder of two Israeli soldiers

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.300
and four Palestinians

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.570
suspected of collaboration with Israel.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.005
And he spent two decades

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.575
in an Israeli prison studying his enemy,

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.743
the founder of Hamas

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:45.412
internal security force.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.513
He had hunted alleged

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:49.649
collaborators with zeal and

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.418
brothers and was among the movement's

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.385
biggest prizes

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.319
when over a thousand

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.788
Palestinian prisoners

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.656
were released in 2011.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.191
For Gilad Shalit,

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.894
an Israeli soldier held hostage in Gaza

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.631
for five years, he said, 

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:05.598
there is no doubt

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.567
that this is a nationalistic moment,

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:08.968
par excellence.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.371
It is one of the big strategic monuments

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.340
in the history of our cause.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.242
He quickly became head of Hamas

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.377
military wing

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.878
and on election to the Gaza

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.980
leadership in 2017,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.382
effectively abolished

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.184
its civilian branch,

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:26.386
ostracized by Egypt over its support

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:27.854
for political Islam.

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:30.256
He repaired friendships with Cairo

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:30.723
and built

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.192
regional relationships

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.260
that entrenched Hamas power.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.595
It really needed to have

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.263
also good relations

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.733
with the key Arab state that also shares

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.069
the only era border with the Gaza Strip

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.240
and with Iran that could supply Hamas

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.211
with military and logistical support.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.313
Iran has poured military support

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:54.514
into Hamas under him,

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.649
and Qatar has been a major backer

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.451
of civilian projects.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.453
He was soon in Israel's crosshairs.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:01.754
Quite literally,

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:05.492
the IDF tried to kill him in May 20, 21.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:08.561
Ten days later, he laid out his strategy.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.130
He said

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.097
if the world doesn't

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:13.633
take action to stop it, meaning Israel,

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.201
there will be a religious war

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.936
in the region.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.471
And he soon appeared in Gaza

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.206
alongside Egypt's intelligence

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:21.875
chief, Abbas Kamel.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:22.575
For us,

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:25.645
the US is now relying on Egypt and Qatar

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.913
as key players

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.281
to try to secure the safe

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:32.018
release of Hamas's 200 captives.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.953
Their main point of contact

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.756
is likely Sinwar.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.024
unless Israel fulfills

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:40.460
its promise to kill them.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.328
Sam Kiley, CNN.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:45.298
The move of

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.766
well, a major unanswered question

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.301
here is what was Hamas

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.969
thinking with their terror attack?

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.304
That is the headline for an article

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:52.639
by a journalist at The New Yorker

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.607
who recently asked that of a senior

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.643
political Hamas official

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:58.978
who is living in in Doha in Qatar.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.547
David Kirkpatrick, who coauthored

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:01.381
that piece, has covered

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:02.682
the region extensively.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.516
He joins us now.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.651
David, the article you wrote

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.753
is is fascinating.

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:11.558
What what were they thinking?

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:12.659
You know,

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.062
the picture that emerged was desperation.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.863
I should tell you

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.599
that when my colleague Adam

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.301
Rasgon and I,

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.168
both Rasgon

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:24.804
and I spoke to Mousa Abu Marzouk,

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.105
he was at pains to say, no,

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:28.208
we have not despaired, we're strong.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.442
But the takeaway was

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:31.744
that they basically feel like their backs

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.479
against are against the wall.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.648
It was a, you know, a familiar

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:36.749
litany of grievances

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:37.750
about the occupation,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.152
about Israeli settlements

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:40.053
in the West Bank,

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.054
about the management

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.121
of the Al-Aqsa mosque,

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:44.257
which is very important to Palestinians

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:46.025
and Muslims everywhere.

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:46.960
But added to

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.828
that was an increased sense

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:49.295
of desperation

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.030
because of the right wing government

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.465
around Netanyahu,

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:53.733
because of the messages

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:54.567
that it's conveying

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.102
about its lack of receptivity

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:57.503
to any kind of

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:58.771
Palestinian political entity

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:00.740
alongside side Israel.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.642
And also a sense of betrayal

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:05.044
as the other Arab states

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:06.512
more and more accommodate

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:07.780
themselves to Israel,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.182
you know, begin to recognize

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:10.783
Israel and Saudi Arabia,

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:11.951
the most important of those.

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.753
The latest in line

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.355
to make an agreement like that.

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:16.522
So it's really a time

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:19.092
when I think from his point of view,

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:22.562
little choice.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:26.466
So for for Hamas, it would be a success.

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:27.900
If you can talk about the murder

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.102
of so many civilians

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.136
as a success

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:31.471
in their in their calculus,

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.473
as if that Saudi deal

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:34.307
does not go through.

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:36.809
Saudi Arabia does not recognize

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.544
the state of Israel.

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:40.280
And also,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.581
they have these hostages

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:44.117
who they have wanted to trade in the past

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.820
and I assume want to trade now.

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.222
Yeah, that's all true.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:49.522
You know,

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:50.490
and we pressed him

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.991
on the sort of intelligible

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:53.059
strategic reasons.

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.293
You know,

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.994
did you do this because of Saudi Arabia?

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.996
Did you do this for prisoner exchanges?

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:58.298
And there wasn't a clear answer

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.265
because he was very frank

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:00.633
that he didn't think they could dissuade

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:01.301
Saudi Arabia.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.302
Saudi Arabia is going to do

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.237
what Saudi Arabia is going to do.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:04.871
And yeah,

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.039
I'm sure they'll want to exchange

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.006
these prisoners.

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:08.508
But at the same time,

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:09.275
they this

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:12.011
this attack has brought an enormous,

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:14.947
enormous degree of pain on the Gaza

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:16.115
and part of the Palestinians

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.850
living in Gaza.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.052
And when we pressed him

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.321
about how the strategic advantages,

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.522
the practical strategic

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:23.823
advantage of this attack

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.892
could justify that sacrifice,

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:27.894
his answers were very abstract,

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:28.661
very nebulous.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.829
He was really looking towards

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.698
a very, very distant horizon.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:34.267
All he could say was, you know, for years

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:35.902
they've been fighting on our territory

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:36.969
and killing us.

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:37.603
This time

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:38.805
we're fighting on their territory

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:41.374
for the first time, which is a

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.608
you know, it's a symbolic

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:47.113
victory of sorts, but it's not much.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.847
We should point out

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.215
and you point this out in

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:50.450
in the article in The New Yorker,

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.051
which I encourage people to read.

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:52.985
He lied to you.

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:53.920
I mean, he denies

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.388
that civilians were targeted.

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:56.622
He denies that the

00:05:56.622 --> 00:06:00.793
women and children were slaughtered.

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:02.261
He did say some things,

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.163
which we found unconvincing about that.

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:04.397
Yeah.

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:05.798
He said, you know, after the Hamas

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:06.866
fighters came in.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.701
Others came in afterwards.

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:09.769
And it was those others

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.371
who did these misdeeds.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.038
Yeah, that's true.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.573
I didn't find that very convincing.

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:14.073
He's certainly

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:15.208
not the first military leader

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:19.278
to try to spin in that way.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.279
If.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.214
Is it clear to you

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.182
if Hamas expects Hezbollah

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:26.886
to open up a second front in this war?

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:27.987
It was clear

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:29.922
from what he said that they do not.

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:31.324
You know, obviously this is a war.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:32.859
There's lots of misinformation.

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:34.861
But he was he seemed very candid.

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:36.162
We said, you know what,

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:37.263
if Hezbollah enters this, well,

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:38.698
what if it becomes a regional conflict?

00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:39.932
And he said, quite frankly,

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:41.000
we wish, you know,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.868
if only it could

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:42.869
become a regional conflict.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:43.870
We would love that.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.905
But we don't see any sign of it.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.241
Hezbollah is going to more or less abide

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:51.244
by its cease fire with Israel, he said.

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:54.046
And he did not expect this war to expand

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:57.850
on that other front.

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.318
David Kirkpatrick, thank you so much.

00:06:59.318 --> 00:06:59.819
It's good to have you on

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:00.453
the program again.
