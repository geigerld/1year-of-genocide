&gt;&gt; Out front now, doctor Barbara's end. And doctors, and it is incredible to finally see. I know you are literally on your way, back home. I can only imagine the conflicted feelings you have about that, you are eager to be going home, but of course leave behind so much suffering. How do you feel right now? &gt;&gt; Well, just as you said, I feel mixed. I am relieved to be on my way home, I know being there, I couldn't do anything to help what was going on. But also, yeah, just so sad for the people of gaza, and concerned about what is going to be going on in the next weeks to months to, however long it takes to getome peace there. &gt;&gt; And, there is so much suffering. I know Barbara while you are, there it was so hard for you to get any contact. I mean, your husband, Paul who we respect to every day, sometimes he got a text from, you sometimes he couldn't even. And he was obviously quite distressed. But you know, there were times he told us you are sleeping in a car with six other people. You had reported that food and water were in short supply. You have seen people fighting over food outside of the compound where you were. And you talked about a toilet shared by 800 people, which just to imagine the thought of that what that means for, people the duress. What more can you tell us about the conditions inside gaza right now, doctors and? &gt;&gt; Well, it is great that the aid is moving in, but there is so much more aid that is needed. And so, it's so difficult. The -- ran out of water. And we were getting short on water. And at one point, we only thought we had about two more days of food left. And, we were able to have someone risked their lives and go to north, gaza and get some food for our. Group and we were the fortunate ones. Really, people were just having trouble just getting food, finding food in the grocery stores. And getting water. A friend of mine there today says he is drinking the tap water, which is salty, and not safe, 80% of the water there is unsafe. So it is concerning, it is concerning about the health. And like you said, the toilet issues, the sanitation, that's -- dysentery for those, especially the children there. And you know, that's half of the population. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes and of course the population to which you have dedicated your career, and your life and your care. For doctors in, I mention your husband Paul, and I just want to bring him into the conversation. Because he was with us, and everyone watching every day, sharing any update he had, from you throughout this entire ordeal. I know you can see Barbara, literally on her way to come home to you. How does it feel to finally be in this, moment to see her, to know that she is safe, and you know that she is on her way home to you? &gt;&gt; Well it's incredible. It's one of those things where, I knew it would happen, but it seemed like time was dragging on. And then at some point, I did get pretty pessimistic. But otherwise, I am just very happy that she is on her way home. &gt;&gt; Doctors in I mean, I know that you can talk. But here in this moment. I mean, is there anything that you would want to say to Paul, before you get on that plane. And, obviously you'll be with him tomorrow, right at this time? &gt;&gt; Yeah I you know, I think it's harder to -- we had challenges here. But you know, it's harder to -- and so I really, I really appreciate all the love and support -- and. And I just am also there for them. &gt;&gt; Well they had such incredible care for. You doctors, you mentioned your conflicted feelings, because of what you are leaving behind. This was not your first trip to gaza, you have been several times before, to help children Do you think you will go back? &gt;&gt; I have to talk to Paul about that. I definitely want to come back, and continue to work with Palestinian children. But, we will have to make that a family discussions, right. &gt;&gt; Paul? &gt;&gt; Yet we'll, we'll have vigorous discourse on that, yes. &gt;&gt; I can only imagine. I guess I'm glad that, I guess I'm glad eavesdropping on your conversation here, it made us all smile, in such a moment of darkness and pain and everything that you have witnessed and endured, doctors My thoughts are with you. And police have a safe trip home, and we will all be so glad that the two of you will be reunited, and your son as well. So thank you, again.
