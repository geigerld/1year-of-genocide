00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.376
The Hamas attacks have caused

00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:03.003
a significant shift here

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:03.628
in Israel

00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:05.672
among many and the ultra-Orthodox

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:06.756
Jewish community.

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.216
Traditionally, they refuse

00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:10.343
to sign up for military service,

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:11.386
which is mandatory

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:12.846
for most men and women

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.015
in Israel after their 18th birthday.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.641
But that's changing.

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:18.935
After the October 7th Hamas attack

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:25.817
that killed 1400 men, women and children.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.194
A limitation they want to see made about.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:28.611
Moti.

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:29.320
Lightner reads

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.323
the Torah at least an hour every day.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:35.618
Decision on his family as one of the 1.2

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:38.705
million ultra-Orthodox Jews or Hassidim

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:42.042
who live here in Israel for decades.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.418
Many in his community

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.045
have fought against Israel's

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.838
mandatory military service

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.507
for every Jewish Israeli man and woman.

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.342
As soon as they turn 18.

00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:52.927
This year, the ultra-Orthodox

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.220
tried to get a law passed

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.431
to exempt them from having to enlist.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.932
A major source of friction

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.101
in Israeli society.

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:03.104
Then October 7th happened.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.564
Have you ever fired a weapon

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:07.692
and picked up a weapon before? No.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.110
I never heard the gun.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.361
Something like this.

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:12.489
That is about to change in.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.908
The few days

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:18.286
I will go to the Israeli army.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.537
Leitner enlisted

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:20.872
after the murderous attack

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:21.998
by Hamas on men,

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:24.292
women and children in Israel.

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.503
That killed 12 as Israel then.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.004
It completely shook

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.882
us, Broke all conceptions, he says.

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:32.467
We thought we had the privilege

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.303
to stand at the side and not be part of.

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:36.763
And now we realize

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:40.975
it's just not sustainable.

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.353
He says most of the ultra-Orthodox here

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.355
believe their jobs are to keep

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:46.272
the Jewish religion

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.191
alive and well, spending their days

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:50.151
studying the Torah.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:50.568
But often

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.487
because the Israeli military

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:55.365
reported between 2019 and 2021,

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.660
only about 1200 or so ultra-Orthodox Jews

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:01.287
were conscripted annually.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.831
That's out of 12,000

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.582
potential applicants.

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:07.418
Why did the Hassidim, the ultra-Orthodox,

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:09.129
not want to serve in the Army?

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.964
It was. Silly.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.799
The ultra-Orthodox people in Israel

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.175
have an ethos, according

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:15.051
to which studying

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.803
Torah gives the nation

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:20.014
a metaphysical layer of defense, he says.

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:21.224
So if it's my home issue,

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:22.767
a lot of them are not.

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:24.519
But he says he cannot see

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.312
how that is enough now.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:29.232
And he says he knows many other Hassidim

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:31.025
feel the same.

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:32.986
It's part of the same.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.946
I personally sat in my living room

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.990
and just cried for a day.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.868
We can't just go on with our daily lives.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:40.994
We said, never again.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:41.953
After the Holocaust.

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:42.912
And if we want to be able

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.456
to say that again to next generations

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:47.292
and promise our children

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.877
a sustainable future,

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.296
we have to solve this issue.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.547
In Hebrew, this sign says,

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:53.840
Together we will win.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.133
It's very rare

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:56.092
to see this kind of

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:57.677
nationalistic language

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:58.928
in ultra-Orthodox

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.680
neighborhoods like this one in Israel.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.223
You're also seeing a lot of Israeli

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.976
flags plastered all over the place.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.561
That just doesn't really happen

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:07.562
during normal times.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:08.688
It gives you some sense

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.899
that opinions among the ultra-Orthodox

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.234
have changed in a bit.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:14.944
Infanti, writing

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:15.486
his wife's

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:17.155
opinion, has certainly changed,

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.782
but she does worry about one thing.

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.451
I worry more

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:25.163
if we don't know how to hold a weapon.

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:27.582
And I also want to know

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:30.585
how do I want a license for a gun?

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.172
Also, there is a role.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:38.092
You know, we are not in Switzerland.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.178
There is one more difficult thing

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:41.596
he has to do with his family

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:43.431
before he goes to serve.

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.308
Tell his children Yehuda.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.227
Elizabeth and Abigail.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:50.021
Nine, seven and six years old.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.398
They play oblivious to the changes

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.858
they're about to experience

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:58.613
at home due to war.

00:03:58.696 --> 00:04:00.573
Now, Moti Lightner is not the

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.866
only member of his family

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:04.869
that is going to go enlist.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:05.954
He has enlisted

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.957
and so has his twin brother who lives

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:09.999
in California.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.251
His twin brother is leaving

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.418
there to come to Israel.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:15.463
They hope to go into the armed forces

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:16.005
together.
