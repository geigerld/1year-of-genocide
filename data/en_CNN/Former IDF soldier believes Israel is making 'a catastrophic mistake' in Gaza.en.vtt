00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.302
Welcome to the program.

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.170
You've been listening

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.538
to some of the reporting

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.273
just just airing just before you

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:08.742
and you obviously seeing everything

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:11.044
that's going on around you.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.313
Tell me first,

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.281
what has been going through your head

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.784
and your heart since October 7th?

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:24.257
Well, since

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.593
October 7th,

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.996
everything has changed in some ways

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.664
and in other ways.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.967
Everything is

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.736
my my worst fears are coming true.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.607
I as you mentioned,

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:43.376
I fought in Gaza in 2014.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.713
That war was also preceded by a horrific

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.881
terrorist attack,

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.983
just like we saw on October 7th.

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.184
Three Israeli teenagers

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.819
were kidnaped and murdered,

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:56.156
which led to a oh, don't worry

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:58.558
sorry story

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.294
which led which led to a horrific

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:05.298
which led to the firing of rockets.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.500
A massive crackdown on Hamas

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.635
in the West Bank

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:09.903
and the firing of rockets and

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.071
then a ground invasion.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.174
The the images that

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.377
everyone is seeing that I'm seeing

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:20.413
remind me very vividly of that fighting.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:24.284
And frankly it's it's my worst fears

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:27.420
because many people colleagues

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.223
in the Israeli peace camp in the Israeli

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.391
anti-occupation camp

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:32.525
have been warning

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.027
for so many years

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.161
saying that

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.629
there is no military solution.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.698
We can't just manage the conflict

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:42.869
and maintain a very, very brutal

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.137
military

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.306
regime of control over Palestinians.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.640
That actually plays

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.908
into the hands of Hamas

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:49.375
and plays

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:49.976
into the hands

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:52.645
of these murderous terrorist groups.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.882
And so all I've been doing since then

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:58.051
is trying to share my message, try

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.486
to share my experience,

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.921
and try to avoid making the same mistakes

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.490
that we made in 2014

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.325
when Hamas only got stronger

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:08.928
after we bombed them and killed thousands

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.232
and we struck them a decisive blow

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:12.899
where that's at least

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:13.800
what I thought at the time.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.335
But I only saw afterwards

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:16.603
that my own government

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:18.271
strengthened Hamas.

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:18.872
You know,

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:21.040
it's pretty intense to hear you say that.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:21.541
Look,

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.575
we know that

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:23.910
the majority of your country

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.713
right now is in favor of this war.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.181
They might not be in favor

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.115
of the current government,

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.683
but they definitely believe

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.552
that somehow, somewhere

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:34.888
Hamas has to be defeated.

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:35.288
You're saying

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.423
it can't be done militarily.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:38.958
Tell us.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:40.827
I guess the first question

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.395
really is to you.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:43.530
Are you out of step

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.565
with the majority of your country people

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:46.032
right now?

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:49.836
And are you able still to talk about,

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:52.005
you know, what you saw,

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:52.972
what you feel,

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:56.809
what you've learned, how you've changed,

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:00.313
Yeah.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.414
Well, I'll add,

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:03.650
you know, I'm not a I'm not a pacifist.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.617
I believe that Israel

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.686
has the responsibility to defend itself.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.520
Against Hamas.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.721
And, of course,

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.224
that includes military actions.

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.392
But I think that right now

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:13.860
in Israeli society,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.728
there's a debate going on

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:16.162
as to

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:18.164
whether this war that we're fighting

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.233
should be against Hamas

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:21.701
or it should it be against

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.336
the Palestinian people.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.171
And you have

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.140
members of this current government

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.007
who have said

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:29.609
since the horrific atrocities

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.910
that we saw in October,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.845
on October 7th against Israeli civilians

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.614
and the kidnaping of Israeli

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.649
civilians who are still being held

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.585
they have made it clear

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.653
that they aren't differentiating

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:43.489
between civilians and and Hamas.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.959
Even last night,

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.560
a senior member of the coalition

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.861
sorry, on Saturday night,

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.630
senior member of the coalition

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.931
of a member of the cabinet,

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:52.832
Bezalel Smotrich,

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.267
the finance minister

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.236
and the minister overseeing

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.170
the West Bank

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.339
and the Ministry of Defense said

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.939
that he doesn't

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:00.340
really see

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.007
a big difference

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:02.809
between the Palestinian Authority

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:03.910
and Hamas.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.745
The Arabs are the same Arabs.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.513
So there are many Israelis

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:08.481
who disagree with that.

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:09.816
And there are many Israelis

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.151
who are questioning the assumptions

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:13.586
and questioning

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:14.854
the lies that they've been told

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:15.955
for so many years.

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:18.024
And maybe it is a majority

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:19.826
who has believed the lies that

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.127
our government has told us.

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:23.696
But, you know, I

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.598
think that this is an opportunity for a

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.600
for partners

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.702
of mine in the Israeli peace camp.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:31.504
I saw

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:33.573
many of my.

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:35.575
Yes,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.611
I can hear you

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.849
Let me ask you another question, Ben.

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.551
Let me ask you another question.

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:49.355
Okay, Ben.

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.124
See, your line is dropped.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.692
We're going to redial you

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:54.327
and we're going to bring you back.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:56.062
We're going to bring you back

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:58.931
So standby and we'll bring you back.

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.634
I want to ask you again about the op ed,

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:02.135
the article

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:02.468
you wrote

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:03.269
for The New York Times

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:05.371
describing what it was like

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:05.705
you know,

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:08.041
in the deployment in 2014 and Gaza.

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:08.941
You wrote,

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:09.309
you know,

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.410
that some of your soldiers

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.978
were feeling doubts at that time.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.546
And then you wrote your own thoughts

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:15.748
on a piece of paper and you wrote this.

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:16.849
I wrote that

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.185
some members of my team had been tallying

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.987
the number of soldiers killed

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:21.788
and discussing

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:22.922
whether this operation

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.557
was worth the losses.

00:05:24.557 --> 00:05:25.992
I think it could be worth it.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:26.659
I wrote

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.861
as long as we decisively eliminate

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.063
the threat.

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:31.664
That's the lie they told us

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.766
and the lie that's being repeated today

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.802
that we can decisively eliminate

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:36.936
the threat of Hamas

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:40.173
through a military operation and see.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.241
How did you come to the conclusion that

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:42.942
you couldn't

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:50.350
Well, you know, one of the voices

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:52.819
that I've listened to over the years

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:53.853
and I've been convinced

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.988
by is not just not just the voices

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.023
of human rights activists,

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.591
but also the voice of the former

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:00.760
head of the Shin Bet, Amy Ayalon,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.329
who is the top counterterrorism expert

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:04.964
and for four

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:06.899
and a half years in the in the country.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.401
And he said this openly.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:08.701
He said,

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:12.405
the only way to decisively defeat

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:14.607
the terrorism that Hamas represents

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:16.376
is through creating an alternative

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.010
and creating hope.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.245
And that means working

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.080
towards a political solution.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.550
And our current government has been

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.786
fundamentally committed

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:28.688
to opposing a political solution

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:31.057
and to preventing the creation

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.291
of a Palestinian state

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:34.293
and preventing Palestinian independence.

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:35.361
So, therefore,

00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:36.362
I that's why

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:37.296
I realize that

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.465
military alone will not defeat Hamas.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:41.434
And that's why

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:42.502
I think that our government

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:44.670
needs to be changed immediately.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.172
So let me ask you then as well,

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:49.108
because you talk a lot in your favor

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:51.577
of what you saw in Gaza in 2014.

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:52.645
Tell me,

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:53.279
because earlier

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.847
you said you don't believe

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:56.215
that the soldiers distinguish

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:57.283
carefully enough

00:06:57.283 --> 00:07:00.720
between civilians and Hamas fighters.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.255
What did you

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:05.224
yourself experienced to make you say that

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:11.063
Well, you know,

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:11.364
in the

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:12.732
area that we went,

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.033
we were told that

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:15.301
all the civilians had fled.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:17.103
And that was true for the most part,

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.504
but it wasn't entirely true.

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:19.872
We did find civilians.

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:21.374
There was an entire family

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:22.508
in the second neighborhood

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:24.510
that my unit took over

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.979
was an entire family who stayed behind

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.381
And the soldiers,

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:29.348
you know, luckily

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:31.284
when they entered the house, they didn't

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.453
kill them through live fire.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.620
They gave them food and water.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.355
They guarded them for many days.

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:37.757
But when we pulled out,

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:38.825
the Air Force

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:40.059
flew overhead

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:42.495
and bombed the entire neighborhood.

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:43.229
And eight

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:44.363
members of that family were killed.

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:45.498
I learned this later.

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:46.899
So I've seen this with my own eyes

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:47.433
and I'm not.

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:48.534
And I'm listening today.

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:50.436
I'm listening to my own leaders,

00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:52.405
including who I'm mentioned,

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:53.272
Bezalel Smotrich,

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:54.006
who said he doesn't really

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:55.274
differentiate between

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.910
the Palestinian Authority,

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:58.778
which recognizes

00:07:58.778 --> 00:07:59.912
Israel wants to negotiate

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.681
with Israel and Hamas,

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:03.282
which is the terrorist organization

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:05.351
that carried out these atrocities.

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:06.819
The Arabs are the Arabs.

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.120
That's what he said on Saturday

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.755
night on Israeli television.

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:11.724
So it's hard for me to believe.

00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:12.258
I don't believe that

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:13.392
I've seen it with my own eyes.

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:14.594
I don't believe that Israel

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:16.195
is doing everything in its power

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:17.597
to prevent civilian casualties

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:18.464
based on the statements

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:19.932
of members of the Likud

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:21.667
and other members of the coalition.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.002
And I think that that's

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:25.171
a result of the fact that this government

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:25.738
doesn't view

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:27.139
the Palestinian people

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:28.441
as the future partners

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:29.976
for making peace with.

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:31.711
And they are just convinced that

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:33.312
overwhelming military power

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:35.348
is going to bring us safety and security

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.583
and this is a catastrophic mistake.

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:39.552
It's the same catastrophic mistake

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:41.487
that led us to the horrific

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:43.890
events of

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.324
October 7th And

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:46.993
we absolutely need to change that.

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:48.694
We need our partners abroad.

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.196
We need the US government also.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.498
I'm an Israeli, but I'm also an American.

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:54.901
And I expect that the American government

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:57.970
also not just pay lip service to the idea

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.172
of pursuing a political solution.

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:00.640
You know,

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.308
settlements are expanding

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:04.610
at an incredible rate.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.946
Settlers are illegally taking over land,

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:08.581
not even according to international law,

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.049
according to Israeli law.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:10.783
They're going out

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:12.451
and there are shooting at

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:13.553
Palestinian civilians

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.488
and there's no with impunity.

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:17.857
There's no real enforcement against them.

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:21.160
And so I think the our international

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:22.895
partners and allies

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:23.963
need to take a stance

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:25.932
on the side of the Israelis

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:26.299
who are

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:28.301
demanding political solution

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.269
and are demanding

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:32.905
differentiation, and that our government

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:36.642
makes sure not to harm and kill

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:38.711
innocent civilians.

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:39.745
Benzie, obviously,

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:40.780
they tell us endlessly

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.815
that they are doing their best,

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:44.083
but you can see

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:45.451
allies like the United States

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:46.652
are getting increasingly worried,

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:48.521
not to mention everybody on the ground

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:49.855
about the civilian toll.

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:53.125
There is there are stories

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:53.726
a lot

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:56.562
about dissent being quashed in Israel.

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:58.197
Are you not worried

00:09:58.197 --> 00:09:59.632
about what you're saying to me

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:01.434
publicly now,

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.603
being accused of siding with the enemy

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.403
and the kind of things

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:06.572
that are getting some Israelis in trouble

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:12.211
You know,

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:13.245
it's it's a risk

00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:13.646
that I have

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:14.013
to take

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:16.782
for the future of the people of Israel.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.718
You know,

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:20.653
siding with the enemy would be ironic

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:22.188
for my government to accuse me

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:24.457
after my government

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:24.857
in order

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:26.692
to prevent a Palestinian state

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.127
actually facilitated

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.061
the transfer of hundreds

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:31.063
of millions of dollars to Hamas

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:34.667
and preferred to bolster Hamas

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:37.770
and to de-legitimize

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:39.438
the Palestinian Authority

00:10:39.438 --> 00:10:40.172
and Palestinian

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:41.273
human rights organizations.

00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:41.874
They designated

00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:43.743
Palestinian human rights organizations

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.077
as a terrorist organization

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:46.746
that they categorized

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:47.546
Palestinian

00:10:47.546 --> 00:10:49.548
diplomatic initiatives as Palestinian,

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:51.150
as diplomatic terrorism.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.451
But Hamas,

00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:53.986
they facilitated the transfer

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.554
of hundreds of millions of dollars,

00:10:55.554 --> 00:10:56.822
and they also crushed

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.658
Palestinian hopes of independence,

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:02.161
which also fed the fuel of Hamas,

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.663
because that's what Hamas

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.064
is the enemy of peace.

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:09.301
And when our government committed itself

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:11.037
to preventing a peace process

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:12.505
and preventing negotiations,

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.540
they were actually helping Hamas.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.576
Ben Sanders, thank you very much.

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:18.811
And what you've just said

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:20.379
has been

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:23.349
confirmed by by very many people.

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:25.484
And obviously, we know that governments

00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:26.552
were encouraged

00:11:26.552 --> 00:11:30.723
to try to make Gaza and Hamas

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:31.691
sort of economically

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:32.224
okay,

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:35.394
thinking that the threat had subsided.

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:36.128
But clearly,

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:38.564
we know that it had not been easy.

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:39.799
Sanders Thank you very much.
