00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.633
A second day of

00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.401
talks in Doha

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.736
over a potential Gaza cease

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.437
fire and hostage release deal

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:05.338
have now ended.

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:07.140
CNN is told that technical teams

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.042
will continue to meet in the coming days,

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.110
until the main principals

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.312
meet again in Cairo next week.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.413
This comes as the Israeli

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:15.048
military orders evacuations

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:15.448
from parts

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.417
of the so-called humanitarian zone

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.785
in southern Gaza.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.520
Israel says that it has intelligence

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.488
that terrorist activity

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.889
is taking place there.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.224
Since October of last year,

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.192
more than 80% of the Gaza Strip

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.728
has been subjected to evacuation orders.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:29.262
That's according

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:31.598
to the UN's humanitarian agency.

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:32.399
Meanwhile,

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.433
a Palestinian village

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.367
in the occupied West

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.668
Bank has come under attack

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.404
by armed Israeli settlers.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.172
Nic Robertson is tracking this story

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:41.574
for us

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.576
with a car behind was set on

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.145
fire as the settlers came

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.913
into this hilltop village.

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.148
The man who owns the car,

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.082
I talking to him.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.483
His face is smashed up.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.252
He said he tried to confront the settlers

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:53.186
as they came in.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.320
He described a scenario

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.821
that they haven't

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.724
witnessed in this particular village

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.159
for a long time.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.527
And he said, never before

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:01.628
in fights that they ever seen.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:02.862
settlers coming

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:06.433
in, firing live rounds, firing tear gas.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.201
And when we arrived in the town here

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.769
a little earlier on in the day,

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:11.638
we were witness to the funeral

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:12.839
cortege of Rashid,

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.908
said a 23 year old young man

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.310
who was shot dead by the settlers.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.245
There was a lot of anger,

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.647
in that cortege

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:21.548
at the settlers,

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:22.949
at the Israeli government,

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:24.717
a lot of pain being felt.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:27.120
This was a young man of the village.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.855
He was being carried at shoulder

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:31.491
height, wrapped in a Palestinian flag.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.461
young men carrying him, older men

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.628
watching from the sides.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:36.262
And at the

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.998
at the funeral service in the graveyard

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.567
a little after the oration,

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.103
there was absolutely powerful,

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.839
and very clear in its message

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:47.907
that the people of this village

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.309
don't feel safe,

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:50.143
that they believe

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:50.944
that the settlers

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.113
were acting with the support

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.247
of the Israeli government.

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.015
They don't feel in this village

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:57.450
protected by,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.519
the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:01:59.886
In fact,

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:01.221
they allege

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.156
that the Israeli Defense Force was

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.191
was protecting the settlers now.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.693
the IDF did

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.228
stop a second attack

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.929
overnight getting into this village.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.798
The IDF and the Israeli police

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.100
are investigating the incident.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.236
So far, we've heard condemnation

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.371
coming from the US ambassador, Jack Lew,

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:18.838
saying it's

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:20.840
absolutely appalled by this

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.243
and these attacks must stop.

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:25.211
The defense minister of Israel,

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:28.214
Yoav Gallant, has put his condemnation

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:30.950
out as well, calling it radical violence.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.385
That does not,

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:35.321
he said, does not stand up to the values

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.256
of the State of Israel.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:37.290
Israel's interior

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.791
minister has condemned

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:39.425
it as well,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:43.229
calling it, violent nationalist riots.

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:44.497
Those were his words.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:45.798
So the condemnation

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:46.866
coming from Israeli

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.368
officials, even from right

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:51.237
wing leaders like Itamar Ben-Gvir,

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.338
although he did say that

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.275
the Israeli Defense Force should do more

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.643
to protect the settlers

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:59.045
and Israelis from the stone throwers

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.380
whom he calls terrorists

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.048
in his in these villages.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.383
That's his allegation.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.953
and he but he did say that this is

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:09.088
this is absolutely unacceptable.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:10.790
So this is strong condemnation

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.258
coming from Israeli officials,

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.194
but it just doesn't cut through

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.128
in these villages.

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:17.197
People here don't feel safe.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.231
and, and

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.566
and I think irrespective

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:20.166
of what they hear

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.401
from the Israeli government,

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.770
they will continue to believe

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.371
that events like last night,

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.073
the settlers coming in

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:28.308
unarmed in the village

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:30.076
when no one was expecting,

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:32.679
killing a young man, injuring others.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.847
They think these are coordinated

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:35.949
by the government.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.550
They're in cahoots together.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.052
This is deeply divisive,

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.320
particularly at the time of these

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.588
very sensitive

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:44.591
talks in Doha about the future of Gaza

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:45.658
going on.

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:48.161
Nic Robertson, CNN, Jeet

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.529
and the occupied West Bank.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.030
All right.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.764
Joining us now

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.099
from Washington, DC is our chief

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.834
national security correspondent,

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.703
Alex Marquardt. Alex, good to see you.

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:58.137
Let's circle back to the cease fire.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:58.538
Talk to me.

00:03:58.538 --> 00:03:59.539
What what more do we know

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.641
about how these talks ended?

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:04.644
And also what progress was made, if any.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.146
Well, they they ended on a positive note.

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:08.548
And the fact that we know

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:09.249
that more meetings

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.049
are going to be happening

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.184
in the coming days.

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.518
That that is positive.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.854
But by no means are we on the cusp

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:17.123
of any kind of imminent deal renewal

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:18.424
that is important.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:19.492
These main mediators.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:20.560
So the heads of intelligence

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.761
for the Egypt, for Egypt

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.096
and the US, as well as the Katari

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:23.529
prime minister,

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:24.764
they went into these talks

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.799
with the Israelis, with Hamas,

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.635
trying to bridge some,

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.536
some pretty significant gaps.

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:31.738
And what we heard today

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:33.273
from those three mediating countries

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.140
in a joint statement,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.708
was that they made progress

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.043
by putting forward

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:38.645
what they're calling a bridging proposal,

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:39.746
essentially a document

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:42.448
that takes all of the outstanding issues

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:42.849
and tries

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.384
to bring the two sides

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:45.518
closer together in terms

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:46.986
of how those issues

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:48.254
will not only be solved,

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:50.390
but how they will be implemented.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.324
So what we're told

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.792
is that in the coming days,

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.327
now that these main talks

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.862
are over in Doha

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:56.763
at a lower level,

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:57.897
experts on what are called

00:04:57.897 --> 00:05:00.099
technical teams will get together

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.301
to essentially cross

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.168
the T's, dot

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:03.536
the I's and really work

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.505
towards a final agreement.

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.440
And then towards the end of next week,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.741
the main players again

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.009
will get back together

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.678
in the Egyptian capital, Cairo.

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:13.179
So we're talking about the CIA director,

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:13.746
Bill Burns,

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.448
the Egyptian intelligence director,

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:17.817
Abbas Kamel, the Qatari prime minister,

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:20.520
the Israeli head of the Mossad

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.323
intelligence agency, and Hamas.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.458
And so these are encouraging signs.

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:27.060
But no one that I've spoken to,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.261
Hal, is ready to say that

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.262
this is certainly something

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:30.196
that is going to happen.

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:30.730
I want to read you

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.298
part of the joint statement

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:32.799
that was released

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:33.900
just a short time ago

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.401
from the three mediating countries,

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:35.968
that says

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:37.870
it is time to release the hostages

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.472
and detainees,

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:41.274
begin the cease fire, and implement

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:42.175
this agreement.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.610
The path is now set for that outcome.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.346
Saving lives, bringing relief

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.781
to the people of Gaza and de-escalate

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.084
the escalating regional tensions.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:52.218
One more note, Rachel.

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:53.119
This comes

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:56.255
as the prospect of a major strike

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:57.724
or major strikes

00:05:57.724 --> 00:05:58.758
from Hezbollah

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:01.661
and Iran could happen against Israel.

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:03.162
Retaliatory strikes.

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:05.331
And so what the cease fire talks

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.333
those involved are hoping to

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.435
accomplish is essentially to push those

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:11.971
those potential strikes away to

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.373
to keep them at bay.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:13.873
And in fact,

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.842
the Qatari prime minister has reached out

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:17.643
to the Iranian foreign minister

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:19.912
not once, but twice in the past two days

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:21.748
to keep him abreast of the talks

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:23.716
and to say that essentially

00:06:23.716 --> 00:06:25.017
that they need to give these

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:25.752
these cease fire

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:27.353
discussions a chance

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:29.655
and that any kind of escalatory,

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.858
any kind of escalatory action,

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:34.494
a major strike could derail the prospect

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:35.428
for peace in Gaza.

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:36.996
Rachel and Alex,

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:38.030
I mean, to that end,

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.898
Israel is saying

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.366
and telling its counterparts

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.367
in the UK and France

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:43.436
that it expects their nations,

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:44.937
the UK and France, to attack

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:47.206
Iran if Iran strikes Israel.

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:47.507
Why?

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:48.741
I mean, where do those nations

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.375
stand on that?

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:50.810
But also, where is the U.S.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.178
stand on this?

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:52.478
Well,

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:54.280
the US is essentially helping

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.281
coordinate that effort.

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:56.416
And let's remind our viewers

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.017
why we expect this to happen.

00:06:58.017 --> 00:06:59.585
And several weeks ago,

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.387
there were a pair of strikes

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:04.424
that Israel is either publicly behind

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.591
or is believed to have been behind.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:07.427
One was against a major figure

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.828
in the Hezbollah militant group

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:09.629
in Lebanon, Forward

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:11.364
Shakur, who was killed in an airstrike

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:12.965
in southern Beirut by Israel.

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:13.833
The next day,

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:14.734
there was an operation

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.636
that took out the top political leader

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:19.038
for Hamas in the Iranian capital.

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:20.273
Israel did not admit

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.140
that they carried that out,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.176
but it is widely believed that they did.

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:24.610
And so now we're in a situation

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.245
where it is believed that Hezbollah

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:28.781
and or Iran could respond.

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:29.982
Now, it's been several weeks.

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:31.517
So we've been waiting to see

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:32.485
every single day

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.020
whether this is going to happen.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.887
In the meantime,

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:36.856
the US has been assuring Israel

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.958
that it will come to its defense.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.159
it is expected that the Brits

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:40.626
and the French

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:42.795
would also help in that defense.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.096
And the major reasons

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:45.731
are not just because

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:47.066
they want to protect Israel.

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:48.901
But if there were major damage

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.336
and a lot of deaths in Israel

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:51.504
as a result of those strikes,

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:52.972
we could expect the situation

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:53.873
to really escalate

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:56.008
and potentially spiral out of control.

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:58.544
So the US, and potentially

00:07:58.544 --> 00:07:59.879
with the Brits

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:00.480
and the French

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.282
are really trying to avoid that scenario.

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:06.052
but right now we are waiting and seeing

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:08.354
whether Hezbollah and Iran

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:10.223
could carry out those kinds of strikes.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:11.757
Well, we continue to watch.

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:12.658
Alex Marquardt,

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:13.659
thank you for your reporting
