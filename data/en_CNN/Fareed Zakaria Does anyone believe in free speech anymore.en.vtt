00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:01.543
Hamas has terrorist

00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:03.336
attacks against Israel, and Israel's

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:04.963
military actions in Gaza

00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:05.588
have unleashed

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:07.048
a firestorm of controversy

00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:09.092
in the United States and Europe.

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.261
Watching it all, I do wonder.

00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:12.929
Does anyone believe

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.432
in free speech anymore?

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:16.349
Now to note,

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.767
I have strongly condemned

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.686
the attacks of October 7th

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.730
and I think those that praise Hamas

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.689
in any way

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.025
are blind to the reality that it has been

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.109
the principal opponent

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.610
of a two state solution

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.946
to the Israeli-Palestinian question.

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:31.781
But the question to grapple

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.825
with is how to handle views

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.327
that either side finds deeply offensive.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.247
And, of course, speech and assembly

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.167
are not the same as physical intimidation

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:43.460
and harassment

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.421
which prevent civil discourse.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.589
Until very recently,

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.339
most concerns

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:49.841
about free speech on college

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.426
campuses were related

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.011
to conservative speakers

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.054
from Ben Shapiro

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.597
to Condoleezza Rice

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.682
being protested or disinvited.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.059
Conservative state

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.394
legislator has introduced dozens of laws

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.563
to protect campus free speech.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.606
In 2021,

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:06.608
House Republicans started a campus

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.318
free speech caucus

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:08.902
to protect

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.904
free expression and free association

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.364
in January 2021.

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:14.282
Florida Governor

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:15.658
Ron DeSantis said

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.994
the most important legislative issue

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:18.703
to get right

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:19.162
in the next

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.246
couple of years

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.247
was the protection

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.500
of controversial speech.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.959
Not anymore.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:25.794
Late last month,

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.629
DeSantis reversed course,

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:29.005
directing Florida State

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:30.632
University's chancellor

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:31.716
to close down

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.426
campus chapters of Students

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.386
for Justice and Palestine.

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:36.679
DeSantis accused the group

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.015
of giving material support to terrorism.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.557
Though,

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:40.558
as far as I can tell,

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.519
these groups have only organized protests

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:43.686
and rallies,

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:44.437
as the GOP

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.605
presidential candidate

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.774
Vivek Ramaswamy has pointed out.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:48.900
Courts have made clear

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.528
that verbal support for extremist groups

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:52.779
is very different

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.031
and constitutionally protected

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:57.659
from sending money, material or arms

00:01:58.868 --> 00:01:59.911
Other conservatives have

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.663
tried to publicly identify

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:03.039
and shame students

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.457
belonging to groups

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.543
that voiced support for Hamas.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:07.585
A hedge fund manager

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.087
proposed to circulate

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.588
lists of these students

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:12.757
to ensure that they don't get jobs.

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:14.134
Many donors have demanded

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.009
that universities

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.302
issue statements

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.595
either condemning Hamas

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:18.972
or supporting Israel

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.141
Some even insisting that certain rallies

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.184
and speakers be banned.

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:23.852
Many college

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:25.812
presidents issued follow up statements

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.730
when their original responses

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.774
were not seen as sufficiently strong

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:30.525
and said

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:31.568
their support of Israel

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.862
or denunciation of Hamas.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.155
This is all a far cry

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.407
from where universities used to be

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:41.202
like that in 1967

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:42.704
in the midst of the passions

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.038
of the Vietnam War

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:45.790
and the civil rights movement.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.792
A report by a University of Chicago

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:48.668
committee chaired

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.545
by the eminent legal scholar

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:53.256
Harry Calvin, eloquently argued that

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.008
the mission of the university

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:58.553
could not be fulfilled if the institution

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.430
formally took positions

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.389
on controversial

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.391
political issues of the day.

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:05.518
The committee wrote a university.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.520
If it's to be true to its faith,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.355
an intellectual inquiry

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.691
must embrace, be hospitable to

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.234
and encourage

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.236
the widest diversity of views

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.155
within its own community.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:18.573
It is a community,

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.408
but only for the limited,

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:21.242
albeit great

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.578
purposes of teaching and research.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:24.787
It is not a club.

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:26.831
It is not a trade association.

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.291
It is not a lobby.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:29.500
Simply put,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.377
the university is the home

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.213
and sponsor of critics.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.256
It is not itself the critic.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.717
The basic argument for free speech

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.219
espoused by the Calvin report

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.137
is that it is better to hear those

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.348
you violently disagree with

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.475
than to ban them or silence them.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.602
That way, debate happens out in the open

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.438
points a match with counterpoints.

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:51.981
The alternative is to drive

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.441
discourse into the shadows

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.610
and gutters of political life

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.861
where it festers

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.905
turns into conspiracy theories

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.740
and often erupts into violence.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:03.910
Growing up in India, I read

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.535
with wonder

00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:06.246
about the United States's commitment

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.330
to freedom of speech,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.250
which was so strong that in 1977

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:12.794
a court ruled that a group of Nazis

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:14.254
should be allowed to march

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.297
in Skokie, Illinois or Chicago.

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:17.257
Suburb.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.466
In the 1970s,

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.884
the Harvard Crimson ran

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.010
editorials

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.471
praising Pol Pot's takeover in Cambodia.

00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:26.057
I went to college in the early eighties,

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:26.474
an area

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:26.766
in which

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:27.892
it was not unusual

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.144
to hear incendiary views on campus

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:31.271
from communist

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.398
revolutionaries to the Nobel Prize

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.358
winning scientist William Shockley,

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:36.859
who made crude arguments

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:38.444
about the racial inferiority

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.613
of black people in this century.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.365
I recall very few colleges

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.409
making official statements

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.035
about the Iraq war

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:48.079
or even the terrorist attacks of Nine 11.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:51.165
We are now in a different world.

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:52.000
In recent years,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.376
the pressure on universities

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.962
to take political positions has grown.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.130
A turning point

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.547
might have been

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.341
the murder of George Floyd last night,

00:05:00.883 --> 00:05:02.719
when many institutions decided

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.721
to demonstrate their sensitivity.

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.431
An issue statements.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.099
Once they took a stand on one

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.017
political issue,

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.185
it is perfectly understandable

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:11.769
that they have been

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:12.979
also asked to condemn

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.939
Hamas's attack last month.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.733
But where will it end?

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.609
A Pandora's box has been opened

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:20.611
with every major political event.

00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:22.238
University administrators

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:23.531
will have to decide

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:26.034
whether to condemn or support it.

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.827
Will they find some standard

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.078
by which they can explain

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:31.247
why they denounced one terrorist attack

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.499
or human rights abuse, but not another

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:35.835
I'm not sure

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:36.252
what it

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:38.129
signifies that many of us

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.255
find the embrace

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:40.214
of free speech

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:41.466
outlined in the Calvin

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:44.677
report to be too cold in its neutrality.

00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:47.847
We want our institutions to endorse

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.849
our own fashions and points of view.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.352
But can they do that

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.978
in a diverse society?

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:55.438
In which people disagree

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.566
so strongly on so much?

00:05:58.566 --> 00:05:59.233
I fear that

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.736
far from bringing us together,

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.654
the path we are on will drive us

00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:04.489
further apart.
