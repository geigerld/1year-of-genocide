00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.501
Israel's security cabinet

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.969
now authorizing Prime Minister

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.037
Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.572
as well as Defense Minister Yoav

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.173
go on to decide on the country's

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.808
response to yesterday's deadly

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.977
rocket attack in the Golan Heights.

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:11.344
Already,

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.246
the Israeli military say

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:13.913
they have struck

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.315
multiple Hezbollah

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.784
targets inside Lebanon overnight

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.319
and now the region

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.954
and the world waits to see

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:23.423
whether this will escalate further.

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:24.791
With us now, Jeremy Diamond,

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:25.658
who's on the scene

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:26.559
in the Golan Heights,

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.128
and Ben Wedeman in the Lebanese

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:29.562
capital of Beirut.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.897
Dami, let's start first with you.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.198
We know the international community

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.401
is urging restraint on both sides.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.535
What are Israeli

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.872
leaders saying right now?

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.273
Well, Jessica, there's no question that

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:42.342
there is a flurry of diplomatic activity

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:42.809
right now

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.011
trying to de-escalate these tensions,

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:46.446
trying to ensure

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.181
that the Israeli response to

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.283
what they say was a Hezbollah strike

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.718
right here behind me

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.385
on this soccer

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.388
field will be a limited response.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.624
Israeli officials have not indicated yet

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.726
how limited that response will be,

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:00.693
but they have made clear

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.095
that there will be a response,

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:03.263
that there will be a price

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:06.266
to pay for this attack that killed 12

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.535
children in this community

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.570
of Majdal Shams.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.472
The Israeli security

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:13.940
cabinet met this evening once

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.474
Prime Minister

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.476
Netanyahu returned to Israel

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:17.544
from the United States

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:18.745
authorizing him

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.747
and the defense minister, Yoav Gallant,

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.650
to try to move forward with a strike

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.417
at a time

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.753
and with a scope of their choosing.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.521
So remains to be seen

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:29.255
how quickly

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.224
that will actually come together.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:33.660
But right now this is a community

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.328
that not only is anticipating

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.564
the possibility of that Israeli response

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.466
waiting to see what will unfold

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.534
from the events that have happened here,

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:42.669
but it is also very much

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.370
still a community in mourning.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.506
It is just after midnight

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.841
here in Majdal Shams.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.442
And you can see behind me

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.376
that there are, you know,

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.911
several dozen teenagers

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.481
who have come here to just sit together,

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.349
to speak to to mourn

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:59.119
quietly and to take in

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.653
all that has happened

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.423
over the course of these last two days.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:04.090
Flowers

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.191
have now been set up

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.027
where that crater still stands.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.896
Lights have also been put up.

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:11.731
This is a very small, tight knit

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.266
Syrian Druze community

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.735
and they are definitely all feeling

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.070
the tremendous impact

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.238
of what has happened,

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:18.938
an attack

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:20.340
that has shaken

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.375
this community to its core

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:25.245
and in many ways shattered its very soul.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:26.613
Jessica Hmm.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:27.413
Jeremy Diamond

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:28.081
All right, Thanks

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.682
so much for that reporting.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.084
And Ben, this

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.685
this says the Lebanese government

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.354
in a tenuous spot.

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:38.791
How are they responding?

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:39.626
Yes, the Lebanese

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:40.226
government

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.729
is this really underscores, Jessica,

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.632
just how weak the Lebanese government

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.734
is in trying to determine

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.335
the course of events.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.605
Hezbollah is has in terms

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:53.973
of military strength,

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:57.911
has far more firepower than the Lebanese

00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.012
army itself.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.747
Now, we spoke today

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:01.881
to the caretaker

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.516
Lebanese foreign minister,

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.418
Abdullah Abo Habib,

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:06.853
who made it clear that

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.922
the worry of the Lebanese government

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.524
is that if Israel attacks

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.527
Lebanon and Hezbollah in particular,

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.063
that it could easily spiral

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:22.402
into a regional war.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:23.336
You know,

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.672
not because of conviction,

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:28.141
but because of any attack on our country.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:31.644
We support Hezbollah as the art,

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.079
but it's not going to be Hezbollah

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.480
alone, as I mentioned.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.116
Iran's foreign minister said yesterday

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:39.185
it will be Hezbollah alone.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:40.520
And you have the houses of

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.489
the Iraqi militias. You have

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.092
militias in Syria are not serious,

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:52.098
but certainly have got the militias.

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:52.899
And, of course,

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:53.967
the concern here

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.969
is that if that happens,

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:56.469
life,

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:57.937
which at the moment

00:03:57.937 --> 00:04:01.441
is actually going on very much normally

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:04.177
to my right, there is a disco party.

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:06.012
It's Sunday evening,

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:08.581
but people are enjoying

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.184
the cool evening temperatures.

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.885
A little while ago,

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:15.888
we heard some very loud bangs rushed out,

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.623
wondering

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:19.292
if this was the much anticipated

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:20.560
Israeli attack.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.129
No, it was actually fireworks

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.797
just above our head.

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.132
Nonetheless,

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.801
several airlines have either delayed

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.671
or canceled flights into Beirut in fear

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:34.007
of an imminent Israeli attack.

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:36.142
And the US embassy today

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:39.579
reissued a statement strongly urging U.S.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.915
nationals to reconsider travel

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:43.750
to Lebanon.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.052
Now, I was at the airport today.

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.720
I arrived in Beirut

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.490
and what I saw was there was a very long

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.058
line of people

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:54.227
waiting to enter the country.

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:57.230
Many of those from the Lebanese diaspora,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.767
many of them with American passports

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:02.035
Jessica. All right.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:02.902
Ben Wedeman for us

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:04.203
live in Beirut tonight.

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:05.972
Thank you so much for that reporting.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.040
I first want to ask

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.174
just your reaction

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:10.109
to this attack on the Golan Heights

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:11.210
and what we've seen from

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.180
Israel in response so far.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.214
I mean, yet another heinous

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:17.250
attack by an Iranian proxy.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.550
Right.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.818
I mean, 12

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:19.652
children

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:22.622
and teenagers killed on a soccer field,

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:23.523
just barbaric.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:24.223
And yet another

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:25.892
the deadliest attack

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:28.561
on Israel since October 7th.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:30.163
So it's yet again,

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:34.200
I mean, we've seen it's 5000 attacks

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.368
now from Hezbollah

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:38.071
into Israel since October 8th.

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.539
So this is just an ongoing

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.940
and these are just ongoing attacks,

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.343
this one particularly heinous.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:44.444
And so so, Jessica,

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:48.181
I think what this shows us is now of Iran

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:52.118
and its continued attack on our allies,

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:54.187
but also on democracy

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:55.288
in the United States.

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:57.323
As the foreign minister

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:58.157
and one of the foreign ministers

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:00.660
recently said from Hezbollah

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.628
said, Israel is merely a tool,

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:03.529
the main war.

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.165
The real war is with America.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.900
And I think that's important context

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.302
that you bring up, that Hezbollah

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:10.536
has been firing rockets

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:11.771
into Israel

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:13.406
at the northern border for months

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:14.841
now, that this has been ongoing,

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:16.242
it has been a deep concern,

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:17.410
especially from U.S.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.580
officials, that this particular region

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.614
could escalate, that

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:23.616
that conflict could escalate.

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:25.952
What do you think is the appropriate U.S.

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:30.456
response to the current escalation?

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:31.924
I think the United States, as it did

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:32.925
today, has to continue to work

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:33.626
very closely

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:37.063
with with Israel and in deciding

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:39.265
what's the appropriate response here.

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:40.433
So we'll leave it to them

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.268
to work that through.

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:43.436
But the bottom line is,

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:45.405
when there is an attack on a nation,

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.874
an attack on Israel yet again,

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:48.975
with, of course,

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:50.042
the loss of 12,

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:52.578
then 40, more than 40 wounded,

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:53.813
you realize that it does

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.281
merit a response.

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:56.349
So we'll leave it to them

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.885
to work together on that response.

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:00.453
But the bigger point here

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:01.020
is whether you're

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.555
talking about the Houthis

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:03.790
and their attack on Israel,

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.492
but also on the United States, on our

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:09.395
on our service members, other Iranian

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:12.398
backed proxies in Iraq and Syria,

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.333
continuing to attack the United States

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:16.602
and our service members around the world.

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.205
What you see here is terror,

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.273
you know, at its worst.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.974
And that's really what Hamas

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:23.810
and Hezbollah and all and Palestine,

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.878
Islamic Jihad and others and the Houthis.

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:26.712
That's what this is about.

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:27.246
It's an attack

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:28.714
not just on Israel, but an attack

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:30.616
on democracy.

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:32.251
Last night, I spoke with the

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:33.119
former Israeli prime

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.120
minister, Naftali Bennett.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.922
He told us the following.

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:37.256
I'll play this clip.

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:37.857
With respect

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:38.424
to Lebanon's

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.293
responsibility for Hezbollah,

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.761
here's what he said.

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:44.130
We are not going to tweezer our way

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.867
through and look for Hezbollah amid

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:48.534
Lebanon.

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:50.069
Hezbollah is part of the government.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.305
Hezbollah is part of Lebanon.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.474
And what Lebanon needs to do

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.142
tonight is move

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.912
all of Hezbollah away from the border,

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.982
all the way up to the river of Litani

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.785
and stop everything they're doing.

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:08.688
That is the only way they can prevent

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:11.390
an all out war.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.091
And so, Congressman,

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:13.493
what is your response to that?

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.060
Again,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.195
kind of helping people understand that

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:18.030
Hezbollah operates within Lebanon?

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.334
There's also a Lebanese government.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:21.734
Right.

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:26.172
And the Hezbollah in southern Lebanon,

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.908
right on the border of Israel.

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:31.143
After the attack of October 7th,

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:33.513
Israelis pulled back from the border

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:34.180
after the attack

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.348
started from Hezbollah

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.749
in southern Lebanon.

00:08:36.749 --> 00:08:39.118
More than 80,000 have been displaced.

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:40.653
They haven't been able to go home

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.121
since October 7th. Right.

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:42.855
They've left their homes

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.423
in the northern part of Israel,

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:45.625
right on the border of Lebanon

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.526
because of the attacks

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:47.994
coming in from Hezbollah.

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:49.662
And people want to go home. Right.

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:51.030
And many of them want to go home.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.832
School is starting in a few weeks

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.467
for the students there in Israel.

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:55.034
They haven't.

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:56.702
They've been displaced from.

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:58.604
And so that's a big issue

00:08:58.604 --> 00:08:59.639
in Israel right now.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:00.873
How do we get them home?

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:01.674
And Hezbollah

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:02.942
has not pulled back

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:04.510
from from that border.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.145
And we see just the attacks

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:06.812
going, as I mentioned,

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:08.848
have been 5000 of them

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:10.182
yesterday, being one of the

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:11.617
being the deadliest.

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:12.652
But the bottom line is

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:14.086
this has been going on

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:15.821
nearly every day, rockets

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:18.624
being fired from Lebanon, from Hezbollah

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:20.026
into Israel.
