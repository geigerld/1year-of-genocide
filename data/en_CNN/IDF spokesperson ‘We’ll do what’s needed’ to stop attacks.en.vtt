00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.900
OUTFRONT now,

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.901
major Israeli

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.570
Major Ben Wall houses

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.938
the Israel Defense Forces.

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:06.539
Spokesperson A major,

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:07.907
thank you so much for joining us,

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:08.575
first of all.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.042
What's the

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:12.779
latest on the ground right now?

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:13.847
Thank you, Wolf.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:14.581
The situation

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.083
now is that we have secured the South.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.853
We no longer have hundreds of terrorists

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.821
streaming across the border

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.524
trying to kill our civilians.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.792
We still have forces

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.794
that are going house by house,

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.662
making sure that none of them are left.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.231
Hundreds streamed across the border.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.332
Two days ago,

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.133
entered into more

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.868
than 20 towns and cities.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.770
So our forces are still going house

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.337
by house

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.472
to make sure that none of them are left.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:41.808
At the same time, as your viewers know,

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:42.842
we are undergoing

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.210
continuous rocket fire

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.379
into our cities, indiscriminate.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.381
And that's the current situation.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.382
So is it true

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.751
that Israel is now in full control

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:55.255
of all of its land at this hour?

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.389
Yes, that is correct.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:57.724
We have fortified the border

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.325
fence on Gaza as well.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.227
We have strained forces down there

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.796
and they are working to make sure

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:06.066
that the entire south is safe and secure.

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:07.434
Prime Minister Netanyahu,

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:08.935
as you well know, said today

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.337
that the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza,

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.540
in his words, are only the beginning.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.942
Are we looking right now at a ground war

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:18.445
here as well?

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.380
Well, Hamas's attacks are continuing.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.482
The rocket fire is continuous.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.917
I'm sitting here in Tel Aviv

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.251
at my house in Tel Aviv.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.153
My children are continuously going

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:28.955
from upstairs down to the basement

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.323
to the bomb shelter.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:32.492
Sirens all throughout Israel.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:33.960
So the IDF has been directed

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.829
by the government to stop those attacks.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:36.362
And we'll do

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.363
what's needed in order

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.465
to stop those attacks

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:39.899
and make sure that Hamas doesn't

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.035
have the capability to renew them.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:43.436
So you're clearly leaving open

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.070
the possibility

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.340
of a major Israeli ground invasion into

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.009
Gaza to deal with that.

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:50.643
The IDF

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:51.978
has many capabilities

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:53.713
and we are going to deploy them all

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:54.247
in order

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.748
to stop Hamas's ability

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.751
to keep attacking our civilians.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.020
As you know, major Hamas is saying

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.655
it will start executing

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:03.990
the civilian hostages

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.693
taken from Israel into Gaza

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.161
and broadcasting it

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.529
if Israel targets

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.798
people in Gaza without warning.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.733
Will that change Israel's response

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.568
at all?

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:17.370
Well, that shouldn't surprise anyone.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.106
Hamas's war here is a war on civilians.

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.542
It started with a massacre of women,

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:25.545
children, elderly, entire families.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:28.181
They kidnaped tens of

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.582
families and people

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.552
and young people, toddlers, elderly women

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:33.753
are there continuously

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.788
firing rockets at our civilians.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:36.789
And at the same time,

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.791
they're hiding behind their civilians

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:39.559
in Gaza

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.161
to try and avoid attack from us

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.530
and cause more civilian casualties.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.564
So it's not surprising

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:45.932
that they would say something like that.

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.667
And our priority is to make sure

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:48.968
that Hamas cannot carry

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:49.802
any of that out

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:52.505
and cannot continue attacking us.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.773
Do you believe, Major,

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.308
that some of the hostages

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:58.378
may already be dead?

00:02:58.444 --> 00:02:59.145
I don't have the

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.613
information to give you that. Now.

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:02.949
It's also for operational reasons.

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.551
But obviously, our highest priority

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.286
is to protect our people at home

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.521
and also protect those people in Gaza.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:08.955
And that's

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.590
what our forces are doing in the land,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.292
sea and air.

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:13.059
Major Ben Wall,

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.060
House of the Israeli

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.562
Defense Force and spokesperson,

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:16.863
thanks very much for joining us.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.164
Thank you.

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:19.866
And the war has tragically hit

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.302
very close to home for my next guest,

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:22.902
a man

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.170
who has been on our network

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.838
many times over the years.

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:27.507
Mark is the former U.S.

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.909
ambassador to Morocco, former White House

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.711
adviser on Middle East policy.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.178
As well,

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:33.813
he just announced the death

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:35.081
of his nephew,

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.183
Elie Ginsburg, a lieutenant commander

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:38.484
for Israel.

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:39.118
Ambassador,

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:40.420
thanks so much for joining us.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.487
You and I have known each other

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:42.355
for many years.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:45.158
We are so, so sorry for the loss.

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.659
This your loss this evening.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:47.860
What do you know so far

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.231
about what happened to your nephew?

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:52.298
Well, Elie

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.000
was a lieutenant commander

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.436
and a Navy SEAL in Israel,

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:59.038
and he had just retired from serving

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:00.840
as an operational commander

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.308
for Mossad three weeks ago

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.643
and was called up

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:06.479
to lead his unit into Kibbutz

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.015
Rai, where the music festival

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:12.285
was taking place to rescue hostages

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:16.256
that were being held by Hamas.

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:19.759
And Brian, one of the efforts to

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.661
break down

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:24.130
one of the apartment buildings.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.733
He was shot and killed

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:29.902
by a Hamas terrorist.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.471
I found that out for my sister

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:32.839
in law this morning.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:34.907
I'm here in Morocco doing earth

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:36.109
relief work.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:36.909
So it's had

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.412
been a terrible day for my family and I.

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.748
Our hearts go out to you, of course.

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:42.482
Give us a little bit

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.817
more about your nephew, Ambassador.

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:47.320
What was he like?

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.855
Oh, Elie.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:49.889
He was.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:50.356
He was the

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:51.591
oldest of my three

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:53.559
nephews who was raised on a kibbutz

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.827
in this government.

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:55.762
My brother Mike

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:58.164
had been killed up there in 2006,

00:04:58.164 --> 00:05:01.734
so Elie had lost his father to Hezbollah

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.603
and a Hezbollah attack in the war.

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:05.738
And I know he was raised there,

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:08.174
someone dedicated to Israel's

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:09.442
military prowess.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:11.744
He I mean, the fact that he became

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.179
not only a Navy SEAL,

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:14.480
but also

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.682
the lieutenant commander

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:17.116
for the Navy SEALs

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:19.786
and then trained in the United States

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:20.620
at the U.S.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.721
Naval Academy.

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:22.989
And

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.023
in order to

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:27.493
develop his his skills to train Israelis

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:30.596
and in special commando operations.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.399
I mean, he just worked in the last year.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.101
Right. Pretty secret, Wolf.

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:36.669
But for those of us

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.672
who and I particularly was his

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:42.742
I guess, substitute father,

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.444
we were so proud of him.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:47.447
He leaves a beautiful wife in a kibbutz

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:49.215
and four children,

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:50.950
as well as two brothers

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.785
and my sister in law.

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:54.120
And we're all morning

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.321
I can't make it,

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:57.557
unfortunately, to the funeral tomorrow

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:58.925
because the flights

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.727
are extraordinarily hard.

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:01.894
But I'll make it to Israel

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:04.397
to be with my family as soon as I can.

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:05.298
And when you do, please

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:06.966
pass along our deepest,

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:09.469
deepest condolences to your family.

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.204
As you know, the Israeli prime minister,

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.039
Benjamin Netanyahu, has warned

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.141
there will be difficult days ahead

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.310
and that Israel will go on offense

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.378
against Hamas.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.180
In his words, like never before.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.049
What do you think that looks like

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:23.983
specifically over

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:27.320
the next 24 to 48 hours?

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.188
Well, I've I've listened to both you

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:29.789
and I know

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.457
I've spent an enormous amount of time

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:33.693
in Israel as well as in Gaza.

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:36.796
I've watched the successive efforts

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:39.999
by Israel to try to quell Hamas.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:42.635
But I'll tell you, Wolf, my biggest fear,

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:43.569
based on the fact

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.204
that my family lives

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:46.606
up on Kibbutz Maccabi,

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:48.741
I'm on the Lebanese border,

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:52.145
is that diabolically, given my own view

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:55.114
and hatred for Hezbollah and Hamas,

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:56.449
it's very conceivable

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:57.784
that part of the scheme here

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:59.552
directed by Iran

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:00.887
is to exhaust Israel's

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:03.423
supply of Iron Dome missiles,

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.490
because

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.025
Hezbollah, as you well know,

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:07.960
Wolf, and you're an expert on this,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.931
if if Hamas fire 2000 to 3000 missiles

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:15.568
at Israel in a matter of two days, Hamas,

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:18.971
Hezbollah has 150,000 guided missiles

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:21.007
and no Iron Dome system

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:22.442
that Israel currently has

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.077
and is already badly depleted

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:28.347
can withstand that type of attack.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.950
It's a serious, very serious situation,

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.151
as I continue

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:32.618
to say,

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:33.453
and I hope I'm wrong,

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.822
this war is only just beginning.

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:36.956
Ambassador Mark Ginsberg,

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.291
our deepest, deepest condolences

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.559
to you and your family.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:40.927
Thank you very much for joining us.
