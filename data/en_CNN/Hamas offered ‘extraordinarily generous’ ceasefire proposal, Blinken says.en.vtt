President Biden

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:06.291 size:72% position:36% line:71%
is again

00:00:06.291 --> 00:00:08.208 line:71%
applying pressure on Israel over

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.625 line:71%
its actions in Gaza.

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:10.750 line:71%
The president spoke with Israeli

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.583 line:71%
Prime Minister Benjamin

00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:13.083 line:71%
Netanyahu over the weekend.

00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:13.625 size:84% position:42% line:71%
The White House

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:15.291 position:59% line:71%
said Biden made it clear that the U.S.

00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:16.250 size:88% position:44% line:71%
would not support

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.291 line:71%
a potential invasion of Rafah

00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:19.833 line:71%
without an explicit plan

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:20.833 line:71%
to protect civilians.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:21.625 size:88% position:44% line:71%
But a source says

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:23.166 line:71%
the primary focus of the call

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.583 position:61% line:71%
was a potential hostage deal with Hamas.

00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:26.541 line:71%
It comes after the group

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:28.416 line:71%
released a video of two hostages

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:30.583 position:56% line:71%
on Saturday on the left as Israeli

Israeli Keith Segal.

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:35.750 size:81% position:41% line:71%
In the video,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.916 line:71%
Segal pleaded for Israel

00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:39.000 position:58% line:71%
to negotiate a hostage release deal

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.208 size:81% position:41% line:71%
that appeared

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:42.250 position:59% line:71%
he he was speaking under some duress.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.666 size:88% position:44% line:71%
CNN cannot verify

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.875 position:56% line:71%
where or when the video was shot.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:46.375 size:75% position:38% line:71%
Meanwhile,

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:47.791 position:56% line:71%
the secretary of state is in Saudi

00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:48.958 size:88% position:44% line:71%
Arabia right now.

00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.125 position:56% line:71%
As Hamas is considering a new deal

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:52.625 position:58% line:71%
calling for the release of hostages

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:54.708 position:56% line:71%
held since October 7th in exchange

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:56.791 position:58% line:71%
for a pause in the fighting in Gaza.

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:57.541 size:81% position:41% line:71%
This morning,

00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:58.458 size:88% position:44% line:71%
Tony Blinken said

00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.875 line:71%
Israel has presented

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:02.041 position:59% line:71%
Hamas with, quote, an extraordinarily

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.583 size:88% position:44% line:71%
generous proposal,

00:01:03.583 --> 00:01:04.708 line:71%
adding that the militant group

00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:05.666 size:88% position:44% line:71%
is the only thing

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.166 position:58% line:71%
standing between the people of Gaza

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:07.916 size:88% position:44% line:71%
and a cease fire.

00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:08.541 line:71%
Let's get the latest

00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:09.666 line:71%
from CNN national security

00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.666 line:71%
correspondent Kylie Atwood.

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.875 position:56% line:71%
Kylie over at the State Department

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:13.916 size:81% position:41% line:71%
for us. Kylie.

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:16.041 position:63% line:71%
What can you tell us about this proposal?

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.041 line:71%
Well, listen, as you said,

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:17.916 line:71%
the secretary of state

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:19.583 line:71%
very clearly this morning

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:21.041 line:71%
saying that in the U.S.

00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:23.125 position:61% line:71%
opinion, what has been put on the table

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:24.333 size:81% position:41% line:71%
by Israel for

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.375 line:71%
Hamas is an extraordinarily,

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:28.500 line:71%
quote, generous proposal.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.208 line:71%
And he called on Hamas to

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:31.083 size:88% position:44% line:71%
accept that deal.

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:32.916 position:61% line:71%
He also said that they have to accept it

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:33.833 size:72% position:36% line:71%
quickly.

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:35.291 size:88% position:44% line:71%
And our reporting

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:36.625 line:71%
is that some of the demands

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:37.416 line:71%
that Israel had been

00:01:37.416 --> 00:01:39.208 line:71%
making has been lessened.

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:40.291 size:69% position:34% line:71%
And so

00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:42.375 position:61% line:71%
it appears that this could be a proposal

00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:44.208 line:71%
that Hamas could accept.

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:45.416 line:71%
And the reason for him

00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:47.625 position:58% line:71%
saying that Hamas has to act quickly

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:49.291 position:58% line:71%
is because the backdrop here is that

00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:51.125 position:58% line:71%
Israel has been saying for some time

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:53.250 position:58% line:71%
they plan to invade Rafah. And U.S.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.083 position:56% line:71%
officials are very eyes wide open

00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:56.375 position:58% line:71%
about the fact that they are likely

00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:58.125 line:71%
to go ahead with that invasion

00:01:58.125 --> 00:01:59.625 line:71%
if there isn't an agreement here

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:00.666 size:84% position:42% line:71%
for a cease fire

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:02.333 line:71%
and for hostages to be released.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.291 line:71%
So time is truly of the essence.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:05.833 size:69% position:34% line:71%
Yeah.

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:06.291 size:81% position:41% line:71%
And clearly, a

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:07.166 size:84% position:42% line:71%
source tells CNN

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:08.000 line:71%
that there's a worry

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.125 line:71%
inside the State Department

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:10.583 line:71%
that Israel is not using

00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:12.000 line:71%
American provided weapons

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.708 position:59% line:71%
in accordance with international law.

00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:16.166 line:71%
What's going on there?

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:16.666 size:69% position:34% line:71%
Yeah.

00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:18.791 position:58% line:71%
So there is not a consensus opinion

00:02:18.791 --> 00:02:20.791 position:56% line:71%
within the State Department as to

00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:22.166 size:88% position:44% line:71%
if Israel is using

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.166 position:63% line:71%
those american-made weapons in accordance

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:25.375 line:71%
with international law.

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:26.791 position:59% line:71%
That's according to a State Department

00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:28.958 position:59% line:71%
official who spoke with my colleague,

00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.125 size:88% position:44% line:71%
Jennifer Handler.

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:31.958 line:71%
And this is important

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.666 line:71%
because this is all going to

00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:35.375 line:71%
come to the fore next week.

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:37.125 line:71%
There is a requirement

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:39.333 position:63% line:71%
due to a new national security memorandum

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:40.750 line:71%
that President Biden signed

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.083 line:71%
at the end of last year

00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:43.041 line:71%
for the State Department,

00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:43.958 size:88% position:44% line:71%
for the secretary

00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.250 line:71%
to provide an actual assessment

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.083 line:71%
as to with all of the countries

00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:50.666 position:63% line:71%
using american-made weaponry are doing so

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:52.708 position:59% line:71%
in accordance with international law.

00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:53.791 line:71%
These countries are supposed

00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:55.791 line:71%
to provide their rationale,

00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:56.958 size:88% position:44% line:71%
their explanation

00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.416 position:56% line:71%
for the fact that they do believe

00:02:58.416 --> 00:02:59.250 line:71%
they are in accordance

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.208 line:71%
with international law.

00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:01.291 line:71%
The State Department assesses

00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:03.333 line:71%
that, provide that to Congress.

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:05.000 position:56% line:71%
But because there is disagreement

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.250 position:59% line:71%
within the State Department over this

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.916 size:75% position:38% line:71%
right now,

00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:08.000 line:71%
it's going to be interesting

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.291 size:69% position:34% line:71%
to see

00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.000 line:71%
what the final determination

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.125 line:71%
from the secretary of state

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:12.500 line:71%
actually is next week

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.208 size:84% position:42% line:71%
when he provides

00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:15.500 line:71%
that assessment to Congress Jim.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.208 size:75% position:38% line:71%
All right.

00:03:16.208 --> 00:03:17.541 position:56% line:71%
Very important development there.

00:03:17.541 --> 00:03:19.458 position:56% line:71%
Kylie Atwood, thank you very much.

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:19.833 size:66% position:33% line:71%
U.S.

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:20.541 size:88% position:44% line:71%
Secretary of state

00:03:20.541 --> 00:03:21.458 line:71%
is back in the Middle East

00:03:21.458 --> 00:03:22.750 line:71%
for the seventh time

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.916 position:61% line:71%
since the start of the Israel-Hamas war

00:03:24.916 --> 00:03:25.916 line:71%
and is urging Hamas

00:03:25.916 --> 00:03:26.958 line:71%
to accept the latest framework

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.041 line:71%
for a Gaza cease fire.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.416 line:71%
Anthony Blinken meeting today

00:03:29.416 --> 00:03:30.583 line:71%
with regional foreign ministers

00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:31.916 line:71%
and other top diplomats

00:03:31.916 --> 00:03:33.083 line:71%
at a special forum,

00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:34.291 line:71%
a special World Economic

00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:36.083 position:56% line:71%
Forum meeting, rather, in Riyadh.

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:38.833 position:61% line:71%
It comes as a Hamas delegation in Cairo

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:41.041 position:58% line:71%
is there to discuss the new proposal

00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:41.958 size:78% position:39% line:71%
for a truce,

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:42.708 size:78% position:39% line:71%
which calls

00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:44.750 position:58% line:71%
for the release of Israeli hostages

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.291 line:71%
and Palestinian prisoners.

00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:47.583 line:71%
Over the span of several weeks

00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:48.166 size:78% position:39% line:71%
in exchange

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.541 line:71%
for a temporary cease fire

00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:52.625 position:61% line:71%
and the restoration of sustainable calm.

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:54.166 position:61% line:71%
I want to play for you a little bit more

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:55.500 line:71%
from that meeting with the Saudi

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.583 line:71%
foreign minister was asked

00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:57.916 line:71%
specifically about the situation

00:03:57.916 --> 00:04:00.791 line:71%
in Gaza and Saudi Arabia's role.

00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.458 size:81% position:41% line:71%
Take a listen.

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.583 line:71%
The situation in Gaza

00:04:04.583 --> 00:04:07.083 position:63% line:71%
obviously is a catastrophe by every major

00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:11.583 position:63% line:71%
humanitarian, but also a complete failing

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:13.666 line:71%
of the existing political system

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:16.041 line:71%
to deal with that crisis.

00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:19.291 line:71%
We in the region are not going

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.791 size:84% position:42% line:71%
to focus only on

00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.375 position:56% line:71%
solving the crisis of the moment.

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:26.625 position:61% line:71%
We are going to look at how we can solve

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:27.625 size:88% position:44% line:71%
the bigger problem

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:29.208 line:71%
in the context of Gaza.

00:04:29.208 --> 00:04:30.500 size:72% position:36% line:71%
That is

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.333 size:88% position:44% line:71%
a real commitment

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:33.541 line:71%
to a two-State solution.

00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:35.833 line:71%
That is a credible, irreversible

00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:37.250 line:71%
path to a Palestinian state.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.583 line:71%
That's the only reasonable

00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:39.708 size:78% position:39% line:71%
and credible

00:04:39.708 --> 00:04:40.291 size:72% position:36% line:71%
solution

00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:41.750 size:88% position:44% line:71%
that guarantees us

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.416 line:71%
from not having to come back

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.541 line:71%
to this same situation,

00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:47.500 position:58% line:71%
to three, four years down the line.

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:50.208 line:71%
The shadow minister of state

00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:50.875 line:71%
for foreign affairs

00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:51.833 size:81% position:41% line:71%
also pointing

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.541 position:56% line:71%
to reduced conflict in the region.

00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:54.416 size:81% position:41% line:71%
Take a listen.

00:04:55.083 --> 00:04:57.083 position:61% line:71%
Our objective is to link the region with

00:04:57.083 --> 00:04:59.416 line:71%
the world and to be able to

00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.041 size:72% position:36% line:71%
put the

00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.708 line:71%
resources of the region together

00:05:04.708 --> 00:05:06.041 line:71%
so we can create synergies

00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:08.416 line:71%
that have a positive impact

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:10.333 position:59% line:71%
on all the inhabitants of the region.

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:11.750 line:71%
This is complicated

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.541 size:84% position:42% line:71%
by the tensions

00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:13.708 line:71%
that we have in the region.

00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:16.916 position:61% line:71%
So our objective is to try to put an end

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:17.708 size:88% position:44% line:71%
to these tensions

00:05:17.708 --> 00:05:18.958 line:71%
so we can focus on the things

00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.041 size:78% position:39% line:71%
that matter.

00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:23.541 position:58% line:71%
Economic development and prosperity.

00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:25.458 position:56% line:71%
The crisis in Gaza, understandably

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.333 line:71%
top of mind at the World

00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:28.166 line:71%
Economic Forum conference.

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:29.500 position:63% line:71%
That is where my colleague Becky Anderson

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.708 position:58% line:71%
sat down with the forum's president.

00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:32.875 line:71%
They began by speaking about

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.416 line:71%
the future of the enclave

00:05:34.416 --> 00:05:37.250 position:61% line:71%
and what will be needed to help rebuild.

00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:40.333 line:71%
There will be no willingness

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:43.958 line:71%
among any donors to rebuild Gaza

00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.750 line:71%
if there's no guarantee

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.333 position:61% line:71%
that there will not be a Gaza war again,

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:48.666 position:56% line:71%
because we will rebuild something

00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:49.750 line:71%
that will be bombed again.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.375 line:71%
That means an irreversible

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:54.208 line:71%
path to a Palestinian state.

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:56.500 line:71%
From the conversations

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.791 line:71%
that you are having here

00:05:58.791 --> 00:05:59.875 line:71%
and these are around

00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:03.291 line:71%
that a unified Arab strategy

00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.208 position:61% line:71%
for Gaza and Palestinians going forward,

00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:08.916 line:71%
is your sense that we are close?

00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:11.666 size:72% position:36% line:71%
I think

00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:13.833 position:59% line:71%
with the cease fire in Gaza, at least

00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:17.083 line:71%
there will be a willingness

00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:20.875 position:58% line:71%
to have real political discussions.

00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:23.375 line:71%
What is in it for Israel is,

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:24.833 line:71%
of course, a potential deal

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:28.833 position:63% line:71%
with, for example, Saudi Arabia and Saudi

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:30.875 line:71%
Arabia will then gain

00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:31.833 size:88% position:44% line:71%
additional support

00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:34.791 position:56% line:71%
from the US on the military side.

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:38.500 position:58% line:71%
But we know that this has taken time

00:06:38.791 --> 00:06:40.000 size:78% position:39% line:71%
also before.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.375 line:71%
And I guess there is also

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:44.583 line:71%
the complications with

00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:46.750 position:56% line:71%
the political situation in Israel.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.583 line:71%
Is there a willingness

00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:51.875 position:56% line:71%
to work for a two-State solution?

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:53.625 position:61% line:71%
And then we have the American elections

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:54.750 size:81% position:41% line:71%
coming up too,

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.250 line:71%
that some people say

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.250 line:71%
that is not possible to move

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.625 line:71%
before or after those elections

00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:01.625 line:71%
because a plan, though, I think

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:03.708 line:71%
has to also be supported

00:07:03.708 --> 00:07:05.708 line:71%
very strongly from outside.

00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:08.041 position:61% line:71%
You will have to have the Arab countries

00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:10.500 position:61% line:71%
and the US and other key players saying

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.125 position:59% line:71%
this is the deal Take it or leave it.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.666 line:71%
Important points, of

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:16.458 size:72% position:36% line:71%
course,

00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:18.166 position:58% line:71%
as in terms of the economic picture

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:19.041 size:84% position:42% line:71%
for the region.

00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:19.875 size:88% position:44% line:71%
It is not defined,

00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:20.875 line:71%
of course, by conflict.

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:22.541 line:71%
It's incredibly complex.

00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:23.375 line:71%
The host of the World

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:25.250 line:71%
Economic Economic Forum

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.083 line:71%
is a case in point.

00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:28.583 line:71%
Here's more about Saudi

00:07:28.583 --> 00:07:31.041 line:71%
Arabia's current trajectory.

00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:34.458 position:58% line:71%
So it is very significant that Saudi

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:36.875 line:71%
Arabia have reached already

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:40.250 size:88% position:44% line:71%
this big milestone

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.458 position:59% line:71%
of 50% of the economy is now based on

00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:45.000 size:78% position:39% line:71%
oil and gas.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.041 line:71%
This was the plan for 2030

00:07:47.041 --> 00:07:48.500 line:71%
that the conference launched

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.166 line:71%
and now we are in 2024.

00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:53.208 line:71%
So this is incredible.

00:07:53.208 --> 00:07:55.041 line:71%
But we also see other these days

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.000 size:88% position:44% line:71%
doing really well

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.541 position:58% line:71%
also with their investments knowing

00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:01.708 line:71%
they have a lot of talent there.

00:08:01.708 --> 00:08:02.500 size:69% position:34% line:71%
Qatar

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.666 position:58% line:71%
but then the Middle East is kind of.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.625 size:84% position:42% line:71%
There is the JCC

00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:08.125 line:71%
and then there are other Middle

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:08.833 size:88% position:44% line:71%
Eastern countries

00:08:08.833 --> 00:08:11.416 position:56% line:71%
that are really really struggling.

00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:12.541 size:78% position:39% line:71%
I'm assuming

00:08:12.541 --> 00:08:13.666 line:71%
that you will look at a country

00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:14.958 line:71%
like the kingdom and say here's

00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.625 line:71%
a great example of how

00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:19.666 size:78% position:39% line:71%
that kind of

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.041 line:71%
portfolio comes together

00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:23.791 line:71%
successfully again.

00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:25.500 line:71%
How how does one take

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.500 line:71%
what is going on here

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.625 line:71%
and around this region

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:31.000 line:71%
as a starter for ten as it were?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.875 position:61% line:71%
When you're looking at the wider world.

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:33.916 size:72% position:36% line:71%
So Saudi

00:08:33.916 --> 00:08:36.666 position:59% line:71%
Arabia is going by thing investments.

00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:38.958 size:88% position:44% line:71%
That's important.

00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:39.666 line:71%
We're seeing people

00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:41.708 size:88% position:44% line:71%
also expats coming

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:44.375 position:63% line:71%
to the kingdom and they also have an open

00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:45.625 size:81% position:41% line:71%
trade policy.

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.041 line:71%
They're reducing tariffs

00:08:47.041 --> 00:08:48.125 size:84% position:42% line:71%
and they're not

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:49.666 line:71%
sticking to protectionism.

00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:51.291 line:71%
The challenge globally is

00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:52.458 size:75% position:38% line:71%
that trade

00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:55.166 position:59% line:71%
was the engine of growth for decades.

00:08:55.166 --> 00:08:57.375 line:71%
So trade was growing much faster

00:08:57.375 --> 00:08:58.625 line:71%
than the global economy.

00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:00.333 line:71%
Now trade is growing slower.

00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:01.250 size:66% position:33% line:71%
Then

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.958 line:71%
that is also leading

00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.750 line:71%
to more anemic growth

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.500 line:71%
of what we have to avoid

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.291 position:59% line:71%
is that the twenties become the 1970s.

00:09:11.208 --> 00:09:12.458 line:71%
So how do you avoid the twenties

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:14.125 line:71%
becoming the 1970s like this?

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:14.750 line:71%
It's also important

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.791 position:59% line:71%
to look at some of the success stories

00:09:16.791 --> 00:09:19.125 line:71%
of these past decades.

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:20.916 line:71%
So we are faced with that.

00:09:20.916 --> 00:09:21.833 size:81% position:41% line:71%
Globalization

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:23.875 line:71%
is a different globalization.

00:09:23.875 --> 00:09:25.666 line:71%
I think on the global trends,

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:28.208 position:56% line:71%
we will not only have a situation

00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:29.375 size:84% position:42% line:71%
where you stick

00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:30.958 line:71%
to comparative advantages,

00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.000 line:71%
you will have nurturing

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:36.083 position:58% line:71%
particles or French roaring that you

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:37.666 line:71%
then trade more with countries

00:09:37.666 --> 00:09:39.708 position:56% line:71%
where you feel that you are great.

00:09:39.708 --> 00:09:41.500 size:88% position:44% line:71%
But it's also very

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.916 position:59% line:71%
important that you don't lose the baby

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:43.708 size:88% position:44% line:71%
with the bathwater

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.000 position:56% line:71%
because this globalization has led

00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:49.083 line:71%
to a situation where never seen

00:09:49.083 --> 00:09:52.041 position:56% line:71%
so much poverty being eradicated.

00:09:52.041 --> 00:09:55.375 position:58% line:71%
In 1994, 2% of the global population

00:09:55.375 --> 00:09:57.250 line:71%
lived in extreme poverty.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.583 size:81% position:41% line:71%
Today it's 10%

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.916 line:71%
and we'll continue to watch

00:10:01.916 --> 00:10:03.500 position:58% line:71%
for more developments out of Riyadh.
