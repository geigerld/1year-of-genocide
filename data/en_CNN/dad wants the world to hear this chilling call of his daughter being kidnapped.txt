It's been nearly two weeks since Hamas militants abducted dozens and dozens of hostages in Israel, and their families are growing desperate. More tonight from my colleague Erin Burnett, who's in Tel Aviv Erin. Abbi, it has been 12 days since those hostages were abducted. I mean, you have to think about what they've been enduring in that time, we understand, maybe held in tunnels. Who knows what the circumstances are? And of course, their families are desperate for any sign of their loved ones. They all tell us they just want a sign of life, any kind of a sign of life. Earlier today, I had a chance to talk to the parents of two of the hostages, Maya and E.J. Regev. They were both abducted by Hamas at the music festival. At least 260 people were killed, of course, at that festival, and their parents thought they were among them. At first, their father played me a harrowing phone call from his daughter, Maya, as she came face to face with Hamas terrorists, to my husband to I can hold onto my call and my thought I've heard that. But I guess that's my effort. Their method, my coping with whatever she said. She over 30 wanted to hear my sense of humor the only bad moments to see me coming out you know, I the suffering took some water, some water some hummus, the form of I felt she was the I thought both of them did the most. My son, both both of my child in the car he chose to kill me. To kill me. I love you, Bob. I love you. The AP, obviously, it's incredible to watch that. You can see Marines reaction. And Alon, of course, the heartbreak but they wanted the world to hear that call. Ilan had not listened to it since he actually spoke to his daughter. Marie had not heard it until that moment. And you could see her steeling herself to hear it. But she wanted the world to hear it because they want the world to know. They they also told me that they saw video on social media a very brief one from Hamas that showed their son taken hostage. And they haven't seen any video of their daughter, although they say that Israeli authorities just a few days ago told them the Israeli army came and told them on Monday night that both of their children are being held in Gaza. So they thought it obviously very important that the Israeli government, Avi, knew that but the Israeli army refused to tell them exactly how they know this information. But, of course, I mean, you can see the anguish and the pain as those parents wait and wait and pray for a sign of life of their children.
