00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.169
Well, this video is is hard to look at.

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.437
But what can you tell us about

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:05.171
I know there's

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.440
there's not a whole lot of information,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.076
but it gets to the the desperation

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.045
that we're seeing out there.

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.081
Well, this location in southern Gaza,

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:15.482
the Rafah

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.183
crossing, is essentially

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.718
one of the only lifelines

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:19.052
for the

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.520
2.2 million people in Gaza,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.021
because it's

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.856
where you can bring in supplies

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:23.523
from Egypt.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:24.090
There's there's

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.492
always a long line of trucks

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:26.292
waiting to cross,

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.294
but they don't always get through.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:29.329
Today,

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.930
we know that there were dozens of trucks

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.731
that did get through,

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:35.268
but there efforts to distribute aid

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.736
in Gaza were hampered

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:39.039
by these large, desperate crowds.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.007
You're talking about hundreds of people.

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:41.808
At least that's what we can

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.010
ascertain from this footage.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.111
Jumping on the trucks,

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:46.713
trying to break in and grab

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.515
whatever items they could.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.550
It seemed as if it was really a mad dash.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.086
And at some point, gunfire erupts.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.287
So adding to the chaos

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:54.921
and the confusion

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:55.989
is the danger of bullets

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.123
whizzing through the air.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.159
We don't know who was firing the shots.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:00.226
We don't know how

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.829
it started or necessarily why.

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:05.031
But in a chaotic situation like that,

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.733
when people are so hungry

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.201
and so desperate

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.969
and so determined

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.538
to try to get what they can.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:13.740
In many cases, just to support themselves

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:15.241
and their families.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.176
But there could also be

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.077
potentially looting.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:17.610
We saw that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.579
there were tires that were set on fire.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.713
And then you had the gunshots

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:21.815
ring out as well.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.950
Listen, to what it sounded like

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.351
at the height of all of this.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.413
It is Christmas Eve jam.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.682
These people have lived through week

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.084
after week of airstrikes.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.452
There's been ground combat

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.920
that's now expanding.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.755
The IDF, the Israeli military

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.457
moving into central and southern Gaza.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.492
Their operations.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:06.159
There've been airstrikes

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.794
throughout all of these areas.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.529
And now on top of that,

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.531
a brawl around the relief trucks

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:12.832
and gunfire.

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.268
People are living an absolute hellish

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.371
nightmare right now in Gaza.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.206
And this video is all

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:21.274
you really need to look at to

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.576
just get a little bit of a glimpse

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.245
of what it's like for them.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:26.579
And this is why.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.648
The call for aid. The call for help.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.883
The call to

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:30.250
to do

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.551
whatever the world can

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:32.619
to improve the situation

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.154
for more than 2 million people

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:34.687
living through

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:36.589
this is even more urgent

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:37.524
on this Christmas Eve than

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:38.091
it's ever been.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:39.993
Yeah.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.660
Yeah.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.561
Well, I mean,

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:42.262
that video right

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:44.164
there just goes to the horror

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.065
of what life is like right now

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.167
in that part of the world.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.869
And and we just don't know.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:53.540
The gunfire is emanating in that video

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:54.874
Is that

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:55.475
is that something

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:56.976
we can ascertain from looking at it?

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:58.044
We just don't know.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:58.711
Okay.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:00.613
It is.

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:01.481
It's in the video,

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.182
but we don't know where

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.050
the shots are being fired from.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.385
You don't see there's

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.220
no reports of anybody injured

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.954
that we know of.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.055
But again,

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.590
information could be slow going.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.124
A lot of times

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:12.692
people have to climb up on a roof

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.893
just to get an Internet signal

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:16.229
to feed back video like this.

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.130
Our journalists

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.730
on the ground

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.800
in Gaza worked so hard to record moments.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.302
And sometimes it can take hours

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:23.102
and hours and hours

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.871
just to get the information back to us,

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:25.772
to get a phone signal,

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.040
to get the footage back.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.208
And so we hope to learn

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.143
more about what exactly happened today

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.212
in southern Gaza at the Rafah crossing.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.214
But you can see clearly in the pictures

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.217
it was a situation of people

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.351
who are driven

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.353
to the edge of desperation.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:40.987
Yeah,

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.322
they are so desperate

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.157
and so

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.292
determined to try to get what they can,

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:46.793
grabbing

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:47.594
whatever they can,

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:48.795
running running for it,

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.730
and then having to essentially,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.231
you know, hear

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.065
gunfire, wonder

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.533
if they're going to have to dodge bullets

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:54.867
after airstrikes

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:55.668
and everything else

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:56.402
that they've gone through.

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.204
And by the way, most of these people

00:03:58.204 --> 00:04:00.039
on the on the verge of starvation,

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.307
extremely hungry

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:02.342
because they're so little food

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.409
and and water,

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.677
even even drinking water

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.179
available in Gaza right now.

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.281
Barack, I do want to ask you about this

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.148
drone attack

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:09.916
in just a few moments,

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.484
but I wanted to go back to that video

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:12.952
that Will Ripley was talking about

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:15.054
near the Rafah border crossing

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.789
where we saw gunfire breaking out.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.058
People sort of almost running in a panic

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:21.728
with relief supplies that had come in,

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:23.896
I guess.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:25.298
What's your sense

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.300
when you talk to your sources

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.235
about the level of desperation

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:31.971
inside Gaza and whether things could?

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:33.339
I mean, this just gives you a sense

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.408
that things could really spiral

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:36.442
out of control

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.311
in a significant way,

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.346
that it just might become difficult

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:41.881
for anybody to get a handle

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:43.750
or a lid on the situation.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.385
What's your sense of it?

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.554
First, I agree with you, Jim,

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:51.090
that the situation is very, very serious

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.760
and it's getting worse by the day.

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:57.030
And I think what is most challenging

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.766
is that in a few weeks,

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.567
the Israeli military is going to

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.569
phase out this operation

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.471
and move from the high intensity

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.273
phase to the low intensity phase,

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:09.309
which means that most of the IDF

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.077
soldiers will go out

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:13.179
of the Palestinian cities.

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:16.015
And then you'll have a vacuum

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.850
all over the Gaza Strip.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.885
And then either

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.687
Hamas will come back again

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:22.555
or we will see the same pictures

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:24.157
we saw in Rafah today.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.192
We will see it all over the Gaza Strip.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:27.360
And the number one

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.496
challenge now is to find a way

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.765
for somebody

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:34.867
to be in charge of law and order

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.102
in a few weeks in Gaza

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:37.170
so that all this

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.571
humanitarian aid is coming

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:40.173
in, won't be looted,

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.808
will reach the people who need it.

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:44.043
And unfortunately, at that moment,

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:45.812
there's nobody that can do it

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:47.113
right.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:47.647
Because Barack,

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:48.081
one of

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:48.848
the conversations

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.451
that really hasn't been fully

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:52.919
dealt with is

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:53.720
who is going to be

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.323
the governing authority in Gaza,

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.660
you know, in the near future.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.227
I can't

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:02.662
imagine Israel is going to want Hamas

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:04.564
to be that governing authority.

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:06.232
And when you see the chaos

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:08.167
break out that we saw today,

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:08.501
I mean,

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:11.070
that is going to be a major challenge

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:12.238
of course.

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:15.274
And if the if it's not Hamas

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:20.012
and if there's no other volunteer

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.748
and that can take

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:24.016
the Gaza Strip under its responsibility,

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:25.318
the Egyptians are not going to do it.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:26.519
The Saudis are not going to do it.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.187
The Democrats are not going to do it.

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:30.823
Then Israel can find itself again,

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:32.825
not next year and not

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:34.861
six months from now,

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:36.396
but a few weeks from now

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:40.099
in a situation where it will have to take

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.567
responsible

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:43.503
responsibility for 2 million

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:44.737
Palestinians in Gaza.

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:47.173
And this is the last thing Israel wants.

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:48.541
But if there's not going to be

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.343
any alternative governing body

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:51.077
and for now,

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.245
there is not,

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.981
you know, the responsibility will aid

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:55.815
Israel stable.

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:58.217
And Barack,

00:06:58.217 --> 00:06:59.719
what do you make of the Pentagon

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:01.621
singling out Iran

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:02.955
for this latest drone attack

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.524
on this commercial ship?

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:07.760
It does sound as though that tensions

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:09.429
are really building

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.664
and it almost feels like a foreshadowing

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:13.533
of something to come

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:14.400
to send a message

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.636
to the Houthi rebels, to send a message

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:17.870
to the Iranians, potentially.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.605
What can you tell us

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:21.841
I think what's

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:23.142
important and interesting

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:26.646
in this recent attack that generated

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:27.580
from Iran,

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.715
this drone attack against this ship

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:31.517
near the coast of India,

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:32.418
is that it's

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:33.986
the kind of attack that we haven't seen

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:35.855
for many, many months.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:37.323
Something like a year ago,

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:39.692
we saw almost every week

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:41.461
an Iranian attack

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.262
on some sort of a vessel

00:07:43.262 --> 00:07:44.730
that had either

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.798
a strong connection

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.533
or a weak connection to Israel.

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:49.535
And this was part of this shadow war

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:50.870
between Israel and Iran,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.939
because the Israelis also attacked

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:54.106
Iranian vessels

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:56.042
and this war, this tit for tat.

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:57.343
But we haven't seen this for a long,

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:58.077
long time.

00:07:58.077 --> 00:07:59.245
And the fact that the Iranians

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:02.081
decided to resume those attacks,

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:04.717
those direct attacks from Iran against

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:06.886
Israeli vessels or vessels

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:08.087
that are affiliated with

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:09.188
Israeli companies

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:10.990
I think it's a very worrisome sign

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.091
because it's

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:13.926
no doubt an escalation

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:14.894
after what

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:16.863
we've seen in the last few weeks.

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:17.697
And when we were talking

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:18.931
with Kevin Liptak earlier,

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:20.566
about this on this program,

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:21.601
I mean, there is a sense

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:23.636
in the Biden administration

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:24.370
that the Iranians

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:24.937
may be setting

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.405
something of a bit of a trap

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:27.206
and that they

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:28.541
they want to almost bait

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:29.942
the Israelis and the U.S.

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:31.277
to, I guess, muster

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:32.278
some kind of response

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:34.180
that would widen the conflict,

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.048
make things messier in the region.

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:37.216
And I suppose that there's

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:38.818
there's that side of it to that

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:40.586
that has to be dealt with. Yeah.

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:42.522
So senior

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.790
Israeli officials that I talked to are,

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:45.424
you know,

00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:47.059
very aware that that's the case.

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:49.962
And this is why you did not see Israel

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:53.099
retaliating against the Houthis in Yemen,

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.267
because the Israelis say

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:56.002
this is exactly what the Iranians

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:57.069
and the Houthis want.

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:59.305
They want to distract us from Gaza.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.273
They want to distract us

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:01.974
from trying to deter

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.543
Hezbollah in the north.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.710
And we're not going to do it.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.012
And therefore is

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:06.445
Israel

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:07.046
gives a chance

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:07.713
for this

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:09.482
international maritime

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:11.350
coalition in the Red Sea.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.585
But on the other hand,

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:13.920
the Israelis do say that

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.454
they think that the U.S.

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:16.622
should do something about it

00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:17.757
or about the Houthis

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:19.559
and you see that every day.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.726
The Houthis are escalating

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.562
their attacks on U.S.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.463
vessels in the Red Sea, U.S.

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:25.064
Navy vessels.

00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:28.067
Just the other day, an attack on a U.S.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.168
ship.

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:31.771
And when I speak to U.S.

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:33.439
officials in Washington,

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:35.641
they say and they you know,

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:38.177
they recognize that this is an option

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:39.812
that's on the table, U.S.

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:40.980
taking military action

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.014
against the Houthis.

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:44.550
It's being considered in the Pentagon.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.152
It's being considered in the White House.

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:47.987
Secretary of Defense Austin,

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:50.323
when he was just here in Tel Aviv

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:51.257
a week ago,

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.291
he told the Israelis,

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:54.427
we are not taking a military action

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:55.361
off the table when it

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:56.228
comes to the Houthis.

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:58.364
All right.

00:09:58.364 --> 00:09:59.398
Barack Ravid,

00:09:59.398 --> 00:09:59.865
perhaps I'm

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:01.167
going to be watching

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.135
for over these holidays.

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:04.136
Thank you so much.

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:06.172
Appreciate the time today.

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:07.039
Thank you, Jim.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.608
And I hope you all have a calm

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.476
holiday season. You as well.
