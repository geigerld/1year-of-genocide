00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.702
That's a humanitarian aid

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.237
that we're supposed

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:06.906
to have already gone into Gaza t

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.043
Well, now cross the Egyptian bor

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.077
within the next

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.980
24 to 48 hours, supposedly

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.783
in about 200 trucks

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.020
which carrying dire

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.122
humanitarian aid water

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.557
and food and medicine

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.059
are just sitting there

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.894
just a short distance away

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:30.263
from the tens of thousands of Pa

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.565
civilians, innocent civilians

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.700
who desperately need it.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.434
The United Nations

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:35.402
calling this a difference

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:36.936
between life and death.

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.972
CNN's Clarissa Ward is in Cairo,

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:39.272
for us.

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:39.806
And Clarissa,

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.341
officials say

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:42.509
road repairs were needed

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.410
before the crucial aid

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.210
could pass through.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.579
Is that really the only reason f

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.315
13 day long delay so far,

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.553
No, Jake, it's not.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.422
We were actually at the Rafah bo

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:56.923
crossing today.

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:57.424
The U.N.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.459
says there's a number of other i

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:01.494
firstly, the issue of the Israel

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.063
wanting to verify everything

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:03.997
that's in those trucks

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.665
to make sure there's no weapons 

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:06.466
and they need to come up

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.802
with some kind of a mechanism to

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.370
But that takes time.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.404
How would they do that?

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.405
Where would they do that?

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.174
The second issue, they say,

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.542
is that they don't want this

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:16.709
to be a one off of

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.044
just 20 trucks going in

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.612
and they want to have an agreeme

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:20.447
in place

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.115
for a sustained, continuous

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.283
humanitarian corridor.

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:24.751
They're worried potentially

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.786
that their trucks and their work

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:28.721
could get attacked or mobbed

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.423
if it's just that one,

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.858
one sort of shipment

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.993
or movement of tow trucks.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.795
All of this, though, Jake,

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:37.564
is really coming down to the wir

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.732
now with steel stocks about to r

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:41.000
in a matter of days

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.703
and anger getting ever, ever hig

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:44.237
Take a look.

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:46.606
For days,

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:47.006
they have

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:47.807
been waiting

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.642
more than 200 trucks

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:50.477
full of aid

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:52.579
desperately needed in Gaza,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.481
but stuck on the Egyptian side

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.850
of the Rafah border crossing.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.317
U.N.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.618
Secretary General

00:01:58.618 --> 00:01:59.886
Antonio Guterres

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:00.987
hope to be here

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:03.123
for a much needed diplomatic win

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.426
as quickly as possible.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:07.026
Instead,

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:08.761
he found himself in the midst

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:09.996
of a protest.

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:12.232
His remarks drowned out by the c

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.834
People are chanting over and ove

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:17.070
with our blood, with our souls.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.773
We will defend Palestine

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.843
There's a huge amount of anger,

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:25.979
a huge amount of emotion,

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.548
much of it directed at the West.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:30.316
We need justice.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.885
We're need justice.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.287
And much also at Western media,

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.388
who people here

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:36.389
feel have favored

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.092
Israeli voices over Palestinians

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.361
where you a protester

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.163
starts shouting at me.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.398
We invite her to do an interview

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.500
When a thousand plus

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.002
Palestinian babies die,

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.570
you don't feel the same

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.005
You don't feel the same

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:52.772
as when I tell you

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:54.440
one of your own has died.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.243
But these are our own

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:58.178
and it is unfair.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.213
And Egypt will stand with Palest

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:00.880
All Western

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.682
journalists are talking for Isra

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.650
If the United Nations

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.484
standing for Israel,

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.020
all these international institut

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.121
are standing for Israel,

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.422
who is there for the Palestinian

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:10.957
And don't call it a war?

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:13.259
The jargon is even more infuriat

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.261
So the war there not equal footi

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:17.130
It is not a war.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.432
For many, it is deeply personal.

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:22.001
Palestinian man holds up his ID.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.571
I can't contact with my family,

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:25.271
their families.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.272
On the other side,

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:28.675
I have seven sister and my fathe

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.077
My mother grandmother, uncles.

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.413
All my family is there.

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:35.048
I can contact with them.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.617
I don't know everything okay?

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.720
I don't know if they are okay or

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.622
As Egyptian soldiers stand

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:45.358
by, the demonstrators get more a

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.061
Protests are normally illegal he

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:50.196
But today, the Egyptian presiden

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:52.732
called on people to take to the 

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.703
So this is rapidly becoming

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:58.238
a very chaotic scene.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.038
Now,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.708
They're trying to get

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.810
the secretary general out of her

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.380
We were ordered back onto the bu

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:08.681
and escorted out

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.017
through the crowd, back to Rush 

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:14.187
where piles of aid sit by the ru

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:16.522
so close to where they need to b

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.157
but held back, the U.N.

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.260
says, by complications over

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.862
how to monitor the trucks that e

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.330
and how to establish

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.733
a continuous humanitarian corrid

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.635
When you saw the anger

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:29.969
of those protesters,

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:30.570
most of it

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.106
leveled at Israel and the U.S.,

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.074
but also at the international co

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:38.478
for failing to stop the situatio

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:39.646
What's your response?

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:40.013
I think

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:41.114
what's important to say

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.216
is that we are doing everything 

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:45.551
engaging with all the parties

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:46.319
to make sure

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.721
that sooner rather than later,

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:50.556
we are able to have

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.058
not only a first convoy,

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:54.027
but continued aid

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:55.228
to the population in Gaza.

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.031
I think

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.433
it should be as quickly

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:03.569
as possible and

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.071
with as many

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.172
as possible trucks

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:08.241
to cross in the first few days.

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.209
But that is little comfort

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:11.978
to the people of Gaza,

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:15.048
for whom every day, every hour i

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:16.015
vital

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:19.485
Jake,

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:20.553
one of the other

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:21.821
sticking points here

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.890
appears to be the issue of fuel.

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:25.124
There has been agreement

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:25.925
about food,

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:27.427
about medicine, about water,

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:30.063
but fuel is desperately needed t

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:30.897
the generators

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:31.464
that are keeping

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:32.198
those hospitals

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:33.132
going, that are keeping

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:34.600
those refugee centers

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.936
overwhelmed as they are still go

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:37.737
President Biden,

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:38.371
as you mentioned

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:39.872
in the introduction, said

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:42.642
hopefully within 24 to 48 hours,

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:44.911
we may start to see movement,

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:46.446
but there are still obstacles

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:47.747
to overcome.

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:49.215
The secretary general saying

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:51.684
he desperately need to end this

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.219
impasse Jake.

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.486
All right.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:55.588
Clarissa Ward in Cairo, Egypt fo

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:56.522
Thank you so much. This.
