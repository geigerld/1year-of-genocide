00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:02.085
While it's Labor Day

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:03.670
weekend, the traditional kickoff

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.838
to the home stretch

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.673
of the presidential campaign.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:07.215
Here with me

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:08.883
now is the Democratic Senate

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:11.219
candidate from California, Congressman

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.095
Adam Schiff.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:12.762
I want to talk to you

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.055
about the campaign in one minute.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:14.889
But first,

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.100
you are in Oakland, California right now.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.144
That is where the Goldberg poll

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.021
and family is originally from.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.605
And I want to get your reaction

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.274
to the murder

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:27.360
of Israeli American hostage Hirsh

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:28.236
Goldberg.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:31.239
Poland and five others.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:33.700
Well,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.535
when I heard the news last night,

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.162
I felt sick.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.789
I am just absolutely heartbroken.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.000
for Hirsch's family,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.085
for the families of these other hostages

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:45.378
that were

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.380
butchered by these Hamas terrorists.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.339
And,

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:49.090
it just,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.342
is hard to wrap your head around.

00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:54.471
I think we all came to know,

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:58.266
Hirsch, through his family, and,

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:02.020
and it's just it's just devastating.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.522
and these,

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:05.899
sons of bitches who did this,

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.650
ought to be hunted down

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.651
and brought to justice,

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:11.196
no matter how long that takes.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.822
I hope and pray.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:15.075
I think, as we all do, that

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.285
there's a negotiated end to this war.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:20.497
And soon, and that not another,

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.500
innocent person loses their life.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.836
and I just can't imagine how

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:29.047
his family must feel right now.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.049
I mean, you just heard the new tras,

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.008
whose son,

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:36.012
Omar, is also in captivity called

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:38.389
not just on Prime Minister Netanyahu,

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:39.307
but President Biden

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:43.061
multiple times to do more to get,

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.646
these hostages,

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:47.107
particularly Americans, home.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.400
I mean, I asked her about a prayer

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.194
that she says every day,

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.655
and she she's clearly done with prayers.

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.698
She's frustrated, understandably.

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:56.741
I'm hearing anecdotally

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.785
for people from people saying,

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.912
this is the United States of America

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:02.038
and the fact that

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:04.874
the American

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:05.458
president and

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.543
American administration

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:07.794
can't get

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.087
American citizens held

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.088
in these conditions

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:13.299
back is very frustrating.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.300
And a little bit,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.303
they're flabbergasted by it.

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.431
How can the Biden administration

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:23.434
answer those frustrations right now?

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:26.646
Well, first of all,

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.273
I think the parents of the hostages

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:29.315
are doing exactly

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.358
what they should be doing,

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:31.943
exactly what I would be doing,

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:34.571
in their shoes.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:35.321
as difficult

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:35.780
as it is

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.699
to imagine the horror of

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.033
standing where they're standing,

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:39.576
and that is,

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:40.994
pleading,

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.162
advocating, doing everything

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.205
possible to get Israeli government

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:45.498
to agree to,

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:46.499
an end to the war

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.709
that that releases

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.668
their family members

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.671
and also, call upon the president

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:52.297
and vice president

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.381
to do everything they can.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.674
And I think they are.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.009
I think President Biden

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.802
and Vice President Harris

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:00.930
are turning over every stone

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.848
in their efforts

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.726
to secure the release of the hostages

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.936
and protect the lives of the hostages

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.314
and achieve a ceasefire.

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.108
I don't think they go a waking moment

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:15.278
without focusing on this, where,

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:16.571
you know, we're not putting boots

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.322
on the ground,

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.032
in these tunnels under Gaza.

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:23.077
So it is a very difficult, situation

00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:24.454
in terms of our own ability

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.581
to rescue these hostages.

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.248
But I

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:28.458
really, sincerely believe

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:28.958
the administration

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.002
is doing everything possible.

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:34.214
and, and is committed,

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:37.091
not only to an end to the war

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.551
in which the threat from Hamas

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:39.969
is eliminated,

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.262
in which we

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:44.557
we are on a path at some point

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.478
and I pray soon to a regional,

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.188
and two state solution

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:51.022
that,

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.441
achieves a lasting peace in the region.

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.567
But I really believe they're

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:55.818
doing all they possibly can.

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:57.946
Congressman, I want to turn

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.739
back, domestically

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.699
to the presidential race,

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.910
which is 65 days away.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.578
Election day is,

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.497
I want you to listen to how Vice

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:07.872
President

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:09.332
Harris answered my question

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:09.916
this week

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.919
about a key issue in the campaign.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.256
In 2019, you said, quote,

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.757
there is no question I'm

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.592
in favor of banning fracking.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:20.677
Fracking, as you know,

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.095
is a pretty big issue,

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:22.887
particularly in

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.223
your must win state of Pennsylvania.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:27.642
Do you still want to ban fracking?

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:28.851
No, and I made

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:31.562
that clear on the debate stage in 2020

00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:33.773
that I would not ban fracking

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:34.816
as vice president.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.943
I did not ban fracking as president.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.946
I will not ban fracking.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.448
You're a co-sponsor of a House bill

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.200
right now that would ban fracking.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.493
Are you disappointed

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:46.953
that she supports it now?

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.833
well, look, you know, I

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.376
favor banning fracking.

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.086
And I strongly believe that,

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:58.798
the the pathway to, attacking

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.591
climate change is to,

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:03.386
wean ourselves off of fossil fuels.

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:04.470
but, look, I'm

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.264
not the vice president United States.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.390
And I do think that

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.224
when you are

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:09.475
representing the whole country,

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:12.103
you have a different perspective.

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.938
as the vice president pointed out,

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:15.273
her values, though,

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:16.566
have remained consistent.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:19.986
And that is she is a champion of,

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.279
moving ourselves

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.031
in the renewable energy direction.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.867
her role in passing the Inflation

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:26.409
Reduction Act,

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:27.368
the most aggressive attack

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:28.578
on climate change in our history,

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.580
I think, speaks for itself.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.043
But, but, look, let's, let's compare,

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.544
a situation

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:37.253
where,

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:38.796
someone changed their position

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:40.423
four years ago

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:41.257
to Donald Trump,

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:42.425
who's changed his position

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.177
four times on abortion

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.636
in the last 48 hours.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:47.555
that, to me,

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:49.098
is, you know, a

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:50.683
much more significant question,

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:52.185
particularly as

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.062
when you're talking about abortion,

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.939
and you're talking about a, right.

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.067
And freedom of the American people

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.943
to be so pandering,

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:02.945
wishy washy, flip flopping,

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:05.114
you know, so,

00:06:05.114 --> 00:06:06.908
disrespect for the rights and freedoms

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.618
of millions of American women,

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:11.120
and do all that in a single day.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.997
that's the contrast here.

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:15.375
and what's more, Dana,

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.377
that's a values issue.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.795
That's a values issue.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:19.879
when on something

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.423
like the right to an abortion,

00:06:22.423 --> 00:06:25.426
you flip flop, every 15 minutes,

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:28.596
that shows essentially he has no values.

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:32.600
Congressman, special counsel Jack Smith

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:34.227
filed a new indictment

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.520
against Donald Trump this week

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.938
for election interference,

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.231
even after the Supreme Court

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.315
ruling on immunity.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.109
And it comes as two

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.819
pro-Trump organizations

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.571
are slated to hold a January 6th

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:48.074
awards gala at Trump National Golf

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.075
Club in Bedminster

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:52.703
to pay tribute to all six defendants.

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:54.789
Now, Trump has been invited to speak.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.583
Organizers say he hasn't ruled it out.

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:58.876
What's your response

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:00.837
to the fact that he's,

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:01.838
whether he goes or not,

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.631
that he's allowing his property

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:05.133
to be used for this event?

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:08.803
Well, first of all,

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:09.429
the Justice Department

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.304
is exactly right

00:07:10.304 --> 00:07:12.098
to be refiling these charges,

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.474
after that,

00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:15.059
just absurdly

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:17.520
dangerous Supreme Court decision,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.855
attempted to give immunity

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.440
to a president to commit crimes

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.691
while they were in office.

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.609
so he's right to refile these charges.

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:28.030
but for, the president to allow,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.073
you know, this event

00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:30.074
to go forward,

00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:32.994
celebrating these people who beat

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:35.997
who gas to bear sprayed, who.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.083
we're responsible

00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:41.627
for the deaths of police officers

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:44.088
who essentially try to interfere

00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:45.131
with the,

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.716
peaceful transfer of power

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.468
the first time in our history,

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.720
shows you that for Donald Trump,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.512
he could,

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:51.846
you know,

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.347
give a damn about the country,

00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:54.140
about the Constitution,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.017
about the oath of office.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.226
It's only about him.

00:07:57.226 --> 00:07:59.687
And to glorify these people.

00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:01.689
also is a green light

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:03.691
to further violence.

00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:06.235
Should he lose the upcoming election?

00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:09.363
so just another dangerous disrespect.

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:13.242
Full, acquiescence

00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:15.203
in lawlessness by Donald Trump

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:16.913
and his enablers.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:18.247
Congressman Adam Schiff,

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:19.749
candidate for Senate

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:21.375
in the great state of California.

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:22.084
Thank you so much for

00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:22.960
being here this morning.

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:26.005
Thanks, Dana.
