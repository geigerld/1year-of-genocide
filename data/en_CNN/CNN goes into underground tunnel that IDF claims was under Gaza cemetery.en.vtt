00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.902
This is no ordinary quarry.

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:04.304
It's where the living ones

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.106
bury their dead.

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:08.708
Gaza's Bani Suheila, a cemetery

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:11.611
hollowed out by Israeli excavators.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:12.645
These were all graves.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.147
This was a cemetery.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:15.115
But the military says

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.384
that they were forced to come in here

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:18.985
because they discovered a Hamas

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:19.586
tunnel

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:22.789
running right underneath that cemetery.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.324
But the Israeli military

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.625
failed to prove that

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:26.893
stunning claim

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.829
during a three hour tour of the area.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.398
They invited us here a week

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.932
after we first uncovered

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:33.767
this graveyards,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.101
partial destruction

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.970
using satellite imagery.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.671
Part of a CNN investigation

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.607
that found 16 cemeteries

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:41.474
in Gaza

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:42.842
damaged or destroyed

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.844
by the Israeli military.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:45.745
This whole area

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:47.580
here is a military compound.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.582
From the mosque over there

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.085
underneath the graveyard.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:55.422
All the way down north and south,

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.491
my forces are beginning to try to flank

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.494
this area, were fired from this area

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.730
again and again and again.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.065
They couldn't understand why.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.066
So that's how you determine

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.300
that there was a tunnel here

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.670
because you were being fired upon. Yes.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.472
Our journey to investigate

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.307
the Israeli military's claims

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:15.575
begins in the rubble

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:16.609
of what they say

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.578
was a residential building.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.379
You even just standing

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:20.313
at the mouth of this tunnel,

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:21.614
you can feel the humidity

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.283
just like emanating here.

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:25.251
And this is the way that we go in to

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:25.785
what they say

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:27.887
is an extensive tunnel system

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:31.591
in Bani Suhaila.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:35.161
We descend into a dark, seemingly endless

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:38.398
labyrinth,

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.800
just as tight spaces like this

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.503
in certain parts of this tunnel.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:44.871
But then you get here

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:48.975
and you have full head space pretty much

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.543
all throughout it, you can see that

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:51.478
there's electricity,

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:53.213
there's telecommunications.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.314
The Israeli military says

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:55.949
that this tunnel system

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.184
actually leads to a Hamas command center,

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.487
which they say was used by Hamas fighters

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:03.623
to coordinate their attacks.

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:04.290
The Israeli

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.258
military says

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:07.560
this is that command center,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.995
multiple rooms equipped

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.297
with plumbing and electricity.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:14.300
Maps like this one lining the walls.

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.169
You can see a kitchen here

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:17.370
equipped with a sink,

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.538
running water

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:19.539
with the pipes

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.641
running through the tunnel wall.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.344
You have a fan plates.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:24.944
I mean,

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.646
you could imagine this being in a house,

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.983
but instead it's deep, deep underground.

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:31.251
Where are we right now?

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.452
I mean, what's above us?

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:34.521
So we're in the headquarters

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.823
of a Hamas commander.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.392
Above us is a cemetery

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:41.461
that I showed you from the outside.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.529
If you look at the satellite

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.663
imagery of this cemetery,

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.031
there is a wide area

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.266
that the military has cleared.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.367
Why is that necessary?

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:48.902
In order to uncover these tunnels?

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.803
We have to reach the tunnels.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.739
We have to reach the tunnels

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.673
and cover the tunnels.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:54.541
We have to prevent

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.342
from the enemy to flank us.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.978
But there's no way for us to verify

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.880
whether we are actually beneath

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.448
the graveyard.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:03.516
General Goldfuss

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.885
takes us back out of the tunnel,

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.254
but not into the cemetery.

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:11.758
Instead, we leave the same way we came in

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.561
before walking back to the enormous hole

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.397
where the cemetery once stood.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:17.730
He's.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.531
Hold on.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:23.136
Yeah.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.170
We're asking the general

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.838
if we can actually see

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:27.473
the shaft to the tunnel,

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.809
but the answer is no.

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.177
So they go by the machinery,

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.912
which I don't want you to,

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:34.981
just to take pictures of

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:35.848
the security muscles.

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:37.250
But what about if we don't film it?

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.651
We just look with our eyes

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.553
as we might fall in,

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.188
the whole thing can collapse.

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.623
Well, you have to walk to the edge.

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:45.325
The edge is not secured.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.859
Can collapse, collapses, machinery,

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:47.760
so on.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.061
That's.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:48.595
It's not something

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:51.331
I'm going to take a risk on. Sorry.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:52.832
The Israeli military later

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.701
provided this drone footage

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.969
showing the tunnel shaft

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.205
we entered and another one nearby.

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.307
CNN geolocated the footage

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:03.142
using this satellite image.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.110
This outline shows

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.012
where the cemetery once stood.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:08.414
And these are the two tunnel entrances.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.984
Clearly outside the graveyard.

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:11.985
As for the tunnel

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:12.452
they say

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:13.519
they found here

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.622
where the cemetery once stood.

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:18.358
The military never provided any evidence.
