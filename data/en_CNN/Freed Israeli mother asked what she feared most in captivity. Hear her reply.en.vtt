00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:03.837
They absolutely put on a show

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.372
to dress me up in nice clothes

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:06.272
and shoes before

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:07.907
I was released, when my girls and I

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.542
were barefoot for 50 days

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.244
and we were cold because we were wearing

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:13.179
short sleeves in November.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.914
It's one big show journey

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:15.382
to share,

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:16.816
opening up and revealing

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:18.318
what really happened to her

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:19.753
and her two young daughters.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.421
While held captive by Hamas

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.156
for nearly 50 days.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.258
Once you got into Gaza,

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:27.594
what happened again?

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:31.031
But then we got into our hiding place,

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.033
an apartment that belonged to a family.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.601
We were inside the room

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.302
without the ability to get out,

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.170
of course.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.506
Closed door, closed window.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:42.042
And after 16 days, they relocated us

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.744
to another place, a so-called hospital.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.780
Did anyone tell you what was going

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.915
on, why you were there?

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:51.518
Were they members of Hamas?

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.021
They didn't give us a lot of information.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:56.356
They mainly tried to say that

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:57.991
Hamas wants to release us.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:58.691
But in Israel,

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.361
no one cares about us, which wasn't true.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.229
We didn't believe most of the stuff

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.464
that they were saying.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.332
And of course, it wasn't true.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.001
Just over the border in Israel,

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.335
Darren's husband, Yoni,

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.071
never gave up hope.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.374
Why is daddy not coming?

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:19.746
The stuff

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:22.248
that they've seen on October 7th,

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.650
I couldn't hide from them.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.919
It's like we were in a war movie.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:26.753
But after that,

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.021
it was very important to me

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.522
that they wouldn't feel a danger.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:30.356
And I told them

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.258
there are no terrorists anymore

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:32.792
and we are

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:34.427
good people who are guarding us

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.096
until we can return home.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.098
Were they good to you?

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.201
The people at our welcome,

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.403
they didn't physically harm me,

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:43.937
but there was

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:46.306
a lot of psychological warfare.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.341
Like, what challenges are

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:49.843
that we want to return

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:50.910
to live in the kibbutz?

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.378
Because it's not our house.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.247
It's not the place where we belong.

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:57.584
Did you know if they were Hamas or

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.488
just citizens in Gaza at a local level?

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:02.255
They didn't

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.990
give me a lot of info about them.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.625
I don't even know their names.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.527
I guess that the father is with Hamas,

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.629
but they didn't even give me much info.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.563
I just know he worked

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:11.564
at Israel in the past,

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.099
and that's how he knows Hebrew

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.834
and that's how we communicated.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.970
Were there other children there can?

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.504
Yes.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:19.105
He had children and grandchildren,

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:20.273
and basically his children

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:22.475
were watching us. 24 seven.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.677
I asked every day about my family

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:26.479
if they knew anything about Gary,

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.380
about my brother.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.315
About my brother's baby girl.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.084
They didn't give me any answers.

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:34.254
Why do you think they moved you after

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.056
16 days? 

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:39.325
I think they tried to get our

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.293
hostages together

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:41.728
because the day that we arrived

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:43.363
to this so-called hospital,

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.131
other hostages arrived there as well.

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:46.166
And that was the first time

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.967
that I've met other hostages.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:50.303
Why do you keep saying so-called hospital

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.907
hospital needs to treat sick people?

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.775
It doesn't hold hostages.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:56.776
There were a few times

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:58.511
when the girls had high fever

00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.512
and they were sick

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.147
and I had to take care of them

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.949
and I needed to get the medication.

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.784
So they brought someone who they said

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:06.486
that was a doctor

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:07.520
And the next day

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.622
I got medication from him for the girls.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:11.090
But it wasn't enough.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.525
I used to put a wave in the sink

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:13.393
with cold water

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.128
to bring down her temperature,

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.596
but she was screaming

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.464
and they would tell us to keep quiet.

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:19.732
And the girl had high fever,

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.901
but I had to take care of her somehow.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:24.938
And were you worried that by mistake that

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:27.207
you and your girls would have

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.041
been in danger

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.577
as Israel was trying to retrieve you?

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:34.581
I heard the fighting.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:35.882
And yes, we were scared.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.117
The noises were very strong, very loud.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:39.619
But at least that's how we knew

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:40.820
that something was going on

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.522
in order to get us back home

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:43.790
to put the pressure on Hamas

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.724
to release us.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.826
What did you fear the most

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:48.328
when you were there?

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:51.564
surprisingly

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.499
it was the day that we were released

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:54.667
They were smuggling us

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:55.768
out of the hospital

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:57.470
and they got us on a Hamas vehicle

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.738
to get to a meeting point

00:03:58.738 --> 00:03:59.939
with the Red Cross.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.141
We waited a long time for the Red Cross,

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.176
and we were very scared

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.044
because we didn't know what was going on.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:06.980
No one gave us any info.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.914
Once the Red Cross

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.582
vehicles had arrived, thousands

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:10.383
of Gazans,

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:11.818
thousands children,

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:13.319
elderly everyone

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.820
came in

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.421
and started to climb on the cars

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.023
and bang on the cars.

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:17.657
I was holding

00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:19.659
my girls and I was scared of a lynch mob.

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.094
And this was the first time

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.161
that Rose has said to me,

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:22.862
after a month

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:23.563
and a half of me

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:25.565
protecting her mommy, I'm scared.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:28.301
Today, the girls are back in kindergarten

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.702
and with family therapy

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:32.205
for the most part, are readjusting well.

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:34.674
There was one day

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:36.175
that they saw a tractor here

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:38.177
and they asked if the evil men are here.

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:39.545
And I had to tell them, no,

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:40.880
the tractor does not belong

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.781
to the evil men.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.483
The evil men are in jail.

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:45.518
And while they mourn their grandmother,

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.186
my mom,

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:48.655
Doron, says the healing

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:49.889
cannot really begin

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.257
until all of the remaining

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:54.027
129 hostages are released.

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:57.230
Including God, Moses, I.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.166
The word has to understand

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:02.635
the reality that the hostages are in.

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:03.503
I don't want to think

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:04.771
about how they're treating men.

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:05.438
They're

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:07.040
how they're treating the young women

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.107
that are there.

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:09.475
People who kidnap children

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:11.044
and old people are not human.
