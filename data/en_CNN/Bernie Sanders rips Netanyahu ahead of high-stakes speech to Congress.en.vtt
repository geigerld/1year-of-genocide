00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.934
Israeli Prime Minister

00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:01.935
Benjamin Netanyahu

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:04.270
will address a joint meeting of Congress

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.105
ahead of his speech,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.139
hundreds of protesters

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.607
staged a sit in inside

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:08.141
the Capitol

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.610
calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.278
Dozens of Democratic lawmakers

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:14.014
are planning to skip the speech

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.248
as the party remains

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:17.751
divided over his handling of the war.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.320
CNN's Lauren Fox is with me now.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.789
What are we expecting today? Loren?

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.691
Yeah, this address is coming

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.259
at such a tumultuous time.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.193
And not just U.S.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.396
politics, but also Israeli politics.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.930
And as Benjamin Netanyahu

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.466
faces challenges back home.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.834
This is a high stakes

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.136
speech for him,

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.538
given the fact that there are lawmakers

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.973
who are going to be in this audience,

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.474
who have serious questions,

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:42.809
serious doubts

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.445
about Netanyahu's leadership right now.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.580
And that includes some Republicans.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.115
I was talking last night

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.817
to Senator Joni Ernst.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:51.985
She serves on the

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.319
Armed Services Committee,

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.656
and she said she has to hear a very clear

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.259
and concise message from Netanyahu today

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.194
about the path forward in this war

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:04.464
and how he is going to get hostages home.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:04.864
She said.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.901
It is far beyond time for that to happen.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.436
But you are also going

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:11.037
to see many Democrats

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:12.906
not attending this speech today.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.340
There are more than 80 House

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.141
Democrats

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:15.842
who we know

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:18.211
are going to be boycotting six U.S.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.346
senators who are going to be boycotting,

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.182
including Patty Murray,

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:25.251
who is a top Democrat in leadership,

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.319
who is not going to be

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.521
attending this speech today.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.824
Overseeing it is going to be Senator

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.193
Ben Cardin. He's going to be presiding.

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:35.228
And I think that that just says a lot

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:36.830
about this moment right now

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.698
as Netanyahu comes in

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:40.600
to give this address.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.067
You know,

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.268
there are some Democrats

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:42.735
who are going to be

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.504
having alternative programing.

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:46.306
This is Congresswoman

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.508
Pramila Jayapal, who said in a statement,

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:49.642
instead of attending

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.244
Benjamin Netanyahu's address,

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:53.179
I will attend a panel discussion

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.348
led by the Center of American Progress

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:56.549
and other organizations

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.084
on the path to Peace.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:58.585
This event

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.186
will feature a Palestinian leader,

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:01.354
a Jewish

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:04.290
Israeli leader and a former IDF soldier,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.192
all of whom are dedicated

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.727
to finding a path

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:09.963
toward peace and security.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.564
And I just want to remind people

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.466
that this address is happening

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.268
after the initial invitation

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:18.104
went out from speaker Mike Johnson.

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:18.705
Obviously, it's

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:19.772
going to be really interesting

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.107
to see what House Republicans

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:21.975
think of this speech.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.176
Meanwhile, last night

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.310
on the Senate floor,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.646
a series of Democrats

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:27.914
addressed the issues

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:28.648
that they see

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:29.349
happening

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.250
and concerns

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.451
that they have about Benjamin

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.619
Netanyahu coming.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:33.853
This is independent

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:35.188
Senator Bernie Sanders.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:38.725
It will be the

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.728
first time in American history

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.030
that a war criminal

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.966
has been given that order.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.269
Frankly, this invitation

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.272
to Netanyahu is a disgrace

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:56.075
and something that we will look back on

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:59.078
with regret.

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.181
And earlier this year,

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.449
remember, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.251
actually called on the Israeli people

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.653
to hold a new election

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:09.122
and replace Benjamin Netanyahu.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.290
Laura Fox in Washington

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.691
will be watching this very closely.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:12.959
Lauren, thank you very much.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:13.860
Israeli Prime Minister

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.761
Benjamin Netanyahu

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.162
will address the US Congress

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:17.864
for a record fourth time.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.532
Now he hopes to shore up

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.801
American support for the war in Gaza.

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:23.102
But many of the families

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.103
of Israeli hostages

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.205
still held in Gaza

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.606
are criticizing his trip,

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.373
with some saying

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:28.808
he should have remained at home

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:31.377
to secure a deal to release the hostages.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.612
Now his trip comes amid

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.347
an upheaval in U.S.

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:34.981
politics.

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.249
Though his visit was orchestrated

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.417
by Republican leaders,

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:38.885
many prominent Democrats

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:39.953
like Vice President Harris

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:41.421
and Senator Elizabeth Warren

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.323
won't be in attendance for his speech.

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.092
I'm not going

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:49.095
because, Benjamin Netanyahu

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:52.298
has led that region

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:55.468
into a complete humanitarian disaster.

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:57.971
He has put his own personal interests

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.505
ahead of the interests

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.808
of the people of his country.

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:04.377
And what he has done in Gaza

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:07.013
is unspeakable right now.

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:09.082
Prime Minister Netanyahu is scheduled

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:09.515
to meet

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:11.050
President Biden on Thursday

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.219
and former President Trump on Friday.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.454
CNN's Not a Beshear

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.289
joins us now live from London.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.056
so not a what

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:18.791
can you tell us about the upcoming speech

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:19.359
and what

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.362
Netanyahu here expects to achieve?

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:23.162
Look, mean?

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.530
There is growing pressure

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.833
from representatives and family members

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:27.734
of those hostages

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:30.803
still held captive by Hamas in Gaza.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.639
For Prime Minister Netanyahu

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.640
to strike a deal.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.474
They want that to be

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.576
the focus of his address to Congress.

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:37.744
In fact, we've heard from the

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.212
host of Challenge Forum,

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:40.480
which has said they want to see

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.382
Netanyahu opening his address

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:44.450
by saying that is a deal.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.419
And we have heard some optimistic notes

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.654
from the Israeli prime minister,

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:48.721
and we've even heard some

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:50.757
signs of optimism from U.S.

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:51.791
officials as well.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.358
It's understood

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:53.026
that there is

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:53.459
a clear

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:54.460
framework on the deal

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.561
that they're just hammering out

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.930
those finer details and technicalities.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.765
But as you mentioned,

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.099
there is growing criticism

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:00.933
of the Israeli prime

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:02.468
minister back home in Israel

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:03.603
and from the family members

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:04.570
and representatives

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.738
of those hostages

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:06.906
still have cut to saying that

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:08.408
he should be at home focusing

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:10.677
on the return of those hostages,

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:11.811
bringing an end

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.279
to the war in Gaza, securing

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.881
that ceasefire agreement.

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:15.782
Now, of course,

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:17.417
all eyes will be on his address.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:18.251
Now, as you mentioned,

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.086
we are already seeing backlash

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:21.721
in Washington DC,

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:24.023
not only as members of the Democrat Party

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.525
now choosing to boycott, to

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.726
not attend

00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:28.194
the congressional address

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:29.495
by the Israeli prime minister.

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.597
But we're also seeing protests as well.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:33.566
Of course, we saw protests yesterday.

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:35.168
Members of the Jewish Voice for peace

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.137
movement occupying is staging a sit in

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.439
in congressional building.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.506
We've also seen,

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.407
of course, other protest

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:42.742
taking place across the country

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:45.345
and are expecting to see more today.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:45.945
But of course, that

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:46.612
growing black

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.981
backlash is not only centered in Israel

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:49.749
and in Washington.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:51.684
It is a global backlash.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.086
And, of course, the U.S.

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:54.921
has been vocal in pushing

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:56.989
the Israeli government for a cease fire

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:58.758
deal to be struck.

00:05:58.758 --> 00:05:59.759
Now, at this stage,

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.927
we've heard from President Biden

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.528
speaking on Monday,

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.630
he believes that the parties

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.065
involved in this negotiation

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:07.200
are, in his words,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.134
on the verge of coming

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:09.936
to some sort of agreement.

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.137
The State Department has said

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:12.705
that the gap separating

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:13.973
those two is narrowing,

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:16.142
that there are still some issues

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.176
which remain.

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:19.812
But of course, pressure is mounting.

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:21.714
And of course, the situation in Gaza

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:23.449
is only worsening as well.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.318
If a deal isn't struck soon,

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:27.587
we will be entering ten months

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:28.554
of this war.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:29.722
That is, ten months

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:30.623
with hostages

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:32.091
still held captive in Hamas.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:32.592
That is,

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:34.093
ten months with civilians

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:37.096
in Gaza being killed on a daily basis.

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:39.665
That death toll now topping 39,000.

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:40.533
The UN

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.068
warning that famine is spreading

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.403
throughout the Gaza Strip,

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:43.970
and we are seeing

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.638
the humanitarian situation

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:46.806
worsened with that disease,

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.374
is spreading rapidly

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:49.542
across the Gaza Strip.

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:51.077
We're seeing continued airstrikes

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.512
in southern Gaza as well.

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:54.180
Of course, deadly strikes in Khan

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.914
Younis, where

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.182
hundreds, thousands,

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:56.916
even civilians

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.252
have been ordered to evacuate once again.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.521
So it is a deteriorating situation.

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:04.223
We're seeing mounting pressure from U.S.

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:05.124
officials.

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:06.559
Many have been careful

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:08.027
to clarify that the U.S.

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:08.995
maintains

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:10.530
its strong relationship with Israel,

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.464
that Israel continues

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:12.331
to be

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:13.800
one of the United States closest

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.167
and perhaps

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:16.936
most important allies in the Middle East.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:17.570
But again,

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.571
we have seen those

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:19.572
tensions mounting,

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.674
particularly between President Biden

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:22.842
and the Israeli Prime

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.477
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:26.546
They are expected to meet, of course,

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.580
on Thursday.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.016
Netanyahu now also expected to meet with

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:31.684
with Donald Trump formally as president,

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:34.120
and of course, also with Kamala Harris.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.122
So important meetings taking place.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.657
But all eyes will be on that

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:39.692
congressional address later today,

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.227
expectations around what he might say.

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:42.395
And of course, the reaction,

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:44.997
crucially from the Democrats as well,

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:47.166
and all of the very real dynamics

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:47.767
that you laid out,

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.268
particularly on the humanitarian front,

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:50.937
playing out in the politics of

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:53.039
who will attend Netanyahu's address.

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.707
surely not a Beshear.

00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:56.509
Thank you so much for the reporting.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:57.743
Now, the head of the opposition

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.979
Labor Party in Israel is blasting

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:00.480
the trip.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.248
Yeah, your goal and posting on it,

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:03.049
saying, quote,

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.584
Netanyahu went to the US

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:05.818
for an extravagant show

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:06.986
in the middle of the war

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.989
without a deal to return hostages.

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:10.923
I want to bring in CNN

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:12.391
global affairs analyst Mark Esper.

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:12.892
He was U.S.

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:14.861
defense secretary under President Trump.

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.028
good to see you.

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:16.896
Thanks for being here.

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.664
Now, Secretary of State

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.465
Antony Blinken says

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:20.733
they're inside the ten yard line,

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:21.801
driving toward the goal line

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:22.869
and getting a cease fire.

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.303
That's his metaphor, not mine.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:25.671
But in getting a cease fire

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.873
and hostage agreement

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:29.175
that would produce, a cease fire.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.309
How optimistic

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:31.611
are you of a deal

00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:32.578
getting done at this stage?

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:33.880
And what do you make of Netanyahu

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.914
appearing before Congress

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:36.582
without a finalized deal?

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:39.018
Right.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:39.418
Well, I was

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:40.086
actually with,

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:41.821
Jake Sullivan and Tony Blinken

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:43.222
this past weekend in Aspen,

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:44.423
and we talked about this

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:46.025
and both believe are confident

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:48.060
that we're within the ten yard line,

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.628
as you said.

00:08:48.628 --> 00:08:50.363
But they also note that the often

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:51.030
those last

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.965
ten yards are the most difficult.

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:54.267
look, I would say in some ways

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:55.034
we've been here before.

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:56.402
There have been numerous proposals

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:58.070
on the table for Hamas.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.405
at the last minute

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:00.873
they've raised the ante with,

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.041
asking for adjustments

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.309
and amendments and so forth.

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:04.677
So we'll see.

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:05.611
I mean, there is hope

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:06.078
that there will be

00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:06.846
some type of agreement,

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.614
but my view has been that

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:10.917
Hamas is not going to be interested

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:11.551
in any deal

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.218
that does not call

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.786
for a complete cease fire

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:15.421
and the removal of all Israeli

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:16.689
troops from Gaza.

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:17.123
And,

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:19.058
I see the Israeli government,

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:20.993
Netanyahu unwilling to go there yet.

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:21.761
if you look,

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:24.330
the polling shows that a majority of,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.198
Israelis want to see,

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:28.200
no more Hamas in Gaza.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.435
And they are very concerned

00:09:29.435 --> 00:09:30.703
about what might happen

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.905
if, if Hamas is not dismantled.

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:35.174
So I think they're probably further apart

00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:36.642
than we would like,

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:37.710
but we'll see what happens

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.444
in the coming days.
