WE BEGIN WITH TEAM COVERAGE. ERIN BURNETT IN TEL AVIV STARTS  IT OFF. THAT IS QUITE A CLAIM BY  PRESIDENT HERZOG. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS? &gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT. LET'S GO THROUGH WHAT THEY SAY  THEY FOUND. THEY SAY THEY FOUND A USB ON ONE OF THE HAMAS MILITANTS INVOLVED  IN THE ATTACKS, AND ON THAT USB  THERE WAS INFORMATION FROM WHAT  HAD BEEN AN AL QAEDA 2003  OPERATIONAL MANUAL WHICH  INCLUDED A PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS  ON HOW TO ASSEMBLE A CYANIDE  CHEMICAL WEAPON AND HOW TO  DISPERSE IT WITH CRUDE DRAWINGS. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. THEY ARE HOWEVER CLEAR THAT  THERE WAS NO INDICATIONS AT  LEAST WE'VE RECEIVED NO  INDICATIONS FROM THE ISRAELI  GOVERNMENT THAT THERE WERE ANY  PLANS TO DEPLOY SUCH A WEAPON. JUST THAT IT WAS ON THAT USB. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE WERE  BATTLE PLANS FOUND ON OPERATIVE  AS WELL, WE'VE SEEN THOSE  OURSELVES THAT GO THROUGH EACH  OF THE KIBBUTZIM THAT WERE  ATTACKED, STREET BY STREET, AN  INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF DETAILED  INFORMATION. AND ON THOSE PLANS WE DO KNOW  TALKING TO SECURITY AT AT LEAST  ONE KIBBUTZ THAT THEY FOLLOWED  THOSE TO THE "T" AND WENT ITEM  BY ITEM. SO WE CAN'T MISS THE  SIGNIFICANCE, BUT THERE IS NO  INDICATION AS OF YET THAT THERE  WAS ANY PLAN TO USE ANY SUCH  WEAPON. &gt;&gt; THE BARRAGE OF AIRSTRIKES  OVERNIGHT, 320 TARGETS IS WHAT  THE IDF IS SAYING, WHAT ARE YOU  SEEING AND HEARING THIS MORNING? &gt;&gt; SO 320 AIRSTRIKES, THEY GIVE  OUT NUMBERS MOST DAYS. SO RUNNING AT A 500 STRIKE OVER  48 HOUR PERIOD. THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT  IS HAPPENING IN GAZA. THE PALESTINIAN HEALTH AUTHORITY THERE IS SAYING THAT FOR EXAMPLE NEAR RAFAH THAT THERE WERE FOUR  STRIKES THERE ON INDIVIDUAL  HOMES AND THAT 29 PEOPLE WERE  KILLED. IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY. BUT IT DOES SPEAK TO SOMETHING  BOTH SIDES ARE ACTUALLY AGREEING ON, EVEN IF NOT EXPLICITLY,  WHICH IS THAT THE ISRAELI  STRIKES ARE EXTREMELY TARGETED. SO TARGETING SPECIFIC HOMES  WHERE THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE  ARE LINKS TO HAMAS MILITANTS,  ALSO TALKING ABOUT ISLAMIC  JIHAD, THAT THEY ARE INCLUDING  PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD  TARGETS AS LEGITIMATE TARGETS IN ADDITION TO HAMAS MILITANTS  ITSELF. WE'LL GET TO NIC IN A MOMENT TO  HEAR MORE, BUT THERE ARE DAYS  WHEN WE'VE HEARD THE ASSAULT,  YOU CAN HEAR ARTILLERY. HERE WE DO HEAR OFTEN THE THUDS  OF THOSE BOMBS AND IT HAS BEEN  QUIET TODAY. IT WAS QUIET YESTERDAY. AT LEAST FROM WHERE WE'RE  STANDING AT THE BEGINNING TWO  WEEKS AGO GHOEN I WAS HERE. IT WAS A CONSTANT THUD THAT YOU  COULD ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY FEEL  THROUGH YOUR BODY THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WE ARE NOT HEARING THAT. SO THAT IS DIFFERENT. AND THERE ARE THOSE THOUSANDS OF TROOPS MASSED ALONG THE BORDER  WAITING FOR THE GREEN LIGHT TO  GO IN, ALL UP ALONG THE 25 MILE  LONG BORDER. ISRAELI OFFICIALS HERE HAVE BEEN WARNING FOR DAYS BUT THE  QUESTION ROMAINS WHEN EXACTLY IT WILL HAPPEN. AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE  PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU WHO HAS BEEN PRESENTED WITH MANY POSSIBLE OPERATIONS  THAT HE COULD GREEN LIGHT, THEY  COULD GO ON, SO WE'LL SEE  WHETHER THIS WAIT INDICATES A  SHIFT IN HIS DECISION MAKING ON  WHAT GOING IN ENTAILS. NIC ROBERTSON AS PHIL SAID IS IN ISRAEL. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING? &gt;&gt; Reporter: OVERNIGHT LAST  NIGHT THE LATE EVENING HOURS  INTO THE EARLY MORNING HOURS,  REALLY HEAVY BOMBARDMENT SHAKING THIS HOUSE, THE MOST SUSTAINED  AMOUNT OF MISSILES AND ARTILLERY THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED HERE. AND WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR TWO  WEEKS. TODAY AS YOU SAY MUCH QUIETER. WE HEAR DRONES IN THE SKY, BUT  NO SOUNDS OF IMPACTS HERE IN  NORTHERN GAZA. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE HEARING AS WELL IS THE REASON  THAT THE GOVERNMENT HERE IS --  NETANYAHU'S GOVERNMENT IS SO  CONCERNED ABOUT HUMANITARIAN  PAUSES, THEY THINK THAT THAT  WILL BE USED BY HAMAS TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE, TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF  THE PRESSURE THAT THEY ARE  FACING AT THE MOMENT. AND THIS PRESSURE DESIGNED TO  HELP MOVE ALONG HOSTAGE  RELEASES, TALKING TO SOME OF THE TROOPS WHO ARE CLOSE TO THE  FRONT HERE, THEY TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, BEING TOLD TO BE READY FOR ACTION AND THEN ACTION NOT  COMING AND SORT OF STOOD  UP/STOOD DOWN. BUT SPEAKING TO PAST VETERANS OF WARS HERE, THEY SAY WE'VE BEEN  THROUGH THIS HERE BEFORE, WE CAN STAY OUT AND DO THIS IN THE  FIELD AS LONG AS WE LIKE. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TROOPS  AT THE FRONTLINES, THAT IS A  FORCE WAITING TO GO. BRISTLING WITH BATTLE READY  TROOPS, FARMERS' FIELDS NORTH OF GAZA CHURN WITH A CONTROLLED  FURY OF A NATION READYING FOR AN INCURSION TO STRIKE HAMAS. YET THEY ARE WAITING WITH NO  EXPLANATION WHY. FEELS LIKE THE EARLY RUSH FOR  BATTLE READINESS HAS PASSED. TROOPS  SS ARE DEPLOYED STANDIN. THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG CAN  THEY BE KEPT OUT HERE. ACCORDING TO FORMER IDF GENERAL, AS LONG AS IS NEEDED. THERE ARE MILITARY GAINS. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOW IMPROVING OUR  INTELLIGENCE AND OUR CAPACITY OF TARGETS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT THE POLITICAL  CAL COULD YOU RACE HERE IS MORE  COMPLICATED. &gt;&gt; I THINK BOTH IN WASHINGTON  AND IN JERUSALEM THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEGITIZATION WINDOW IS  CLOSING QUICKLY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: CIVILIAN LOSSES IN  GAZA ARE GROWING. MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEM  CHILDREN ACCORDING TO  PALESTINIAN HEALTH OFFICIALS. LENGTHY NEGOTIATIONS HAVE LED TO TWO AMERICAN HOSTAGES RELEASED. A TINIMENT A OF HUMANITARIAN AID HAS CROSSED INTO GAZA THAT  ISRAEL FEARS ENDS UP IN HAMAS'  HANDS. NETANYAHU CALCULUS OF WHEN TO  SEND IN GROUND TROOPS HAS NEVER  BEEN SO FRAUGHT UNDER PRESSURE  FROM THE WHITE HOUSE FOR MORE  HOSTAGE RELEASES. &gt;&gt; NETANYAHU IS IN A REAL  PROBLEM. HE CANNOT SAY NO TO BIDEN BUT HE CANNOT SAY YES TO THE  HUMANITARIAN AID THAT DRIFTS  INTO NORTHERN GAZA. &gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT HE IS ALSO  UNDER PRESSURE AT HOME TOO. MILITARY AND OTHERS HAWKISH FOR  DECISIVE BLOW AGAINST HAMAS. &gt;&gt; WE ARE FINISHING PREPARING,  YOU KNOW, THE GROUND FORCE  BECAUSE WE'VE CHANGED PLANS, WE  ARE GOING TO -- FOR HEAVY  MANEUVERING. &gt;&gt; Reporter: NETANYAHU'S DILEMMA COMPOUNDED BY HIS DEPENDENCE ON  AMERICAN WEAPONS. &gt;&gt; THE PRESSURE FROM WASHINGTON  IS REAL. IT IS REAL AS STRONG AND THE  PRIME MINISTER SAYS MANY TIMES  TO HIS MINISTERS, LISTEN, WE ARE GETTING FROM THE UNITED STATES  MORE THAN YOU KNOW. &gt;&gt; Reporter: WHERE LESS THAN A  WEEK AGO THESE FIELDS WERE  TEEMING WITH TANKS, TROOPS  MAKING LAST MINUTE REPAIRS,  TODAY JUST TRACKS IN THE SAND. THERE IS A SOLDIER'S JACKET  HERE, BREAD AND BAG ON THE  TABLE. THE QUESTION IS, WHERE HAVE ALL  THE TANKS GONE, FORWARD FOR  INCURSION OR BACK TO BASE FOR A  PAUSE. CLOSE TO THE FRONT LINE IN GAZA  THESE DAYS, MORE QUESTIONS THAN  ANSWERS. AN INCURSION STILL HIGHLY  PROBABLE BUT WHEN. AND WHILE WE'VE BEEN STANDING  HERE THE LAST FEW MINUTES, WE'VE HEARD SMALL ARMS FIRE, GUNFIRE  COMING FROM THIS DIRECTION OVER  HERE WHICH IS THE DIRECTION  TOWARDS THE BORDER. WE CAN'T TELL WHAT IS ACTUALLY  HAPPENING THERE, BUT I THINK  THAT IT IS INDICATIVE OF THE  TENSIONS ALONG THE BORDER FENCE  AT THE MOMENT. &gt;&gt; NIC, HERE IS THE THING PEP I  KNOW YOU ARE SAYING TROOPS CAN  TELLING YOU THAT THEY CAN  INDICATE INDEFINITELY AND YOU'D  EXPECT THEM TO AND ISAY THAT. BUT THE REPORT THAT U.S. IS  PUTTING PRESSURE ON NETANYAHU TO WAIT, IT MAKES SENSE, BUT HOW  LONG CAN NETANYAHU WAIT AND DOES HE LOSE HIS POSITION OF STRENGTH AND AUTHORITY BY APPEARING TO  CAVE TO U.S. INTERESTS ON THE  TIMING OF WHAT HE DOES? &gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU KNOW, I THINK  PART OF THE CALCULUS FOR  NETANYAHU WILL BE WHAT DO HIS  ENEMIES IN THE REGION PERCEIVE. IF THE UNITED STATES AND  INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS ABLE  TO TELL ISRAEL NOT TO GO AFTER  HAMAS, FOR MANY ISRAELIS THAT  WILL ULTIMATELY LOOK LIKE A SIGN OF WEAKNESS AND THE CALCULUS  WILL BE WHAT WILL HEZBOLLAH DO  KNOWING THAT, KNOWING THAT THEY  ARE POTENTIALLY ABOUT TO LAUNCH  ATTACKS ON ISRAEL AT SCALE IF  THE IDF GOES INTO GAZA. SO I THINK THAT THAT ALL BECOMES PART OF THE CALCULUS. CALCULUS THAT ISRAELIS  THEMSELVES GENERALLY DON'T FEEL  SAFE AFTER THE BARBARIC ATTACKS  MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AGO. I THINK THAT HE CAN HOLD BACK  FOR A WHILE, BUT EVERYONE IS  POISED AS AN EXPECTATION. BUT THEN IT BECOME AS QUESTION  WHAT PRECISELY IS THE IN-DURING  GOING TO DO, HOW BIG WILL IT BE, HOW MANY CIVILIANS WILL BE IN  THE WAY OF THAT INCURSION. BUT WHEN IT COMES BACK TO HOW  LONG CAN THEY WAIT, ONE VETERAN  OF THE 1967 WAR, ARAB/ISRAELI  WAR SAID WE WERE HELD IN THE  DESERT FOR A MONTH AND WE  TRAINED, WE PRACTICED. AND ACTUALLY THAT WORKED TO OUR  ADVANTAGE. SO I THINK THAT THE PSYCHE HERE  IS NOT JUST SOLDIERS WILL TELL  YOU WHAT THEY THINK YOU WANT TO  HEAR AND WHAT THEIR COMMANDERS  WANT YOU TO HEAR. I THINK THE PSYCHE IS WHAT IT  TAKES, WE'LL DO.
