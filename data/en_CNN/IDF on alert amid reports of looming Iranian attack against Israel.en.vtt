00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:03.878
Returning out of the Middle East,

00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:05.380
CNN analyst and Axios

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.798
reporter Barak Ravid

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:09.634
is now reporting that Iran has indeed

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:12.637
decided to directly attack Israel.

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:13.888
And though it's not clear

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:15.306
when that might happen

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:16.975
or what form it would take,

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:17.475
the attack

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:18.935
could come reports

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.938
as soon as in the next few days.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:23.106
With us now,

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.524
CNN military analyst

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.026
retired Lieutenant General Mark

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.444
hurdling and former State

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.154
Department Middle East negotiator

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.697
Aaron David Miller.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.532
General, starting with you.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:33.366
What do you expect

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.284
from Iran

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:35.827
as compared to the drone

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.245
and multi missile attacks?

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.497
Some 300 rockets and missiles

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:40.749
that were directed towards

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.250
Israel back in April

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.585
from Iran, directly

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.253
from Iranian territory.

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:46.296
Do you expect something

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:49.299
similar or something different?

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.383
You know, Wolf,

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.718
you can't really say

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.262
it could be a spectrum along that line,

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:55.889
anything from a massive attack

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.307
not only from Iran,

00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:00.310
but also in coordination with Hezbollah

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.228
and with other forces in the area.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.731
The PMF forces in Syria and Iraq,

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.067
as well as the Houthis in Yemen.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.026
Or could

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.445
we see just a kinetic strike

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:11.780
that's precision

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.739
and surgical

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:13.239
in nature

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.825
to show Israel and for Iran

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:17.285
to show their own population

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:18.411
that they are doing something

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.538
about what's struck in Tehran.

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:22.123
So it could be anywhere

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:23.875
between those two extremes.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:26.294
but I think they have to do something

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:28.463
just to appease their own population,

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:30.340
but also to show Israel

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.966
that they are ready to confront them.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.135
But anything that they do do.

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:35.804
could certainly expand

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:37.097
this region into a,

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.432
catastrophic conflict.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:41.392
And that's

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:43.686
certainly what Israeli military officials

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:44.646
are bracing for.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:45.396
Right now,

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:47.982
as I can tell you, based on briefings

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:50.110
that I've had over the past few days.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.237
Aaron, there's been some confusion.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:53.530
Today's, you know, over

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.782
how Hamas is treating Thursday,

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.742
a scheduled cease fire,

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.410
hostage release talks.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.829
What's your read on the statement

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.832
they put out earlier today?

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:05.792
You know, the worst thing in negotiation,

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.793
Wolf, is to

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.336
tell your negotiating partners

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:09.796
that you're in a hurry.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:12.257
And I suspect part of Hamas's calculation

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:13.341
is they know

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.386
that Biden's clock, Netanyahu's clock,

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:17.887
and their own clock

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:19.514
are not really in sync.

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:20.265
The administration

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.517
wants this done yesterday,

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:23.852
and they're evidencing,

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:26.855
all sorts of signs,

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:30.066
which are completely understandable,

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.901
given how fraught

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:34.154
the situation is for the hostages

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.029
and the prospects

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.073
of an, escalation in the northern front,

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:38.533
they know if they could get a cease

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:41.536
fire would also come down the north.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.246
the problem is that

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.165
the Biden clock is not sync.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.124
It seems to me

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.667
either with the Netanyahu clock

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.294
or the similar clock,

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:49.919
and Yankees

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.713
and wire ensconced in some tunnel

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.882
somewhere, is making decisions

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:57.677
based on what he considers to be Hamas's

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.304
needs and requirements.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.265
And those require, a cessation,

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:05.018
a true cessation of military activity

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.312
by the Israelis and Benjamin Netanyahu,

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.439
for his own understandable reasons,

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.773
are not prepared to agree.

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:13.776
So, I think on this one, Wolf,

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:14.444
that Hamas

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.487
ultimately will show

00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:18.907
we'll show for Thursday's meeting

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.825
if the whole thing is not undermined

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:21.701
by a major

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.745
Hezbollah or Iranian strike

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.580
sometime in the next 72 hours,

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:28.666
which is certainly possible.

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:29.542
General Hertling,

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:30.752
is there a scenario

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.671
you can foresee where Iran launches its

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.215
retaliatory attack

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.175
against Israel in the coming days,

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:37.842
and the region

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:38.885
still manages

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:42.263
to avert a much wider regional war?

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.140
What needs to happen for that

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.726
to be how this goes?

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:47.977
Yeah, certainly, Wolf,

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.855
there is that potential and it would be

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:53.858
dependent on Iran holding their fire,

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:55.109
literally not

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.278
conducting the kind of large scale attack

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:58.905
they held last time

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.156
where a lot of Israeli

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.283
citizens could be hurt or killed

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:03.576
if that happens.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.244
What I'd say

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.620
is, Katie, bar the door

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.039
if if Israel is struck to the point

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.541
where there are multiple casualties

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.751
or a lot of deaths,

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.628
I think we're going to see that conflict

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:14.963
spin out of control.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.839
That's the part where I'm very concerned

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.383
because it has to do with

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:19.884
not only what Iranians,

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.719
Iran's action will be,

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:22.345
but as

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:23.554
Aaron David just said,

00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:26.683
also what Hezbollah and Hamas will do,

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.435
to, to to contribute to this,

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.187
but it could certainly rise

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:32.647
into a regional conflict

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.691
or beyond, in my view.

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.151
And I don't think Iran is ready for that.

00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:38.611
Or has the military

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.321
or the diplomat capability

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.240
to do something of that scale.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.449
So they should be very

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.826
careful in what they do next.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.828
Yeah.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:47.745
I think you make a very

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:48.788
important point, general,

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.206
because based on the briefings

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.624
I've been having here,

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.293
if Iran were to do

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.877
a direct assault on Israel

00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:55.628
and wind up

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.422
killing a lot of Israeli civilians,

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.465
especially destroying a lot of buildings

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:00.341
in Tel Aviv,

00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:01.884
where I am right now

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:03.761
attacking military bases,

00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:04.846
Ben-Gurion airport,

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:05.930
the international airport

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.307
outside of Tel Aviv,

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.558
Israel, would respond

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:09.642
with enormous,

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.352
enormous military force

00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:12.270
against Iran,

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.730
something the Israelis believe

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.939
the Iranians would

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.775
deliberately, desperately try to avoid.

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:19.485
But they won't be able to do so.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:21.195
So we'll see if this explodes

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:23.364
into that type of regional war.

00:05:23.364 --> 00:05:24.866
Aaron, this forthcoming attack

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.242
from Iran, as is now

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:27.910
expected against Israel,

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:28.786
is in response

00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:30.997
to the killing of a top Hamas leader

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.790
who was in Tehran.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.584
Obviously, there's more to come here,

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:37.045
but how has that already impacted

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.463
the region altogether?

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.176
You know, I think it has in several ways.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.052
Yeah, it's in wire.

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:44.886
Wolf is now

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:47.055
has now been elevated to the air from us,

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.431
which is something

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.099
frankly, we all knew from the beginning

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.185
that he's the major decision maker.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.020
I will say, though, that Mark

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.146
generally raises

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:56.856
a critically important point,

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:59.108
and that is the Hezbollah piece of this.

00:05:59.108 --> 00:05:59.400
You know,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.526
it takes 12 minutes

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.153
for a cruise missile,

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.863
to impact in Israel,

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.198
assuming it's not intercepted

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.324
once from Iran.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.034
We're talking a minute and a half.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:08.618
Well,

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.370
probably less time

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.329
for Hezbollah's high

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.372
trajectory weapons

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.582
and its precision guided munitions

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:16.167
to strike Israel proper.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.961
The real damage here, frankly,

00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:21.547
it is not going to come from Iran.

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.257
It's going to come from Hizbollah.

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:25.218
But I really do believe that both.

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.594
And again, Hurley's right.

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:27.804
I don't think Hezbollah

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.598
nor Tehran is interested

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.601
in the kind of strike that would trigger,

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.979
a massive Israeli response, a response,

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:37.897
I might add, Wolf.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.524
And the Iranians know this

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:41.317
that could easily,

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:43.778
draw in the United States.

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.613
The question is, what will be

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.199
the fine line

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.575
between doing something

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:51.285
that is significant

00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:52.745
but not triggering the

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:53.955
regional escalation?

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:55.039
That would create something

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.249
the Middle East Wolf

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.792
has never seen before,

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:58.584
a genuine

00:06:58.584 --> 00:06:59.919
multi-front

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.922
war involving Lebanon, Syria, Iraq.

00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:06.008
Yemen, Israel, and perhaps,

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:07.635
even an Israeli

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:09.846
and US military involvement,

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.557
against Iran.

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:13.766
Yeah, it's a really,

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:15.726
really dangerous situation right now.

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:16.686
General Hurley, before

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:17.145
I let you go,

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.729
I want to close with a quick question

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.440
on Ukraine right now,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.065
which is seeing

00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:24.068
some serious, deterioration as well.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.611
the Ukrainian government claims

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.737
that Russian troops

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:27.613
set fire

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:28.990
near the Zaporizhzhia

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.993
nuclear plant in, in in Ukraine.

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:34.245
What's your read on on that situation?

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:37.206
How dangerous is it unfolding right now?

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.250
Yeah, I've been watching the,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.168
Ukrainian front

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.377
for the last seven days

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:42.336
and have been amazed.

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:42.879
Wolf,

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.255
this, fire that's

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.673
occurring at the Zaporizhzhia

00:07:45.673 --> 00:07:46.841
power plant,

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.385
I believe, in all intelligence,

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:50.303
at least all open

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.054
source retaliations is saying

00:07:52.054 --> 00:07:53.431
that it's the result of

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:57.351
a tire fire in inside or near

00:07:57.518 --> 00:08:00.521
the, the, the smokestack or the

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.273
the the stack of the

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:03.941
the nuclear power plant.

00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:05.902
That is to distract.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:06.944
And it's a Russian way

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:08.738
of doing distraction.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:09.697
Remember,

00:08:09.697 --> 00:08:12.325
Russia has control of that power plant.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.243
They have forces in the area.

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:17.163
There are IAEA, members

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.123
there as well saying what's happening?

00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:21.959
They say all radiation is safe still,

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:23.294
but they are very concerned.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:24.921
They've been saying that for months.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.797
But the fact that Russia would,

00:08:26.797 --> 00:08:31.093
would, start a tire fire to envelop

00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:32.345
smoke into the area

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.931
and indicate that something's going on.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.766
It's just another approach by Mr.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.851
Putin to, conflict.

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.853
What's going on in this area

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:42.396
and cause more danger,

00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:44.315
to not only Ukraine,

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.816
but also the entire region.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.945
Let me follow up a general.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:49.612
what do you make of

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:52.740
the Ukrainian incursion into Russia?

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.951
We're now told some 20 miles.

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:55.993
Ukrainian forces

00:08:55.993 --> 00:08:58.788
have moved inside Russia.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.414
Yeah, it's been fascinating for me.

00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:03.417
Well, first I thought this was a raid.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:04.418
They have conducted

00:09:04.418 --> 00:09:06.212
these kind of cross-border raids

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.130
with small forces in the past.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.090
It now appears

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.716
to be more of a demonstration.

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:11.551
I certainly wouldn't

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.553
call it an offensive yet.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.720
the key is going to be,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.556
can they sustain this fight?

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.224
When you put that many forces

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.392
and there's apparently

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:22.436
two brigades or more of Ukrainian forces

00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:23.729
have gone across the border,

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.690
not just of of, Kurz,

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.400
but also in Belgrade.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.235
you need a lot of logistics

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:32.113
for an armored force that goes 20km.

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:33.489
They've been there seven days.

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:33.823
They need

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:36.951
water, fuel, ammunition, supplies, parts.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:39.704
So we'll see how long they're in there.

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.622
They have taken a lot of prisoners.

00:09:41.622 --> 00:09:42.665
Estimates are over

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.709
a couple of hundred Russian prisoners

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.210
that have already been taken.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.878
And there are some indications

00:09:47.878 --> 00:09:48.588
of movement

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.590
of Russian reinforces

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.508
reinforcements into the area

00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:53.801
to counter it.

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:55.553
there's no proof of that just yet.

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.555
The fighting has not been intense,

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.015
other than beyond the border,

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.474
the border guards and the forces

00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:01.601
that were in the area.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:02.852
So this is Ukraine

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.854
saying we can do the same thing

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:06.480
the other thing that I'd point out,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.732
Wolf, is indications

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:10.443
are that it's Western style vehicles,

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.111
the ones that have been given to Ukraine

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:14.030
that are conducting most of this attack.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.072
And one of the things

00:10:15.072 --> 00:10:16.949
that I find most fascinating

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.492
is having been a Stryker

00:10:18.492 --> 00:10:19.869
brigade commander,

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.662
it appears that strikers in the air

00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:22.580
are in the areas.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.706
They move fast.

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:25.750
They're very mobile, they're very quiet.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.335
And there are exactly fitted

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:29.086
for this kind of operation.

00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:30.338
That would be a quick strike

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:31.255
inside of a country.

00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:32.840
And then to pull back very quickly

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.759
without the need for a lot of logistics.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:37.386
It's potentially a very,

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:38.596
very dangerous situation

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.556
unfolding between Ukraine and Russia

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:41.223
as well.

00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:42.308
General Hertling, Aaron

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.601
David Miller, to both of you.

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.561
Thank you very much for your analysis.
