zdq3NVtT6Nc,The history of Gaza in 2 minutes,data/en_CNN\The history of Gaza in 2 minutes.jpg,"Gaza is only about 25 miles
long and seven miles wide.
But this small strip of land
is one of the most
fought over in history.
It was an Egyptian base,
a royal city for the Philistines
and the place
where the Hebrew hero,
Samson, betrayed by Delilah,
met his death.
Since then, much blood has been spilled.
The most recent contest for Gaza began
at the end of World
War Two,
when persecuted Jews
traveled to Israel from Europe
looking for a new start
After the horrors of the Holocaust.
In 1947,
the United Nations
created a plan to split
Palestine into two lands
one for Jews and one for the Arab people.
Backed by the U.S.
President, Harry Truman.
David Ben-Gurion, Israel's
founder, proclaims
the establishment
of the State of Israel in 1948.
Egypt then attacked Israel
through the Gaza Strip.
Israel was victorious,
but Gaza remained
under the control of Egypt,
and an influx of Palestinian refugees
began.
In 1967, war broke out between Israel,
Egypt, Jordan and Syria
in what became known as the Six-Day War.
Israel seized the Gaza Strip
and held it for 40 years.
Israel pulled its forces
out of Gaza in 2005.
In 2006, Hamas, a group sworn
to destroy Israel
and listed by the United States,
the European Union
and others as a terrorist group,
won a landslide victory
in Palestinian legislative elections.
Hamas was now in
control of the territory.
However, Israel's deal controls
much of the areas access
to and from the Gaza Strip.
Since then, Israel and Hamas
have been exchanging blows.
Israel maintains
that Hamas is a violent terror
organization.
Of Hamas says
that they represent an oppressed people
being victimized by the Jewish state.
The international community continues
to press for a cease in violence.
But for now,
the strip's
population of 1.8 million people
are trapped in the crossfire.",20231009

major Israeli
Major Ben Wall houses
the Israel Defense Forces.
Spokesperson A major,
thank you so much for joining us,
first of all.
What's the
latest on the ground right now?
Thank you, Wolf.
The situation
now is that we have secured the South.
We no longer have hundreds of terrorists
streaming across the border
trying to kill our civilians.
We still have forces
that are going house by house,
making sure that none of them are left.
Hundreds streamed across the border.
Two days ago,
entered into more
than 20 towns and cities.
So our forces are still going house
by house
to make sure that none of them are left.
At the same time, as your viewers know,
we are undergoing
continuous rocket fire
into our cities, indiscriminate.
And that's the current situation.
So is it true
that Israel is now in full control
of all of its land at this hour?
Yes, that is correct.
We have fortified the border
fence on Gaza as well.
We have strained forces down there
and they are working to make sure
that the entire south is safe and secure.
Prime Minister Netanyahu,
as you well know, said today
that the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza,
in his words, are only the beginning.
Are we looking right now at a ground war
here as well?
Well, Hamas's attacks are continuing.
The rocket fire is continuous.
I'm sitting here in Tel Aviv
at my house in Tel Aviv.
My children are continuously going
from upstairs down to the basement
to the bomb shelter.
Sirens all throughout Israel.
So the IDF has been directed
by the government to stop those attacks.
And we'll do
what's needed in order
to stop those attacks
and make sure that Hamas doesn't
have the capability to renew them.
So you're clearly leaving open
the possibility
of a major Israeli ground invasion into
Gaza to deal with that.
The IDF
has many capabilities
and we are going to deploy them all
in order
to stop Hamas's ability
to keep attacking our civilians.
As you know, major Hamas is saying
it will start executing
the civilian hostages
taken from Israel into Gaza
and broadcasting it
if Israel targets
people in Gaza without warning.
Will that change Israel's response
at all?
Well, that shouldn't surprise anyone.
Hamas's war here is a war on civilians.
It started with a massacre of women,
children, elderly, entire families.
They kidnaped tens of
families and people
and young people, toddlers, elderly women
are there continuously
firing rockets at our civilians.
And at the same time,
they're hiding behind their civilians
in Gaza
to try and avoid attack from us
and cause more civilian casualties.
So it's not surprising
that they would say something like that.
And our priority is to make sure
that Hamas cannot carry
any of that out
and cannot continue attacking us.
Do you believe, Major,
that some of the hostages
may already be dead?
I don't have the
information to give you that. Now.
It's also for operational reasons.
But obviously, our highest priority
is to protect our people at home
and also protect those people in Gaza.
And that's
what our forces are doing in the land,
sea and air.
Major Ben Wall,
House of the Israeli
Defense Force and spokesperson,
thanks very much for joining us.
Thank you.
And the war has tragically hit
very close to home for my next guest,
a man
who has been on our network
many times over the years.
Mark is the former U.S.
ambassador to Morocco, former White House
adviser on Middle East policy.
As well,
he just announced the death
of his nephew,
Elie Ginsburg, a lieutenant commander
for Israel.
Ambassador,
thanks so much for joining us.
You and I have known each other
for many years.
We are so, so sorry for the loss.
This your loss this evening.
What do you know so far
about what happened to your nephew?
Well, Elie
was a lieutenant commander
and a Navy SEAL in Israel,
and he had just retired from serving
as an operational commander
for Mossad three weeks ago
and was called up
to lead his unit into Kibbutz
Rai, where the music festival
was taking place to rescue hostages
that were being held by Hamas.
And Brian, one of the efforts to
break down
one of the apartment buildings.
He was shot and killed
by a Hamas terrorist.
I found that out for my sister
in law this morning.
I'm here in Morocco doing earth
relief work.
So it's had
been a terrible day for my family and I.
Our hearts go out to you, of course.
Give us a little bit
more about your nephew, Ambassador.
What was he like?
Oh, Elie.
He was.
He was the
oldest of my three
nephews who was raised on a kibbutz
in this government.
My brother Mike
had been killed up there in 2006,
so Elie had lost his father to Hezbollah
and a Hezbollah attack in the war.
And I know he was raised there,
someone dedicated to Israel's
military prowess.
He I mean, the fact that he became
not only a Navy SEAL,
but also
the lieutenant commander
for the Navy SEALs
and then trained in the United States
at the U.S.
Naval Academy.
And
in order to
develop his his skills to train Israelis
and in special commando operations.
I mean, he just worked in the last year.
Right. Pretty secret, Wolf.
But for those of us
who and I particularly was his
I guess, substitute father,
we were so proud of him.
He leaves a beautiful wife in a kibbutz
and four children,
as well as two brothers
and my sister in law.
And we're all morning
I can't make it,
unfortunately, to the funeral tomorrow
because the flights
are extraordinarily hard.
But I'll make it to Israel
to be with my family as soon as I can.
And when you do, please
pass along our deepest,
deepest condolences to your family.
As you know, the Israeli prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, has warned
there will be difficult days ahead
and that Israel will go on offense
against Hamas.
In his words, like never before.
What do you think that looks like
specifically over
the next 24 to 48 hours?
Well, I've I've listened to both you
and I know
I've spent an enormous amount of time
in Israel as well as in Gaza.
I've watched the successive efforts
by Israel to try to quell Hamas.
But I'll tell you, Wolf, my biggest fear,
based on the fact
that my family lives
up on Kibbutz Maccabi,
I'm on the Lebanese border,
is that diabolically, given my own view
and hatred for Hezbollah and Hamas,
it's very conceivable
that part of the scheme here
directed by Iran
is to exhaust Israel's
supply of Iron Dome missiles,
because
Hezbollah, as you well know,
Wolf, and you're an expert on this,
if if Hamas fire 2000 to 3000 missiles
at Israel in a matter of two days, Hamas,
Hezbollah has 150,000 guided missiles
and no Iron Dome system
that Israel currently has
and is already badly depleted
can withstand that type of attack.
It's a serious, very serious situation,
as I continue
to say,
and I hope I'm wrong,
this war is only just beginning.
Ambassador Mark Ginsberg,
our deepest, deepest condolences
to you and your family.
Thank you very much for joining us.",20231010

warning it will execute the hostages
it kidnapped over the weekend
if Israel continues to retaliate in Gaza.
I want to bring in shelly shem tov.
Hamas kidnaped her 21 year old son, Omer
from the supernova
Music festival on Saturday.
They kidnaped him and took him to Gaza.
Shelly,
when did you last year from your son?
A I heard from my son
on a Saturday morning at 8:00
when he was he called us that he is in
he was in panic and he told us that
they are shooting guns and
big mess there.
And he tried to escape
with the friends car
and
my daughter told him to
to send
a Google Live or
and and he sent us
the Israel that they give your life
and then we
so he told us I will talk with you.
I will talk with you.
And then we saw in the Google live map
that he is going to
to near the border.
And then we saw that he's moving into
Gaza.
And it was the last
time that we contacted him.
Do you do you know anything
about his condition right now?
Has has Hamas
or the IDF or the Israeli government?
Has there been any communication?
Yeah,
I don't know what is what his condition.
I know on the air on Saturday night,
we got a telegram video that almost
he was lying down in the back
of a pickup truck and handcuffed.
And this is the video that.
So I so that so that he's alive
and he looks and that is he's okay.
He didn't get hurt.
And so I know he's alive.
But from that video
until now, I don't know Nothing.
Nothing.
What message would you want
to convey to the kidnapers?
The people that have him right now?
What do you want to tell them?
If they're watching right now,
I just want my
my baby, my my son back.
And I want it to end.
And I want to say
to everybody that I'm in nightmare
and I'm it's a nightmare that that is
few days left, that I don't know
what to do and how to help my son.
I cannot tell him.
And
the things that I think that I want
is only that he will come back
and
that's it.
That's it.
Shelly Shem Tov.
We will be thinking
and praying for your son.

xTHV_9KHs8Q,How Hamas won and kept control in Gaza,data/en_CNN\How Hamas won and kept control in Gaza.jpg,"Slick propaganda,
a blatant threat and published last year.
Hamas gunmen
training a motorized paragliders.
They also showed meticulous planning
for fighting in built up areas.
All an historic failure
of Israeli intelligence.
Hamas videos
of the start of their assaults from Gaza
were published
within hours of its launch.
Once a branch of the Muslim
Brotherhood, Hamas,
a Sunni movement,
won Palestinian elections in 2006
on a platform of social reform
and resistance to Israel.
Riven by corruption
and incompetence, rivals Fatah
launched attacks immediately
against the movement,
which denies the right of Israel
to exist at all.
In the end, Hamas won control of Gaza
and its grip on the enclave of around
2 million people tightened
as Israel and Egypt
largely sealed it off,
causing intense humanitarian problems.
Hamas responded with
waves of rocket attacks
against Israel that got worse
as the years went by.
Israel counterattacked from the air
and with ground assaults that left
thousands dead and Hamas still in charge.
But Iran's influence has been key
to Hamas's military power.
The Iranians have trained
Palestinian engineers
and how to establish rocket
manufacturing in Gaza.
We know that the Iranians have provided
production, social production equipment,
which you need
for the production
of solid propellant rockets to Gaza
and to other places as well.
Israel knows
it must battle Hamas on its own
turf in urban areas,
latticed with explosive traps
and riddled with secret tunnels.
And Hamas
will draw on the experience
of Iran backed Hezbollah,
which ravaged Israel's armor in 2006.
All the while trying
to protect the lives
of at least 130 hostages that Hamas says
they will kill
if Israel's attacks continue.
Dealing with violent groups
backed by Iran,
a country
that's bent on destroying Israel
and building a nuclear weapon
that could do just that.
Sam Kiley, CNN.
Some perspective now from New York Times
foreign affairs
columnist Thomas Friedman,
who's been covering the region
and writing about it since the 1980s.
His bestselling account from Beirut
to Jerusalem is considered required
reading for students.
The Middle East.
Tom, why do you think this
attack happened now?
Why did Hamas choose to strike now?
Was it
divisions within Israel
that they sense
the the the looming Saudi deal?
I have to believe that
the looming Saudi deal
was a big factor in this,
because we're talking about something
that would have been
a fundamental geopolitical shift
in the region.
Saudi Arabia
normalizing relations with Israel
opens ties up between Israel
and really the
the rest of the
of the Muslim world,
possibly Indonesia, Malaysia.
It would be a huge strategic shift.
But more importantly, Anderson,
it also would have had to have been done
as part of a deal
that would have,
I think, strengthened
the legitimacy of Hamas's archrival,
the Palestinian Authority, in Ramallah,
because that normalization
between Israel and Saudi
Arabia could only have been done
if Israel also made concessions
to the Palestinian Authority.
Give me a greater control
over certain areas in the West
Bank, administrative control,
putting some kind of
freeze of settlements down
and and basically reviving hopes
for a two state solution.
So I think both of those were in play.
And at the same time,
I think it sense
that Israel
was completely distracted by a needless
judicial coup inside
and the two came together properly.
The big question,
of course, about
the level of Iran's involvement.
You know, U.S.
officials have said
they haven't seen a smoking gun,
but certainly Iran supports Hamas.
Islamic Jihad, certainly.
Yeah.
I mean, again,
no one, I think, has a smoking gun.
But same time,
Iran's overriding interest in
not seeing its two arch
enemies, Israel and Saudi Arabia,
forge an agreement together.
I think it is really apparent there.
Otherwise,
the thing is, even beyond being barbaric,
even more senseless and stupid
than that, than it appears if Hamas
just did this on some fleeing
for no apparent reason
other than had the resources,
it's now, you know, visited
just tremendous
destruction on itself
on Palestinians in Gaza and maybe lost
a strategic number of weapons
that it will it will hopefully
you'll never be able
to threaten Israel again.
So I can only believe
it had something to do with that Iran
with that Saudi Israel
normalization deal.
The Israeli government
has called
for a complete siege of of Gaza.
Benjamin Netanyahu spoke
today, did not specifically
talk about a ground incursion,
but certainly
that would seem to be in the cards
or certainly a strong possibility.
We all know the difficulties of that,
the inherent dangers in that.
We know the international outrage
that will
that will grow
the as conditions deteriorate in Gaza
and the civilian population suffers.
You know,
Israel risks a lot by a ground invasion,
not just in blood
of of of their people, of their soldiers,
but also in in
in actually being able to
to get what they want.
I mean, doesn't it?
It can actually go in.
It can actually play into
the hands of Iran, can't it?
Well, you
know, in these kind of moments, Anderson,
I always ask myself,
and I'm sure Israel's asking itself,
I hope it is, what does my enemy want?
And then let's do exactly the opposite.
So what do Israel's
enemies want right now?
Iran and Hezbollah and Hamas.
They want Israel
to occupy Gaza, get enmeshed in a,
you know, door to door, house
to house fighting. There,
kill a lot of Palestinian civilians
and completely erode
the moral high ground
that it has right now,
which does have real value.
That's what they want.
They don't care less about their people.
If they did, Hamas would have been
governing Gaza
in completely different way.
I hope that Israel can achieve its goals
of restoring its detergent, deterrence,
getting its hostages back,
but doing it in a
way that is not against
the aims of Hamas.
These are hard calls I recognize.
But you don't want underplay it.
You don't want to overplay it.
But I hope Israel
does not have to go into Gaza
and or if it does,
doesn't go far or deep.
Is it
possible, though, for Israel
to avoid going into Gaza?
I mean, if they want to stop,
Hamas is military capabilities
moving forward
from being able
to do the same kind of attack?
What other option is there?
Well, I think that
one of the things
that Hamas has done, again, which
sort of leaves
you wondering what they were thinking
among many things, is that
they've they've shown Israel
every vulnerability it had in Gaza.
And they they did that
for the purpose of inflicting, you know,
seven or 800
civilian and military casualties
on Israel.
But now, where are you, Hamas?
How are you better off?
Are the Palestinians of Gaza better off?
But you've just shown Israel
when blessedly for Israel, that
it had all these vulnerabilities.
They will the Israelis will study this.
They will close them.
Hamas is now fired off a lot of weapons.
Also shown Israel
what new missile technology it had.
So I think there's a lot of things
that Israel can achieve in the long
run that will leave Hamas
much more weakened without
having to go in
and try to reoccupy the place, because
if not, you know,
maybe there's only one thing
worse than Hamas controlling Gaza,
and that's nobody controlling Gaza
or Israel happening to control Gaza.
And so, you know, this is this problem
hasn't been insoluble
for so many years for a reason.
And, you know,
I think this is a time for Israel
to do deep
thinking about how deep it gets in.
I'm sure they are. But I think
this is a really
some critical decisions
got to be taken here.
There are, I'm sure,
plenty of the civilians in Gaza who
oppose Hamas,
who don't like the Hamas regime, and yet
they don't really have anywhere to go.
I mean, Israel,
you know,
the IDF will say go to other areas.
But it is it's so densely packed,
it is very difficult
for civilians in Gaza.
And that's why, you know, Anderson,
some problems are kind of insoluble.
Unless Israel wants to completely
occupy Gaza
and nurture a completely different kind
of Palestinian government there
and stay there
probably multiple generations,
it would take,
it's going to have to deal with
some form, most likely, of Hamas.
I think the point is to put Hamas
in a situation
where it can never
do this kind of attack again,
where it's on the defensive
in international circles and is deterred.
But I think deterrence is
is the only outcome here.
You're not going to remake Gaza.
You know, the notion of you know,
of completely transforming
that situation through military means,
it is not going to happen.",20231010

Cy6vewZo3jY,Military expert shows on map where Israeli forces will face challenges in Gaza,data/en_CNN\Military expert shows on map where Israeli forces will face challenges in Gaza.jpg,"As questions about hostages remain it appears
preparations for a ground offensive in gaza
are under way.
Let's take a closer look at gaza with retired
major Mike lions.
Appreciate you being here.
To start, we hear constantly about just how
tight it is in gaza for lack of a better term.
About 2 million people, an area about the
size of Chicago.
What complications does that bring for any
type of ground offensive?
&gt;&gt; Tremendous.
I think we're going to potentially see casualties
and civilian casualties like we haven't seen
since the second World War, just based on
what Israel has said.
They declared war here.
Are use the word like siege.
Siege from military perspective means flatten.
We're going to surround, choke off the supply.
I want to talk about the courageous CNN crew.
They're sitting right here.
And they're so close to that gaza border here.
What -- missile fire coming from on the other
side.
Hamas is still firing rockets
[6:26:34 AM]
Hamas is still firing rockets inside of Israel.
And so, the airframes you hear are Israel
forces on kind of stationed ready to go ready
to knock them out.
Just shows me they still have capacity.
They have not stopped with regard to attacks
Israel.
&gt;&gt; What are the biggest challenges for Israeli
forces?
If we do see the ground incursion, nic made
a very good point because he had years of
experience covering the region, that in his
estimation, they are not amassed enough at
this point for an imminent incursion, that's
his read on the ground.
When ever it may happen if it does what are
the challenges they face once they get inside
gaza.
&gt;&gt; It will take them a while to wound up.
It will take days in order of 300,000 reservists
mobilized.
What are their objectives?
Attack from different sides?
Going to come from this side here, cut off
hamas troops?
Obviously this is where the center of gravity
is here with regard to where the hamas troops
are.
I think Israel has to be very
[6:27:34 AM]
I think Israel has to be very concerned overall
about from a strategic perspective.
They have enemy here coming in this direction.
They have Hezbollah coming up from the north.
If they can mass troops in the west bank,
this is the problem trying to fight war on
three fronts.
That's why they call 300,000 troops up.
Once they go back to gaza, once they get into
this location here, it's going to be street
fighting, house to house and again large civilian
casualties.
&gt;&gt; We talk about the strikes that we have
seen over the course of the last several days.
There have been air strikes.
We have seen numerous strikes very specific
facilities, at least according to the idf
and what their targets are.
What do those tell you?
&gt;&gt; They're going after if you look at some
things.
These are mosques now.
They're taking everything off the table with
regard to collateral damage again.
Normally the military wouldn't attack these
kinds of targets.
They're saying they are clearly military targets.
And in this case they're leaving nothing behind.
You know, in the past they would be more discriminate
with regard they would go after, specific
[6:28:36 AM]
they would go after, specific things.
Here they are literally leveling all the kind
of targets they going after.
There's nothing left now.
&gt;&gt; Those are both mosques you're showing in
the before and after.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; On Saturday, there was rockets fired from
Hezbollah southern Lebanon into Israel and
bit of a pause secretary blinken said and
yesterday seeing more.
Can you speak to the complication of trying
to fight Hezbollah in the north of Israel
while doing the rest?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
That's really what Israel has to be concerned
about because they'll have to put troops to
the north here.
This is where they would come from here.
Also, it would introduce, we warned now, the
Syrian government says, look, if Hezbollah
decides to come in, they're good fighters.
They've been part of the Syrian civil war.
They have that kind of experience.
Opens up a front where Damascus becomes a
target in this area here.
I think Israel will be forced to put ground
troops up there.
What Israel's advantage here is shock effect.
They bring tanks, air power.
The problem is the enemy is not fighting that
kind of battle.
&gt;&gt; This isn't conventional.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
[6:29:36 AM]
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
They prepared for a war that they didn't get.
&gt;&gt; What are Hezbollah's capabilities compared
to hamas?
&gt;&gt; Better.
Better, more, greater capability.
Again, still don't really have that shock
effect, but they're good fighters.
There's more of them.
Israel has to be concerned.

aQIWFW0RUUE,Hamas fires hundreds of rockets at Israeli city,data/en_CNN\Hamas fires hundreds of rockets at Israeli city.jpg,"Okay.
This is video from moments ago.
You can see rockets being fired from Gaza
Our reporter
Nic Robertson
is just over the border from Gaza
in Israel. Inside the road.
Nic, why don't you tell us
what you're seeing
Yeah,
we are seeing a massive barrage of
Iron Dome intercepts in the sky.
Here.
You can just make out the tiny
puffs of white smoke in the sky.
Each one of those puffs
is an intercept of an Iron Dome defensive
missile system taking down Hamas rockets.
And you can see over my shoulder
that some of the
traces of the rockets themselves
that have been fired through the sky,
it looks as if those
those iron domes were stopping
the rockets going to the two
big Israeli towns along the coast.
There
Ashkelon with the power station and ash.
Ashdod further up the coast there
you could see the missiles coming out
from the Iron Dome
and intercepting
with the rockets in the sky.
So literally in the last
in less than an hour
from here,
there's been attacks,
missile attacks,
Hamas missile
attacks on on this town start.
There's been
missile attacks on Tel Aviv as well.
We saw those rockets going out
and there have been these rocket missile
attacks on Ashkelon and Ashdod,
it appears.
So at this moment.
This afternoon, Hamas is clearly showing
it's got firepower left.
It's got the longer-range
weapons
that it was always difficult
for it to produce.
They can reach as far as central Israel.
It's got the shorter range ones
that can come in here
and the mid-range ones
that can reach up along the coast.
So Hamas is showing that
despite all the strikes on it so far,
it has the capability
and the reserves of rockets to continue
firing out.
Nic Robertson, stand by if you can.
And it is safe.
I just want to give people a sense
of where you are.
You can see in red here is Gaza.
If we can put it back up there.
This is enrolled right here.
This is where Nic Robertson is
just over the border from Gaza.
He could hear Iron Dome,
that is Israeli air
defense missiles
being shot up into the sky.
To get rockets
that were being fired from Gaza.
And as Nic was explaining here,
some of the targets
of these rocket attacks
from Gaza appear to be Ashkelon
and Ashdod.
Here, Israeli cities
right on the Mediterranean coast.
Nic Robertson, again, back to you.
How constant is this
and do you feel like
you're hearing more outgoing?
Can you distinguish
between the outgoing from Gaza
and the air intercepts from Israel?
Yes, the outgoing from
Gaza, you see,
because there's the
the white trailers behind the rockets.
So you see them
particularly the longer-range ones.
At night,
you see them outgoing
because of sort of the orange burn,
a trail on the back of the rocket
and the intercepts start out as well.
But you can actually I can
I can
I have a rough idea
of their firing positions now
because you see them come up,
you see a little red
dot flying through the sky
and then it explodes
into a puff of white smoke.
You hear the percussion from it
when it intercepts with that rocket.
So the dynamics of how this works.
We have a very good vantage point here.
All right, Nic Robertson, stand by.
You're in Surratt.
Let's go over to Clarissa Ward.
We can see her shot up right now.
Clarissa, if you can hear us.
You're in Ashkelon, Also, rockets firing.
What are you experiencing
Yes.
Okay.
We had
seen on
the Hamas Telegram channel
that they were warning
that there was going to be
some kind of a threat
that they told people to leave.
By 5 p.m.,
we got here literally it's 5 minutes
to five. Air raid sirens start.
I was there.
I should just say
sirens started going off
We were immediately
dragged into the bunker
by another person here and massive
amount of missiles
just slamming in all around.
We also heard hi, Fred.
We also heard there's
other journalists here as well.
Obviously,
we also heard the Iron Dome intercepting
some of them.
You can
actually smell
the smell of the explosives
coming from
some of the balconies out there.
So unclear at the moment
how many of these rockets
may have made impact
or what
the damage may be,
what the casualty rate may be.
But certainly
a lot of rockets were fired.
The hotel was
a relatively secure location.
Okay.
We're hearing more sirens coming again.
So I'm just going to move
away from the window
and
the other
shelters over there.
Do we want to go towards the shelter?
Well, let's just say sorry.
So the bunker the bunker is this way
we've moved this place
just moving into this bunker here.
This is actually where we were
when the last barrage came in as well.
Every floor of the hotel has a bunker
like this. Yeah.
You can hear some activity out there.
It's not anything like it was
on that previous round.
I don't know
if you're picking up on that.
That sounds like maybe interceptions.
It's difficult to know,
but that's what it sounds like.
But it's a bit quieter now.
We're trying also
to send in
some video that we
captured from inside the bunker
when the first round of rockets went off.
And
but yeah,
just waiting to see and get some clarity.
Yeah.
Clarissa, what we're showing,
I want to give viewers
some point of reference here.
You're in Ashkelon.
You've got incoming.
You guys are in a bunker right now.
Stay there with me, if you will.
Clarissa, on the other
side of your screen,
everyone, what you're
where you can also see
is to rot
where there is incoming as well.
John's over at the wall
and he can show in relation
to what these two areas
that we're talking about.
As we go
back, Clarissa, stick with me
as we go back to Nic Robertson.
Nic, you're seeing incoming as well.
Talk us through it.
So the
vantage point that
we have here,
we can see the rockets
coming out of Gaza.
I can see those rockets coming up.
Then there were the intercepts
and that's
when Clarissa was getting the warning
to go to the bunker.
The sirens were picking it up.
Clarissa is over there in Ashkelon, close
to those power station chimneys.
The three big chimneys
you see on the horizon.
That's where she is.
And I'm just sort of going to duck down,
I suppose,
here to see that
so that John can get a better view.
So you see the rockets
come up
where John's pointing the camera
now out of Gaza,
and then they're flying up into the sky
and being picked up by the Iron Dome
as I was flying towards
Ashkelon, where where Clarissa is.
And then the Iron Dome
kicks off and starts intercepting them.
And that's the
what was the white puffs of smoke?
So what Clarissa has experienced
at the end of those missiles,
we have a position
where we can see the missiles going out
and being intercepted
some of them being intercepted
on their way to where she is.
And just before those missiles took off.
There were fighter
jets in the air as well.
And a couple of explosions from Gaza.
So it kind of gave the impression
that the fighters had gone
up, the fighter
jets had gone up to try to target
Hamas, firing those rockets out of here.
Another
fighter jet in the in the sky just now.
I can't see it.
But typically when when Hamas comes out
to fire their rockets,
typically the jets come on station here
and we'll look for targets.
Look for those Hamas
Hamas militants with their rockets.
They're firing positions
to take them out. This is a
this is a very this view from here
gives you a very strong understanding
of the dynamic of this battle.",20231010
ni1vHdQtWbs,Watch as Iron Dome intercepts Hamas' rockets over CNN correspondent's head,data/en_CNN\Watch as Iron Dome intercepts Hamas' rockets over CNN correspondent's head.jpg,"I can't
think of a scenario
where I've been sort
of looking at rockets that are outgoing
and a colleague.
Dear colleague,
you are being underneath it.
And if it's a bad, eerie feeling
and I just
when I see the rockets
coming out of that,
I want to be picking up the phone
and said, guys, they're coming.
They're coming.
But I know the defense system
here is so strong
that you get
as I'm seeing them come
up, you're
getting the sirens immediately.
I mean, you're getting those intercepts
right over your head.
We're actually from where we are.
We can actually see the rockets
Iron Dome rockets themselves taking off
and making those intercepts.
And we've been looking.
I know you're trying to figure out
if you can get to
underneath the cloud of smoke, but John's
pointing at that cloud of smoke now.
We've been watching it get bigger.
It was small, dark cloud of smoke.
Now it's like big and billowing
and the smoke is gone kind of gray.
But something's on fire there
because it hasn't gone out.
It's it's
it's it's putting out more smoke.
But, yeah,
when I see those rockets
going out there and the intercepts
above your head,
I'm just thinking about you
and your team, Brant and Clayton.
And I'm hearing I'm
and I'm hearing
small arms fire behind me there.
That's that's
the Israeli Defense Force, I believe,
will be firing towards Gaza.
I don't know if I've seen anything.
Small arms
fire, guns,
heavy machine guns, small machine guns,
okay. Thank you.
Absolutely. Nic.
No, we can hear that small arms fire.
We heard a right over your shoulder.
Have you been hearing
have you been hearing that
since the rockets
since this barrage kind of started up?
Right.
Basically, right at 10 a.m.
eastern
Yeah.
No, not really.
I mean, we don't get much
small arms fire, but,
you know, we had it in this town
siren two days ago.
We had it
and we knew that the IDF was going after
some Hamas militants in the town
because that is coming from towards Gaza.
Does that mean some Hamas
militants have been spotted
maybe at the border fence
trying to get through the border fence?
If they have, they popped out a tunnel?
We're seeing intercepts.
Clarissa,
I believe that there is missiles
coming your way
because I'm seeing intercepts
above your head.
So take take cover here
that they're going up.
They're intercepting right there.
Okay.
Yeah, you can see right here.
There you see a
right above us.
That's the Iron Dome intercepting,
just sort of crashing your balcony.
But you can see the plane
Clayton.
Just keep a little bit inside. Yeah.
So this is just the sirens
went off a matter of seconds ago.
And
now we're hearing
as those
rockets, it looks like
most of them were intercepted by the Iron
Dome up there.
You can see the plumes of smoke
from where
they were literally stopped
in their tracks.
Seems that maybe it's
a little bit quieter right now.
Not clear out.
There's another one.
Hold on.
You can hear a jet overhead now as well.
It's not uncommon in these situations.
You'll hear the intercepts, you'll hear
the Iron Dome at work.
And then pretty quickly after
that, you'll hear jets
and then the distant
thought of a strike and Gaza
still hearing
those rockets being intercepted
and just gives you a feel
for the the volume
of rockets that are being used.
I think many people initially
had been surprised
by how many,
how many rockets,
how extensive the stockpiling up.
And here another
sorry,
how extensive the stockpiling
and how effective
it's been in terms of the sheer
amount of rockets and some of them longer
range rockets and missiles as well.
So now appears to be
a little bit quieter.
We can still see those plumes of smoke
from where the Iron Dome was activated.
We can still see a plume of darker
smoke lower on the horizon from where
one of those rockets appears to have made
impact earlier on.
But clearly, Hamas
trying to send a very sobering message
to the people of Ashkelon today.
They warned people,
they told them leave by 5 p.m..
And it has been pretty unrelenting in the
I forget how long
we've been out here now,
but what are we talking?
35 minutes of pretty sustained,
I would say barrages of rockets
coming in to this cease port city.
Really remarkable for us as John Berman
here, we're seeing in real time
the Iron Dome
interceptor those rockets over your head.
And if we can just show people
this map very quickly
so we can remind people
where Clarissa is.
She is in Ashkelon right here.
Our Nic Robertson
and this is really also remarkable.
Nic Robertson was here in Central
looking over Gaza
as the rockets were being shot out
into Ashkelon.
Where Clarissa is.
Clarissa, we hear heard
explosions and blast there.
Was that from the sky?
Can you distinguish between intercepts
or whether there was any impact
on the ground from that last barrage?
Yeah, you can usually
you can usually
distinguish is a slightly different sound
when they're intercepted in
the sky as opposed to
when they make a direct hit
I will say the first barrage
right at 5:00
was the most sustained,
the most intensive
and the most amount of direct hits.
From what we heard,
we don't know where those hits
may have happened,
with the exception of that one location
where it appears
that one of those rockets hit again,
we don't know exactly
what was there,
but we've been going out every day now
and seeing the the impact and effect
that some of these rockets have.
They destroy cars.
They destroy homes.
They just leave craters in the streets.
And, of course,
they have a very palpable effect
on the psyche of ordinary people.
I think I hear a drone now.
Again,
drones are very common
at the moment for obvious reasons.
We heard some jets before as well.
We had been hearing pretty much constant
jet activity
yesterday, but
more so even the day before.
And it
is this utterly disco
bar violating sense
for people who live here between
on the one hand, sirens going off
and people are frantically running
to try to get to shelters and crouching.
And then you hear explosions in the sky
and then 5 minutes later,
everything feels quiet again.
You can hear the sea.
It's
it's hard to imagine
how people can live
like this day in and day out.
It's extremely difficult
to kind of find any sense of equilibrium.
And we have definitely notice
that the tempo in Ashkelon today,
this afternoon
has has dramatically escalated.
John
Clarissa, thank you.
Stand by for a second.
Let's go back to Nic Robertson instead.
Nic, you were hearing firing.
Describe what you were hearing
and what you think it might have been
what we were
hearing, what
sounded like small arms fire,
machine gun fire,
and that typically the Israeli
Defense Forces
won't fire their machine guns
unless they're close to a target.
And then we could hear
what sounded like exchange
exchanges of fire, sustained,
sustained bursts of fire
coming from
that direction towards the border fence.
There are several
we're saying it's literally
2700 meters, I think is
what is what you said, Sara?
The distance
between where we're at
and the border fence
and if Hamas is still
trying to make incursions.
We were down in that area today.
We were probably
about 700 meters
from the border fence earlier today.
And there are a lot of Israeli troops
down in that area,
combat troops and jeeps and tanks
and armored vehicles.
They're ready for the potential
of more Hamas
militants trying to slip inside Israel.
So it's possible
that that's what we've just heard there.
But the fact that the gunfire is subside
subsided tells me that
whatever that contact, to use the
military parlance, was
the contact is broken at the moment.
They're not engaged in a firefight.
So that is over
unless we hear it start up again.
But what we did hear during when Clarissa
was under that bombardment again,
just in the past few minutes,
we did hear a lot of artillery fire
being fired
from the Israeli forces into Gaza.
That's a very accurate artillery
that they used to try to target
the firing points
to try to get the the
the Hamas militants
who are firing the rockets.
And further south in Gaza,
I did hear a series
of even bigger explosions
and those may have been associated
with that fighter jet.
And I'm hearing another
sound explosion, detonation ripple
through the air
that may have been associated
with the fighter jets
that both Clarissa
and I heard flying in over Gaza
just in the past few minutes.",20231010
2Z8fvTfQgUs,Israel’s military amasses near Gaza,data/en_CNN\Israel’s military amasses near Gaza.jpg,"The Israeli military
is mobilizing
a record number of reservists,
some 360,000 as observers
are anticipating
a ground operation in Gaza.
The IDF is also amassing
tanks
and other military vehicles
near the border
with the Palestinian territory.
And Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has vowed retaliation on Hamas
like never before.
Keep in mind,
a ground operation could get complicated.
Gaza is very densely populated.
It puts civilians
in the middle of urban warfare
where Hamas can utilize narrow
city streets
and a complex network of tunnels
that can be used to move
fighters,
store weapons
and launch a series of attacks.
We want to discuss the situation
now with a military expert
who knows firsthand
the hazards of urban combat.
We're joined now by General Wesley Clark.
He was the supreme
allied commander of NATO's
during the Kosovo war.
General, thanks so much for sharing
part of your afternoon with us.
We saw this drone video of Gaza
earlier today.
This is the aftermath of aerial strikes
on the territory.
I'm wondering
what an Israeli ground operation
in this region is going to look like.
Well, first of all, I've
got to pick some targets
on the way
you would probably do
this is to section off Gaza,
maybe block by block,
figure out how to go
in, isolate
that area and work from the outside.
And you've got to
work against the tunnel network
and you've got to work against snipers
and other people on the high ground.
Now, you've created a lot of
rubble in the city right now.
So you've got to stay away
from those streets
if you're trying to move
are armored vehicles in there.
So that adds to the obstacles there.
It's going to be a very tough,
slow, painstaking operation.
Got to do it with maximum protection
for your own troops
because you have to understand that Hamas
this is not going to be
a surprise to Hamas.
They knew that
this is what they were going to get.
This is what they want.
They want to bring that
Israeli ground force in
and attack it from every direction
and put more casualties on to show
that it lacks credibility.
So Israel has to do
this, has to do it
well as to maintain
its military credibility.
Extremely difficult operation coming up.
General, you describe
the targeting of tunnels and areas
along that border.
There were civilians in Gaza that were
trying or rather were told to evacuate
a certain crossing
and this Rafah crossing right here.
And it's been complicated,
partly because it was targeted,
obviously.
You mentioned some of the complications
regarding a ground operation.
What about the fact that Hamas is holding
some 100 to 150 hostages,
potentially some American citizens?
How does all of that?
The difficulty of getting civilians out
and the fact that there are hostages
in Gaza.
Alter the calculus for the Israeli
Defense Forces?
Well, obviously,
you'll have teams
standing by
that could do an emergency hostage
rescue operation
if you could identify
where the hostages are.
If you could get entrance into that area
with sufficient force to rescue them.
But those capabilities will be there.
And we'll be monitoring
all the electronic
and visual intelligence
we've got
will be looking for other people, talking
and communicating people on the ground.
We'll do everything we can
to locate them.
But, you know, it's in Hamas interest
not to execute those hostages.
They need those hostages
as bargaining leverage at the end.
So you're going to hear a lot of threats.
You may have some outer control people
who do want to kill the hostages.
But my bet would be that
the Hamas leadership
will not want to give up those hostages
for the sake of
the families of those missing.
General, I hope you're right about that.
I do want to share with you
some new satellite images
we have of the Erez crossing complex.
So essentially
what we're looking at,
this right here is Gaza.
And this is Israel
This is part of the border.
And on it,
you can see craters in some areas
where Israel
launched retaliatory strikes.
What really stands out to me are breaches
in the border wall
where Hamas broke through.
And you can see them in these circles
I'm drawing.
This is where Hamas militants
were able to get into Israel.
It's striking partly
because of the scale
general of the attack.
They executed an attack
unprecedented in the history of Hamas
without Israeli intelligence
having a clue
that this was going to happen.
How is that possible?
It's possible by just
working with people you trust,
keeping the circle of knowledge small
and only talking face to face,
no electronic communications
nothing in writing that can go out.
If you do that,
you can maintain security.
But, you know, Hamas has been there for
for a long time.
We cannot underestimate
their sophistication.
It's a mistake
to think that they're just terrorists
out there waving AK 47.
This is a sophisticated military force
It's had training.
It's had assistance from the Iranians,
maybe some Russian equipment in there.
For all we know,
they can monitor communications.
They have cyber
they have anti-aircraft missiles.
They have anti-tank missiles.
Got a lot of stuff buried underground.
Are they prepared for this
for a long time?
So I think, you know,
we have to anticipate
this is not like going
when the United States
Army raced through Baghdad
in 2003, shattered the Iraqi guards
and the people in Iraq were like,
oh, yeah, well, some of us liked him.
Some of us didn't.
Let's see what happens now.
That's not what this is.
This is a force for Syria
that's been prepared.
How many Hamas fighters are there?
15,000. 20,000.
We saw maybe 2000 committed
in this operation.
So we've got
lots of forces left behind and ready
and no doubt
willing to sacrifice their lives
to take Israelis with them.
So this is going to be a tough fight.
And at the same time, of course,
we've got the northern border
to worry about
the president's
talk about maybe
sending another carrier battle group in
And don't forget,
the North
Koreans are now shipping
artillery and ammunition
by rail to the Russians
to put the pressure on Ukraine.
We can never neglect that
because that fight in Ukraine
is very much in America's interest.
They're fighting our battle.
They're against Russian aggression.",20231010
lQLlo89kaco,Biden: Hamas attack on Israel is ‘an act of sheer evil’,data/en_CNN\Biden Hamas attack on Israel is ‘an act of sheer evil’.jpg,"We're watching President Biden
as he approaches
the podium at the White House.
Good afternoon. Listen to his remarks.
You know, there are moments in this life
I I mean this
literally when the pure,
unadulterated evil is unleashed
on this world.
The people of Israel
live through one
such moment this weekend.
Bloody hands of the terrorist
organization, Hamas
group, whose stated purpose for being
is to kill Jews
This was an act of sheer evil.
More than 1000 civilians slaughtered,
not just kill, slaughtered in Israel.
Among them, at least 14
American citizens killed,
parents butchered,
using their bodies
to try to protect their children.
Stomach churning
reports of babies being killed.
Entire families slain.
Young people massacred
while attending a musical festival.
To celebrate peace. To celebrate peace.
Women raped,
assaulted, paraded as trophies.
Families
hid their fear for hours and hours,
desperately trying
to keep their children quiet.
To avoid drawing attention
And thousands of wounded.
Alive.
But carrying with them
the bullet holes and the shrapnel wounds.
And the memory of what they endured.
You all know these traumas never go away.
There's still so many families
desperately waiting
to hear the fate of their loved ones.
Not knowing if they're alive.
Or dead. Or hostages.
Infants in their mother's arms.
Grandparents in wheelchairs.
Holocaust survivors abducted
and held hostage.
Hostages whom
Hamas has now threatened execute
in violation
of every code of human morality.
It's abhorrent.
The brutality of Hamas
is blood thirsty and is brings to mind
the worst the worst rampages of vices.
This is terrorism.
But sadly for the Jewish people,
it's not new.
This attack is brought to the surface.
Painful memories.
The scars left
by a millennium, antisemitism
and genocide.
The Jewish people
So in this moment,
we must be crystal clear.
We stand with Israel.
And we will make sure,
as has what it needs
to take care of its citizens,
defend itself and respond to this attack.
There's no justification for terrorism.
There's no excuse
Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian
people's right
to dignity and self-determination.
Stated purpose is annihilation
of the state of Israel.
On the murder of Jewish people
They use Palestinian civilians
as human shields.
Mass offers
nothing but terror
and bloodshed with no regard
to who pays the price
The loss of
innocent life is heartbreaking.
Like every nation in the world.
Israel has the right to respond and deed
has a duty to respond
to these vicious attacks.
I just got off the phone with the third
called Prime Minister Netanyahu.
I told him
the United States
experience is an experience
in our response to be swift,
decisive and overwhelming.
We also discussed how democracies
like Israel
and United States are stronger
and more secure
when we act according to the rule of law.
Terrorist
purposely target civilians kill them.
We uphold the laws of war, law of war.
It matters.
There's a difference
Today, Americans across the country
are praying
for all those families
who have been ripped apart.
A lot of us know how it feels.
It leaves a black hole in your chest
when you lose family
feeling like you're being sucked in.
The anger the pain
the sense of hopelessness
This is what they mean
by a human tragedy,
an atrocity
on an appalling scale.
We're going to continue to stand united,
supporting the people of Israel
who are suffering unspeakable losses
and opposing the hatred
and violence of terrorism.
My team has been
in near-constant communication
with our Israeli partners
and partners all across the region
and the world.
From the moment this crisis began.
We're charging
additional military assistance,
including ammunition
and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome.
We're going to make sure
that Israel
does not run out of these critical assets
to defend its cities and its citizens.
My administration
has consult
closely with Congress
throughout this crisis.
When Congress returns,
we're going to ask them
to take urgent action
to fund the
national security
requirements of our critical partners.
This is not about party or politics.
This is about the security of our world,
security of the United States of America.
We now know
that American citizens are among
those being held by Hamas
I've directed my team
to share intelligence and deploy
additional expertize from across
the United States government
to consult with
and advise Israeli counterparts
in hostage recovery recovery efforts.
Because as president,
I have no higher priority
than the safety of Americans
being held hostage around the world.
The United States has also enhanced
our military force posture in the region
to strengthen our deterrence.
The Department of Defense has moved
the USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group,
the Eastern Mediterranean,
and bolstered our fighter
aircraft presence.
And we stand ready to move in
additional assets as needed
Let me say again
to any country, any organization,
anyone
thinking of taking advantage of
the situation,
I have one word don't
don't
Hearts
may be broken, but our resolve is clear.
Yesterday, I also spoke with the leaders
of France, Germany, Italy and U.K.
to discuss the latest developments
with our European allies
and coordinate our united response
This comes on top of days
of steady
engagement with partners
across the region.
We're also taking steps at home
in cities
across the United States of America.
Police departments have stepped up
security around centers of Jewish life
The Department of Homeland Security,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation
are working closely
with state
and local law enforcement
and Jewish
community partners
to identify and disrupt
any domestic threat
that could emerge in connection
with these horrific attacks.
This is
a moment for the
United States to come together
to grieve with those who are mourning
Let's be real clear.
There is no place for hate in America,
not against Jews, not against Muslims.
Not against anybody.
We reject.
What we reject is terrorism.
We condemn the indiscriminate
evil just we have always done.
That's what America stands for.
You know, just over 50 years ago,
I was thinking about this morning
talk from
the secretary of state,
the vice president in my office
over 50 years ago.
As a young senator,
I visited Israel for the first time
as a newly elected senator,
and I had a long, long trip
meeting with Goldman in her office
just before the Yom Kippur War.
I guess you could see
the consternation on my
face as she described
what was being faced.
She knew they were facing
walked outside
in that
sort of hallway outside her office
to have some photo.
She looked at me all of a sudden, said,
Would you like to have a photograph?
And so I got up and followed her out
here, standing there silent,
looking at the press.
You could tell, I guess I was concerned.
She leaned over and whispered to me.
She said, Don't worry, Senator Biden,
we have a secret weapon here in Israel.
My word is what she said.
We have no place else to go.
For 75 years
is also the only guarantor
security of Jewish people
around the world.
So the
atrocities of
the past could never happen again.
Let there be no doubt
the United States has Israel's back.
We will make sure the Jewish
democratic state of Israel
can defend itself
today, tomorrow, as we always have to.
Simple as that.
These atrocities
sickening
We're with Israel
Just make no mistake.
Thank you.

President, what was your reaction

E4gzxOO-yQQ,Israeli forces prepare for potential ground operation,data/en_CNN\Israeli forces prepare for potential ground operation.jpg,"Jeremy diamond.
Give us the latest, Jeremy.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: Today we set out to
do a story of the hundreds of
thousands of military reservists
and this massive military
buildup that Israel is preparing
for.
As we set out to do this story
along the gaza border and
Israeli communities here, one
thing became clear that this is
a very volatile, very unstable
situation even before the next
phase of Israel's military
campaign, whatever it may be,
reveals itself.
Whether it was rockets flying
overhead as we were in the city
of sderot, or a firefight we
caught, this is a very unstable,
uncertain situation.
Three days after hundreds of
hamas militants infiltrated
Israel, Israeli forces are still
fighting to eliminate the
threat.
We are outside the Israeli town
of mythalseem where we have been
hearing repeated exchanges of
gunfire the last ten minutes or
so.
We haven't seen exactly who they
are between, but we know Israeli
forces have been continuing to
try and clear some of these
Israeli towns around the gaza
strip from those hamas
militants.
The idf later confirming they
killed two hamas terrorists in
the battle.
Minutes after it ended, Israeli
defense forces rushing a
casualty into an ambulance.
The south track to life in most
Israeli communities around the
gaza strip today wasn't gunfire,
but rockets.
In sderot, the booms punctuate
the stillness of the day.
&gt;&gt; Just coming to a shelter here
where we can take cover from
iron dome interceptions.
They're intercepting active
rockets coming in from gaza.
The booms are very loud, they're
directly overhead.
20 minutes later, another
barrage of rockets headed for
the city of ashkelon.
We're in the city of sderot
where we can see that barrage
that hamas promised at 5:00 P.M.
Appearing to head over in the
direction of ashkelon.
That is exactly where hamas
officials said about an hour ago
that they would fire rockets in
that direction.
But there is also another sound
in towns like sderot.
Israeli troops and reservists
mobilizing to the gaza front.
Part of a massive call-up of
more than 300,000 reserve
troops, preparations for a
potential ground invasion of
gaza.
For some, this moment feels
different.
&gt;&gt; Then we came in with a
concept of full control.
This one started with obviously
more confusion and the playing
field is different.
But I think in the last two
days, the momentum has shifted.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: An entire country
springing into action with those
T of uniform bringing food and
supplies to troops.
After days of tragedy, also a
sense of resilience.
""I'm not afraid at all,"" she
said.
""When it will be my time, it
will be my time.""
Wolf, late Tuesday evening, the
Israel defense forces also now
confirming that the first
shipments of advanced U.S.
Weaponry provided by the united
States in the wake of hamas'
attack this past weekend has now
arrived in Israel.
It arrived at the nevatim air
base in southern Israel.

bYxGjMCTFdE,Israel Defense Force general recounts what he saw after Hamas attack,data/en_CNN\Israel Defense Force general recounts what he saw after Hamas attack.jpg,"And I want to begin our
coverage live here tonight
with Nic Robertson.
He is OUTFRONT
live in Stuttgart, Israel,
which is about 45 miles
south of where I'm standing right now.
And Nic, where you are.
Many loud explosions just moments ago.
What's happening,
as best as you can tell?
Yeah, there's a lot of helicopter
activity in the sky.
You heard fighter jets.
This is not that uncommon,
but we've heard a lot of mechanical,
heavy equipment
moving in the area between this town
and the Gaza
Gaza fence,
which is less than a couple of miles
really from where we're standing right
now, says a lot of
mechanized machinery, mechanized units
being military units being maneuvered
in that area.
At the moment, we don't know what form,
but the explosions
that we've been experiencing here
over the past past
perhaps hour or so,
but pretty intense up up here in the past
20 minutes.
You see a big flash go off behind me.
Counter counter
three can't afford to count to five
and then you will hear a huge explosion.
The explosions have been enough
to shake the roof of this building here.
So that impacting in Gaza
a couple of miles away.
And it's enough to shake
the roof of the building here.
But what we found
when we went to Camp Azhar,
which it took,
by the way,
it took the Israeli Defense Forces
48 hours of fighting against Hamas
to take back control of it.
What we
found there and what
the Israeli Defense Forces
wanted to show us
was what they were describing
as the brutality of the way
that people were treated, that
the residents
were treated,
that some of them had their hands bound.
That's how families were executed.
Parents, children, people even beheaded,
he said.
This is what happened on the road that
the drive into Kafr AZA is chilling
evidence of Hamas's butchery Everywhere.
This Israel Defense Force general shocked
at what he found.
I thought about
General Eisenhower that come to the death
camp in Europe.
And the first thing that he
said is brings this press young children.
He did the same
in fighting about 50 journalists.
You will see
it's a it's a big massacre, a big,
big day.
Have you ever seen anything like this
in your career?
Never.
For less than a mile from Gaza.
70 Hamas fighters stormed in here
early Saturday, some even flying.
They're telling us
this is one of the paragliders
that flew in here.
You can see the engine here,
the propellers here made of carbon fiber.
The fuel tank up here
and the frame of it and the seats
at the front.
The IDF in
control now after a two day battle.
Hamas lie where they fell.
Only now, the extremes of their barbarity
becoming apparent.
700 plus civilians lived here.
How many were killed?
Still unclear how they died.
Brutally apparent.
Some decapitated.
They say
kill babies in the front of their parents
and kids. The parents.
They killed parents.
And we found babies
between the dogs and the.
And the family that killed before him.
They cut the head of the people.
Each body bag, silent sentinel
to the intelligence failure
that allowed Kafr AZA
and other communities near Gaza
to be overrun.
And motivation for troops, too.
We wait to the switch
to to switch ourselves
from the defense to the attack.
Because, you know,
we defense our people and still now we
call it.
And when you say you're going to attack,
will you be going into Gaza?
So if we can see it here, look, it's
you know,
I look to the next hundred yard,
you take care
of the next hundred yards next
until they are the fight
fighters, the next hundred yards,
and then look forward,
forward to a possible showdown
with Hamas.
How and when?
Still to be determined.
And that's really
where I think these troops
find themselves at the moment.
They're waiting for
that political decision.
The sense with them today
was that they were sort of
there was a sort of a pause,
but not a pause
where you sit back and rest,
but a pause where you were.
You change posture
and begin to lean forward.
And you get that sense for them.
They're really waiting
to get the political direction
of what they need to do.
They know that
if they go into Gaza,
that this will be a very bloody fight,
a very dangerous fight for them,
because they'll be fighting
and streets and small streets
and civilian neighborhoods
where they're the enemy,
where Hamas, Islamic Jihad, know
the terrain,
where the population is against them,
but also
an environment
where their rules of engagement
are to avoid civilian casualties.
Yet, and in an environment
like that
in Gaza, civilian casualties,
as we've seen in the past,
do and will happen.
So all of this stands in front of Israel,
stands in front of the prime
minister right now
and most particularly stands
in front of those troops
we were with today, Aaron.
All right, Nic, thank you very much.
And Major Ben
Wall Houses
and spokesperson
for the Israel Defense Forces
for the IDF.
And I very much appreciate
your time, Major,
on the back of this reporting.
And here we are tonight.
Hamas
obviously has always been
a brutal organization.
Now, though,
these reports we're seeing beheadings
by ISIS like cruelty babies.
Have you seen a shift in their tactics?
Oh, Hamas has always been
an individual
terrorist organization,
and it's openly stated
its explicit
aim to kill all the Jews
and all the Israelis that it can.
So in
terms of who
it is as an organization,
as an organization, that's nothing new.
But surely the extent
and the barbaric nature of these attacks
is something that we haven't seen before.
And as your journalists saw today,
as our forces
go through the south
and clear house by house,
making sure there is no terrorist
presence left.
We're starting to hear those stories.
We're starting to find those corpses
that were brutally mutilated,
entire communities massacred.
And yet,
as you say,
this is something that
we haven't seen before.
Major, there's the
strikes coming from Gaza.
I also understand
there was a clash between IDF soldiers
and Hamas militants inside Israel.
In the north, meantime,
three rockets were seen
launched from Syrian territory,
according to the IDF just tonight.
Rockets were launched
from Lebanon earlier.
Where does security of Israeli
land stand at this hour?
Yes, this is an extremely complex
security situation.
We are continuing intense
fighting in the south
with the aim of stopping
Hamas's attacks
and making sure they can't carry
these kinds of attacks.
That, again,
thousands of rockets
are still being fired
into Israeli cities indiscriminately.
And at the same time, as you say,
on our northern border
and on our eastern border,
we have attacks, rocket,
anti-tank fire, rocket fire from Lebanon.
In Syria,
we have called up over
300,000 reserve
soldiers who have left their families
and are deployed on all of their borders.
And in the north,
we're watching very carefully
and making sure that the message is clear
that no one should join in the fight.
Reuters is reporting,
Major, that for months
leading up to the attack,
Hamas misled Israel
to believe that it didn't want to fight.
I didn't want a confrontation.
And the report from Reuters
cites a source close to Hamas
saying that the organization actually
even went so far
as to construct a mock Israeli town,
a settlement in Gaza
where they practiced a military landing.
They did all these things.
They trained to storm it.
Can you confirm any of this?
Well, Hamas's intentions
have always been clear.
The fact that it makes a mock
Israeli town
to invade
shows that Hamas's war
is a war against civilians.
Hundreds of terrorists
streaming across the border
and massacring
women and children
and elderly is a war against civilians
taking civilians,
entire families
into Gaza, abducting them.
That's a war against civilians.
And at the same time,
they're using their own civilians
as human shields, placing them
military targets inside homes, mosques,
hospitals, all in an effort
to use their civilian
population as shields.
So in terms of any sort of a mock,
you know,
settlement that they may have created,
do you now know where that is
or what they were doing?
And you do now
have the intelligence to sort of
look at how this actually
was trained for an accomplished.
Well,
we're looking forward at the moment.
Our immediate priority
is to stop Hamas's attacks.
Their rocket attacks
indiscriminately into our cities
are continuing,
as your viewers are seeing right now.
Attempted attacks by land,
by air from Gaza
and our immediate priority
is to protect our civilian population
from further attacks.
All right, Major, I appreciate your time
and thank you very much. Of course.
Obviously, it is past two in the morning.
So another another late
or all night for you.
Thank you very much, sir.",20231011
a34zpFaoBoM,Putin breaks silence on Hamas attack on Israel,data/en_CNN\Putin breaks silence on Hamas attack on Israel.jpg,"And welcome
back to a special edition of OUTFRONT
live from Israel.
We've got breaking news.
We are now learning
that the death toll from the Hamas
attacks on Israel has gone up
significantly.
That number is now at least 1200
people, according
to an Israeli public broadcaster.
And we have been saying about a thousand.
So that
number going up by at least 200 here.
And it comes as as questions grow about
who was behind the attack.
And today,
Vladimir Putin had a very tepid response
to Hamas's attack,
which killed at least
two Russian citizens.
Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT.
But it was a double foot high
after hundreds of Israelis
were slaughtered by Hamas near Gaza.
Condemnation and condolence is poured
in from around the world,
but not from Russian leader
Vladimir Putin.
Even now, in his first comments,
instead of empathy,
Putin blasting the U.S.
yet again.
This is a clear
example of the failure
of the United States
policy in the Middle East,
which tried to monopolize
any settlement
between Israelis and Palestinians.
She also visited
Nero in
Kiev, the Kremlin controlled TV following
suit, mocking both America
and Israel
for allegedly being caught off
guard by Hamas's attack.
Yes, not no.
Mozart's VI
is the meaning of the contrast
with Mozart
and its famous counterintelligence,
as well as the U.S.
and its CIA
slept through Hamas's invasion.
It's the biggest Israeli failure
in security since 1973.
Russia has long been allied with Israel's
staunchest adversaries
and Hamas's
most important backers
bombing Syrian rebels
in support of pro Iranian fighters
battling on the side of Syrian
President Bashar
al-Assad during Syria's civil war.
But Russia also maintained strong ties
and security arrangements with Israel.
Putin meeting
Israel's prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on many occasions.
We in no way underestimate
the importance
of measures that would ensure
very strong
security of the state of Israel.
But since Putin launched his full scale
war against Ukraine,
Tehran has become a key ally for Moscow
at Israel's expense,
fostering economic and military ties
with Iran.
While
Tehran provides the Russian army
with scores of showerhead drones.
The Russians used to hit Ukrainian cities
and infrastructure, Kiev says,
even though Tehran denies it.
Ukraine's president
Vladimir Zelensky, claiming Moscow's
allegiance in the Middle East
has shifted towards Tehran.
But when we are crises
Kiev propagandists,
we see how Russian
propagandists are gloating.
We witness how Moscow's
Iranian allies
openly lend support
to those who attacked Israel.
And, Aaron, the Kremlin has denied
Vladimir Lewinsky's allegation
that the Russians are trying
to inflame the situations
between the Israelis
and the Palestinians.
However, the former
chief rabbi of Moscow, who, of course,
fled Russia
about two weeks
after the
full on invasion of Ukraine,
he today
said that the lack of show
of support
of Russia
for Israel is an ominous sign
of deteriorating relations
between those countries.
Erin.
Fred, thank you very much.
And OUTFRONT
now, the former Israeli ambassador
to the United Nations
and Israel's former deputy
defense minister, Danny Danon.
And I really appreciate your time.
Ambassador, so
friends reporting
Russian citizens
are killed in the attack.
Putin silent really for days.
Many Russians live in Israel.
There are very close ties
between those two countries as well.
And yet Putin showing virtually
no sympathy at all for Israel.
Nothing at this point.
Why do you think that is unacceptable?
We have witnessed the whole attack
against Israelis.
1200 people were killed,
butchered in a daylight.
So we expect more than a leader.
We saw President Biden's speech
and we appreciated the speech.
It was very emotional.
It was a remarkable speech,
I have to tell you,
because we are still digesting
those attacks.
It was very hard for us.
The pain is still in our stomach
and we are grateful
for the support coming from the U.S..
For you, hope for more
almost all over the world.
I cannot explain Putin's behavior.
So the Fred Pleitgen Pleitgen pointed out
Russia has long been allied with Iran.
And, of course,
we've seen that intensify.
If I could use that word
with the Ukraine war as well.
Iran is a key backer of Hamas.
Do you think that
if Iran had any advance knowledge
that Russia would have had advanced
knowledge?
I mean,
do you see any ties here
that you're starting to tie together?
Well, Iran is very involved
in what's happening here.
They are funding Hamas and Hezbollah
for years.
They are training Hamas operatives.
We know that Hamas experts
went to Tehran
to get training about explosives
and other things.
Do we know what Iran is involved in?
Maybe. I don't know for sure.
But maybe what we saw in the last
few weeks,
the relationship between Israel
and Saudi Arabia,
it wasn't very good for Iran.
So maybe that is the reason
for the timing,
because it wasn't
until a vocal attack against Israel.
Nobody can find logic
for the timing of this vicious attack.
So how how involved do you think
Iran was?
I mean, the White House has been careful.
They they've sort of said
that there's ambiguous
ties, that Iran is broadly and complicit,
but that there's no intelligence
directly linking
Iran to this actual attack.
Do you buy that? No.
When you fund the Hamas
and you give them a hundred
of billions of dollars every year,
you control Hamas.
So basically, both Hamas and Hezbollah
are proxies of Tehran.
They control them.
And that is why we are sending
a very clear message today
to Hezbollah and to Tehran.
Watch very carefully
what we will happen in Gaza.
Don't mess with us.
We are not playing anymore.
We will not hunt down Hamas.
And if anyone will try to play with us,
either from north
or somewhere else,
it will be under our guns as well.
So as you are massing
IDF forces,
paratroopers, snipers
along that Gaza border, is there anything
that will be off limits
when if I
assume at
this point is when Israel goes in,
we will do whatever is necessary
to eliminate Hamas.
We going to come from the sea.
We're going to come from the land.
We're going to come from the air.
We're going to hunt them down.
They butchered 1200 Israelis
and they went to the communities.
We did not attack
soldiers, attacked women.
Today, we
we actually saw the pictures
of innocent babies
that were tied up and burned alive.
Those are animals. We have to fight them.
We have to hunt them down.
And we are committed to do it.
You know,
we are still in in pain, in shock.
And I think in a few days,
we will start to show
the might of the IDF,
the strength of the Israeli people.
We put politics aside.
Now we are united
and we going to go into war
against Hamas.
Ambassador Danone, thank you very much.
I appreciate your time.",20231011

Gaza, because right now in Gaza,
there is no electricity.
The head of the power authority tells CNN
that the one power station
has run out of fuel
and that it's no longer working.
It's part of Israel's promised siege
of the Palestinian enclave.
And of course, the death toll in Gaza,
as we have it,
above 1000 people, injuries
mounting above 5000.
Now, all this together
making the humanitarian,
humanitarian situation
there even more dire for civilians.
Gaza's hospitals and morgues,
we are told, are filling up.
CNN's Salma
Abdelaziz is following the story
from London.
Salma,
tell us what you're learning
from the Gaza side of this story.
And you've just revealed
some of those numbers.
More than a thousand
killed so far, one in ten Gazans over
nearly a quarter million people
essentially have been displaced
from their homes.
Hospitals say
that they're running on generator power,
but soon they'll run out of fuel.
Morgues are overwhelmed.
People have nowhere to go in.
All of this
is only the beginning
of a lengthy conflict.
You heard there from our colleague
Jeremy Diamond
speaking about the reservist
on the ground.
So far, all you're seeing
is Israel's air assault,
a continuous battering of the strip.
You haven't yet seen a ground in courage.
And, of course, that's highly expected.
And would only amplify
the suffering there.
It's important to know
that there are about 2 million
Gazans, 2 million people
who are trapped
in that tiny coastal strip.
There is even before this conflict,
a blockade that's existed there
for more than 15 years.
It imposes
travel restrictions
that make it nearly impossible
for most average people to leave.
And you have to remember that
Hamas treats
Gaza like it is its own back yard.
There have been no elections in Gaza
for many,
many years now
since Hamas seized control in 2007.
So the people there have no say
in what Hamas does,
but they absolutely bear
the brunt of the consequences
of the consequences of this conflict.
You already have rights groups
ringing the alarm,
saying that the siege that Israel
has imposed, cutting off food
cutting off fuel, cutting off water,
that that is collective punishment,
that it is
a violation of international law.
But Israel is undeterred.
The defense minister was on the border
just a few hours ago
meeting with Israeli troops, saying
the gloves are off.
There are no restraints.
Gaza will never be the same again.
Of course, these words
are haunting the many families right now
living under bombardment
Is there any sense now
when we look at these strikes, is Israel
still giving warning of the strikes
in advance to allow for civilians to move
from the buildings,
their homes
or elsewhere before the bombs drop?
I think what you're referencing
is the knock on the door.
It's actually a form of strike
that, you know, in
the past has been used on homes
to give them some warning.
Actually, an Israeli
official was asked about that
by CNN and his response was,
well,
Hamas did not give us a knock
before they carried out
their surprise attack,
before they carried out their assault.
So the answer
sort of vaguely there being
no civilians
are not being given a heads up.
We've also heard eyewitness accounts
of the same on the ground.
Israeli officials
have also been asked about cutting off
food cutting off fuel, cutting off water.
Is this not collective punishment?
And their response has also been
we cannot be expected to provide
for the Gaza Strip while we are at war
with the Gaza Strip.
And that's absolutely the problem here.
Again, 2 million
people
trapped in this deeply
impoverished enclave
are absolutely caught in the middle
They have no say
when Hamas fires a rocket,
but they will get the vengeance for it.
And summer,
we've been hearing just awful
stories of people who were in Gaza
who say you know,
they hear
from the authorities,
go to the south, they go to the south,
and then the south
is hit with airstrikes.
They hear from authorities,
go to the north and in the north.
And so,
you know,
for all of the folks
that are in Gaza,
more than 2 million people,
just just really difficult days ahead.
Sam Abdul Aziz, thank you, Salma.
And Christiane
is on the other side of the screen.
We can see
as the sun is setting
in Gaza, you can see just how dark it is
as they mean
the one and only power station in Gaza.
Reports that the power is out
and generators
that are there,
they will have
or will soon be running out of fuel.
This is our first
look at what power out in Gaza
is going to mean.
And to your point about how civilians
that want to get out of harm's way
want to get out of Gaza,
what they're up against.
In doing so,
there are these third party talks
about potentially
getting humanitarian corridors out.
An IDF spokesperson was on with us
earlier this earlier in the show.
And I asked her where she
where the IDF thinks
that civilians in Gaza should go
if they want to get out
of the out of harm's way.
Let me play what she said
Of course, I would
say that
if they do receive any kind of advance
warning to simply put distance
from where they are
and go somewhere else,
even within the Strip
and beyond that there is another border
that the Gaza Strip has with Egypt.
And, you know, I can't speak to that
to that situation at this stage,
just showing kind of
to your point,
the lack of clarity on exactly
what it's going to look like
going forward.
It's not open.
The other side is not open.
And the people in Gaza
do not have anywhere to go.
The Israelis have said
they are going to try
to warn people when they bomb.
But we were talking to a doctor inside
Gaza last night
who said the warning amounts
to a sort of a first tap,
the quote unquote, small rocket
warning people
and hopefully they can get out in time
before the big ones,
the big bombs come down and and level
the the buildings,
which is what's happened.
They are, according to the U.N.,
some 150 or so thousand Gazans
who've already taken refuge at U.N.
facilities, including UNWRA,
as it's called, schools
and other such facilities.
But that's only a small percentage.
And I think really,
it goes to the question
that Sara also asks,
what is the end game?
Because it is,
for instance, Hamas
setting up traps
for Israeli forces as is being warned.
Does it want to try to drag
Israel into a quagmire?
Does it want to spark a regional conflict
conflagration by doing this
and more importantly,
even if Israel manages to decimate Hamas,
then who takes over?
Does Israel re-occupy?
Who then?
What then?
There's so many questions,
but Israel's aim right now
should not be misunderstood.
It is to retain and regain rather
the deterrence that it
has lost since Saturday.",20231011
FD28jY6vkhs,Israel forms emergency war cabinet,data/en_CNN\Israel forms emergency war cabinet.jpg,"&gt;&gt;&gt; Top of the hour.
I'm John Berman with Kate Bolduan and Sara
Sidner.
We just learned Israel has a government in
the war cabinet, this is Benjamin Netanyahu
who made the announcement moments ago all
of this as hundreds of thousands Israeli reservists
are staged outside Gaza.
Let's get right to become Anderson who is
in tel aviv who can explain this shift inside
the government and what it means.
Becky?
&gt;&gt; This is really important.
What we understand is that these discussions
have now being on for some days, and I have
to say there was some speculation.
We got this news yesterday, but clearly, these
negotiations on who is in this unity government
and particularly in what will be this war
cabinet have been very, very difficult, but
as we
[10:02:06 AM]
very difficult, but as we understand it now,
this is Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister,
in unity now in a coalition government in
a car cabinet with Benny Gantz who is the
leader of the national unity party and opposition
leader and former defense minister, of course,
and the defense minister Yoav Gallant this
is an emergency situation that is being addressed
now by those who have experience of war in
government here.
What isn't clear is what the makeup of this
wider group will be and sources have been
telling me that there has been much discussion
and demands made by those in opposition that
the right wing ministers, the finance and
security ministers being veer, will not be
part of
[10:03:09 AM]
being veer, will not be part of it.
All we know at this time is that Benjamin
Netanyahu is now in unity with Benny Gantz
and the defense minister here gallant to to
address what happens next and the sense is
here that what you didn't have in the cabinet,
in the government until Saturday morning was
experience.
And what you need is Spencer and authority
of characters in position who reflect the
unity of -- of the Israelis.
I am being told now, I am just getting reporting
on this.
This is an emergency cabinet, a war cabinet
at this point.
&gt;&gt; Becky, for those who -- I mean, who aren't
familiar with the players within Israeli politics
so much, just some
[10:04:10 AM]
politics so much, just some background here
of what a G deal this is as you describe it
because these are political parties and these
are men who are until now, deeply hostile
with each other and it does underline the
scale of the crisis and how much has changed
in Israel since Saturday.
Just the background, if you can offer kind
of -- Earth shattering is what Saturday was
with the hamas terror attack and this as a
response to it.
Just the perspective on that.
&gt;&gt; If we step back and consider what's going
on for months and months as being this deep,
deep division and reflected on the streets
of tel aviv and reflected in this country
with hundreds of thousands of Israelis demonstrating
and
[10:05:11 AM]
Israelis demonstrating and protesting against
what has been Israel's most right-wing government
ever.
This sense now that there is an absolute need
to bring those who are running this country
together in a war cabinet that can now address
the security concerns that Israel now face
Wes experience.
There has been much talk around the judicial
reform about how Benjamin Netanyahu and his
right wing have want been focused on what
Israelis themselves believe is important for
them and on Saturday morning, you know, that
was revealed.
Security and protection.
Where was -- why was there such a failure
of intelligence?
Why is it now that Israelis feel such a sense
of insecurity and
[10:06:12 AM]
such a sense of insecurity and vulnerability?
And it was to the prime minister, to organize
around him, to ensure now the fingers of blame
are pointed to him squarely on what happens
going forward and now the crucial nature of
what is in play here.
The complexity of what happens next with regard
of any incursion, ground incursion into gaza.
The sense now that the decisionses that are
made here in Israel about what happens in
the days and weeks ahead should not be left
to a government that, frankly, didn't have
the experience in cabinet to address these
issues.
So that now looks like the makeup that we
have in what is this new war cabinet, if I
can describe it as such with the current defense
minister, the
[10:07:13 AM]
current defense minister, the former defense
minister Benny Gantz and Benjamin Netanyahu
and heading up the decision making for the
state of Israel to address, as I say, the
complexities of what happens next.
Let's just consider those.
They have a ground incursion on the table.
They have described by the idf saturated the
southern border with troops no in anticipation,
one assumes, of a ground incursion.
We're not seeing that as of yet, but the complexities
we've been reporting now for hours in that
you have these hostages being held in various
locations as described by hamas around gaza
and then the wider story which is the plight
of the Palestinians who are in gaza.
We have a thousand dead and a total siege
of gaza and hospitals being bombed and no
fuel now to the palace station
[10:08:17 AM]
fuel now to the palace station there.
Palestinians do work with H generators in
gaza.
So there will be some generation of electricity
and provided by generators, but you know,
considering what it is that Israel faces is
decision making now and it has been clear
for some time that there was a need for -- I
don't want to call it levelheadedness, but
experience, and this will be -- this will
be demands from the outside -- from the international
community, from capitals around the world,
particularly from Washington demands that
this war cabinet",20231011

That was just an Israeli
airstrike that we just heard

a bomb or a missile.
Is that what we just heard?
Yes, we are.
Yes, that's happening. 24 hours

Everywhere. Bombing is everywhere.

going on.

I have to calm them down and
trying to
make them feel comfortable, safe, and
trying to make them busy

So they can feel afraid or scared
about like
they are like what happened with me,
for example, today
I was going trying to get out from Gaza.
I was going to the Rafah border.
And while we were going there,
we tried multiple ways to get out of
Gaza, going to the hospital so
we could make it.
And also,
my son saw all the locations destroyed
his favorite places.
He was he was shocked with what he saw.
So we had to see all that
and we had to go
through what we say.
Okay.

you're going to death
Yes.
There needs to be a way
for you to get out.
I mean, you're not Hamas.
You're an innocent person
and you have three kids.
You need to be able to get out

the suggestions from the IDF spokesman
I spoke with Saturday night.
Where are innocent
Palestinians supposed to go?
He said, you can go to the south,
you can go to the shore.
Is that at all realistic?
We just
we just heard about your attempt
to go to the border
crossing in the south,
and that didn't work.
Is there anywhere for you to go to escape
to escape this barrage of missiles?
No.
We tried everywhere.
They say go to the shore
and then they bombed the store. Next day.
They say go to the north
and then be bombed
the north areas next day,
like everywhere.
They're bombing everywhere.
So no place is safe here in Gaza Strip.
And
it's like it's just terrible
and very, very,
you know, very hard to explain.
Because they're bumping everywhere.
Well, I hope the wife
just a place
or like a place that is close to Hamas,
they're bombing places that
are not related to Hamas to like,
I don't know, everywhere.

in the retired major general
and former head of Israeli
military intelligence, Amos Yadlin.
He's also joining us from Tel Aviv.
Welcome to the program.
You heard what I was asking
the IDF spokesperson.
And obviously it's very, very tough
to figure out how to avenge this
mass murder
while also, as he says,
respecting the laws of war.
And also, as President
Biden has said, that
that must happen in all your EU and U.N.
supporters as well.
So what do you think
Amos Yadlin might happen
in the coming up as this
massacres are avenged
When the defense minister, Yoav Gallant,
says they've removed all restraints
from their soldiers,
what what do you think that might mean
And, you know,
we have to remember
what happened on Saturday, more than 1200
Israeli citizens were killed brutally
by the terror organization called Hamas.
And, by the way,
by citizens from Gaza that follows them.
It was a poor dawn.
People were killed
in families, children, women,
and women were raped.
People were killed.
Babies were beheaded.
This is something
that you should not put behind you.
It's very much like September 11,
and it's very much like your war on ISIS.
And when the U.S.
attack Mosul or Vacca,
is there will some collateral damage.
And this is
what is going to happen to Gaza,
because Israel that helped
the people of Gaza
by letting them come to work in Israel
by letting them have the capacity money
were misled by
unbelievable brutal
government of Hamas.
And this government of Hamas
is going to pay
the way the Nazis paid in Europe.
The way I speak to them,
they're tied up, paid
when they attacked Americans.
So it weakens the rules of the game.
However, we will continue to fight
according to the international law,
as American forces,
if both according
to the international law
and the lesson of law,
we say
if you want to win the war,
you have to target your your enemy.
And there is the proportionality
and proportionality principle
that allow that
some collateral damage will be there
to achieve
that objective of winning the war.
And we are in war.
I know that.
And I
now want to ask you from your perspective
and from what
you know from your position
what is the actual objective?
I don't know whether an actual objective
has been announced by the prime minister,
other than,
you know,
obviously avenging what happened
and also decimating and changing
the rules of the game, decimating Hamas.
And as one IDF spokesman said today,
changing the rules of the day.
What exactly does that mean?
Does that mean,
you know, fighting
until there's no longer Hamas in charge
or anywhere able to exert any authority
in Gaza
Yeah.
Changing the paradigm.
The paradigm was we can live with Hamas.
It is a determined organization.
It's a
we may need to have a mini wall
around every four or five years,
but they will not go to a full scale war.
This paradigm was wrong.
We allowed them
to build up a military that threaten
Israel and destroy a
the whole region of Western the Negev.
This is not going to happen again.
So to your question, there is a objective
is to reduce Hamas, get the ability
to threaten Israel
to the minimum possible.
And this means
destroying their military power
and destroying the government's power.
So does that mean I won't. Yadlin.
Does that mean
does that mean that Israel.
Then what? Then what happens?
Does Israel is Israel
also counting in the possibility of
of going back in and ruling what happens
when that happens?
We will do
what is needed at that time.
We are still in the process of cleaning,
which the Negev will Hamas militants
and restore their defense.
But in the same time,
the Israeli Air Force is conducting
a very aggressive air bombing campaign
against any targets
that belongs to Hamas in Gaza.
And unlike the past,
we are not giving a specific warning.
In the past, we used to pick the phone
and call the police and send them please
evacuate your apartment.
Not anymore.
Anything that connected to Hamas,
a command post intelligence
for logistic production will be targeted
all over Gaza until we will reduce
the capability to threaten Israel.
Close to zero. Close to zero.
And I must tell you another thing.
We are living in the Middle East
as we.
So
when you
are weak and your enemy taking over.
It's a full blown
we need to show
to demonstrate to other enemies
like Hezbollah, like Syria, like Iran,
that anybody who is dreaming about
a duplicating what Hamas has done
will suffer some things
that they haven't dream about.
And Gaza is a way
to rebuild our deterrence.
So it's going to be very very aggressive
campaign.
I hear you loud and clear,
and I guess
everybody will be hearing you.
So I guess I want to ask you,
you're saying very clearly
to rebuild the deterrence
because I'm assuming you agree
what happened on Saturday knocked
the superiority of Israel on its head.
I mean, the idea that the military,
the intelligence, everybody was caught
so much by surprise, destroyed the
the decades
old myth of Israel's superiority.
I assume that's what you're saying.
And you need to regain that.
But how do you imagine
as head of former head
of military intelligence
that that happened in the first place?
I tell you again,
there will
be a real campaign against any target
belong to Hamas in August
and there are thousands of.
And then and then don't rule out
a military move on the globe.
Because I'm a big believer in airpower.
I'm a fighter pilot in my bedroom.
But there are places and missions
that cannot be done from there.
So I don't rule out the
in a
ground operation that once again
will go
to every place that we know that Hamas,
especially the leader,
that all the leaders, that all the air
they attack,
they will not be in Gaza
at the end of the day.
They will not be in the
most. Yadlin.
And I want to continue.
I
you to the north,
because what is happening
in Gaza may affect the north,
but we can speak about it tomorrow.
Yes.
We are keeping an eye on it, by the way.
And we did ask the IDF spokesman and.
And thank you very much indeed for your
for being with us tonight.",20231011

AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
SO LET ME START WITH YOU,
MATTHEW, AND YOUR REPORTING.
U.S. OFFICIALS ARE SAYING IN
TERMS OF WHAT STARTED THIS
ATTACK AND POSSIBLY WHAT COULD
DETERMINE HOW MUCH BIGGER THIS
CONFLICT GETS.
U.S. OFFICIALS ARE SAYING THAT
THERE IS NO PROOF OR SUGGESTION
OF DIRECT IRANIAN INVOLVEMENT.
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING?
&gt;&gt; WELL, I MEAN, IN GENERAL
TERMS, ISRAELI OFFICIALS I'VE
SPOKEN TO AGREE WITH THAT
ASSESSMENT IN THE SENSE THAT
THEY'RE SAYING, LOOK, THE
BACKDROP OF THIS IS THAT IRAN
PROVIDES MATERIAL SUPPORT,
TRAINING, POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR
HAMAS.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.
THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE
JUST SAID THEN AND WHAT ISRAELI
INTELLIGENCE IS SUGGESTING.
THEY ARE SAYING TO ME, THE
SENIOR ISRAELI OFFICIAL TELLING
ME EARLIER THAT IRAN GREEN
LIGHTED THE IDEA OF THIS
OPERATION, DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE
TIMING PERHAPS, DIDN'T QUITE
UNDERSTAND PERHAPS AS MANY OF US
DIDN'T, THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT
THIS OPERATION WOULD BE BUT KNEW
THIS OPERATION WAS BEING
PLANNED.
AND THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT TO
HAVING NO INVOLVEMENT
WHATSOEVER.
IT'S NOT THAT IRAN WAS PULLING
THE STRINGS, BUT IT'S SOMEWHERE
IN THE MIDDLE.
&gt;&gt; SO, A SENIOR HAMAS OFFICIAL
IS NOW CLAIMING THAT THEY SPENT
TWO YEARS -- THAT'S AMAZING TO
THINK ABOUT THAT AS MATTHEW AND
I ARE STANDING HERE -- TWO YEARS
PREPARING FOR THIS UNPRECEDENTED
ISRAEL AND THAT IT DID FINANCIAL
AS WELL AS WEAPONS SUPPORT FROM
IRAN.
ALSO SAYING THAT RUSSIA REACHED
OUT AFTER THE ATTACK.
GENERAL HODGES, WHEN YOU PUT ALL
THIS TOGETHER, HOW SIGNIFICANT
IS THIS?
THE INVOLVEMENT THEY ARE SAYING
THEY HAD FROM BOTH RUSSIA AND
IRAN.
BUT ALSO THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT
THEY ARE SAYING THEY PLANNED
THIS THAT ISRAEL DID NOT SEE IT
COMING.
&gt;&gt; SO, ERIN, I THINK THIS IS
RUSSIA OPENING UP A SECOND
FRONT.
I MEAN, WHAT'S GOING ON NOW IS
DISTRACTING SO MUCH ATTENTION
AND EVEN RESOURCES AWAY FROM
UKRAINE, WHICH, OF COURSE,
BENEFITS RUSSIA.
NOBODY EVEN HAS MENTIONED
UKRAINE HARDLY IN THE LAST 96
HOURS.
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY ACCURATE
WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS
THERE WAS NO DIRECT INVOLVEMENT,
BUT THE WAY YOU AND MATT HAVE
LAID IT OUT, IT'S GREEN LIGHTING
THE WEAPONS, I MEAN, I WATCHED
THE TRAINING VIDEO OF THESE GUYS
WHAT, THEY WERE DOING TO PREPARE
FOR THIS ATTACK.
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU DO IN
YOUR GARAGE OR YOUR BASEMENT.
THIS IS REALLY HIGH-QUALITY
EFFORT ON THE SIDE OF HAMAS.
&gt;&gt; AND, MATTHEW, WE'RE
TALKING -- I WAS TALKING TO
SOMEONE TODAY.
THERE ARE THESE STORIES ABOUT
IDF FIGHTERS TAKING ON EIGHT TO
TEN OF THESE FIGHTERS AND
FIGHTING FOR HOURS AND HOURS IN
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT, THAT THIS
WAS ALSO GOING ON FOR QUITE SOME
TIME, THAT THESE WERE NOT JUST
HIGHLY MOTIVATED BUT HIGHLY
PREPARED AND HIGHLY ARMED
INDIVIDUALS.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.
THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE
SHOCK, ERIN, OF COURSE, TO THE
PEOPLE OF ISRAEL, THEY'RE
ENRAGED BY IT.
AND, OF COURSE, IT'S BEEN
SURPRISING AS WELL.
AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
SURPRISING FOR HAMAS AS WELL.
FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING,
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO
BE SO SUCCESSFUL, IF I CAN USE
THOSE TERMS.
PERHAPS THEY WANTED TO GET SOME
ISRAELI HOSTAGES, PERHAPS THEY
WANTED TO USE THAT TO NEGOTIATE
BETTER TERMS IN GAZA.
BUT WHERE THEY'VE GONE TO HAS
LED TO THE BRINK OF UTTER
CATASTROPHE FOR THEM AND FOR
GAZA.
&gt;&gt; AND, GENERAL HODGES, WHEN YOU
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ACTUALLY SAW
ON THE BORDER TODAY RIGHT ALONG
THAT BORDER THREE MILES AWAY,
VERY BLATANT MASSING OF ISRAELI
FORCES.
THEY ARE BUSING THEM IN.
WE HEARD HEAVY OUTGOING FIRE.
WE HEARD THE FIGHTER JETS AND
THE EXPLOSIONS AND WE SAW THEM
IN GAZA.
AND THEN AT ONE POINT 60 ROCKETS
CAME IN.
IT WAS A BARRAGE, IT WAS AN
ONSLAUGHT.
THAT'S THE TEMPO THAT WE
EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT THE
AFTERNOON TODAY.
GENERAL HODGES, WHAT DOES THIS
SAY TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IS NEXT?
DO YOU SUSTAIN THIS SORT OF BACK
AND FORTH IF SOMETHING ISN'T
ABOUT TO IMMINENTLY OCCUR?
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M PUTTING
MYSELF IN THE SHOES OF THE
COMMANDER OF, SAY, A BATTALION
COMMANDER.
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS MY
MISSION.
SOLDIERS CANNOT STAY IN A CROUCH
OR COILED LIKE THIS
INDEFINITELY.
SO, WHAT YOU HAVE SHOWN VERY
CLEARLY IS THAT THEY ARE IN THIS
CROUCH GETTING READY FOR
SOMETHING.
BUT ARE THEY GOING IN THERE TO
DO A PUNITIVE STRIKE, GO IN FOR
A FEW DAYS, KILL AS MANY HAMAS
AS THEY CAN?
OR IS THIS GOING TO END UP IN AN
OCCUPATION THAT MAYBE LASTS FOR
SEVERAL MONTHS?
THAT'S A DIFFERENT SORT OF
THING.
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD WANT TO KNOW
IF I WAS THE COMMANDER.
WHAT'S THE END STATE WE'RE BEING
SENT IN TO ACHIEVE.
NO MATTER WHICH, EITHER OF THESE
TWO POSSIBILITIES, IT'S GOING TO
BE VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.
YOU'VE POINTED OUT THE
BULLDOZERS.
THE ISRAELIS ARE PROBABLY AS
GOOD AS ANYBODY IN THE WORLD AT
USING BULLDOZERS AND OTHER
CAPABILITIES INSIDE A DENSELY
POPULATED AREA LIKE THIS.
THEY KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.
BUT EVEN WITH THAT, IT'S STILL
GOING TO BE VERY COSTLY.
&gt;&gt; AND, MATTHEW, AS YOU HAVE
SPENT SO MUCH TIME IN UKRAINE,
AND WE WERE THERE AS THE WAR
BEGAN, THERE ARE MORE THAN
DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THAT
PUTIN HAD AT ONE POINT ON THAT
BORDER AT THE BEGINNING ALONG
THIS BORDER WITH GAZA.
A VERY SMALL -- EVERYTHING HERE
IS IN A VERY SMALL SPACE.
JUST TO GIVE EVERYONE A SENSE OF
THE MASSIVE FORCE THAT IS
PREPARED.
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE GOING TO NEED
OVERWHELMING FORCE BECAUSE GAZA
IS ONE OF THE MOST DENSELY
POPULATED AREAS IN THE WORLD,
IT'S GOT THIN NARROW STREETS,
TERRIBLE FIGHTING CONDITIONS.
IT'S CRISSCROSSED BY A NETWORK
OF TUNNELS THAT ARE CONTROLLED
BY -- AND THE OTHER THING IS 150
HOSTAGES INSIDE GAZA.
THAT'S GOT TO COMPLICATE ANY
KIND OF MILITARY OPERATION.",20231012
kufj_iN41Gc,Hamas official reveals intent behind assault on Israel on Russian TV,data/en_CNN\Hamas official reveals intent behind assault on Israel on Russian TV.jpg,"I really like you.
A brazen political move.
Hamas demands that the US negotiate
the release of American hostages
on Russian TV.
In the end, for long,
there are also prisoners in the U.S..
We want them, of course.
There are Hamas members
sentenced to life in the U.S..
We demand that the U.S.
freeze our sons from their prisons.
The U.S. conducts prisoner swaps.
Only recently it did one with Iran.
Why wouldn't it conduct one with us?
Confirmation of part of the intent
behind the Hamas assaults in Israel.
They were enabled by a failure
of Israeli intelligence,
but plotted by a shadowy Hamas officer.
They call Aldin death the guest.
Only two photographs
exist of Mohammed
Dhiab, Ibrahim al-Masri, who's nearly 60.
He's known as LDA
because he billets
as a guest in a different location
every night.
He's the mastermind or monster
behind the murder of more
than a thousand in Israel
and the kidnaping of about 150 hostages.
At the beginning,
he was very much interested in fighting
before the occupation in the mid 1990s.
He was believed to be behind a
wave of atrocities in Israel.
And in 2014, he's believed to
have lost an arm and a leg
in an Israeli airstrike aimed at him
that killed his wife and daughter.
For the last two years, though,
Hamas has pretended to focus on welfare,
not warfare.
All the while under the table,
Hamas was preparing this big attack.
Israel, meanwhile, invested in automation
and sensors, a high technology
iron wall around
Gaza, and focus forces on the West Bank.
Under Deif, Hamas
encouraged Israeli complacency.
Then last weekend, it hit hard,
attacking communication towers
and automated machine guns, with drones
overrunning command and control centers,
killing senior officers, among them
three colonels.
But the
and unleashing terror
on thousands of civilians.
The Israel Defense Forces
found Hamas anti-tank mines
and other heavy weapons, a sign
they may have planned for a longer stay.
The shock infantry attack was either
deliberately brutal from the start
or degenerated into a massacre.
As Israeli defenses collapsed,
it shifted attention and power to Hamas.
He has become
like a god
to some, to some of the Palestinians
because of what he has done.
Many Palestinians are dismayed
by the massacre and the bloodshed
that's followed.
But with the lives of hostages
in his hands,
the guest now has an unwelcome place
in America's mind.

C7ROkhm2c5E,Retired colonel points out key difficulty Israeli troops would face in Gaza,data/en_CNN\Retired colonel points out key difficulty Israeli troops would face in Gaza.jpg,"While the Israel Defense Forces say
that they are currently conducting
what they're calling a large scale
strike on terror targets
belonging to Hamas in Gaza,
that is, the top US diplomat is in Israel.
And the aircraft carrier
Gerald Ford has now moved into
the region as Israeli forces are mass
along the border.
With Gaza.
And there's so many questions
now happening of what comes next.
And the real question is how could the
next phase of this conflict unfold?
I want to bring in CNN military analyst
and retired Air Force Colonel
Cedric Leighton.
Also, actor James Clapper is also back.
He's a retired Air Force
lieutenant general, Colonel Leighton,
let's begin with you because
I try to understand, what do we know
about where the Israeli troops are moving
and then what might be coming?
Laura, that's a great question.
Tonight,
we have about 300,000 Israeli reservists
that are actually deployed on the border.
And so where are they actually well,
this is probably
a pretty good indication
right around all of these areas.
Right here
is where you will find Israeli troops
concentrated
and what are they concentrating with?
Well, equipment like these tanks right
here, they have tanks, armored personnel
carriers and other equipment that they can
potentially use to go into Gaza.
And that, I think, is going to make
a big difference in what they could
potentially do with some kind of ground
incursion on their part
It's hard for most people to imagine
just how densely populated Gaza is.
I mean, just we've heard about it.
We've been hearing about comparisons
that are drawn.
Tell me about the impact of that
on the next phase of a potential ground
incursion.
Yeah, that's a very interesting area
as well, Laura, because the most densely
populated
part of Gaza is the city of Gaza itself.
So that's this part right here that has
over 25,000 people per square mile.
Other areas like North Gaza, Darryl
Paula Khan Yunis, which is a major refugee
camp,
and Rafah, have less population densities,
but still everything in Gaza is basically
with little bit of an exception.
10,000 people or more per square mile.
So you think of a lot of people
that are packed into a very small area.
And just by comparison, there are places
that have higher population density
per square mile around the world,
but Gaza has more populations density
per square mile, about 21,000 people
per square mile in the urban areas
compared to Tel Aviv, Los Angeles
or here in the Washington, D.C.
area.
Wow. When you look at that comparison,
it really drives home the point of just
how densely populated and also
what would take place
if you had troops moving into those areas.
This is civilians we're talking about
in those areas in particular.
And so the US has moved
assets into the region.
What role could US firepower play,
if any, going forward?
Well, there are a lot of things
that we would have to contend with here,
and one of them are the dense streets.
So you look at how narrow things are.
This is what General Clapper
and I would call battle damage assessment.
Perfect video for that.
You see what damage has been done here.
But look how cavernous all of this is.
Look at all the different buildings
and look at how difficult it would be
to maneuver something through each
and every one of these streets.
So a lot of things
that would be coming into the area
include deliveries of munitions like you
see here from this Israeli cargo jet.
You have the USS Gerald
R Ford with its aircraft
is 70 to 90 aircraft depending on
how they did the carrier battle group.
And you've got them
coming into the eastern Mediterranean,
along with Air Force F-35s and F-15s,
as well as A-10s.
All of those play a huge part
in putting the U.S.
presence in this area and making sure that
this conflict doesn't go
any further than that.
It really has already.
Colonel Leighton, that's so important
to think about and just seeing all that,
Director Clapper, I want to ask you
about what we've been seeing from
Colonel Leighton,
because that population density,
there are hostages likely in Gaza.
You don't know where they are.
You see what is ahead and trying
to move ground troops into that area.
What strikes you as the most difficult
aspect of trying to get people out?
Well, a very compressed geography,
very crowded, urban, urbanized
terrain.
Urban terrain.
And so you wonder how, given
that sort of situation,
how they're going to move all that
heavy equipment, those tanks down these
very narrow streets that are in the Gaza.
So the question that comes to my mind
is what rules of engagement
is the Israeli Ministry of Defense
and the IDF chief
instructing,
providing to these the troops?
How exactly do they conduct themselves
if and when they actually enter enter
into the Gaza?
They've got so
many things to consider here.
A very
difficult terrain to start within operate
equipment, even in a passive environment,
which are benign environment,
which this is not.
They've got to contend with booby traps,
IEDs, snipers,
and plus the presence of a very dense
civilian population.
And also to to be
considered
are the location of the hostages
probably dispersed widely,
probably underground.
So what I wonder
about is, you know, the operations order
that is being issued
to or will be
issued to the Israeli attacking force
and what the rules of engagement are on
how they are to conduct those operations.
Mindful of all these factors,
there's so much to consider
and we're going to continue to unpack.
Colonel DeLay,
and thank you so much to Clapper.",20231012
VWu7zjxvOxg,'It was animal slaughter': Israeli festival survivor describes horror,data/en_CNN\'It was animal slaughter' Israeli festival survivor describes horror.jpg,"The infamous rampage through
the outdoor
music festival
killed at least 260 partiers, at least.
Many are still missing, and the stories
keep coming out.
Sara Ben Sala barely survived.
He's shown here dancing with friends
just hours before the massacre.
And I spoke to him
from hospital in Tel Aviv.
And a warning to
his story is difficult to hear.
I want to make it clear.
First thing first,
it was at this festival
and we
and we did nothing to provoke them.
We just was dancing and having fun.
I can't.
I can forget the moment
that when I got in the festival
and I don't know anybody, anyone there,
it was something like 34,000 people.
And just got into the entrance and a
just a guy that I don't even know
then came to me
and start to hug me and bless him
for coming for the festival.
We had a small camp
next to us, the German
people from German, just tourist
who came all over the way from Berlin
or wherever they came,
and we made drinks together.
We had laugh.
It's just so much happiness.
What happened to you?
Tell me how you got wounded.
And I forget when I saw the story.
The first moment that we realized
that there is myself,
I was really come in first
because it's not the first time
to the same
missiles I was fighting in
there took it down.
And then I was doing.
I've been serving the army.
And then
then the start towards the missiles.
And one of the producers of the festival
just jumped on the fence
and screamed
that the terrorists are coming
and legs and legs
just they kind of landed
not there for myself.
And then the panic begin.
It was a big panic.
Everybody was jumping on the fence.
Everybody ran to their cars
and there was a lot of fire out there.
Just even in the biggest war thing
that we seen in the movie movies.
I can explain
almost how many bullets and missile
were flying around up,
not to the big mister like RPG
and everything was RPG all over.
I was fighting in the war.
Never seen so many RPG history.
And how did you get shot?
And Sahar, how did you get get shot?
The part of the story,
we tried to go to another place
and they turned us around again.
And then when
we saw a policeman
standing next to a shelter
and the look of us
and the policeman
look at us say,
there is no ID, there are,
they are all over the place.
Get inside the shelter.
It's the only way we got inside.
The shelters are suffering.
I remember 30 or 40 people,
but my friend say that was six
still living there, 50 or 60 people.
And we got inside.
The shattered was something like
two meters at all,
like just two meter square.
And we got inside
and then the shooting started
and the policeman tried to come down.
It's not a terrorist is the IDF.
But the shooting was on us.
I could see the shot.
I couldn't.
I can feel on the
on the stance of the soldier killed
at the bullets.
In this case, it's not IDF.
It's not IDF.
And then just look at us, say,
stay inside, pull out the gun.
And then it was a mass of shots
all over the place.
We can see in the intensive, the shelter,
a lot of bullets flying inside,
but they couldn't get us
because if they can turn left,
but because it was an entrance
and then left to the shelter,
a small something like.
So we made the saw.
It sounds
to me like you're
directed to take shelter,
but you were like a cornered animal
in this shelter because that's where the.
Shelter it wasn't.
It wasn't the shelter.
It was animal slaughter.
It's like they take
all the animals to one place
and shoot them all.
And then
the policeman got shot in the run away
and he killed one of the terrorists,
but got shot and thrown away.
I found him on soccer life and God,
the policeman
and one second, silly.
Then they
they dropped the first grenade
drop inside.
It was to explode in the entrance.
I'm sorry if it's too much to.
Take my life. Okay.
I need to tell about this.
Just a second, please. Thank you.
After the first
grenade of something like 45 seconds,
it dropped the second grenade
and they hit the wall, hit my head
and blow to the back of the rope
for the people of the people
in the back row and explode on their.
And then was it
something like a lot of smoke inside?
And they my friend, their friend,
they start to choke.
And she wanted to go out
and to
start to run away from the shelter.
We tried to catch her.
I remember
I wasn't the second of the people.
I tried to catch her with my hand
and it was sleeping and she tackle,
I think she tackled the terrorists
and the shutter
Then from the zero, from zero
point blank.
From point blank. Point blank
from point
blank and after, after each other.
Then it just got to the side.
I could never forget the face of it.
It was smiling at us.
It looks like the devil just looked at us
one point.
The gun,
the column,
the machine gun in front again, face.
And just to spread everything around
all the people.
I was in the second row,
all the people in the first
or in the second row shot dead.
I just opened my eyes and opened my mouth
and start to go down the world
because I got
I understood that I got hit.
But then in a state
where yet because it was blood
all over and screaming
and from all the adrenaline,
I got it it in my body.
But I can't really understand
what happened.
And I think his gun was broken that way.
Stopped the shot
and there was a third grenade
inside of the building,
but it didn't explode.
We found him on the floor.
We would you say with that
we don't don't touch it
so it wouldn't explode.
You know what, Sara?
I'm just pleased that you made it out.
What a complete and utter horror.
I wish it was all over in all the movie.
You can go outside somehow.
We then. And no joke.
I saw the kids that
the bodies full of bullets again,
that all all the body parts on the floor.
And she was calling to her boyfriend
and dead boyfriend
and start to kiss him until she got
she died by herself.
Wow. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry for you.
I'm so happy that you survived.
And we wish you all the best.
And we thank you for this story,
because as you say,
it's important for people to hear
what happened.
Thank you very. Much. Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Just really wanted to make it clear.
Just last think.
It wasn't the war.
It was a slider. Cicely.
It wasn't the war.
It was a big slider
that didn't care about animals or people.
You didn't care
if you're a Jew, American,
a Christian, even not a muslim.
They killed even evil Muslims.
They killed
you didn't care about anything.
I was convinced.
My conversation
with Sahar in the hospital in Tel Aviv
is too difficult.",20231012

HAS THREATENED TO HOLD TONY

DONALD TRUMP, AND I WANT TO
PLAY FOR EVERYONE WHAT HE SAID

JUST RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM
THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE.
LISTEN TO THIS.
&gt;&gt; I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT BIBI
NETANYAHU LET US DOWN.
THAT WAS A VERY TERRIBLE THING,
I WILL SAY THAT.
WHAT I SEE SOMETIMES IN
INTELLIGENCE, WE TALK ABOUT THE
INTELLIGENCE OR YOU TALK ABOUT
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WENT
WRONG OVER THE LAST WEEK.
THEY'VE GOT TO STRAIGHTEN IT
OUT, BECAUSE THEY'RE FIGHTING
POTENTIALLY A VERY BIG FORCE.
AND THEY SAID, SHE, I HOPE
HEZBOLLAH DOESN'T ATTACK FROM

BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST
VULNERABLE SPOT.
I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE.

THEY'RE ALL VERY SMART.
&gt;&gt; VERY SMART.
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE WHITE HOUSE JUST PUT THIS
OUT, A SPOKESPERSON ON THESE
STATEMENTS SAYS, WE DON'T

STATEMENTS LIKE THIS ARE
DANGEROUS AND UNHINGED.
IT'S COMPLETELY LOST ON US WHY
ANY AMERICAN WOULD EVER PRAISE
AN IRAN-BACKED TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION AS SMART, OR HAVE
ANY OBJECTION TO THE UNITED
STATES WARNING TERRORISTS NOT
TO ATTACK ISRAEL, ESPECIALLY
NOW AS ISRAEL'S FIGHTING BACK
AGAINST ONE OF THE WORST ACTS
OF MASS MURDER IN THE COUNTRY'S
HISTORY.
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THERE USED TO BE
AN IDEA THAT WAS --
BY REPUBLICANS.
PARTISANSHIP OUGHT TO END AT
THE WATER'S EDGE.
THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE IN A
TIME OF CRISIS LIKE THIS, WITH
AN ALLY.
THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP
DIDN'T HAVE THE DECENCY TO TRY
TO UNITE THE NATION, BUT HIS
INSTINCT IS ALWAYS TO DIVIDE
AND MAKE IT ABOUT HIMSELF.
AND THEN TO PRAISE THE
TERRORISTS, WHO ARE MURDERING
CHILDREN, AS VERY SMART.
YOU KNOW, IT REMINDS ME OF
LANGUAGE HE USED AFTER TEAM IN
SQUARE, WHEN HE PRAISED THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME
FOR BEING TOUGH AND SMART.
HE SEEMS TO PRAISE VIOLENT
ACTIONS BY SO-CALLED STRONGMAN
OR GROUPS.
AND IT'S PART OF THAT.
IT'S THIS INSTINCT TO MAKE IT
ALL ABOUT HIMSELF, NOT THINKING
ABOUT, OTHERS LET ALONE
THINKING ABOUT THE NATION.
&gt;&gt; CAN I JUST QUICKLY ASK YOU
ABOUT THAT?
WE JUST SAW ANTHONY BLINKEN IN
A REMARKABLE, UNPRECEDENTED
GATHERING OF ISRAELIS, HUGGING
HIM, CRYING IN HIS ARMS.
HE SECRETARY OF STATE, HE'S
WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION.
DO YOU SEE THIS AS DONALD TRUMP
TRYING TO FIND HIS ROLE, TO GET
THE ATTENTION HE SO CRAVES AS
OPPOSED TO TRYING TO GOVERN?
TRYING TO SHOW --
&gt;&gt; THAT'S INSTINCT.
HE'S GOT TO INSERT HIMSELF.
WHAT HE FEELS WHEN IT'S NOT
ABOUT HIM, EVEN IF IT'S A
TERRORIST ATTACK TRYING TO
INSERT HIMSELF IN THIS.
THE ABILITY TO RISE ABOVE AND
UNITE.
I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT
ANYTHING MORE THAN HIS EGO AND
HIS INSTINCT TO PRAISE STRONG
MEN.
NO BETTER HOW UGLY THAT IS.
THIS IS NOT HARD TO UNITE RIGHT
NOW.
&gt;&gt; IS IT AS SIMPLE, ANNA, AS
MAYBE --
&gt;&gt; GO AHEAD.
&gt;&gt; IT IS BECAUSE FOR ME DONALD
TRUMP IS --
HE IS AN INCOHERENT, NARCISSIST,
WHO MAKES EVERYTHING ABOUT
HIMSELF.
BUT FOR ME, THE PROBLEM REALLY
IS PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR TIM
SCOTT.
WHO TALKED ABOUT JOE BIDEN
HAVING BLOOD ON HIS HANDS.
PEOPLE LIKE RONNA MCDANIEL'S,
THE HEAD OF THE RMC, WHO SAID
THAT THIS IS A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY FOR REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATES.
THAT IS IRRESPONSIBLE.
YOU SEE, AMERICANS HERE HAVE TO
TALK WITH ONE VOICE.
THERE IS ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE
WITH BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS, AND
THAT IS HAMAS.
AND WHETHER YOU ARE
PRO-PALESTINIAN OR WHETHER YOU
ARE PRO ISRAELI OR WHETHER YOUR
PRO BOTH, YOU HAVE TO BE
AGAINST HAMAS.
AND THAT IS WHAT OUR FOCUS AS
AMERICANS, AND CERTAINLY THE
MEMBERS OF OUR GOVERNMENTS AND
THOSE WHO HAVE PLATFORMS AND
OUR LEADERS SHOULD BE DIRECTING
THEIR FIRE AND DIRECTING THEIR
VOICE.
AND THE CONTRAST, AGAIN, COULD
NOT BE STARK.

THANKING AMERICA AND THANKING
JOE BIDEN, AT A TIME WHEN YOU

HIM.
AND THEY ARE HUGGING HIM AS AN

YOU SEE HERE IN AMERICA PEOPLE
TRYING TO BLAME AMERICANS FOR
WHAT JUST HAPPENED IN ISRAEL.
COME ON, FOLKS.
COME ON.
STOP THIS.
STOP THE INSANITY, STOP THE

WE HAVE TO UNITE AT A TIME LIKE
THIS.

BIBI NETANYAHU LET US DOWN THAT
WAS A VERY TERRIBLE THING. I
WILL SAY THAT ALL RIGHT,
OLIVIER KNOX, THE AUTHOR OF THE
WASHINGTON POST DAILY TO O2.
AND OF COURSE, NATIONAL
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IS BACK
WITH US ON THIS.
&gt;&gt; SO OLIVIER THE STAKES ARE
VERY HIGH. OF COURSE, WITH THIS
STORY BUT THE REALITY IS QUITE
PAR FOR THE COURSE WHEN IT
COMES TO DONALD TRUMP
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT REALLY IS. I MEAN,
WE STILL, WE HAVE TO START BY
SAYING, WHO KNOWS IF WHAT HE
SAID IS TRUE EVEN.
&gt;&gt; BUT YES, WE'RE TRYING TO
FIGURE THAT OUT AS YOU AND I
SPEAK. SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT
CAVEAT. I'M GLAD YOU RAISED,
BUT WE'VE WATCHED WE'VE WATCHED
THE ISRAELI RESPONSE TO THE
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S SUPPORT
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS.
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAS, HAS
JUST REPEATEDLY PRAISED THE
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. YOU SAW
THE SHOW OF SOLIDARITY TODAY
WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE,
TONY BLINKEN. IT'S NOT SUPER
HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHY DONALD
TRUMP MIGHT BE ANGRY AT BIBI
NETANYAHU NOW AND I DON'T THINK
IT HAS A LOT TOO. DO WITH A
YEARS OLD RAID AGAINST
AIRSTRIKE. I SHOULD SAY AGAINST
A TOP IRANIAN GENERAL.
&gt;&gt; IT'S
&gt;&gt; IT IS PART FOR THE COURSE IN
ANOTHER WAY WHICH IS OF COURSE
THAT HE HAS HISTORICALLY SAID A
LOT OF NICE THINGS ABOUT A LOT
OF BAD PEOPLE. HE'S PRAISED KIM
JONG UN. HE'S PRAISED THE
CHINESE RESPONSE, THE CHINESE
CRACKDOWN TO TENEMENTS HE
PRAISED VLADIMIR PUTIN. THIS
IS, AS YOU SAY, IT'S, IT'S VERY
PART FOR THE COURSE BUT I DON'T
THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AWAY FROM
THIS.
&gt;&gt; NO, I'M I'M GLAD YOU I'M
GLAD YOU PUT IT THAT WAY. I
AGREE. AND I'M SURE THAT THERE
ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE MISSING. I
WANT TO BRING IN THE REST OF
OUR POLITICAL PANEL HERE NOW,
JOINING US AS BRIAN FALLON, HE
IS THE CO-FOUNDER OF DEMAND
JUSTICE AND THE FORMER PRESS
SECRETARY FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S
2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. AND
WE ALSO HAVE SARAH MATTHEWS,
THE FORMER DEPUTY PRESS
SECRETARY WITH THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION. SO SARA, BEFORE
I GET TO BEFORE I GET TO THE
WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE AND TALK
TO BRIAN ABOUT IT, I JUST LIKE
TO KINDA GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO
RESPOND TO WHAT THE FORMER
PRESIDENT SAID HERE ABOUT THIS
RAID. I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT DID OR DIDN'T
HAPPEN THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO
SHARE WITH US IN TERMS OF
DETERMINING THE VERACITY OF
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY AND IF NOT,
AND PERHAPS IT'S CLASSIFIED SO
PERHAPS I'M ASSUMING THAT IF
NOT I'M JUST CURIOUS. YOU'RE
TAKE ON WHAT HIS MOTIVATIONS
MIGHT BE IN SAYING THIS. NOW
&gt;&gt; I WASN'T AT THE WHITE HOUSE
WHEN THIS RAID HAPPENED, AND SO
I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT
AND HIS THINKING ON THAT
SPECIFIC THING, BUT I THINK
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT IT
WAS REPORTED IN 2021 THAT
DONALD TRUMP WAS VERY UNHAPPY
WITH NETANYAHU BECAUSE
NETANYAHU WAS ONE OF THE FIRST
PEOPLE TO CONGRATULATE
PRESIDENT BIDEN ON HIS WIN IN
THE NOVEMBER ELECTION AND SO I
THINK THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY
WHAT IS MOST SIGNIFICANT AND
DRIVING TRUMP'S BEEF WITH
NETANYAHU AND WHY HE MADE THOSE
REMARKS. HE MIGHT SAY IT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT
SOLEMANI STRIKE AND THAT COULD
BE PART OF IT, BUT I DO THINK
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THAT HE WAS
UPSET THAT NETANYAHU
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT BIDEN WON THE
ELECTION FAIR AND SQUARE. AND
SO THAT SEEMS TO BE THE DRIVING
FORCE HERE, BUT IT IS REALLY
DISGUSTING THESE REMARKS THAT I
THINK HE MADE WHERE HE'S THE
FORMER PRESIDENT IS PRAISING
HEZBOLLAH. AND I THINK A LOT OF
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE BEEN
CRITICAL OF CONGRESSWOMAN TLAIB
FOR REFUSING TO DENOUNCE HAMAS
SHOULD BE EQUALLY UPSET DONE
WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT FOR
PRAISING HEZBOLLAH AND MAKING
THESE REMARKS AT A TIME WHEN WE
NEED TO SHOW SOLIDARITY WITH
ISRAEL AND SHOW UNWAVERING
SUPPORT",20231012
SvpifAzCMCI,Explosion interrupts live Gaza interview,data/en_CNN\Explosion interrupts live Gaza interview.jpg,"Israel's military launched a
new wave of airstrikes
on the region Thursday morning.
The Palestinian health
ministry says more than 1200
people have been killed
and at least 6000
wounded by Israeli bombardment.
The health ministry says
it expects hospitals to run out of fuel
for generators today,
leading to what it calls
catastrophic conditions.
Joining us now is no shower, Oxfam
regional country
relations manager in Gaza City.
Najla,
thank you so much for sparing this time
to speak to us.
I know that yesterday
or certainly earlier
this week, Oxfam was
warning that what's happening in
Gaza would lead to
a humanitarian catastrophe.
Would you say that's already begun?
Yes. Hi.
Thanks for having me, first of all.
Yeah.
It's very obvious
that the crisis is increasing rapidly
and there is a severe,
severe impact on
on the population of Gaza.
The entire population of Gaza.
The numbers of of displaced
people has been increasing,
reaching to around 200
plus thousand people
within the Gaza Strip and some are
are in and under U.N.
administered schools
trying to take shelters there.
We are extremely worried
because of the tightening
of the Israeli siege.
We have to be aware
that the Israeli siege
has been there for more than 15 years.
And so when you ask me about electricity,
we never had
a full day of electricity
since more than 15, 16 years.
And now we have zero electricity before.
At the best times we had to wait.
And that's just an example at 8 hours.
I mean,
and currently
we are extremely worried
about the infrastructure
that is responsible for delivering basic
services such as water.
So electricity affects
water directly in the Gaza Strip.
There is no ability to pump
water to the networks.
That's also in addition
to that, severe damages.
That is not yet clear.
The the extent of the extent of it,
that's apparently is going to be a very,
very grave.
And I think what is also
most important to know
that Gaza is already
suffering before October 2nd,
before October 7th,
you will have half of the population
under poverty.
You are living in a situation
when there is no economic
viability of any activity.
Israel has full control about on export
and import.
Israel conducts
regular attacks and that affects
livelihood groups within the Gaza Strip.
Yeah.
So just
in terms of your immediate concerns,
obviously,
Secretary Blinken
is trying to organize
a humanitarian corridor
that's going to be very difficult
to negotiate right now,
isn't it, with the Israelis,
because they're talking
about a complete siege.
But what is the most important thing
that you need right now
just to get through the next few days?
What is really needed immediately
is to have a ceasefire to
to to allow people of Gaza to
to receive support and basic services, to
at least for the paramedics to be able to
to have have some work around it,
that hospitals hospitals are packed with
with injuries.
There are still injuries that
are are everywhere.
There is no accessibility to
organizations on the ground
to to deliver support.
There's no ability for our population
to move and get get what we need or,
you know, get the water that we need
or the food that we need.
We need immediate,
immediate ceasefire so that we are able
also to support those who are under
under these very,
very harsh
circumstances, especially
who are taking shelter at the schools
and who are being hosted
in just very random places
and public places
around the Gaza Strip, I,
I only want everyone
I know
person really
is not living in their home.
Everyone I know is
is moving from one place to another,
from a public place
to another, at home to a relative, etc..
This must it must be stopped.
And I think
it's going to be very worrying
in terms of supplies, food supplies,
entry of medical supplies
and all of these essential items.
I mean, by the hour, that is.
And severe, severe suffering in addition
to the actual death in the
in the hospitals themselves
that are overloaded
with with injuries and casualties
from some of the bombings just.
Please don't continue this interview.
If you feel that
you need to
go somewhere else for your safety.
Do you do you need to leave?
It's fine.
No, I'm good.
It's not what it's like all the time.
Yeah, I mean, exactly.
Just this morning,
there was a massive airstrike
at Al-Shati camp,
and it's it's extremely shocking
the images.
And I hope these images will make
will make news out at your
your channel, for example, where
it seems there's a huge massacre.
It's a densely populated area
where just bodies are on the job.
And I mean,
I think the situation
is extremely critical
and negotiating safe passage.
I'm not sure if this is
going to be
just to evacuate foreigners or that
or who
I mean,
this does not really respond to what
what would what people would need.
Of course, it's an interesting
you know, I just.
Wanted to offer on your back,
you know, you've just had that, you know,
it was also a very close explosion
and you just sat there
and carried on with the interview.
Whereas, you know what?
You know,
a lot of people
watching would assume
you would run off
and go to some safe space.
But is it
because you just haven't
got anywhere to go
and you're just so used to it?
Well, absolutely.
Thank you.
Thank you for raising this.
I mean, in the entire Gaza Strip,
I mean, we don't have shelters.
I mean
I mean, the best circumstances
is that you go to I would love you know,
I'm very lucky.
I have a basement
where that's
why I'm receiving
more than 12 people
in addition to my family
who are all now I'm hosting at my place.
And so they are unable
to go back to their homes
because they are severely damaged.
And my area that was wiped and
we're managing to live together.
So whenever that is
something, you know,
kind of close
or big like this, we just,
you know,
walk around in the corridors
and then slowly, slowly
go to the lower level, etc..
And we we stick around each other.
And that's what happened at 5 a.m.
this morning, for example,
when massive airstrikes were happening in
the Gaza port
and and the west,
the western side of the city,
just across across the street from me,
that was the building that was
totally destroyed.
We had to evacuate.
We we left running basically with
in the middle of the night after 1 a.m.
two nights ago.
And all of us, we were 20, stopped
at my house, 20, 20, 22 people
who who fled their region came to us.
Then we moved all of us to two different.
We we split into two different places.
I mean,
we're talking about the
mad situation here,
a totally mad situation.
And I
should thank you
so much for joining us this morning.
Obviously, your priority is to help
these people and these civilians.
But this is obviously
this is your life as well.
And we've seen that
expressed so obviously today.
Best of luck with what you're doing
and thank you for making the time.
Thank you.
Thank you for having me.",20231012

JaVjqS6fbBI,Retired general: The issue with Palestinians leaving Gaza,data/en_CNN\Retired general The issue with Palestinians leaving Gaza.jpg,"Hundreds of
thousands of reservists
are now gathering at the border
with Gaza
six days after the Hamas
terror attacks on Israel.
The White House now
says 27 Americans were killed.
14 remain unaccounted for.
Joining us now to discuss is retired U.S.
Army Brigadier General Peter Zwack.
General Zwack
thank you so much for being with us.
The White House has made it
clear that recovering Americans
being held hostage
by Hamas is a key priority.
How do you see that playing out?
Well, it's
it's it's
it's extraordinarily complicated
because it's likely that
that most of those Americans
or a percentage of them
are also Israeli citizens
and they're intermingled
with the other hostages
from a number of countries.
So
my instinct is that we need to
fall in and support the Israelis
while they
do the lead effort
to work those hostages out.
I don't think that
it's right for a negotiator.
And they can try.
But after what Hamas has done,
I don't think anybody's
in the mood for that.
But the problem is,
is that what will happen
if Hamas,
as they've shown extraordinary,
ruthless already.
They're already
so deep into the into this that,
you know, they can perpetuate it.
What do they do, for example,
to start pulling hostages out
and shooting them
if they're not getting their demands met?
And at that point, at
what point do you go in with major forces
or Israeli special operations or combined
special ops?
I don't know.
It's devilishly complicated.
I believe there's a lot of midnight oil
being burned in capitals.
And but what this does do is it
it just continues
to show the depravity of Hamas.
And I think a key angle is to try to,
as much as possible,
separate Hamas in Gaza from the
Palestinian civilians,
that they're caught in the middle of this
and are also hostage
to this awful situation.
I want to expand on that point.
General, is there any potential
for humanitarian
corridors, ways for those civilians
to get out of harm's way?
What would your advice be?
Well, my advice would be
and I'm so far away from this, would be
you're all you've got.
You know,
I know we're talking to the Egyptians
and other nations all.
There would be a hard mission as well,
because how do you manage the flow?
There will be also a major effort to make
sure that that
the any any type of outflow.
Where do the refugees go?
Egypt,
I don't think is ready to take on
thousands or hundreds of thousands
of of displaced persons.
This is really hard.
And I know in the whole this discussion
about sending food
and aid up through those corridors
makes eminent sense.
But do they?
But does it get to the Palestinians
who desperately needed in
in the in the city, or does it go into
feed to feed the Hamas and and continue?
I'll make one other point about Hamas.
How how ruthless
and how they purport
to be supporting the Palestinian,
the fact that even now
they're firing rockets out of built up
hell out of built up Gaza shows
they have no disregard.
They have
they have total disregard for the
for the Palestinian citizens
who they are using for cover.
And that should be,
I don't know, through
leaflets or narrative,
get out to the populations
who to that Palestinian population.
That is key in all of this.
Million a couple million of them.
Brigadier General Peter Zwack,
very much appreciate your time, sir.
Thanks for joining us.
Thank you for having me.",20231012
g2Ntxk_ZQTg,Drone footage of war-torn Gaza shows immense destruction,data/en_CNN\Drone footage of war-torn Gaza shows immense destruction.jpg,"Ben, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza
seems to be growing worse by the hour.
Well, in fact, Wolf, the UN
is describing it as dire.
And I think the U.N.
is rather understating the case.
It sounds,
by all accounts
that it's callous traffic.
In addition
to the fact
that the death toll in
Gaza has now exceeded 1500.
The health system, by all accounts,
and according to the Palestinian health
Ministry, is in a state of collapse.
All the things you need to run a hospital
are slowly running out.
The fuel
for the generators
that keep the hospitals
running medicine,
basic
supplies are simply not
being replenished.
And therefore,
we're seeing that,
for instance, in hospitals
all around Gaza,
many of the injured are
simply put on the floor in the corridors.
There are no beds left.
The operating theaters are beyond
capacity now,
according to the United Nations.
There are 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza
who now have no access
to health care,
partially
because of the fighting,
but partially because the health workers
and all the facilities are being focused
on treating the injured.
Now, speaking of the injured, earlier
this evening, our colleague
Christiane Amanpour spoke to Dr.
Hassan Abu City,
who's a
Palestinian British
doctor who has been going
to Gaza regularly.
I've interviewed him
many times,
also in
operating theaters
while he's actually
operating on the injured.
And he says that the among the wounded,
30 to 40% of them are children.
And certainly there is a
sense in Gaza that
at this point
people feel that the ordinary civilians,
they are simply being abandoned
but are not doing enough.
No one cries over us.
There's no chivalry, no feelings.
Hearts are dead.
Only shocks and body parts remain.
People are blind to this.
People can't find food in their homes.
And there is an extremely
tough social condition in Gaza.
Siege above the siege.
And all of this is happening
because of the siege.
Where should our people go?
We've been besieged for 18 years.
Where should we go?
And and of course, where can they go?
They cannot go anywhere.
The border to Egypt is closed.
They can't go into Israel.
The United States
and other European powers
are trying to figure out
some sort of humanitarian corridor
so Palestinian civilians
who have to can get out of Gaza.
But at this point,
no progress on that front.",20231013

INVESTIGATION ABOUT HOW HAMAS
PLANNED SATURDAYS ATTACK, WE
BROUGHT YOU THE STORY OF THE
HAMAS OFFICIAL WHO MASTERMINDED
THE BRUTAL SHOUT KNOWN AS THE
GUEST FOR HIS NEED TO LARGE IN
A DIFFERENT LOCATION EVERY
NIGHT TO STAY ALIVE.
TONIGHT, CLARISSA WARD JOINS US
AGAIN WITH NEW INFORMATION
ABOUT WHERE THESE GUNMAN
TRAINED, AND HOW THEY WERE
RIGHT UNDER THE NOSES, IN SOME,
CASE OF THE ISRAELI DEFENSE
FORCES FOR YEARS CLARISSA, WHAT
HAVE YOU LEARNED?
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, ANDERSON,
THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE
INTELLIGENCE FAILURES THAT LED
UP TO THE ATROCITIES LAST
SATURDAY.
CNN'S OPEN SOURCE INVESTIGATOR,
PAUL MURPHY, HAS SPENT THE LAST
FEW DAYS POURING THROUGH A
YEARS OF SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEO,
SATELLITE IMAGERY, AND THE
RESULTS AND THE FINDINGS ARE
SHOCKING.
[SOUND OF GUNFIRE]
&gt;&gt; PROPAGANDA VIDEOS PUT OUT BY
HAMAS WERE REVEALING CHILLING
DETAILS ABOUT THE YEARS OF
PREPARATIONS THAT WENT INTO
SATURDAY'S BLOODY ATTACKS
RIGHTS UNDER ISRAEL'S NOSE.
ANALYZING METADATA FROM THE
VIDEOS, A CNN INVESTIGATION CAN
REVEAL THE PRESENCE OF AT LEAST
SIX TRAINING SITES INSIDE GAZA.
ONE JUST 720 METERS FROM THE
MOST HEAVILY FORTIFIED PART OF
ISRAEL'S BORDER.
IN THAT CAMP, HAMAS RECREATED
AND HE'S REALLY COMPOUND, WITH
ELEMENTS OF THE NEARBY BORDER
CROSSING, INCLUDING AN INSIGNIA
OF THE AREAS RETALIATION.
THE VIDEO SHOWED THE EVEN
PRACTICE TAKING PRISONERS, AND
ZIP TYING THEIR HANDS AT THE
CAMP.
SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THE
CAMP WAS CONSTRUCTED WITHIN THE
LAST YEAR AND A HALF.
TWO OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE
SOUTHERN PARTS OF GAZA, HAMAS
TRAINED FOR THEIR AUDACIOUS
PARAGLIDER ASSAULT, REHEARSING
TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS AT ALL
SIX SITES, TWO YEARS OF
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVIEWED BY
CNN SHOWS NO INDICATION OF
OFFENSIVE ISRAELI MILITARY
ACTION.
THE IMAGERY INSTEAD SHOWS THAT
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, SOME
CAMPS EVEN EXPANDED INTO
FARMLAND, ANOTHER'S ACTIVITY IN
THE CAMPS.
THE STUNNING REVELATIONS RAISED
QUESTIONS AS TO HOW HAMAS WAS
ABLE TO TRAIN SO OPENLY, SO
CLOSE TO THE BORDER FOR SO
LONG.
WHY ISRAELI OFFICIALS WERE
UNABLE TO PICK UP ON AND
PREVENT THE OCTOBER 7TH ATTACK.
&gt;&gt; CLARISSA, WHAT'S THE IDEA'S
RESPONSE TO THIS?
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE COURSE REACHED OUT
AND ASKED HIM FOR A STATEMENT,
WHICH THEY HAVE PROVIDED.
I WANT TO READ A VERBATIM WE
CANNOT PROVIDE ANSWERS TO YOUR
QUESTIONS, SINCE THEY RELATE TO
THE COMPLEX ANALYSIS OF
INTELLIGENCE AT THE SAME TIME
THAT WE ARE FIGHTING A WAR.
THIS TOPIC TOGETHER WOULD
NUMEROUS OTHER ISSUES WILL BE
INVESTIGATED BY THE IDF AT THE
END OF THE WAR.
IT IS WORTH MENTIONING,
ANDERSON, THAT HISTORICALLY
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY STRIKES
THAT ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES
HAVE MATES ON HAMAS TRAINING
CAMPS.
ALSO, I WOULD JUST MENTION,
THESE QUESTIONS THAT WE ARE
ASKING OUR QUESTIONS THAT A LOT
OF ISRAELIS WANT ANSWERS TO.
THE TIMING MAY NOT BE RIGHT NOW,
I THINK PEOPLE APPRECIATE THAT
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE
PRIORITY.
BUT, THEY WILL WANT THOSE
ANSWERS, ANDERSON.
&gt;&gt; THERE IS ALSO QUESTION ABOUT
U.S. INTELLIGENCE FAILURES.
ASSUMING THAT, I MEAN, GIVEN
THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE
CAPABILITIES THEY DIDN'T SEE
THIS EITHER.
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE ARE MANY
QUESTIONS, ANDERSON, ABOUT HOW
ON EARTH THIS COULD HAVE
HAPPENS.
I MEAN, YOU LOOK AT THAT VIDEO
A TRAINING WITH A REPLICA OF
THE BORDER CROSSING, THAT WAS
LESS THAN A KILOMETER AWAY FROM
THE BORDER CROSSING.
YOU SEE THE SCALE AND THE SCOPE
OF SOME OF THOSE CAMPS.
IT'S HARD TO FATHOM OR
UNDERSTAND THAT IT WOULD BE
POSSIBLE THAT THE ISRAELIS AND
OTHER SUPPORTERS WOULD NOT BE
AWARE OF IT.
THE ASSUMPTION MAY BE THAT THEY
WERE AWARE OF IT, THAT THEY
PERHAPS DID NOT UNDERSTAND OR
MISINTERPRETED THE INTELLIGENCE,
DIDN'T SEE IT AS A DIRECT
THREAT.
AGAIN, THAT IS SPECULATIVE, WE
DON'T KNOW.
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THERE
WILL BE AT SOME POINT A DEEP

ISRAELIS, AND THE ISRA",20231013
QPjz71xR7SM,Intense bombardment on Gaza City picks up during on-air segment. See the live pictures,data/en_CNN\Intense bombardment on Gaza City picks up during on-air segment. See the live pictures.jpg,"Right now, we are seeing
smoke coming out there.
We're looking at
these live pictures of Gaza City.
We're seeing smoke
coming out of Gaza City at this moment.
What do you believe
could be happening right now
as we are talking about this?
We've seen already
quite a few air strikes
occurring in Israel, throughout Gaza,
but the vast concentration of them
are in Gaza City.
What do you think is happening tonight?
Okay, so that's one thing
you're seeing right now.
That's a result of direct
15 and 35 Israeli Air Force
selective fire
there, special operations, Air Force
commandos, a unit called Shell,
very elite Tier one asset.
It's called the Kingfisher Unit.
And they are on the ground
helping to put those missiles
into specific Hamas buildings
to completely dismantle
Hamas's infrastructure.
So that immobilizes them completely.
That's what the smoke is from
the other thing.
The reason
why this is happening at night,
it allows
clandestine operations
to be conducted within Gaza,
using deception
for operatives to be able to get inside
they're tapping
cell phones,
putting down recording devices.
So Israel is setting an entire pre
raid operation here for two things.
One, for one
that counteroffensive starts
and then to
and the most important thing for us
the able to get those hostages back.
Let's take a listen here.
You can hear those bombs going off
in the background in Gaza City.
We don't always hear
or see
at this time
if you're on the ground right now.
But you can.
Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.
Can you even tell based on listening
to that, the force
the magnitude of what they are?
Yeah.
I mean, look, there's
going to be a lot of destruction.
A lot of people are going to get killed
and hurt.
It's happening on the Israeli side.
The Palestinians will make something
really clear.
Israel has no issue
with the Palestinian people.
In fact, the Palestinian people
ideally would want to be able
to cross the southern border of Gaza
to get into Egypt.
But they can't.
Hamas is keeping them closed in there.
And like a like a whatsername said.
That is a problem
if they're starting to be used
as human shields.
And it creates
immense levels of risk to the Palestinian
And so we do our best to follow
international law.
When we look at the the before
and after of some of these spaces,
it looks like
just an enormous amount of rubble.
Do you see a tactical strategy in the
you know, the flattening
of some of these buildings?
Absolutely. All of that.
Absolutely, yeah.
So the flattening of the structures,
the artillery pieces
that are going in there,
they're starting to open up lanes,
if you will,
for this massive counteroffensive
that's being prepared.
The other thing
that we're doing
is we're tiring out Hamas.
We're treating this as what we call
like a pressure cooker.
And we've got a civil affairs.
And that pressure cooker
is designed to try and slow things down
so that we can collect intelligence
and so that we can tire out
this terror group.
And a tired terrorist
is a better terrorist.
Who's holding
innocent women and children.
So taking our time and doing the best
we can
to collect info, try and slow this thing
down, opening up lanes
for the Givati Brigade,
which is equivalent to the US Marines.
They're the ones who are in charge of the
of the Southern Command,
and they're
the ones who have been
into Gaza previously
in the last war in Gaza.
And so those were they're opening up,
parting ways, if you will,
so that the Israelis
will be able to move in there
as safely as possible
to get to the terrorists and
is it safe to describe
what we are seeing tonight
and hearing tonight
in in the skies over Gaza
as a prelude potentially
to a ground invasion?
Well well,
I can tell you
that a ground invasion is is is imminent
when it's going to happen.
I couldn't tell you.
I'm not I'm
not I'm not going to speculate.
I don't want to give it
any information that might
be inaccurate.
But the fact that 300,000 reservists
have been mobilized,
the fact that the Givati Brigade
is down there,
the fact that the share
that the Israeli SEALs
are already operating on that coast,
you can
bet that they're preparing
for the inevitability
of having to go in there.
And the unfortunate part,
like Anderson said
very gently and eloquently.
It's going to be vicious.
You can hear there.
You can hear the missile fire
you can hear that hitting the rubble.
It's going to be
there's going to be
a lot of violence of action.
There will be a lot of death and trauma
but we believe there could be over
150 hostages in there.
So we're
looking at two multiple assaults.
And, Aaron,
I just want to emphasize for our viewers,
if you've been joining us tonight, leave,
we do not always hear bombardment
at this hour of this strength,
this seems to be
there's intense
fighting that's happening right now.
Those are the
I hear artillery pieces
that are going off.
Again, that's to soften the
and open up the runways for
for those infantry units that
that will eventually go in.
I hear the call to prayer right now also.
And
the other thing we're hearing
is that selective missile fire.
There's potentially
Israelis inside Gaza right now.
These are special operations forces.
They're doing everything
they can to get intelligence
to prepare for the counteroffensive.
And unfortunately, this is the price
that Israelis pay and that Palestinians.
Piers, let's listen for just a moment
As you just said,
this is called to prayer
or
you're listening and watching.
These are images of Gaza City
as the bombs light up the night sky.
There,
we're hearing
what sounds like a call to prayer,
even some sirens in a few moments ago
as the bombs are dropping right now.
This is the population center of Gaza.
About almost 600,000 people live here
and the intensity of the bombardment
seems to have picked up
just in the last couple of minutes.
As we've been
speaking to you
and watching these images.
That sign, according to my guest
here, Aaron Cohen,
that potentially this is picking up.
And as he says, as you've said, Aaron,
perhaps a sign that this
ground invasion
could be imminent,
as is
the Israeli defense
forces are moving more aggressively,
it seems, tonight
to prepare to soften
this ground for the
some 300,000 troops who are amassed
along the border. Get ready to go in.
That's right.
And
Gaza is an incredibly densely
populated area.
Hamas has had years to keep
building it up.
This is one of the most dangerous
places on earth.
I just want to make it really clear,
the Israelis,
as an IDF soldier,
as a veteran of the IDF,
we don't have an issue
with the Palestinians
and we want to do what
we can to get Hamas away from them.
And so we're going to use
as much selectivity.
Is the difference
with the footage that you are showing
is that we're not going to
indiscriminately hurt anybody.
However, lines have been crossed
and decisions have been made.
Leadership will roll.
Intelligence heads will be gone.
We don't we're not focusing on that
right now.
But this is
the most significant hostage
siege in the history of modern warfare.
Let's talk about that for a second.
Again, I mean, the hostages, if
is it necessary for there to be surgical
operation and to try to find and free
those hostages prior to any kind of war,
a large scale ground invasion
of the idea?
Yes, it is.
It is
it is critical to continue to soften
as much of the Hamas infrastructure
within Khan Younis within Rafah
within Gaza City
and all of the small villages in between
in order to reduce risk to those larger
infantry units
they're going to move into Gaza
in order to minimize
getting killed.
Urban warfare is incredibly complex.
This is essentially a symmetrical
or 90 degree angle fighting.
And so bringing down those buildings
means less walls for
terrorists to hide behind.",20231013
D-9-A00vMoc,Israel warns 1.1 million people to leave northern Gaza,data/en_CNN\Israel warns 1.1 million people to leave northern Gaza.jpg,"AND TO BEN WEDEMAN, IN SOUTHERN
LEBANON, THE SCALE OF THIS CALL
FOR EVACUATION BY THE IDF,
ESTIMATED TO BE MORE THAN A
MILLION PEOPLE.
WHAT'S THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THIS
ACTUALLY HAPPENING?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IT'S GOING TO BE
VERY DIFFICULT, FIRST OF ALL,
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE SHEER
NUMBER OF PEOPLE, PERHAPS
1.1 MILLION PEOPLE A SITUATION
WHERE THERE'S VERY LITTLE FUEL,
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE, WHERE ARE
THEY GOING TO GO, WHERE ARE THEY
GOING TO BE HOUSED?
THE U.N. AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS IN GAZA ARE SAYING
IT'S SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE GIVEN
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND THE
CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE'S AN ACTIVE
WAR.
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO JUST MOVE
IN THE STREET, SO MOVING
1.1 MILLION PEOPLE FROM NORTHERN
GAZA TO SOUTHERN PART IS
SOMETHING THAT'S HARD TO IMAGINE
BEING DONE ON PRACTICAL TERMS.
NOW, I'VE BEEN IN GAZA BEFORE,
FOR INSTANCE, IN 2014 THE
ISRAELIS ORDERED THE EVACUATION
OF CIVILIANS FROM NORTHERN
COMMUNITIES, ONES NEAR THE
ISRAELI BORDER.
FOR THE MOST PART PEOPLE WERE
ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU
COULD GET OUT BY WALKING, YOU
COULD GET OUT BY RIDING ON A
DONKEY CART, PERHAPS, IF YOU
COULD GET A CAR RIDE OUT.
BUT THAT WAS RELATIVELY SMALL
NUMBERS COMPARED TO GAZA CITY.
GAZA CITY IS HUGE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO PUT ALL
THESE PEOPLE WHEN YOU MOVE THEM
SOUTH WHEN NONE OF THE RELIEF
SUPPLIES, TENTS, FOOD, WATER,
MEDICINE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED INTO
THE GAZA STRIP.
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE
HOW THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE DONE.
AND HAMAS IS CALLING ON PEOPLE
TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES, TO STAY
PUT.
SO, THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY
DIFFICULT, AND CERTAINLY IF
PEOPLE DO NOT OR CANNOT EVACUATE
THOSE AREAS, THE ISRAELIS ARE
CALLING THEM TO LEAVE, AND THIS
GROUND OFFENSIVE GOES AHEAD,
PROBABILITY IS, IT WILL BE A
BLOOD BATH.
&gt;&gt; BEN WEDEMAN JOINING US IN
SOUTHERN LEBANON, BEN, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
AND JOINING US NOW TO GET MORE
OF THESE QUESTIONS ANSWERED, I
DO, F SPOKESMAN LIEUTENANT
COLONEL PETER LEARNER, COLONEL,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AGAIN
THIS MORNING AS ALWAYS.
I WANT TO ASK YOU FOR
CONFIRMATION ON WHAT HAMAS IS
CLAIMING, THAT 13 ISRAELI
PRISONERS TAKEN HOSTAGE DURING
THE WEEKEND'S ATTACK, THEY ARE
CLAIMING THEY HAVE BEEN KILLED
IN GAZA BY ISRAELI BOMBINGS.
HAS THE IDF CONFIRMED THOSE
DEATHS?
?
I CAN'T CONFIRM THOSE, AND WE
HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS WITH
EVERYTHING HAMAS IS SAYING.
AND THEIR PROPAGANDA EFFORTS ARE
EXTENSIVE.
THIS MORNING WE ARE CONTINUING
OUR ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE HAMAS
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, AND
THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT
THE GAZA STRIP, SPECIFICALLY WE
ARE TARGETING SPECIAL OPERATIONS
CAPABILITIES, WE'VE TAKEN UP
THEIR DRONE CAPABILITIES.
THEY HAD ATTACK DRONES THAT WERE
POSEN AND PREPARED TO BE
LAUNCHED AT ISRAEL BUT WE'VE
TAKEN SOME OF THOSE OUT AND
WE'RE CONTINUING OUR EFFORT TO
MAKE SURE HAMAS CAN NEVER, EVER
THREATEN ISRAEL AGAIN AND THEY
CANNOT BE PERMITTED TO DO SO.
&gt;&gt; YOU DO NOT HAVE CONFIRMATION
OF WHAT HAMAS IS CLAIMING THERE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY UPDATE ON THE
CONDITION OF ALL OF THE
HOSTAGES, ANY OF THEM THAT ARE
BEING HELD?
&gt;&gt; WELL, TO MY KNOWLEDGE THEY'VE
NOT RELEASED ANY INFORMATION
EXCEPT FOR DISINFORMATION, AND
WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT VERY
CAUTIOUSLY.
THE SITUATION IS AS SUCH, WE
BELIEVE THAT HAMAS ARE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
WELL-BEING OF ALL OF THE
HOSTAGES THAT THEY'VE TAKEN, AND
THEY NEED TO RETURN THEM
IMMEDIATELY, THEY NEED TO
RELEASE THEM TO ISRAEL.
AND THEY WILL PAY THE
CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR ACTIONS.
THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND,
OBVIOUSLY, IS A COMPLICATED ONE,
AND WE'RE TAKING OPERATING IN
CAUTION WITH REGARD TO THE
HOSTAGE SITUATION AND OF COURSE
IT IS INFLUENCING OUR
OPERATIONAL GAME PLAN.
&gt;&gt; HOW IS IT INFLUENCING IT?
IS IT CAUSING THE IDF NOT TO
TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS AT THIS
MOMENT, THAT IT WOULD OTHERWISE
TAKE?
&gt;&gt; I OBVIOUSLY WON'T ELABORATE
ON OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS,
BUT DEFINITELY IT IS PART OF THE
PLANNING PROCESS, AND WE DO NEED
TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION.
&gt;&gt; OKAY.
&gt;&gt; OUR PRIORITY IS TO RETURN
THEM HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
&gt;&gt; THE ORDER FROM RECOMMENDATION
FROM ISRAEL FOR ABOUT
1.1 MILLION PEOPLE ACCORDING TO
THE U.N. TO MOVE OUT OF NORTHERN
GAZA, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
REPORTS OF A TIME FRAME PUT ON
THAT.
IS THERE A TIME FRAME THAT THE
IDF HAS PUT ON THAT?
&gt;&gt; SO, THE ORDERS IS TO EVACUATE
IMMEDIATELY, AND I WOULD HIGHLY
RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE ADHERE TO
THAT INSTRUCTION BECAUSE THE
MILITARY IS DETERMINED TO TAKE
OUT HAMAS'S CAPABILITIES, THEY
OPERATE FROM A STRONGHOLD WITHIN
GAZA AND GAZA CITY AND THEY CAN
NO LONGER BE UTILIZE THAT AREA.
IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE AND
MITIGATE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES,
THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN ASKING
US OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS,
WHAT ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN
CORRIDOR, THIS IS PART OF THE
HUMANITARIAN EFFORT SO THAT
PEOPLE WILL NOT BE INFLUENCED
MORE THAN THEY HAVE TO BE IN
THIS CONFLICT.
HAMAS, UNFORTUNATELY IS CALLING
ON THE OTHER HAND, NO, PEOPLE,
DO NOT EVACUATE, STAY AND
SACRIFICE YOURSELF.
HAMAS HAS NO REGARD FOR HUMAN
LIFE, ISRAELI OR PALESTINIAN.
THEY WILL SACRIFICE EVERYBODY AS
THEY ARE PROVING TIME AND TIME
AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS, IS THERE A
SAFE WINDOW FOR ALL OF THOSE
PEOPLE, A MILLION PLUS PEOPLE TO
EVACUATE TO THE SOUTH?
THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS IT IS,
QUOTE, IMPOSSIBLE FOR SUCH A
MOVEMENT TO TAKE PLACE WITHOUT
DEVASTATING HUMANITARIAN
CONSEQUENCES, AS THESE AIR
STRIKES CONTINUE.
&gt;&gt; HERE'S WHAT WE DO.
WHEN WE SAW A THREAT ON THE
BORDER WITH GAZA WE EVACUATED
THE PEOPLE FROM THE BORDER FROM
GAZA.
WHAT IS HAMAS DOING?
THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.
S
SACRIFICING THEM, STAY PUT.
THE IDF IS COMING.
WE ARE OPERATING EXTENSIVELY.
WHEN THEY PLACE THEIR OFFENSIVE
DRONES, STRIKE DRONES, SUICIDE
DRONES ON THE ROOFS OF HOUSES,
THEY ARE JEOPARDIZING EVERYBODY
IN THAT HOUSE, THEY DON'T CARE.
SO WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE,
EVACUATE THIS AREA, BECAUSE WE
ARE OPERATING, WE PLAN ON
BROADENING THE SCOPE OF OUR
OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE
OUR GOAL.
&gt;&gt; COLONEL, I'M GOING TO MOVE
ON, IS THERE A WINDOW OF SAFETY.
THE U.N. HAS SAID 24 HOURS, FOR
EXAMPLE, IS THERE A WINDOW OF
SAFETY WHEN THIS EVACUATION --
&gt;&gt; I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT
THE EVACUATION TAKES PLACE
IMMEDIATELY.
THE WINDOW OF -- THE 24 HOURS
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE
HIGHLY RECOMMENDATION, BUT IT
COULD GO ON BEYOND THAT BUT I
WOULD SAY THE INSTRUCTION IS GET
UP, AND GET OUT OF THE NORTH OF
GAZA AND GAZA CITY AND MOVE TO
THE SOUTH.
&gt;&gt; AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, THOUGH,
MOVE TO THE SOUTH, BUT THERE IS
STILL NO CROSSING OUT OF GAZA
FOR THEM?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE'RE DIRECTING THEM
EXACTLY WHERE WE EXPECT THEM NOT
TO BE WHERE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO
SAFEGUARD THEIR OWN LIVES SHOULD
MOVE FROM.
NOT TO GO INTO EGYPT OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT, BUT THEY SHOULD NOT
BE IN THE AREA WHICH WE
DESIGNATED AND HAVE TOLD THEM
SPECIFICALLY.
THIS IS LIKE A FOREWARNING OF
WHERE WE'RE OPERATING,
FOREWARNING OF WHERE IT'S GOING
TO BE MORE EXTENSIVE COMBAT,
WHERE THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE
EXTENSIVE STRIKES, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS THE WHOLE IDEA OF TRYING
TO MAKE SAFEGUARD PEOPLE'S
LIVES.
THE INSTRUCTION TO LEAVE IS TO
SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES SO THEY
SHOULD LEAVE FROM THE NORTH OF
GAZA, FROM GAZA CITY AND GO TO
THE SOUTH OF THE CITY, OF THE
GAZA WADI, AND THEY SHOULD --
THEY SHOULD SET UP THERE.
IF THEY STAY, THEY ARE
JEOPARDIZING THEMSELVES, THIS IS
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE
CONSIDERATIONS, THERE ARE
PROBLEMS, OF COURSE, I WOULD SAY
HAMAS NEED TO DEAL WITH ALL OF
THOSE PROBLEMS, OF HOW TO SHIP
PEOPLE FROM THE NORTH TO THE
SOUTH, LIKE WE DID, WE TOOK
PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOUSES IN THE
SOUTH OF ISRAEL AND WE MOVED
THEM ELSEWHERE.
AND HAMAS SHOULD HAVE THE
RESPONSIBILITY, RATHER THAN
FAILING THE PEOPLE OF GAZA, THEY
SHOULD HELP THE PEOPLE OF GAZA.
&gt;&gt; COLONEL, I THINK THE QUESTION
BECOMES, FOR HOW LONG CAN THEY
REMAIN IN THE SOUTH?
WILL AN ORDER LIKE ISRAEL HAS
GIVEN IN THE NORTH THEN COME TO
THEM IN THE SOUTH?
IF THERE IS NO CROSSING THAT
OPENS.
&gt;&gt; OUR OPERATION IS FOCUSED
TOWARDS HAMAS, NOT TO THE PEOPLE
OF GAZA, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF
GAZA ARE NOT OUR ENEMY, THE
HAMAS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION HAS
BUTCHERED OVER A THOUSAND, 200
PEOPLE, AND ISRAEL CANNOT BE
PERMITTED TO GOVERN THE GAZA
STRIP AND USE IT AS A STAGING
GROUND AGAINST ISRAEL.
WHEN WE RECOMMEND TO THE PEOPLE
OF GAZA GO TO THE SOUTH, YOU
SHOULD LISTEN, GO TO THE SOUTH,
DO NOT STAY IN GAZA CITY, DO NOT
STAY IN THE NORTH, AND YES,
EVERYBODY SHOULD LISTEN TO THAT
RECOMMENDATION.",20231013
A2S4Vi4F348,Retired IDF general criticizes Israeli military: We failed to defend civilians,data/en_CNN\Retired IDF general criticizes Israeli military We failed to defend civilians.jpg,"The tension at the
border of
Israel and Gaza is palpable tonight.
And here
where Nic Robertson is,
you can even hear the thuds
of the explosions in Gaza
from here in Tel Aviv.
It comes as
we are learning tonight
about the incredible bravery
of a retired Israeli general
who headed straight into a hall
Oh's kibbutz,
which is just a few miles from Gaza
as it was under attack
on Saturday morning and along the way.
General Ziv,
armed only
with a pistol, encountered
Israeli soldiers
who were outmanned and outgunned.
And I spoke with him.
He was deeply emotional,
as he told me about the horrors
he witnessed
General,
that morning Saturday morning,
you.
Was this the gun?
What what kind did you have?
This is new This is new.
The gun that they had
was was a little bit more simple.
It's this one
that was your pistol.
So you were about to go
for a bike ride, collect,
take your pistol with you?
No, I live next to Kfar Saba.
Yeah,
it's like an hour and a half from here.
And it was biking my bike at 6:00, like,
every Saturday.
And we had that left, and
I thought it,
you know, might be some rocket
or something simple that we already know.
Yes.
And then I had the call
that something very serious
and very heavy is happening.
So I took that.
The only four
that are waiting
for such occasion in the cabinet
and took my college and run to Gaza
to to engage to two to me, the forces
So then what did you do
We had
very few forces, very few units.
So I engage with the units
and we went to a place to a place
to see what's going on
along the way with a lot of engagements.
The, well, huge amount with Hamas.
Yes, a lot of close contact engagements.
So I was with the soldiers.
I was shooting with that
when a soldier was was injured
next to me.
I took his gun and shot and we progress
from place to place all day long
until late night.
And then later on that evening
or Saturday night, more units came in.
So I had to engage them
into the situation
and have them to
to manage with the battle
in some of the kibbutzim.
In general, what did you see?
What did you see them doing
in this kibbutz?
You know, it's, it's it's terrible.
In my whole military career,
I haven't seen such a lot of fighting
and terrible things,
you know, off of killing.
I saw women
holding their children
and being shot by holding them.
People were hiding,
you know, on the furnitures
and got murdered.
I saw a few people that
the head was Trump
children
so it
was terrible, terrible,
terrible, terrible.
And we say we feel I feel a shame.
We fail to to protect them.
They they live here
that were the first line
of all Israel or Passover, anything.
And we fail we fail to to to defend them.
It's it's it's a personal humiliation
and national humiliation.
Humiliation at the same time.
So it is hard for anyone to hear
what you're saying,
to imagine that you saw you had to
to see a mother within the child.
Sorry, people.
I mean,
can you even unsee such things?
Could you even comprehend,
as you saw it happen, that it was
that it was a human
being doing these things
to another human being,
and nothing of that is human.
It's it's animals.
It's only animals can do such a thing.
I've never seen such a thing.
This is this is really
low as only animal can do.
It's only animal can do.
I there's nothing human
that you can see in the act.
You know, it's it's
burning, burning, burning, people.
I went that afternoon and later to
to the party, to the festival
hundreds of people and kids,
you know, 16, 17, 18,
Masako are dead.
And you saw because I know
and when you kill somebody
from close contact
and some of them try to escape
so they're waiting for them
to get to the car
and they start to shoot.
And then when they are in the car
they are trapped.
And you saw, you know,
just just
overwhelmed by
the amount of bullets.
And later on they try to burn the car
with the with the, with the bodies
animals, real animals.
And we cannot have them as a neighbor.
I mean,
the, you know,
if they act as there is a jungle law,
we have to act also with it
because we are in the same jungle.
And we cannot have the jungle in our own,
you know, own homes.
How many Hamas fighters did you see?
Who was how many did you see?
Myself in my own I.
Dozens of them.
Yeah, but but I think they were
much above 1500 Hamas.
I mean, I didn't know that by then.
But what we have learned later
is that that there were
at least 1500 people or more.
Some of them, you know, more
commando type.
The first line of of toll, these
some of them a second assailant
and even civilians,
they call civilians to take gun
to come over to the kibbutzim.
And, you know, and been and rape
and do whatever they want.
And and we killed many,
many of those, by the way.
All of them came with the weapon.
General, thank you very much.
Thank you
very much
for full asking and being here with us.
Thank you very much.
General.
Safe did not hold back
on criticizing his own government
and his own military.
He called what happened Saturday
a complete failure
It's a total collapse.
I'm not going to say any excuses.
It's a total collapse.
It's a systematic collapse.
It's it's the intelligence.
It's the whole defense system.
The defense system has a lot of elements.
You know,
it's it's it's defense is the technology.
It's the deployment of the army.
It's the back up, so many things.
It all collapsed so so we cannot,
you know, saying that
any excuses is not is not acceptable.
We have to inquire that.
We have to investigate
what did we have to learn?
A very serious lessons,
by the way, in none of the scenarios,
we had an ideal the Hamas form for me
Still, the organization
will act as an army.
What we think
today is that that Iran is behind it.
They're plain is a copy paste
of the Fevola.
They have a similar playing in
in the in the north
in all over the Sydney.
Exactly the same thing
that we have seen here but then again
we should have guess or learn or take
under a serious assumption
that such thing could have happened
and within the security lapse
prior to Hamas's
assault over
the weekend
has many wondering
what will be done
to make sure it never happens again.
Joining us now is former Israeli
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.
Sir, we appreciate your time
this morning.
We want to look forward
and kind of what to expect,
what you're seeing.
But to start there,
I think it's been striking
when you listen to Israeli
officials, IDF officials,
as they try and figure out what happened,
including this from a retired general
to our colleague last night.
Take a listen.
We say
we feel I
feel a shame we fail to to protect them.
They they live here
that are the first line
of full Israel of our sovereignty.
And we fail we fail to to to defend them.
It's a personal humiliation
and national humiliation,
humiliation at the same time.
And, sir,
I think what stuck out to me,
you had an interview with Channel 11 News
where you're talking about
how the international community views
Israel right now, said,
I don't want their pity.
I want them to fear us.
I want them to understand our strength.
Are you concerned that kind of the the
how Israel is perceived
has been punctured
over the course of the last six days?
Oh, absolutely.
And whoever that general is is correct
there.
There's no doubt
the first and foremost duty
sovereign state
is to protect its citizens
and it's actually 1500
Israeli citizens were slaughtered
by Nazi monsters
and go were enough to fix all of this off
of our military history
teaches us that time and again,
there's a limit to
our mistakes like
brutal barber like Barbaro
sound like nine elevenths
like the Yom Kippur War
were enough to fix it.
But now our view is forward
into the next stage
from collecting ourselves
and taking out and killing
all the
terrorists that entered Israel
to the next stage. The offensive stage.",20231013

BREAKING SITUATION.
THAT IS THE SMOKE, FROM WHAT
WE'RE TOLD, IS ARTILLERY FIRE
FROM NORTHERN ISRAEL.
YOU CAN HEAR SOME OF THE BLASTS
THERE, INTO SOUTHERN LEBANON.
THOSE ARE THE PICTURES NOW, LET
ME SHOW YOU ON THE MAP WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS THE BORDER BETWEEN
ISRAEL AND LEBANON.
LET'S GO TO SOUTHERN LEBANON.
ARE BEING WEDEMAN IS STANDING
BY THEIR.
BEN, GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT
YOU'RE SEEING AND HEARING.
.
&gt;&gt; JOHN, IN THE LAST FEW
MINUTES, WE HEARD SEVERAL LARGE
EXPLOSIONS IN THE MID DISTANCE.
RIGHT BEHIND ME, WHAT YOU'RE
SEEING IS THE MOUNTAIN.
ON ONE HALF OF IT IS LEBANON,
THE OTHERS ISRAEL.
AND RIGHT BEHIND ME IS THE
ISRAELI COMMUNITY OF MEDULLA.
THIS IS A TOWN THAT HAS BEEN
UNDER --
ITS A CLOSED MILITARY AREA FOR
THE LAST FEW HOURS.
BUT IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES, WE
HEARD SEVERAL LARGE EXPLOSIONS
IN THE DISTANCE.
IN ADDITION TO WHAT IS GOING ON
TO THE WEST OF HERE, NEAR THE
MEDITERRANEAN, ALONG THE BORDER
WHERE WE UNDERSTAND, ACCORDING
TO THE LEBANESE NEWS, THE
OFFICIAL LEBANESE NEWS AGENCY,
SEVERAL ROCKETS WERE FIRED IN
THE DIRECTION OF ISRAEL.
THEY WERE INTERCEPTED BY THE
IRON DOME SYSTEM.
THE ISRAELIS LEADER APPARENTLY
TARGETED, ACCORDING TO THE
LEBANESE NEWS AGENCY, AN ARMY
OBSERVATION POINT.
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE
ARE ONGOING EXCHANGES IN THAT
AREA AS WELL.
NOW, THIS IS SORT OF A CHANGE
FROM THE PACE DURING THE REST
OF THE DAY.
EARLIER IN THE DAY, IT WAS
RELATIVELY QUIET.
IN FACT, THE ASSUMPTION WAS
THAT PERHAPS THE WORST HAVE
PASSED.
HERE, I JUST HEARD ANOTHER
EXPLOSION.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD THAT
AS WELL.
AND ANOTHER ONE.
SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT THINGS
ARE PICKING UP.
I CAN HEAR THE IMPACT OF THAT
ONE IN THIS DIRECTION.
THERE ARE LEBANESE SOLDIERS
HERE, OBSERVING WHAT IS GOING
ON.
OKAY, I'M JUST GOING TO STEP
OUT OF THE WAY.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP OF THAT
HILL, THERE'S A PLUME OF SMOKE.
I BELIEVE, BUT I'M NOT CERTAIN,
THAT THAT SIDE OF THE HILL IS
LEBANON.
BUT I CAN'T SAY WITH ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY.
SO YES, THIS JUST BEGAN A FEW
MINUTES AGO.
WE DON'T KNOW THE REASON, THE
CAUSE, BUT CERTAINLY THE
TENSIONS HERE ARE EXTREMELY
HIGH.
HEZBOLLAH, THE MAIN SORT OF
MILITARY FORCE IN THIS AREA, IN
ADDITION TO THE LEBANESE ARMY,
HAS BY AND LARGE BEEN
RELATIVELY RESTRAINED DURING
THE OUTBREAK OF FIGHTING IN
GAZA.
YEAH, I CAN HEAR ANOTHER
IMPACT.
SO YOU CAN SEE THE SMOKE ON THE
TOP OF THE HILL.
IT APPEARS MULTIPLE IMPACTS UP
THERE.
WHAT I THINK I'M HEARING IS
OUTGOING FIRE, AND MOMENTS
LATER YOU HEAR THE IMPACT.
THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.
JOHN?
&gt;&gt; WE HEAR THE THUDS.
WE HEAR THE THUDS, BEN, AND IF
YOU CAN EXPLAIN, AND YOU KNOW
THIS REGION SO.
WELL WE'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON
GAZA, TO THE SOUTH.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE MAP OF
A SERIAL.
YOU ARE OF COURSE ON THE
NORTHERN BORDER BETWEEN ISRAEL
AND LEBANON.
THE CONCERN THERE IS THAT YOU
SAW FLUSH ON THAT HILL.
I DID, A MOMENT AGO.
&gt;&gt; STEP OUT OF THE WAY.
&gt;&gt; THE CONCERN FOR ISRAEL IN
TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS IN
LEBANON ISN'T SO MUCH THE
LEBANESE GOVERNMENT, BUT IT IS
HEZBOLLAH.
WHY ARE THEY SO CONCERNED ABOUT
WHAT HEZBOLLAH MIGHT DO, AND
WHAT KIND OF LINES HAS
HEZBOLLAH PUBLICLY DRAWN?
IT SAYS, THIS IS ONE WILL GET
INVOLVED IN THIS.
&gt;&gt; DON, THE ISRAELIS ARE
CONCERNED BY THE FACT THAT HAS
BELOW, NOT JUST --
GET MY FLAK JACKET ON WHAT I'M
TALKING TO YOU.
THE ISRAELIS ARE CONCERNED THAT
IF HEZBOLLAH BECOMES INVOLVED,
IT IS A FORMIDABLE MILITARY
ORGANIZATION.
MADE SO WITH THE HELP OF IRAN.
AND WE SAW EVEN BACK IN 2006
THAT HAS BLOW WAS ESSENTIALLY
ABLE TO FIGHT THE ISRAELIS TO A
STANDSTILL.
SINCE THEN, THEIR CAPABILITIES
HAVE ONLY IMPROVED.
THEIR WEAPONRY HAS ONLY
IMPROVED, THEY HAVE A BREADTH
OF EXPERIENCE AND IN HOUSE TO
HOUSE AND STREET TO STREET
WARFARE FROM SYRIA.
SO IF THEY BECOME INVOLVED,
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT
SITUATION THAN WHAT YOU HAVE IN
GAZA.
FAR GREATER.
I SEE ANOTHER IMPACT UP THERE.
NOW, HAS BLOT HAS SORT OF SAID
THAT IF ISRAEL ATTACKS LEBANON,
IT WILL BECOME FULLY INVOLVED.
THE HEAD OF HEZBOLLAH HAS MADE
IT CLEAR THAT HEZBOLLAH WILL
DECIDE A TIME AND PLACE WHERE
IT WILL ENGAGE WITH ISRAEL, AND
THAT HEZBOLLAH WILL NOT BE
DRAWN INTO A WAR, NOT OF ITS
CHOOSING.
AND BASICALLY, IT DOES APPEAR
THAT AT LEAST UNTIL NOW HAS
BLOWOUT HAS BEEN HESITANT TO
BECOME INVOLVED IN THIS WAR.
NOW, THIS COULD BE SIMPLY A
PASSING INCIDENT, NOT
NECESSARILY THE BEGINNING OF
SOMETHING.
BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES REPRESENT
SOMETHING OF A DETERIORATION.
JOHN?
&gt;&gt; AN EXCHANGE OF FIRE, TO BE
SURE THERE.
WE CAN SEE THE SMOKE RISING
ABOVE THE HILL BEHIND YOU.
YOU'RE BACK IN FRAME, THE SMOKE
RISING ABOVE THE HILL.
WE DID SEE A SMALL FLASH THEIR.
TO BE CLEAR, THAT SMOKE RISING
BEHIND YOU IS LEBANON.
THOSE ARE THE IMPACT ZONES AT
THIS POINT, WHERE THINGS ARE
LANDING.
THAT IS INSIDE LEBANON, YOU
BELIEVE?
&gt;&gt; I DO BELIEVE SO, YES.
I SORT OF HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO CHECK MY COORDINATES EXACTLY,
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IS
LEBANON.
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, WE DO APPRECIATE
YOU BEING THERE, BEING WITNESS
TO THIS.
BE SAFE, AND PLEASED TO KEEP US
POSTED.
BECAUSE THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE
SO CRUCIAL TO SEE, IF IT DOES
ESCALATE EVEN MORE.
ALL RIGHT, BEN WEDEMAN, UP HERE
ON THE BORDER BETWEEN ISRAEL
AND LEBANON.
WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN HERE NOW
TO GAZA.
I CAN SHOW YOU THE SITUATION
THERE.
OR ERIN BURNETT IS IN SOUTHERN
ISRAEL, NOT FAR.
THIS IS THE BORDER, THIS IS
GAZA RIGHT HERE.
THIS IS EGYPT RIGHT HERE, SHE'S
NOT FAR FROM GAZA, SHE'S NOT
FAR FROM EGYPT.
AND THIS REGION RIGHT HERE,
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING NOW?
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE JUST
OVER --
FROM A MAJOR STAGING AREA FOR
AN ISRAELI TANK BATTALION,
JOHN.
AND BASICALLY THIS PARTICULAR
TANK BATTALION, THEY WERE IN ON
SATURDAY AMONG THE ATTACKS, THE
FIRST TO GO IN SATURDAY
AFTERNOON, AND THEY'RE NOW
STAGING, RESUPPLYING, AND THEY
SAY THEY'RE READY.
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING.
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SPENDING
TIME GOING UP AND DOWN THIS
GAZA BORDER.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE ABOUT THREE
MILES AWAY FROM THE GAZA BORDER
ITSELF, AND AS YOU HAVE BEEN
SAYING, WE ARE ABOUT TEN OR SO
MILES FROM THE EGYPTIAN BORDER.
SO RIGHT HERE, ALONG THE SOUTH,
THERE'S BEEN MASSIVE STAGING OF
ISRAELI FORCES.
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT GOING BY,
THOSE ARE ALL MILITARY
VEHICLES.
I WILL SAY, THEY'RE ALSO BUSING
IN TROOPS ON BUSES.
LITERALLY COACHES.
SO IF YOU SEE 50 OR SO OF THOSE
WITHIN THE PAST PIT, WE'VE SEEN
250 TROOPS COMING IN.
IT'S A CONSTANT FLOW IN.
AND WE'RE GOING TO THINK THAT
THEY'VE BEEN SAYING THAT THEY
HAVE 350,000 TROOPS ALREADY AT
THE BORDER WHERE WE ARE.
THEY'VE JUST BEEN ADDING IN
CONSTANTLY THROUGH TODAY.
CONSTANTLY THROUGH THE DAY, AND
WE HAVE SEEN A HIGHER STATE OF
READINESS.
NOT JUST AT THE TANK BATTALION,
BUT ALSO WITH THE TROOPS COMING
IN, WEARING THEIR HELMETS,
WEARING THEIR PROTECTIVE
EQUIPMENT.
THEY ARE READY, AND THERE IS A
STATE OF READINESS.
OBVIOUSLY, WHAT THAT MEANS, WE
CAN'T TELL YOU IN TERMS OF HOW
IMMINENT ANY ACTION MIGHT BE.
BUT WE HAVE SEEN THAT SHIP
BETWEEN TODAY AND THE LAST FEW
DAYS.
WE'RE CONTINUING TO HEAR THE
ARTILLERY FIRE AND THOSE
THOUGHTS AND EXPLOSIONS.
IN THIS CASE, IN GAZA, SIMILAR
TO WHAT OF COURSE BEEN WAS JUST
SHOWING YOU LIVE, AS THAT
ARTILLERY WAS COMING INTO

3PntaOSdyto,"Israeli troops have carried out local raids in Gaza, IDF says","data/en_CNN\Israeli troops have carried out local raids in Gaza, IDF says.jpg","I want to go back to Israel.
CNN's Nic Robertson is live there.
Nic, what are you learning
Well,
we've just learned
from the Israeli Defense Force
that they have put
some troops across the border into Gaza
in the past 24 hours.
They call it a.
A local.
Looking for the language here.
Exactly. A local raid.
And so a limited incursion.
A local raid is a language
they use
to describe the troops
that they've sent across into Gaza.
It's not clear
how many they've sent across.
It's not clear yet
what their mission was.
It's not clear yet
if that mission was successful.
It's not clear yet
if they had any casualties.
But this is the first time
since the weekend,
since this big buildup of forces
that we've heard
from the IDF, that they have in fact,
sent troops inside the Gaza Strip.
This, they say, was over the past
24 hours.
The indication seems to be
that this was limited.
And the indication seems to be
that it is over
now that those troops are out.
And that would perhaps
be within the sort of expected operation
or parameters
for something like this, that
the IDF would not announce
something like this while they had forces
over the border inside of Gaza itself.
It really is interesting
that they did make this public.
And you said very clearly
that we don't know what the mission is
right now.
I mean, you would think it might be
twofold. One is to try to get hostages.
Another is
that they located
some of the of the terrorists
or some of the
higher ranking
officials in Hamas they are looking for.
But
what does it tell you
that we know this information right now
There's a
there's another thing to add
to that mix of what it might be as well.
It might be going into recover bodies.
It might be going in to recover soldiers
who are who who died over the weekend
and have been
on the other side of the fence
It could be as simple as that.
But what it speaks to what it speaks to
is that Israel is more
and more on a footing
where it can go into this
very dangerous area for troops
and be ready to protect itself
and carry out
a mission that it's indicative
that there will be more missions
like this to come.
I think until we get the details of
precisely what it was,
if it was more than just,
let's say, a body recovery,
then then then that that will tell us
that there
that they're really on a forward
footing at the moment.
Thank you so much for that, Nic.
I want to bring back
Colonel Cedric Leighton,
who will hopefully continue
to give us a bit
bit of perspective
on what Nic just reported.
What are your thoughts?
So, Dana, the
the key indicator here is that
this was a series of small raids
and every single
one of the options you talked about
a, you know,
possibly a hostage recovery mission,
possibly
the business about going after
the senior leadership of Hamas
and or the recovery of
the remains of dead Israeli soldiers.
All of those are possibilities.
I am thinking it's either number one
or two at this point.
In essence,
what they're looking for is
it would be a perfect thing
for Israeli intelligence to recover its
lost luster in the wake of the debacle.
On the strategic front,
if they have a good tactical
intelligence success
where their special operations
forces come in
and they actually have
a successful mission, of course.
We don't know yet
whether or not the mission
has been successful.
We have no idea,
you know, what the actual targets were.
But it seems
as if this is the kind of mission
where special operations
forces would go in
and have very final find its targets,
finite targets that would go in,
and they would be able to take
actions on them
and meet limited objectives in that way.
Colonel,
I'm just being told in my ear
that the IDF says that they were,
in fact,
searching for hostages
as part of this raid.
We do not know if that was successful.
Again, what does that tell you
as a former intelligence officer?
So the likelihood is very high
that we might be disappointed
with the outcome of this, Dana,
because of the way
in which Hamas operates.
But we could see hopefully some success.
But I don't want to give anybody
any false hope at this point in time.
It's very early in this, the IDF.
If things are successful
at some point,
the IDF is clearly going to announce
that they have rescued hostages.
And of course, that would be
a big political
as well as military victory
for the Israelis.
And it would also clear the way
for further incursions
from an operational standpoint
on the military side,
further incursions
of a more conventional nature
if they choose to do them into Gaza
so that, you know,
we're kind of in this environment now.
So if this was a hostage
rescue mission
or trying to find out
where the hostages are
that would be a classic
special operations mission
and it would be something
that would have a high payoff
for the Israeli political
and military leadership.
More on that breaking news into CNN.
The Israeli Defense Forces
say they have carried out
some raids in the Gaza Strip.
They say that they are
searching for hostages.
I want to bring in Matthew Chance,
who is across this story
following the developments
reporting today from Tel Aviv.
Matthew, what do we know
Well, I mean, look,
I mean, we're all bracing, of course,
for the I'm coming back in my ear here.
We're all bracing
for the possibility of a large scale
Israeli invasion
by land into the Gaza Strip.
But, of course,
we have to remember
that complicating that military operation
is the fact that there are between 100
and 150
Israeli hostages
that have been hidden by Hamas militants
after they were seized inside Israel,
all across that territory.
And I think what we're seeing now,
according to the IDF,
small, limited incursions
into the Gaza Strip
with the express purpose of,
you know,
first of all, trying
to neutralize
terrorist locations
is the first thing to say,
but also to try and locate
the whereabouts
of some of those hostages In fact,
the newly appointed hostage affairs
coordinator here in Israel
gave me a statement earlier
saying that they were doing
everything they could on every level
to try and,
you know,
search every area of ground
to try and find
where these people are,
where people are located.
And I think this is this is a part of it.
But to be clear, it is not
we don't think the beginning of the large
scale land invasion
that that everybody's braced for
But again, to reiterate,
when that happens,
the presence of those
captives in the Gaza Strip is something
that the military planners
are going to have to take
into account already.
Hamas
militants say
that as a result of the ferocious
air strikes
that have been pounding areas
of the Gaza Strip
for the past several days,
at least 13 of the hostages they took
have been killed.
That's not been corroborated
by the Israelis
or by the United States,
but it does underline
what a precarious situation
the military planners are
and we all are currently
involved in, Becky.
Yeah, and diplomatic sources
had told me
earlier in the week, can confirm
now by the prime minister of Qatar
speaking alongside
the US secretary of state today,
saying that
there are efforts
that they are mediating between Israel
and Hamas to try and effort
the release of those hostages
earlier on in the week.
We were told that
the efforts were around
an exchange of hostages,
women and children,
Israeli women and children in Gaza
for women and youth in prisons.
In Israel.
So we know that that is ongoing.
We also know that the Secretary of State,
Antony Blinken, who's been in Jordan
and is now in the Gulf, doing the rounds,
trying to ensure
that there is some sort
of humanitarian corridor set up for
and some sort of safe zones set up
for these gardens.
Gazans,
we just spoke to the
Jordanian foreign minister
who said,
you know,
the Gazans need
to stay within the country
as far as Jordan is concerned,
within the enclave,
as far as Jordan is concerned.
They don't want to see the spillage
of Gazans outside of the enclave.
But clearly,
you know,
as they are told by the IDF to move
from northern Gaza, one assumes,
you know,
because there is this imminent air
assault by ground and air
forthcoming, the IDF trying to ensure
that Gazans are evacuated out of the way.
Hamas, of course,
telling Gazans to stay in place.
There is an awful lot going on.
The secretary of state
not only looking
at the humanitarian corridors
and the hostage issue, also speaking
to the Israelis
and the region about how to de-escalate
what is going on, both in the short
term, in the hours to come
and trying to ensure
that this conflict,
what is going on here now
in Israel and in Gaza, that does
not spill outside of these borders.",20231013
ViGf_NojEWg,US intelligence warned of potential for Gaza clash in days before attack,data/en_CNN\US intelligence warned of potential for Gaza clash in days before attack.jpg,"I want to bring in CNN's Katie Bo Lillis.
She's got new reporting that U.S.
intelligence did have some warnings
about a prospect
of more violence here from Hamas.
Just days before Saturday's
surprise attack came out.
What did these reports say?
How specific were they?
Yeah, so, Anderson, what we have learned
is that the intelligence community
was circulating
a pair
of two separate intelligence assessments
just in the days leading into October
seven, a devastating attack.
One of them on September 28th
warned based on
multiple streams of intelligence
that Hamas was poised to escalate
with some cross-border
rocket fire into Israel.
A separate October 5th wire from the CIA
warned sort of generally
of the of increasing possibility
by the increasing
possibility of violence by Hamas.
But, Anderson,
I think
what's really important
to understand here
is that
none of these two
none of neither of these two reports
provided any sort of specific
tactical detail
about the size, scope, scale
brutality of the attack
that actually did occur on October seven.
So they were these sort of
kind of high level
warnings that, you know, look,
that the tensions in between
sort of Palestinian militant groups
and and Israel are growing.
There's an increased possibility
for violence,
but they weren't offering
any sort of specific evidence
of the planning
for the attack that actually unfolded
on Saturday.
Do we know
if those reports were passed
on to Israeli intelligence
or I mean,
it sounds like
it didn't really sound
any particular alarm bells
because it kind of sounded like, well,
there may be more rocket attacks,
but not nothing really too specific.
Yeah.
So this is the
the important thing to understand.
The nuance here,
to understand
here, Anderson, is
there's a big difference
in between sort of strategic warning
and kind of more kind of tactical
warning about, okay, here's
exactly what's about to happen.
And so this was certainly kind of
in the in the camp of strategic warning.
Right.
And I think
based on what our sources
are telling us,
for a lot of officials
who were reading this intelligence,
you know,
they were interpreting it
correctly is like,
look, there's, you know,
heightened tensions in the region.
There's something to be concerned about.
Something could happen here.
But they
they were sort of viewing this as likely
another round of cross-border
rocket fire.
You know,
maybe the Iron Dome intercepts
some missiles, maybe Israel retaliates.
You know,
maybe we even see something as dramatic
as the clash that took place in 20, 21
between Hamas and Israel.
But they weren't in any way
sort of imagining that these warnings
were indicating
something of the size and scale
of what we did see on Saturday.
As for whether or not this was shared
with Israeli officials,
but because the United States
doesn't do a lot of its own
intelligence collection inside Gaza,
it really
relies on Israel
to do a lot of that sort of raw
reporting and a lot of that collection.
It just sort of takes the information
and then analyzes it for itself.
Many of the officials that we spoke
to said it wouldn't necessarily
be indicated for the U.S.
to sort of turn around
and share these reports
or share these sort of assessments
with Israel.
Again,
because much of the raw information
in these intelligence assessments
was coming from Israel in the first place
and Israel wasn't
raising these alarm
bells with the United States
Katie Butler, those
appreciate the reporting. Thank you.
Joining me now
to talk
more about this
and other things happening in
the region is Mark Esper.
He was defense secretary
under President Trump,
is author of the book
A Sacred Oath
Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense
during Extraordinary Times.
Secretary Esper,
appreciate you joining us.
First of all, what do you make of this,
this new information about U.S.
intelligence warning
that something
may be happening,
some uptick, not too specific.
What do you.
Should it have been caught?
Should that have raised more alarms?
It's very interesting.
I'm not surprised that we had some type
of intelligence at that level.
I am a little surprised that there
wasn't more preparation
taking taking on the Israeli end,
if you will, to,
you know,
heighten the security level
along the fence line, the border line
between Israel and Gaza.
I think there have been two failures.
If you look at the situation
now, one has been
the intelligence failure.
But the second one is
a military readiness failure.
To
step up
patrols, surveillance
or whatnot along the along the border.
So that look, that
there will be time for that later.
But that's kind of what jumps to my mind
when we talk about this
Yeah.
And as you said,
I mean, time for that later.
But CNN did do a report
just the board was looking at
what the Hamas, the training videos
they were putting out
and geolocated a site that they built
which mirrored a Israeli
settler community
that they were doing
training on
that was very close to one of the major
border crossings
and was visible from the air.
It's remarkable
that that Israel did not pick up
any real signs of this operation,
which was clearly planned
for a very long period of time
involving many, many different people.
Yeah, that was a very interesting report.
And I read it with some
a good deal of curiosity
that it would go back that far.
And it was should have been visible.
Like I said,
I think there will be time later
they'll go back and really dig into this.
I think the immediate question
when you
look at these pieces of information
that should have been assessed is clearly
there was a blind spot. Blind spot.
And as you go into this next phase
where you're looking
at a military incursion into Gaza
and maybe some other things,
I do think you want to make a quick check
to make sure that this blind spots
are no longer there.
And so I think there is a need
for an immediate assessment
as to what happened and why.
And then you can dig later, kind of
pull each and every thread later.
But that would be
my concern is
what what didn't
we see over the past year
and why didn't we see it
and have we rectified that
before we step into these next
phases of the operation?
I want to ask
you what
you think about the idea
of of a million
residents in Gaza moving south
in a 24 hour period, which is what Israel
is is
telling people to do,
they dropping leaflets.
Do you have a number of humanitarian
organizations saying this is impossible
it's going to lead
to catastrophic consequences?
Hamas is saying don't leave.
I understand
militarily why
they would not want
the civilian population to leave.
They want to use them
as much as possible as human shields
Have you seen mass migrations of people
like that?
Is that possible?
Moving a million
people in 24 hours is a difficult task.
But I've also never seen
a military on the cusp of an invasion
give a warning
to the adversaries that they're coming in
and to allow cities in some time,
if you will, to flee.
Look, it's a tough situation.
It was a situation
brought on by these atrocious, terrible,
barbaric terrorist acts
by Hamas, killing over 1300
Israelis, murdering, raping
slaughtering children, the elderly.
And now on top of that.
We know that
we have 130 250 hostages in Gaza.
I'd like to see these U.N.
agencies come out and demand
that Hamas release the hostages.
That would be a great gesture as well.
But look, it's a tough situation.
Israel has every right to proceed,
and I think they'll do so professionally.
And I think they've given fair warning.
And then I think, look,
I'm in favor
of opening up a humanitarian corridor
in the south,
but I would limit that to women, children
and the elderly
and try and address
that side of the problem. That way.
In terms of the fight ahead.
How difficult
do you think it's going to be?
Obviously,
there's the civilian component.
There's the hostages to think about
and just operating
in an urban environment like Gaza City.
I mean, it is a a warren of streets
and it is densely packed.
It's
how difficult
from your perspective is it?
Very difficult.
You know,
first of all, at the strategic level,
every every day or moment, the passes
you have to make sure
that you don't create a second
front with Hezbollah in the north. Right.
You don't want to fight
two fronts at the same time.
Of course, on top of that,
as we already addressed,
you have hostages.
And so will Hamas
follow through on their threats to begin
executing hostages?
Israelis and Americans, by the way,
we think they have a few Americans
as a as this proceeds
at the tactical level,
urban warfare is very, very difficult.
I know from my time in the Army
during the Gulf War, as we faced
urban areas,
it can consume a lot of troops
very quickly.
So I think part of what
Israel is doing right now
by flattening buildings and pummeling
the area is really trying to reduce
the amount
of places and spaces
and floors and doors.
Every place
that Hamas can hide
to ambush
Israeli troops
as they come through
and try and clear out the areas
they try to uncover
you know,
the subterranean networks
that Hamas has built underneath Gaza.
But it's it's it's really difficult.
It can consume a lot of troops
even if they're not killed or injured.
You just have to leave troops
behind to protect the space.
Part of my concern here
is that maybe the lack of action
by Hezbollah in the north
isn't
because they've made a strategic decision
to sit the conflict out,
but maybe they made
an operational decision
to execute some
to to execute some patience
and wait
until the IDF gets really entrenched
in Gaza.
It's bogged down.
And then they start,
you know, something in the north.
And that would be an operational matter,
which I'm
sure the IDF is considering
very carefully. As well.
Yeah.
Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper,
thank you for your time.",20231013

attempting to kill anybody
who may have been inside.
We have not yet been able to verify
if people were actually killed
in this moment.
If you're actually looking at people die
behind those doors.
But obviously, that was the plan.
That was the intent.
That's what they were doing.
And CNN is analyzing
and verifying more than 50 videos
like this one, piecing together exactly
how many of the brutal killings
the slaughter unfolded that morning.
Katie Polglase is OUTFRONT
with an in-depth investigation.
It's 6:30 a.m.
on October 7th,
and things are getting into full
swing at the Nova Festival
in the south of Israel.
We were having fun.
You know, peace, love,
good vibes and an hour
or an hour and a half
after we are running from bullets,
suddenly the music stops.
And then
there's the station.
But no sense yet of the horror
about to unfold
as news
spreads of rocket
attacks from Gaza, people
begin seeking shelter,
crouching close to the ground.
But even this doesn't
lead to outright panic.
Rocket attacks
visible
here are a regular occurrence
in this part of southern Israel.
About 10 minutes later
and some start heading to their cars.
The decision of when
and how to leave the festival
would mean life or death for many.
Some fled early to nearby bomb shelters.
It's 7:10 a.m.
and many are crammed inside.
This one to the north of the festival.
But they've been followed.
At 7:24 a.m., Hamas
threw a grenade inside,
causing horrific damage.
This man, Noah,
emerges stunned into the daylight
and is not the only shelter
to be targeted.
30 minutes later
and further down the same road,
Hamas militants are caught
on dashcam footage
outside another shelter.
They throw a grenade inside.
In total, CNN has identified
four different shelters
near the festival.
The Hamas attacks
all full of people over the next 6 hours.
Hundreds of civilians were killed,
hunted down as they tried
to flee the festival
by examining over
50 videos of that morning
and speaking to 12 survivors.
CNN has established that Hamas
surrounded the festival,
blocking three approaches
to the south, north
and west,
forcing people to flee across
the fields to the east.
Even then, they were hunted.
It's now 8:15 a.m., and Gal Brooke
Chopin survives along with others
by running across the fields.
He's pictured here in the white T-shirt.
Local police and security
told them to drive
east across rough land
due to roadblocks on the main road.
But many end up fleeing on foot.
We're like ducks.
It was like a range.
People were running in their hundreds.
And you can hear the bullets coming.
Were you seeing anyone get shot?
Yeah.
You can see people fall.
It's 8:30 a.m.
and as Gale and others
continued running east,
others running north met
with more bullets and a police blockade,
causing further panic.
As a result, revelers
start running back down
the main road towards the festival,
not knowing there were more militants.
Just a few kilometers further down
on that same road.
Chilling dash cam footage shows
Hamas militants shooting directly
at an approaching car
just an hour earlier.
Those festival goers
that remained closer to the concert site
hid behind anything they could find,
even behind trees
waiting while the bullets closed.
And
many did not survive.
260 are reported dead,
but that toll could rise.
Just 3 hours
after the start of the massacre,
a 9:39 a.m.
videos emerge
of some festival goers
already held hostage in Gaza.
This man still wearing
a festival wristband
and another visibly
wearing the security uniform.
Their fates remain unknown.
Google and others are still processing
the trauma of what they went through.
I know people who were like
12 hours in the bushes
and they didn't move.
I know people who tried to hide
and they died.
Humanity never seen this
in the last couple of hundreds of years
since maybe the Holocaust.
But this is just this is just horrific.
Horrific.
It would be 10 hours until help arrived
for some.
Others are still missing,
feared dead or held hostage in Gaza.
The scale of this tragedy
may grow greater yet
after those 6 hours of horror
in the desert.
Katie Polglase, CNN, London.
And OUTFRONT now, Wolf BLITZER.
Of course,
he's been following this
story for decades
and he knows it better than anyone.
So, Wolf, when you look at that report
and how intricately planned
the massacre was at the music festival,
the slaughter of at least
260 people,
that the footage of someone
shooting up the port
a potties for shelter to shelter
because they knew where they were
waiting to be brought in them
and then throwing in grenades.
The more we find out, the harder
it is to see a way for this
to to
to de-escalate,
for anyone to to back away.
And I know yesterday you and I spoke,
you thought there was a very tiny chance
that this
this could
this could calm down
and de-escalate
as that chance
basically gone to zero now?
Yes, it's basically zero
based on everything I'm
hearing from my Israeli sources.
The Israeli military does not
mobilize 300,000
or maybe close to 400,000 troops,
deploys them to this area around Gaza
and is not about to try to achieve
two major objectives.
The first objective
to either capture
or kill the Hamas leadership.
The second
objective to either
capture or destroy the Hamas weapons.
They'd like to capture
a lot of those weapons
because if they do capture the weapons,
they can determine presumably
where they came from.
Did they come from Iran, for example?
And if they did come from Iran,
that that creates a moment
for the Israelis
if they want to continue the escalation
to target some sort of objectives
in Iran as well.
This could really escalate
not just in Gaza, but elsewhere as well.
And I'm convinced that the Israelis
are not going to back away.
They want achieve those two objectives.
It could happen within a matter of hours.
It could happen
within a matter of a few days.
But everyone should brace
for a major Israeli
ground invasion of Gaza.
And interesting,
the Colonel Conricus,
I know you've been speaking to him,
too, Wolf.
He said they still don't know
the depth of that arsenal
and those special Forces raids today.
Right.
They were about
trying to get
that information of the names,
who was involved, exactly what. Right.
That that seems like
they're being extremely
they're trying to be surgical
to get exactly what they need
because it's very clear
what the intent is.
As you said,
who puts 400,000 or close
to 400,000 troops along a 25 mile border?
If you're not going to do something?
Yeah, they're going to do it.
And it's just a matter of when.
And in my opinion, it'll be fairly soon.
All right, Wolf, thank you very much.",20231014

Cyp03W2SXyc,Weapons used by Hamas militants appear to be Russian or Chinese made,data/en_CNN\Weapons used by Hamas militants appear to be Russian or Chinese made.jpg,"A special
investigation
here at CNN
looking at the deadly weapons arsenal
that Hamas had, that
they used to unleash terror
and to slaughter
all those innocent people.
What weapons did they use
and where did they get them?
Oren Liebermann is OUTFRONT.
An entire arsenal on display.
Weapons fashioned in Hamas's
homegrown facilities, but no less deadly.
CNN analyzed
dozens of photos
and videos of Hamas militants
during the surprise assault
to identify
the weapons used to kill
at least 1200 people in Israel.
The most important character
risk of the military equipment
they have, it's that it's
easily interchangeable.
It's reliable, dependable,
and you can get parts for it.
Many, like the Soviet built
50 caliber machine gun,
appear to be Russian
or Chinese firearms
relics from previous wars
that made their way
into the hands of Hamas,
ubiquitous among many of the photos
and videos.
The aftermath Kalashnikov, the AK 47,
the preferred weapon for militant groups
capable of spewing automatic fire
with horrific results.
The assault
rifles, along
with the grenades
carried by Hamas militants,
made them deadly when they reached
Israeli towns and villages near Gaza.
All they're trying to do
is provide the shock effects,
provide dependability.
Their weapons have to work.
So they're very rudimentary.
But based on their training
best in how they operate them,
they are successful with them.
Hamas, his main weapon, has long
been their supply of rockets
from short range to long range.
The terror attack on Saturday
morning began
with a barrage of rocket fire,
a smokescreen for the imminent attack.
Thousands of rockets
overwhelmed Israel's Iron Dome air
defense system,
a tactic Hamas
has refined over the years.
That's the capability
for the enemy, for Hamas,
just to fire them up against
potentially commercial aircraft.
And that,
I think, is
one of the major issues
of these terrorist groups.
And if they have those kinds of weapons
in their hands.
Hamas used paragliders
to cross the Gaza border.
The recreational vehicles
are barely maneuverable
and easy to target in the air.
But in the chaos of the moment,
the plan worked.
Some of the weapons
and equipment
were decidedly more low tech.
Israel built a complex
underground barrier to stop tunnels
from crossing the Gaza border.
So Hamas used a bulldozer
to tear down the aboveground fence.
They are just looking to create chaos
with the kind of equipment they have.
And the equipment has got to be reliable.
Worth noting that these are
only the videos and the weapons
we saw in the videos and the
and the photos from from the attack.
We've seen them use
other weapons in the past
like anti-tank
anti-armor rockets or missiles.
And, Erin, that's
what makes a ground incursion by Israel
such a difficult proposition.
All right, Oren, thank you very much.
With all of that
reporting on the weapons,
I want to go now
to Lieutenant Colonel
Jonathan Conricus,
the international spokesperson
for the Israeli Defense Forces.
And,
Colonel, obviously,
welcome back to the program.
You heard Oren's report.
Do you feel right now that
that the IDF knows
what sort of an arsenal Hamas
has right now,
whether it be rockets
and other sorts of weaponry?
Do you know the extent
of the arsenal right now?
I don't.
Hi, Aaron.
Thank you for having me again.
I think that the story you just aired
is very comprehensive, Interesting.
And, well done one.
And I think that
the short answer to your question is, no,
we don't.
And I
think that we have
to be extremely cautious and very humble
in our approach
for the next stage of operations,
because clearly our enemy has shown
that they have had the ability
to acquire and train and use weapons
that they haven't done before,
and they field to them,
unfortunately, successfully
on the battlefield.
So we have to be very,
very humble and strong focused
and I would say aggressive
in our approach against them.
So you talk about being aggressive
in the next stages,
even as you say, you need to be humble.
You know, Israel
obviously issued that evacuation
order for northern Gaza.
The United Nations said
it was a 24 hour deadline.
Where are we in this?
Are you able to give
any sort of a sense of
when Israel may move?
Yeah, it's about 2:30 a.m.
local time.
So it's dark and it's,
of course,
very difficult to
see exactly
what's happening in the Gaza Strip.
But we've been following
throughout the day
and we've been monitoring the movement,
the mass movement
of Palestinian civilians, who,
I'm happy to say many, many.
I don't know
exactly how many, but many,
many have listened to the warnings
and have indeed moved
evacuated themselves to the south.
And that is very good for them
and their families.
I'm not going to put a time line on
our time schedule, sorry,
on our activities.
I can only say that
we are trying to do the right thing here.
We're trying to get
the civilians out of the way
because we are going to intensify
the operations in and around Gaza City
whenever we will feel
that the situation is
tenable for military operations.
I assume that that is when
the operations will continue.
And you also you
did have some operations today.
Obviously, those were more special forces
back in there.
Can you tell us anything about
whether they were successful
or what was accomplished?
Yeah, they were successful
in the sense that they were able
to find new intelligence
and perhaps shed a little bit more light
on the very complex task
we have of understanding
who was taken hostage and who wasn't.
Who is dead and who might be missing.
And then trying to piece together
other sources of intelligence
and building a more cohesive picture
of where they are and who they are.
And then, of course, supporting a plan on
how to get them out.
So, yes, it was successful.
We found intelligence that
the support staff
and of course, that is a very high
I would say number one priority for us is
to find those people,
get them back home to Israel.
And Hamas claims that
13 of them, 13 Israeli hostages in Gaza,
they say were killed,
they say were actually killed
by IDF air strikes in the past 24 hours.
I know that
one of your colleagues had said
that Israeli intelligence
was looking into it.
Is there any truth to
what Hamas is claiming?
Well,
the Hamas is a lying,
cowardly terrorist organization
that I don't think
that any of their statements are true.
It is all propaganda.
And they also said,
I think it was on the second
or third day of the war,
you'll forgive me for not keeping
count of the days. Totally.
But on the second on the third day,
they also said that they would start
they would start executing hostages
and filming it.
If Israel doesn't stop
targeting their facilities
and so who it's it's
impossible to trust what they're saying
and will have to believe
believe it
only when we see it
and when we have our intelligence
that will prove it.
But at the end of the day,
Hamas is responsible
and Hamas will pay a price.
Colonel, thank you very much.
I appreciate your time again.
Thank you. Thank you.",20231014
C5Rv6c3NP3s,Retired colonel: Military buildup around Gaza ‘reminiscent of a scene from D-Day’,data/en_CNN\Retired colonel Military buildup around Gaza ‘reminiscent of a scene from D-Day’.jpg,"To go to the ground.
I want
to turn to someone who is right now
fighting on the front lines of this war.
Joining me
now is IDF soldier Rudy Rockman.
Rudy, you are quite literally,
as we can see there in your picture.
You are called now to duty.
What have the last few days
been like for you on the ground
and where you are in Israel,
which, by the way, I should say
we are not specifically naming
just for security reasons as well.
Yeah. Thank you for having me.
I mean, it's been almost a week
since this started.
And as a reservist,
I've been out of the Army
for over ten years.
I'm a civilian.
I've done my degrees,
I've work, I have families.
And all of a sudden on Saturday morning,
it was Shabbat and it was so quiet.
It was the holiday for the Jewish people.
We get called up
and we started seeing these videos
of what had taken place in the morning
and our entire unit
got deployed to Vaasa,
which is a village on the border of Gaza,
which had some of the most horrendous
massacres.
And unfortunately,
we were there for four days
rescuing the remaining civilians
that remained.
But when we got there, it was a massacre.
We saw
bodies of men, women,
children, elderly, elderly,
cut up into pieces.
The most gruesome images
you can ever imagine.
And it was very unfortunate
to see those things.
But thankfully,
we were able to secure the area.
And since then, we're ready
to be deployed to the next location.
As you
prepare for what this
next phase of the war looks like,
Israeli officials have been pretty clear
that the plan
right now,
the objective is to wipe out Hamas.
But I wonder,
do you think that that will require
street by street fighting?
And are you
personally prepared
for what that would mean?
I mean, the entire army has been prepared
for this war.
Hamas goal
from the very beginning has been
to eliminate the Jewish people
and to eliminate Israel.
It's actually been in their constitution
when they built
their government
saying that they need
to eliminate the Jews,
not only in Israel,
but in entire the world.
So when you give a terrorist organization
like that
weapons to go and fulfill their goals,
we know what that looks like,
whether it's for Hamas,
the Palestinian Authority or Hezbollah
or all these different groups
that are actually oppressing its peoples
and don't actually
represents its peoples.
If you speak to Palestinians
on the ground,
whether in Judea and Samaria,
the West
Bank or in Gaza, they do not like Hamas,
they do not like
the Palestinian Authority.
They're on their,
what, 20th year of their four year term.
These are oppressive
regimes
that are controlling their people
and not only attacking Israeli civilians.
The forcing Palestinians
to also be caught into this conflict.
Israelis do not want to see
either Israelis die or Palestinians die.
The majority of us are innocents,
and this is not a war between the people.
Let me make it clear
the Jews are not fighting the Muslims
and the Israelis
are not fighting Palestinians.
We're fighting Hamas,
which is oppressing
both Israelis and Palestinians.
Are we ready?
We are ready.
But we also need to
not only look at the what is happening,
we need to understand
why it is happening.
And this really started with the West
pushing narratives of dividing
Israelis and Palestinians.
The reality is that there is no future
without Palestinians
and without Israelis.
Neither of us are going to disappear.
So I hope that when this settles,
we can learn from this entrance
on this conflict together.
It's an important point.
And and I think so
many people share your hope that
that if there is an end to this,
hopefully there is
that It's one
that is obviously a lot more peaceful.
But as we sit here,
there's so much concern
right now about the 1 million
or so Palestinians
who are being
told to flee
the northern part of Gaza right now.
I've noted that you've observed
in the past that Hamas uses civilian
casualties of Palestine
as a propaganda tool.
But are you worried that this operation
carried out by by Israel
could ultimately play into Hamas's hands
if those civilians
are not able to evacuate
and many of them end up killed?
Absolutely.
I don't want to see any civilian killed.
You know, for me, you're
you're you're a foreigner.
You know, your fellow human being.
But for me, Palestinians are my cousins.
They're my family.
So I don't want to see
any Palestinians killed.
And I'm glad that they have at
least 24 hours to be able to evacuate.
Israelis have less than 24 seconds
to be able to evacuate
when they're being fired on.
But when you look at people in Gaza,
I really hope
we can minimize the casualties
because none of us
want to see anybody dead.
We want to remove Hamas.
So it can stop being a threat
both for Israelis and Palestinians.
And in order
to transcend this conflict, it's
not just about creating peace.
It's about creating justice.
There's injustice both for Israelis
and both for Palestinians.
And there's one land
and one land that we can both live on.
But in order to get there,
we have to stop these zero
sum game
narratives that are educating people
that in order to be pro-Israel,
you have to be anti-Palestinian.
Or in order to be pro-Palestinian,
you have to be anti-Israel.
The reality,
if you're anti, either you're anti both
because we both belong in this line
and we will both be here eternally.
You mentioned that you've been out
of the Israeli military
for about ten years.
Is there anything in your experience
that compares
to what you are about to go into
and how long are you expecting
this conflict to last?
Yes, I got out of the Army in 2013.
So in 2012
there was an operation on the border
where we almost went into Gaza shortly
after I finished the army in 2014.
The IDF went into Gaza.
So this is not something
new, unfortunately,
but I hope
this will be the last time
that this happens.
We certainly hope it will be for you
and for really everyone in the region.
Rudy Brockmann,
thank you for joining us
and we wish you all the best.
Thank you for having me.
And for a closer look at what's happening
on the developing battlefield
right now,
I'm joined by CNN military analyst
Colonel Cedric Leighton.
Colonel Leighton, we're
we've been discussing the issue of the
the potential refugees
that could be made in Gaza
if they do flee.
Talk to us about what
evacuation even
looks like in Gaza right now.
I mean,
a million people
in that part of the territory.
Where do they even go?
Yeah, that's
going to be the real question, Avi.
And, you know,
let's take a look at the evacuation zone
as we know it right now,
because when you see the types of things
that can happen here,
you've got this area in the north.
There are
about 1.1 million people
that are in this area at this point.
And what's going to happen, Abby,
is they are supposed to, according to
what the Israelis have told them,
go down here toward the Rafah crossing
right here, the Egyptian border.
So their ability to do this
kind of thing
is actually going to be limited
because they really don't
have a humanitarian corridor
coming through this way.
And can you give us a sense
of the distance here
or the distances both in space up here
and how far they would need to travel?
Yes.
So basically,
we're talking about 25 to 30 miles down
this way. It's a very small place.
Gaza is about 140 square miles total,
a total population,
about 2.2 million people.
So it's pretty dense
in terms of its population.
And what they're going
to have to do in a case
like this
is not only go through these areas,
but they're no safe zones
in any of these areas.
And when you go through these areas
which are less densely populated
than the northern area,
there are less services there, less
there's less of an ability
to care for people.
And if they don't
get this crossing opened,
they won't be able to
really stay in this area
for a long period of time
because it's going to be a place
where they don't have living facilities,
they don't have water,
they don't have sanitation
or any of those things.
I want to talk now about as what
the build up
that we're seeing
of Israeli troops around Gaza.
As you can see,
it's there basically surrounding Gaza.
And then just to show our audience here,
these are some pictures of
just the heavy machinery that is
that is part of
that build up when you look at this
as someone with a military eye.
Tell us what you're seeing
and what does it tell us about
what the Israelis are preparing for?
So this is kind of reminiscent
of a scene from D-Day back in 1944
when Eisenhower was talking
to his paratroopers
before they launched that invasion.
This is what units do.
The commanding officer
will talk to the units.
They will go out.
They will deploy in forward positions.
You see the Merkava tanks coming through
and armored personnel carriers
call the tanks right there.
They're Israeli made.
They've been in service
since 1979 in the Israeli army.
They've got radio equipment,
they've got
their rifles, they've got ammunition.
They are ready to go.
These people are well-trained.
They're ready to go.
And they will deploy to forward positions
that are right near the Gaza border.
Obviously, this has been
a week now
of really intense bombing in Gaza.
And I just want to give our audience
a sense here of how this compares
to another previous conflict
that lasted 50 days,
almost the same number of
bombs dropped in that time.
And the dust,
the death toll here.
Colonel Leighton,
what can we expect?
Really, this is 50 days versus six days.
We're almost at the same place.
As we go forward,
what can we realistically expect
in terms of the toll
that this will all take?
I'm afraid
it's going to be a very heavy toll
and this could be
an exceptionally gruesome war.
All wars are gruesome, but this one,
because of the close quarters,
because of the urban combat
that inevitably going to happen
through the narrow
alleyways of Gaza City
and other places like that.
I'm afraid that this death toll
is going to rise considerably.
There are ways to mitigate that.
Israel says it's trying to do that.
The problem is, is that Hamas will use
innocent civilians
as human shields in this scenario.
And that's something that has happened
in other places in Iraq.
It happened in Afghanistan. It happened.
This is the kind of thing
that we can expect.
And unfortunately,
if this isn't stopped,
we are going to see a situation where
the forces will meet
and there's going to be a major increase
in this death toll.
Yeah, I think we
we just have to
be clear eyed about what
we are facing in this region
going forward.
It's going to be gruesome.
Unfortunately.
Colonel Leighton, we appreciate you
joining us on all of that.",20231014

so that it can get back to work.
Friday, Ohio
GOP Congressman Jim
Jordan was nominated to be speaker
after garnering support
from both deposed
speaker Kevin McCarthy
and from Fox anchor Sean HANNITY.
Without a leader of the GOP
has frozen
the chamber during several
looming crises from Israel's
war against Hamas
to a potential government
shutdown now just 34 days away.
It's unclear
if Jordan can win enough support
from the entire House
to get the requisite 217 votes
in a secret ballot on Friday.
He still had 55 Republicans opposed.
Joining me now is the person who started
this whole chain of events
by pushing for McCarthy's ouster,
Florida Representative Matt Gaetz.
Congressman, do you regret ousting
Kevin McCarthy
given that Israel
is now at war with Hamas
and we don't have a speaker?
Absolutely not.
The United States stands with Israel.
Israel has a right to defend itself,
and there is no need expressed
by Israel that the United States
has not been able to meet.
That's because we have an Israel
essentially on autopay
as a consequence of legislation
that was passed by Senator
Marco Rubio of Florida.
The administration is pre authorized
to meet any need
that Israel could
possibly express in this particular phase
of the crisis.
My expectation is that we will elect
speaker designate Jim Jordan
as House speaker next week
and we'll be prepared to move forward
with resolutions of support.
But those are non-binding
expressions of our opinion
when it comes to the movement
of specific material
and the coordination on intelligence.
We are authorized
because our relationship
with Israel is that unique.
How how do you think that
Jordan crosses
the finish line with True 17?
If there were 55 votes against him,
as is being reported, you were there
55 votes against him
on that second ballot last night?
Well, I think it's important
to understand how that math moved.
Initially,
there were 81 votes against Jim Jordan,
and then about 30 minutes later,
there were only 55 votes
against Jim Jordan.
So on that trajectory,
he seems to be gaining
a good amount of momentum.
Also, it's important to note
that those 55
no votes on Jordan were on a secret
anonymous ballot,
like in the basement
of the Longworth Office Building.
It's quite a different thing
to stand on the floor
of the House of Representatives
and vote against the second
most popular
living Republican in America.
I know how hard it is
to stand on the floor
and vote against the party's choice.
I did it to extract concessions
that I thought
were meaningful
that unfortunately the former speaker
did not live up to.
But my my expectation is that next week
we will elect Jim Jordan.
Frankly, Michael,
I think we
probably could have done it last night
and I would have preferred that path.
But Speaker
Emeritus McCarthy said that he wanted Jim
Jordan's family to be able to be there,
his supporters to be able to be there.
And I guess one thing
that Kevin McCarthy and I agree
on, Jim Jordan's going to be
the next speaker of the House.
You've heard the criticisms, right,
from people,
including in your own caucus.
I think one member
who said that,
that it's a group of idiots
who have led us down this path.
Others say we look Third world
ish at a time
when we need to be looking
as a model for democracies
around the globe.
How do you respond to those who say that
the whole perception of the United States
and the dysfunction of Congress
is what has arisen
out of your ouster of Kevin McCarthy?
I find it a little ridiculous, right?
Like, Oh no, the world is ending
because the House of Representatives
isn't passing
ceremonial resolutions this week.
The entire United States
Senate was out all week.
The House of Representatives
takes seven weeks off
every single year
for essentially a summer vacation.
There are days
when all we vote on are procedural votes
and post offices.
So I think that the chaos narrative
is a bit overplayed,
particularly in the Beltway,
because the lobbyists
and the special interests
want someone in the speakership
that they totally control.
They had that in Kevin McCarthy.
And just because lobbyists
and special interests
have been disempowered
by the motion to vacate
doesn't mean it was the wrong decision.
And it doesn't mean that
like we're in chaos
because there were ten days
when the lights were off
on the House floor.
We have not put our pencils down.
This last week
we were getting classified briefings
on the evolving situation
in the Middle East.
I was taking depositions of former
and current Department
of Justice officials
as pursuant to our oversight work.
So don't believe that
just because there isn't floor action
that somehow
all of our representatives
aren't working.
We, in fact,
are continuing the work of the Congress.
I heard the point that you made.
Everybody heard the point
that you made about a quote unquote,
autopay for Israel.
To the extent
there's congressional action
required of any kind vis a vis Israel,
will you be seeking to tie it
to support for Ukraine?
Well, no, I'll be seeking to to untether
any question about Ukraine
from any question on Israel.
And it's important to ask that question
because when what.
Does that mean?
Well,
I think that they deserve their own vote
and their own dignity. Right.
However you feel about Israel
and however you feel about Ukraine,
I think that a responsible
and reasonable government
ought to address
those questions separately.
They shouldn't be lashed together.
For example,
I would support
meeting additional requests
for from Israel for aid.
I would not for Ukraine.
So, you know, mushing things together,
log rolling them.
That is the old way of Washington.
That's what I'm trying to change,
whether it's our budgeting process
or our foreign aid.
I want individual votes
on separate and disparate questions.
I don't want. Okay.
But many of your colleagues,
many of your colleagues
don't share that view.
Is that your understanding?
In other words,
those who seek to diminish
United States support for Ukraine
are now looking to this Israel issue
as a means of doing so.
Unless
unless we get a reduced role for Ukraine,
we're not going to support
Israel to the extent you'd like us to.
That's a sentiment that I'm hearing.
Well,
that is not the sentiment
from the administration.
The administration is trying to combine
the question.
I am trying to separate the question.
And one of the concessions
that we did get in House
rules that will outlast Speaker
McCarthy is the ability in the Rules
Committee to be able
to raise points of order
and raise questions
to try to separate those things.
In fact,
when we had our defense
bill are $886 billion
defense bill,
Marjorie Taylor GREENE was successful
in getting a separate vote
on the 300 million for Ukraine
because of those single
subject concessions we got in January.
That 300 million for Ukraine
still passed,
but it passed
with a majority of Republicans
voting against it.
So now we have
for anyone to move legislation
to support Ukraine,
they would have to roll
a majority of the Republicans
who now believe
we should be less
involved in that conflict.
But that in no way
diminishes our support for Israel,
which is very strong but
in a bipartisan fashion.
Final quick question.
What's your answer to my poll
question today?
Should the Biden administration
encourage, quote unquote,
de-escalation in Gaza?
I knew I was getting this question.
I think the Biden administration
should be most focused
on really
putting pressure on Egypt to set up
refugee camps and passageways.
You only de-escalate
after the military operations
are concluded.
So my answer to the question
would be no today.
But I think our diplomatic efforts
should be focused
on humanitarian passageways
to get civilians out of Gaza.
If we have a pile of dead Muslim kids
that could increase
the amount of terrorism in the world,
not decrease it.
Though I understand Israel's
very sincere
and legitimate efforts
to destroy Hamas once and for all.
But Catherine,
put the social media up there.
It's probably a complaint
either about Gates or me hosting him.
So maybe he'll want to respond.
Quote, Jordan is the worst
of the bad choices for speaker.
Further proof
that the GOP cannot govern effectively
for all of America.
You'd say what to that person.
Add X.
Yeah. At x76.
I guess.
I'm glad you're
not a member
of the United States Congress
because if you were, you'd know that Jim
Jordan is a good man, a virtuous man,
someone who is broadly respected
across the Republican conference
and you know where he stands.
That's a distinction between
Jim Jordan and Kevin McCarthy.
It's one of the reasons I'm
so excited to make him House speaker.
Right.
But people like me
say, hey,
McCarthy was willing
to reach across the aisle
and keep the government functioning.
McCarthy was willing
to reach across the aisle
and raise the debt ceiling lest
we would have suffered default.
Those are those are good things.
10 seconds, you get the final word.
Well, I think that Kevin McCarthy
was ousted by Democrats and Republicans
because he made multiple
contradictory promises
that he never intended to keep.
Jim Jordan puts us back
on a path to fiscal sanity
and he gets the Republican Party
back into the fighting posture
we need to be in to win elections
and push our policy objectives.
Congressman Gates, thank
you for coming back.
Thank you, Michael.
Always good to be with you.",20231014
VlQiCdqFURM,Why this expert thinks everyone's mental health is 'at risk' from Israel-Hamas war,data/en_CNN\Why this expert thinks everyone's mental health is 'at risk' from Israel-Hamas war.jpg,"People were
just watching
the images out of Israel and Gaza.
It's incredibly disturbing.
The war shows no sign of ending
any time soon.
As a result,
it is taking a toll on people's
mental health around the world.
Joining us now
is psychiatrist and host of the
How Can I Help podcast.
Dr. Gail Saltz.
Doctor, thank you so much for joining us.
You know,
even if you don't have family members
or people
you know,
who are impacted by
what's happening in Israel,
I think people are just shocked
at the level of carnage.
How would you advise the general public
in terms of how much
they should be consuming
and when they should know
when to take a break?
I think you have to know yourself.
So for people who know,
they tend to be anxious.
They tend to struggle with mood.
They have a history of trauma
of some sort
or any really any sort
or history
of probable problems
in terms of mental health.
They're more at risk.
People, as you pointed out,
who are connected to this
in any sort of way.
They're more at risk.
But I would say to you
that actually all of us
are somewhat at risk
because we
have never had this level
of graphic image
coming to us on such a constant basis.
So it's not only on the news,
it's on everybody's social media feeds.
And today, children, adolescents, adults,
we're receiving these images and images
tend to stick in your mind
in a very intrusive way,
making it difficult to concentrate,
feeling like it's
repeating all the time,
making it difficult to sleep.
And those things will further
impact your mental health.
So I would say a little bit to all of us,
we really limit how much we are seeing
and possibly even take a break
and take your news in there reading it
or listening to it.
But picking
a source and limiting how much of the day
you actually expose yourself.
So maybe like 30 minutes and not doing it
close to bedtime,
we are likely to be even more stirred up
and therefore have difficulty sleeping.
There's a point at which
we have to turn it off,
and then there's a point
at which for some people
they need some help. Yeah.
How do you know when you've gotten
to that
second level, that second degree there
where you need to talk
to a professional
about what you're watching
and what you're experiencing?
Well, I think, first of all,
most a lot of people
can do things for themselves
before they get there.
They can add some coping tools
that help with anxiety during the day,
deep breathing aerobic exercise,
talking to people around them
that make them feel better,
stay away from doomsday.
People can tap
catastrophizing people
that will make you actually feel worse.
But talking to people
can also really be helpful.
But beyond that,
if your anxiety and concern about this
are disturbing you such
that you can't concentrate at work,
you can't get things done
the way you normally would,
you can't sleep well at night.
It's affecting your relationships,
basically, if it's intruding into
and affecting your day
for more than a few days.
This might be the time
that you want to say,
Hey, I need to get an evaluation
or something.
A process may have started here
that I have to really look into
and think about
whether I need a little extra help with.
I can't stop thinking about,
you know, so many of the people
that we and
our CNN colleagues have interviewed.
They're out in this war zone.
The family members
who have seen
the horror happen
before their eyes, people
losing their children,
people being on the phone
while the abduction
and the screaming
was happening in the background.
How do we begin to help them recover
from the trauma?
So obviously, the closer that you are,
as I said to this event,
the more likely you are
to have
what's called an acute stress reaction,
which is a whole collection
of symptoms
of the intrusive
thoughts of the event
repetitively of feeling
like you have to avoid anything
that reminds you of the event of trouble
sleeping and concentrating
or taking pleasure in anything
and trouble with your appetite.
But again, the closer you are to this,
the more likely
you are to go on and develop
post-traumatic stress disorder.
So what's important is to intervene
early.
An intervention
means, again, any kind of thing
that would help you
decrease your overall anxiety level.
So there are lots of,
as I alluded to earlier, exercises
one can do that
do take down your anxiety level,
which helps you manage trauma more.
You want to pay attention to your mood.
So actually
spending time
talking about anything positive,
anything positive.
And in fact, we hear or someone anywhere
and they too can think about
what can they do to help their situation.
Because helping and being involved
in something
that feels like an active action
really does help with it.
Managing the trauma of this.
So those sorts of things are going to be
very important
to the people who are involved.
And of course, you know, people
like myself
who are getting involved in mental health
care for those people as well.
Yeah. Dr.
Gail Saltz, some great advice there.
Thank you so much.",20231014
IfWjwKl-CA8,Analyst: How Hamas is using cryptocurrency to raise funds,data/en_CNN\Analyst How Hamas is using cryptocurrency to raise funds.jpg,"Investigators in the
US and around the world
have identified a revenue source
being exploited by Hamas online
donors offering
support in cryptocurrency.
Now, even before Hamas launched
a surprise attack on Israel, US
officials had been probing
the group's use of cryptocurrency
through alleged money launderers.
Hamas's use
of digital currency represents
just one of the many ways
the terrorist organization
has sought to raise funds
while evading sanctions.
Hamas and other terrorist groups
have used
Facebook and acts
to publicly post their crypto
wallet addresses asking for donations.
That's according to a report
by US authorities.
All right.
Joining me now is military man seeking
CEO of the crypto analytics software firm
Beto O'Rourke.
Thanks so much for being here with us.
So just first, how significant
a role is crypto in
terms of funding Hamas?
Well, from our
side, we've analyzed and studied deeply
the addresses
belonging to companies
controlled by Hamas,
as indicated in two orders
15, 22 and 1923.
It's public.
So the total amount of almost $41
million was received at this addresses.
And this is a total to turn over
all the addresses
listed in to previous seizure orders
and this was this significant amount
received from September 2021
and April 2024.
So over four years,
with the majority accounts
being received
between December 2022 and April 2023.
So yes, all the things.
So, so that's a lot.
But obviously it could be a lot more
that we don't know about.
So how exactly does it work?
How do they they get the money?
I understand
they fundraise on social media.
I mean, how does that all work?
So they gather
different, different social media
and putting the
different wallets, addresses
and then they're collecting
money, I mean, crypto
from all over the world.
And then they are using intermediary
addresses from a different kind
of exchanges around the world
and then collecting them
into several wallets and and funds.
This means they are laundering money
using crypto.
Well, it happens, unfortunately.
Is it untraceable in terms of the people
who are who are donating this money?
Almost.
So in case
if somebody say in investing or donating,
terrorists are going to be organizations
directly via centralized exchanges.
It's possible, but nobody is doing that.
So they are actually
they are usually
using decentralized wallets
and non-custodial wallets
and then
those organizations are laundering money
to avoid such.
So just closing.
So it's almost impossible.
Yeah.
So I mean, we're talking about,
you know, people
donating money on social media,
but in terms of these intermediaries
and so on, I mean, what
what role does Iran play here?
You mean centralized exchanges and so
on, so
we can determine the precise
origin of the funds.
So whether they were directly sent from
from other terrorist groups
or source from donations, etc..
But however, our investigation
revealed that a significant portion
of this
funds primarily
originated from cryptocurrency exchanges.
Some of them are really popular,
some of them are
have Russia origin,
but it's not connected with Russia.
So because it's not
it's not, you know, exchanges,
they are not aiming to help terrorists.
That's the most important thing here.
But in some of the cases, they are blind
and they cannot understand
what really happened.
And early and sometimes weeks or months
should be passed
till the exchanges are revealing
such bad things happening.
So it's not it's not online.
So time should pass.
And now we may see that
some of the exchanges fall under such bad
circumstance in terms of money
laundering and terrorist financing.
So, I mean, it sounds very hard to stop.
I mean, what more can be done to
to cut off this source
of funding for Hamas?
Yeah, that's the good question.
I mean, crypto is still in the gray zone,
but things that thankfully for you,
you know, international anti-money
and anti-money
laundering measures are coming.
And because of legislation
helping to reveal the source of funds,
the dirty money in crypto,
it goes more and more better to reveal.
And from my perspective,
the best way is to use KYC.
AML measures
in any kind of wallets exchanges
and to to put exchanges,
put exchanges attention on that.
And,
you know, after all, crypto is not about
crime, is not about terrorist
organizations, financing, etc.,
but anybody should be aware of it
because of where we are.
So it happens
and everybody should pay
a lot of attention on it.
Yeah, it's it's very complex
for most of us to untangle,
but really appreciate
getting your insights
on this Dmitri magic.
And thank you so much.
Thanks.",20231014
EtAz61fKLeg,'Israelis are bombing the crap out of Gaza': Tapper presses Biden official on American hostages,data/en_CNN\'Israelis are bombing the crap out of Gaza' Tapper presses Biden official on American hostages.jpg,"Is rescuing the hostages
a priority at all?
I mean, Israeli news media, like Haaretz,
they say it doesn't seem like it at all.
And frankly, Jake,
if my kids were being held
hostage in Gaza
and as you know, there are Americans
being held hostage in Gaza right now,
I'd want you
you to send in the Navy SEALs.
What's the conversation
like in the White House about the U.S.
conducting any sort of operations
in order to save Americans
being held hostage in Gaza?
Well, the president has been very clear
that he has no higher priority
than getting Americans
back safe, Americans
who are being held hostage by Hamas.
The Israelis are bombing
the crap out of Gaza.
And I mean,
it doesn't seem like saving
the hostages are a
priority at all right now.
Well, for President Biden,
they are a priority.
They're the highest possible priority.
And he has sent hostage
experts to coordinate
and consult with the Israeli government
on hostage recovery efforts.
He's also made sure that our diplomats
are in touch with third countries
in the region
to explore avenues
for their safe release.
I have to be cautious
about how much I can say
about certain efforts he's undertaking
because we want to protect those efforts
to give us the best possible chance
of getting our people home.
Now, Jake, one
important point
when it comes to the issue of the Navy
SEALs is
we do not at
this point have pinpoint location
information for where
the American hostages are.
So we have to continue
to refine our understanding
of where they are
and even Jake, who they are,
because we know
there are 15 unaccounted for Americans,
but we cannot confirm the precise number
of American hostages
being held by Hamas at this time.
All we can do
is to continue to work
closely with the Israeli government
on hostage recovery options,
which we are doing,
and then work through third countries
to see if there are avenues for release.
Those efforts are underway.
Our hope is that
they can produce results.
We will continue to stay focused on this.
It's as high
a priority as the president has.
One senior political operative
with Hamas floated
the possibility
a few days ago
of a potential prisoner swap
with the U.S.
for the release of hostages
with the U.S.. Entertain that.
We have not looked at that.
We have not heard from them.
Something like that.
That's not something
that is currently under
active discussion.
It has not been proposed.
What we are focused on instead,
as I said before, are pursuing avenues
with third countries for release.
I'm not going to get into the details
of what
that might look like again, to protect
those channels
in hopes that they can bear some fruit.
But I will say that President Biden
has shown over the course
of the past few years
that he will make hard decisions
to get American hostages home.
In this case,
our focus is on working
through those third country channels
and I'll leave it at that for now.
So I think there are
serious reasons to question
how good any intelligence
about what is in Gaza is.
I mean, obviously,
Hamas was able to carry out
this horrific attack eight days ago,
catching everybody completely off guard.
You just said that
we don't know
where the hostages are in Gaza.
And yet the Israelis claim
the IDF claims that it is bombing places
that it knows are Hamas
targets.
How can we be sure that that's true?
I mean, I
Hamas is a terrorist group.
Don't get me wrong.
But how do we know anything about what
they're hitting?
Given the fact
that it doesn't sound
like any of the intelligence inside Gaza
is particularly good?
Well, Jake, Israel has known
where particular parts
of Hamas's terrorist
infrastructure have been located.
They know, for example,
where rockets are fired from
and they can go back to those locations
to take out the rocket emplacements.
They know
from various forms
of intelligence collection
where certain individuals are located,
who are senior commanders in Hamas,
who are part of the bloody
and barbaric attacks
that took place against
Israel last Saturday.
So they do have information
to be able to go after specific targets,
actionable targets,
similar to the way the United States
has been able to do that.
In other places, in other contexts.
The United States has taken a very clear
stand.
It is a stand that we don't just take
in this situation,
but we've taken all along,
which is that
we stand for the rule of law.
We stand for the law of war,
we stand for the protection of civilians.
And we want to make sure
that innocent Palestinians
who have nothing to do with
Hamas, can get to safe areas
where they will be safe from bombardment
and where they will have access
to necessities like food, water,
shelter and medicine.
Well,
I mean, you say you stand
for the rule of law.
Again, Hamas is vile.
What they did eight days ago,
they're targeting civilians.
It's horrific.
But what's going on right now
is not just a punishment of Hamas.
More than 700 children
have been reportedly killed in Gaza.
And obviously,
electricity, food,
water, supplies have been cut off
by Israel to the totality of Gaza.
Obviously,
the blockade is not just by Israel,
it's by Egypt, too.
Take a listen to what Secretary
Blinken said last year
when Putin was targeting
Ukrainian infrastructure,
heat, water.
Electricity
for children,
for the elderly, for the sick.
These are President Putin's new targets.
He's hitting them hard.
This brutalization of Ukraine's.
People is barbaric.
Now, look, Israel is not Russia.
Gaza is not Ukraine.
It's a different situation.
But cutting off supplies,
cutting off heat,
cutting off water to civilians.
What's the difference?
Well, first,
thank you for saying that
Israel is not Russia,
because Israel is not Russia's, but.
Civilians are civilians.
We are civilians to civilians.
Yes, absolutely they are.
And they deserve, as I said
before, access to water
and medicine and food.
And we are working actively
to ensure that that happens.
And I can tell you this morning, Jake,
that I have been in touch
with my Israeli counterparts
just within the last hour
who report to me that they have,
in fact,
turned the water pipe
back on in southern Gaza.
That has been the subject
of discussion
over the course of the past few days.
The United States is going to continue
working with Israel, with the U.N.,
with Egypt, with Jordan,
and with a lot of the groups
on the ground
to make sure
that innocent Palestinians get access
to those basic necessities
and are protected from bombardment
because they deserve that
right, the right to those necessities
and the right to safety and security
every bit
as much as Ukrainian civilians
do or civilians anywhere do.
And the United States hasn't
made any bones about that.
We're working hard on that.
We're working to make sure
that that is the case as this unfolds.
And it's something
that has been a high priority
for President Biden,
for Secretary Blinken, and for myself.
But you're not telling the Israelis
to let the Palestinian
hospitals have power.
Our position is
that hospitals
should be able to function.
Hospitals should not be targeted.
People should be able to get access
to lifesaving medical care.
We don't qualify this statement
if we don't say that
there is some kind of caveat to them.
These are simple, clear,
declarative statements.
It is our position
that's consistent
with the law of armed conflict,
the law of war.
It's consistent with our view
as we have presented it.
And I would just say, Jake, that there's
a lot of reports in the fog of war
about things that happen.
We're not going to respond
to every one of those
because
we will seek clarity
in the appropriate way.
But we will never back off
our basic principles
and our basic proposition,
which we have made both publicly
and privately
about our view
about how civilians have to be protected.
I haven't asked you over the any
the fog of war stories.
I've seen stories
that blame Israel
for things that later on it
turns out Hamas did them.
I get it. I understand.
But we have reports
and I'm sure you have them, too,
that hundreds of the individuals
stuck in Gaza are American citizens.
You know that, too.
There are also hundreds of
thousands
of Americans in Israel
that are trying to get out also.
And the Biden administration
is doing a lot
to get those individuals out.
29 of the individuals killed
by Hamas were American.
And there are, I think
what is it like something like
40 Americans that are unaccounted for
who were maybe taken prisoner by Hamas?
But I want to talk to you
about one Palestinian-American woman
we talked to named Janine O'Connell.
She's from New Jersey.
She's got three
kids, eight two and two months.
I sent you the interview
we did with her earlier in the week.
She got to the border,
the Rafah crossing.
She can't get out.
She can't get out of Gaza
because the Egyptians
won't open the crossing.
Listen to what she told
me earlier this week.
We tried to contact the U.S.
embassy so many times.
Unfortunately, they couldn't
tell us at all.
I contacted them through the phone
via email.
I texted and I.
I called different numbers, but nobody
I couldn't hear back from any.
We are all here feeling abandoned
that and we're
feeling that we're left alone.
I don't know how many billions of dollars
we give the Egyptians every year.
Why can't you tell
President Sisi
to open the border, to let Americans out?
We have told
President Sisi to open the border,
to let Americans out.
The situation
there at the crossing
is actually more complicated.
The Egyptians have, in fact, agreed
to allow Americans
to depart to get safe
passage through the Rafah crossing.
The Israelis agreed to ensure
that the area around
there would be safe as at least
as far as they were able to do so.
The question
when we tried to move a group
yesterday was actually Hamas taking steps
to try and stop that from happening.
But we are continuing
to work this around the clock
and we are doing all that we can
to make sure
that American citizens who are in Gaza
can get through that border crossing.
Secretary Blinken, in fact,
is in Egypt today
meeting with the president of Egypt.
This is at the top of his list
to help
get those American citizens out of Gaza.
Anyone on who is a U.S.
citizen should have the right
to free passage through there
and then have the U.S.
government facilitate their travel home.
Yeah, I don't
I don't doubt that the biggest problem
in all of this Escobar's.",20231015

Former U.N.
ambassador and 2024
Republican presidential candidate
Nikki Haley joins us now.
Ambassador Haley,
thanks so much for joining us.
If you were president right
now, would you consider using the U.S.
special operations
to rescue American hostages
being held in Gaza?
You just heard Jake Sullivan say
that one of the complications with
that is
we don't know
exactly where the hostages are,
but I'm wondering how much you
would consider such a thing.
Thanks for having me, Jake.
You know,
I think it's important
you have to tell hard truth to Americans.
And and when you're talking about this,
you know,
when you show those percentages
of what people think
and what they think we should do,
you have to be honest with them.
This is messy.
Right.
I mean,
we desperately want to get
those American hostages out.
But if you saw those kids
in the hands of those terrorists,
like with a mom heart,
it made me sick to my stomach
for all those parents
having to see their children
in those terrorists hands.
So of course, we want them out.
But why is it so easy
that we can do that?
It's because we don't know
where they are.
And I have been in those tunnels
that are massive,
that are sophisticated
and that Hamas uses to hide
equipment and ammunition
and to do their dirty work
and maybe to have those hostages.
But where are those tunnels?
They're underneath hospitals.
They're underneath schools.
They're in hard to find places.
So this is incredibly tough.
I feel, for the Israeli families.
I feel for the American families,
and I feel for any other families
who've lost a loved one
or have
someone in a hostage situation,
because it's really bleak right now.
And it's hard for anyone
to feel good about this.
We just showed images that your
your office gave us of
when you visited Israel in 2017
and the IDF took you to those tunnels
near the kibbutz in as well.
You said that
because those tunnels in Gaza are near
civilian sites, it's going to get bad.
It's already pretty bad.
Obviously, there are more than
2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza.
More than half of them are children.
Do you think the U.S., Israel, Egypt
needs to be doing more
to help these innocent Palestinian
civilians get out of harm's way,
although you just heard Jake Sullivan
say one of the problems is Hamas
is keeping
the civilians in Gaza.
They don't want them to leave.
There are a couple of things at play
here.
Hamas is going to do everything
they can to not have them leave
because guess what?
They want them all to die.
One, they want to use them
as human shields,
but two, they want to blame
Israel and show
images of dead children and say,
look at what Israel did.
But don't ever forget what Hamas did.
Don't ever forget those girls
running for their life.
Don't ever forget those babies
that were killed in cribs.
Don't ever
forget the people
that they were dragging
through the streets.
And what were they saying, Jake?
They were saying death to Israel.
Death to America.
That's who we're dealing with.
But I dealt with this
at the United Nations.
You're going to hear
all of those Arab countries
vilify Israel for what's about to happen.
You're going to hear all of them say,
how dare you not do more
for the Palestinian people?
And you know what?
We should care
about the Palestinian citizens,
especially the innocent ones,
because they didn't ask for this.
But where are the Arab countries?
Where are they?
Where is Qatar?
Where is Lebanon? Where is Jordan?
Where is Egypt?
Do you know we give Egypt over
$1,000,000,000 a year.
Why aren't they opening the gates?
Why aren't they taking the Palestinians?
You know why?
Because they know
they can't vet them
and they don't want Hamas
in their neighborhood.
So why would Israel
want them in their neighborhood?
So let's be honest with what's going on.
The Arab countries aren't doing anything
to help the Palestinians
because they don't trust
who is right,
who is good,
who is evil,
and they don't want it in their country.
So they're going to come
and blame America.
They're going to come and blame Israel
and don't fall for it
because they have the ability
to fix all of this if they wanted to.
They have the ability to go in and tell
Hamas right now
to stop what they're doing.
They have the ability to tell Hamas
to let those people out.
But you know what?
Qatar is going to continue
to work with Hamas and their leadership.
Iran's going to continue
to fund all of this and not say anything.
And who's silent?
Every one of those Arab
countries are going to be silent.
But expect for the finger
to point to Israel
and the finger
is going to point to Israel, to America.
I want you to take a
listen to this statement
that Governor Ron DeSantis made about
all I guess he's talking about,
all of the 2.3 million Palestinians.
He said
this on the campaign
trail in Iowa yesterday.
If you look at how they behave,
not all of them are Hamas,
but they are all anti-Semitic.
None of them believe in Israel's
right to exist.
Now, just for our viewers, edification,
according to recent
polling earlier this year
from the Washington Institute,
which is a pro-Israel group
using the polling of a Palestinian center
for public opinion,
62% of Gazans wanted the cease fire
with Israel to stay in place.
50% of Gazans want Hamas to stop calling
for Israel's destruction.
Want Hamas
to accept a permanent two state solution
based on the 1967 borders.
70% of Gazans
wanted the Palestinians authority
from the West Bank to take over Gaza.
So I'm not really certain
that Governor DeSantis has a real read
on the difference between Hamas
and the people of Gaza.
What was your response when you heard
what Governor DeSantis said?
You know, I dealt with this
every day for two years.
And you know, what I can tell you is
you have to realize that
whether we're talking
about Gazans and Palestinians,
you know, all of them don't.
You've got half of them.
At the time that I was there
didn't want to be under Hamas's rule.
They didn't want to have terrorists
overseeing them.
They knew
that they were living a terrible life
because of Hamas.
You had the other half
that supported Hamas
and wanted to be a part of that.
We see that with Iran
to the Iranian people
don't want to be under
that Iranian regime.
They don't.
We saw what happened.
Amasa meaning we saw how they treat them.
There are so many of these people
who want to be free
from this terrorist role.
They want to be free from all of that.
And America's
always been sympathetic
to the fact that you can separate
civilians from terrorists
and that's what we have to do.
But right now,
we can never take our eyes
off of the terrorists.
I mean, what Hamas did
was beyond thuggish, brutal and sick.
What the Iranian regime
is doing to help them is terrible.
But let's look back at what did Biden do.
Biden turned around and fell
all over himself
to get into the Iran deal.
Obama did it before that.
You gave all of this money
and what did you do?
You empowered
Iran to go
and strengthen Hamas,
strengthen Hezbollah, strengthen
the Houthis
to spread their terrorist activity.
We went and strengthened those sanctions
and decimated Iran's economy.
And what happened?
Biden has loosened the sanctions.
Now we've got the fact that he gave
6 billion and hostage money.
Okay, now you've frozen it.
But we have all these American hostages.
Guess what they're going to want?
If you gave them 6 billion
for five people and released hostages,
guess what?
They're going to be asking
for all these others that we have.
So we've created this scenario
where you've given Iran,
the Iranian regime,
too much power
and too much Poland
to be able to do this.
We've got to be strong.
We've got to have Israel's back.
And remember,
as awful as these images are,
and we have the back of Israel
because they've been hit terribly.
We have to have the back of them
when they hit back as well.
So speaking of having Israel's back,
I want you to take a
listen to what Donald Trump
had to say
about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu a few days ago.
He has
been hurt very badly
because of what's happened here.
He was not prepared.
He was not prepared
and Israel was not prepared.
And under Trump,
they wouldn't have had it be prepared.
He went on to call Hezbollah,
which the U.S.
classifies as a terrorist group,
very smart.
He called the defense minister a jerk
and he went on and on.
This was, I think, Wednesday.
So four days
after the deadliest day
for the Jewish people
since the Holocaust.
What was your response
when you heard that?
It's why I continue to say
it is time for a new generational leader.
We've got to get past
the headlines of the past.
I mean, look,
he congratulated
the Chinese Communist Party
not too long ago.
He's saying Hezbollah is smart.
I can tell you at the United Nations
when I was there
and I dealt with all of them every day,
you don't go and compliment
any of them,
because what that does is
that makes America look weak.
It doesn't make America look strong.
It doesn't make America
have friends with them.
What you do is you show strength.
You let them know what we expect of them.
So complimenting Hezbollah
and going
and complimenting
the Chinese Communist Party
or criticize
a leader
who has just watched
so many of his citizens
brutally murdered,
it's the wrong place at the wrong time.
This isn't about Trump.
It's not about him.
It's not about what happened in the past.
We've got to look forward.
This is going to be tough days ahead
for everyone involved.
This is not the time to sit there
and bash a leader.
This is a time to sit there
and give him the support he needs,
Give the Israeli people
the support they need
and to help us get through this
in the best way possible.
Before you go,
the House still doesn't have a speaker.
For the first time in American history.
This is nearly two weeks after Kevin
McCarthy was stripped of his leadership.
They still can't even pass a resolution
condemning the Hamas attacks.
It's starting to look like
there is not one House
Republican who can get 217 votes.
Republican Congressman Austin Scott said
the chaos, quote,
makes us look like a bunch of
idiots, unquote. Is he right?
Well, I'll tell you, what's right
is under the Biden
administration, we've seen chaos within.
You can't blame the fact that you.
Can't blame that on Biden.
You can't blame this on Biden.
No, you.
Well, you have to let me finish.
We have seen chaos with inflation.
We've seen chaos
with the lack of transparency
in education.
We've seen chaos on the border.
We've seen chaos
with crime on the streets.
And now we're seeing chaos
around the world.
What I'm saying is
you can't fix Democrat chaos
with Republican chaos.
They need to get it together.
They need to get in a room
and figure out who this is going to be
and come out unified.
That's what Republicans need to do.
This is not a good look.
This is not good for our country.
We saw what happened to Israel
when they were distracted.
America looks so distracted right now.
When America is distracted,
the world is less safe.
We can't sit there
and act like this is September 10th.
We better get it together
and remember what it felt
like September 12th,
because we've got
a lot of threats around us
and a lot of chaos around us.
And we need some strength.
We need some stability.
And again,
I'll say we need a new generational
leader to right this ship.",20231015

in studio is Israeli
ambassador to the United States,
Michael Herzog.
Before I start, of course,
I want to offer my deepest condolences
to the Israeli people
about what happened eight days ago.
Just a horrific, horrific attack,
a terrorist attack.
I think I speak for
for all of my viewers
and everybody at CNN when I say
our hearts are just broken
by what happened.
Thank you very much.
I really appreciate.
The
the this ground incursion
that we expect in the next.
Do we? Do we.
Can you give me any sort of
sense of timing?
Let's next week.
I know you have 300,000
reservists on the border.
And is it an operation
to rid Hamas
of its military
capabilities, its terrorist capabilities,
or is it an operation
to destroy Hamas completely?
So, as you noted, Israel was attacked.
Hamas waged war on Israel
and they carried out
one of the worst
terror attacks in world history,
if not the worst.
And we have no choice but to strike back.
And we are determined
to destroy the Hamas
war machine
so that they cannot threaten us again.
We do not want to be in that game where
every few years
they launch war against us or provoke us.
That's over.
And we are determined
to destroy the war machine.
We are preparing a ground operation.
I'm not going to go into details
and timetables and all that,
but we are at war
and we're going to fight that war.
And what is the plan
for after you accomplish the objective?
What does the end state
after the operation look like?
Will Israel reoccupying the Gaza Strip?
Will any
Palestinians who fled Gaza
be allowed back in?
So we have no desire to occupy
or re-occupy Gaza.
We have no desire
to rule over the lives of over
2 million Palestinians
and certainly
want people to go back to their homes
or talking about innocent civilians.
And we are doing everything we can
to keep them out of harm's way.
Well, Hamas is doing everything
it can to keep them in harm's way.
That's a situation we are at.
I think talking about the day
after is a bit premature because
crushing the Hamas war
machine will require time.
And the question you raise are valid.
And I think
we will have to enter discussions
with our partners,
with the international community about
the day after.
Haaretz editorial this
week said, quote, Israel's
most urgent task is to bring back
the Israelis
held by Hamas and Islamic
Jihad in the Gaza Strip.
And they point out
that your finance minister,
Bezalel Smotrich, reportedly argued in a
in a cabinet
meeting for Israel to, quote,
strike Hamas brutally
and not take the issue of the captives
into account too much.
And what Haaretz is arguing is, why not?
Why isn't the
why aren't the captives
why aren't the kidnaping victims
the number one priority?
Well, certainly
the issue of the kidnaped
Israelis and others is
is very much it's high on our agenda.
We are well aware
that we're still in the process
of forming a picture, understanding
how many people are there,
what is their condition,
what is their identity.
And certainly this is a consideration.
I don't want to comment about
statements by this or that politician.
All we say is that Hamas perpetrated
a war
crime and crimes against humanity
and taking hostages
and that we hold them accountable
to any harm that comes to
any of the hostages.
Hamas is claiming
that Israeli airstrikes have killed
at least 13 of the hostages in Gaza.
Do you have any idea if that's true?
I don't know.
I would be very careful
about what they say.
There's a lot of misinformation
and propaganda there.
And so I would be very careful and take
I would take what they say
with a grain of salt.
You said a week ago
it was premature to discuss
any deals for exchanging hostages.
Has that changed?
Is there any discussion about any
any prisoner swaps, hostage swaps?
We're not in that phase.
And as I said, we're in the middle of war
and we still have to know
how many hostages there are
and what is their condition.
So you obviously distinguish
between Hamas
and the 2.3 million Palestinians,
many of whom are prisoners of Hamas
in Gaza.
Israel has warned the 1.1 million
in northern Gaza to evacuate.
And and the U.S.
officials, the U.S.
has even said that's a tall order.
The U.N.
has said it's impossible
to get them all out.
What's the latest
on these humanitarian corridors
and letting the innocent victims of
of Hamas in many ways get out?
So I'm glad you asked the question.
Our enemy is Hamas.
It's not the Palestinian people.
It's not the innocent civilians.
Many of them are dying
because of Israeli bombardment.
They are used by Hamas as human shields.
That's why we call on them
to leave their homes,
because as we intense
intensify the war against Hamas and Hamas
war machine,
we don't want to harm any civilians.
And we ask them to move
to the south of Gaza from us.
In contrast,
asking them to stay
is forcing them to stay.
Right there, setting a blockade.
They are conscious, they confiscating
car keys and so on. We see all that.
They want to use them as human shields.",20231015
2FHmHpe2P6o,Military analyst: Hamas is losing the second phase of their plan already,data/en_CNN\Military analyst Hamas is losing the second phase of their plan already.jpg,"also one of the worst terrorist
attacks on the American people
in recent times as well.
&gt;&gt; Joining me now is CNN
military analyst general Wesley
Clark.
So general, first I'm gonna
talk to you about what's going
on at the border, but before
that, can you just talk about
the significance of these two
very important U.S. Naval
carriers, going into the region,
and what is it's meant to do?
&gt;&gt; Those two aaft carriers
and the flotilla that goes with
him, you have about 20 ships,
you have a tremendous capacity
for not only aircraft on each
acre craft carrier, but the
escorts, and what they can do
in the way of tomahawk missiles,
and other things.
And so, there is a warning,
they're there is a deterrent to
Iran.
Keep your hands off, stay out
of it, or else.
Because the general thinking is
that, Hezbollah is not going to
go --
without Iran saying go ahead.
This ties Iran in directly into
the assault.
On the other hand, you can be
sure that Iran is watching
this.
They're calculating, they're
wondering whether the Israelis
are going to get so bogged down
in gaza, be so --
tarnished in world opinion,
that they could justify
releasing Hezbollah, and go for
the finish of Israel.
There is going to be that kind
of thinking going on, in
Tehran.
Those two aircraft carriers are
really important to stop that
kind of thought.
&gt;&gt; You want --
it is a deterrence.
We have definitely heard some
this morning, in interviews,
not ruling out the notion of
U.S. Troops being involved.
I think it's important to put
that into context.
Certainly does not seem as
though the U.S. Is going to get
involved in a very active way
with U.S. Troops in this
conflicts.
The discuss it is --
about how to get American
hostages out.
&gt;&gt; That's right, and I'm sure
we've got a joint plan going on
with Israelis.
If we could locate the hostages,
if it's possible to pull off an
extraction mission, sure we
would work with the Israelis to
do that.
There's also the possibility of
those U.S. Forces in the north
actually having to engage,
should Hezbollah decide to
launch its hundred 50,000
rockets against Israel.
And Iran should be under no
illusions.
Those ships are not just there
for show, those ships are ready
to go and on the presidential
order they could go.
As president Biden said, we're
100 percent committed to Israel
were not going to allow the
destruction of Israel.
&gt;&gt; I really want to get your
perspective on what is
happening inside gaza.
And Thea that, according to
the white house, hamas, they're
the ones who stopped Americans
from getting into Egypt, via
the rafah border crossing.
We're talking about
Palestinians, we're talking in
this case about Americans who
are inside gaza.
These are civilians.
What does it tell you, first of
all, that crossing was closed,
and what is your sense of why
this really happened.
We're showing our viewers a map
of the area we're talking
about.
Now &gt;&gt; Dana, we look at this a
as a two phase --
show how powerful you are, and
then fall back into gaza, and
use civilian population as a
shield, and then attack Israel
on the stage of world opinion,
and cause Israel to look like
an evil force that is anti
humanitarian.
What's happening right now is
that hamas is losing the second
phase already, before the
fighting is even started,
violence of people there are
getting out of the way.
Hamas may be trying to keep
them in position, but hamas is
failing to do that, they are
evacuating the northern area.
Despite hamas roadblocks --
on a main evacuation route,
that looks like something
engineered by hamas to
intimidate its own people.
Their view is that those people,
they're just human shields.
They're collateral, they don't
care about those people, what
they're interested in is the
destruction of Israel, and so
the poor people in gaza,,
they're not all hamas.
There are innocent people
there.
They need to be protected too.
And the United States --
hamas needs to be eliminated,
and that's what the Israeli
objective is going to be
eventually.
In this phase, it's already
underway, hamas is losing
control of the population, and
that's a huge loss for hamas.
&gt;&gt; Just to underscore, we're at
a time, but just to underscore
what you said, which is that
hamas with, just for speed the
leadership of gaza, is trying
to prevent innocent civilians
from getting out of harm's way.
And getting out of a war zone,
because I think it helps them,
in the propaganda war.
It's really important to talk",20231015
GI0810gD6Eg,Fareed shares what the 'severest setback' would be for Hamas now,data/en_CNN\Fareed shares what the 'severest setback' would be for Hamas now.jpg,"Here's my take.
Hamas's brutal
and inhuman attack on Israel last week
took the world by surprise.
Most importantly, and tragically,
it took the Israeli government
by surprise,
which meant a
delayed response
to the slaughter of its civilians.
But this was no black swan event.
Instead, as the scholar Amy Zegart notes,
it was a white swan,
something utterly predictable.
This is the sixth war between
Israel and Hamas in Gaza
over the last 15 years.
Israel controls
air, land and sea access to the Strip.
Israeli intelligence is supposed to have
an extensive network
of informants in Gaza.
So what happened?
We'll need time
to reach a full assessment.
But it does appear that
the Netanyahu government
was so focused
on judicial overhaul at home
and the Saudi deal abroad
that it ignored
the possibility of an upheaval in Gaza.
Despite allegedly receiving warnings
from Egypt.
Professor
Dimitri Chomsky
of Hebrew
University writes more provocatively
that for years, Netanyahu developed
and advanced
a destructive, warped
political doctrine
that held that strengthening Hamas
at the expense
of the Palestinian Authority
would be good for Israel.
This approach
divided the Palestinians, undermined
the Palestinian Authority
in the West Bank,
and made it easy for Netanyahu to claim
there was no path to a Palestinian state.
Chomsky cites a Jerusalem Post report
that at a Likud Party meeting in 2019,
Netanyahu made clear
that he supported the money
that the Qatari government
was sending to Hamas.
That way, Bibi is reported
to have said
Israel would foil
the establishment of a Palestinian state.
Tal Schneider
references the same meeting
and also notes
that most of the time
Israel policy was to treat
the Palestinian Authority
as a burden and Hamas as an asset.
Like Israel's
current finance minister once asserted,
the Netanyahu
government was pursuing
a policy
premised on the notion
that it could ignore
the Palestinian issue
and make a deal directly
with the Gulf Arabs
who were increasingly nervous
about Iran's rise in the region
and eager to tie up with Israel's
booming, technology driven economy.
The assumptions
behind that strategy exploded last week,
but there is a broader backdrop
for last week's terror attack.
For the last two decades,
the Middle East has been shaped
by Washington's actions,
above all, by the Iraq war
and the subsequent withdrawal
of American power.
The war upset the delicate balance
between Iran and the Arabs
and the Shiites and the Sunnis.
When the US toppled Saddam Hussein's
Sunni dominated government in Baghdad,
Iran gained
unprecedented influence in Iraq,
which is majority Shia.
Then began
the American retreat from the Middle East
which left a vacuum in the region
and to which many players entered
Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Russia
and Israel
each trying to promote its own interests.
We think of the
world as
having been reasonably stable
for these last two decades
until Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine
But that is not true of the Middle East,
where the last two decades
have been particularly bloody.
Hundreds of thousands died in Iraq.
Then came the Syrian civil war,
which displaced
more than 14 million people
and killed
still more hundreds of thousands.
That was followed by a war in Yemen,
which quickly became the worst
humanitarian crisis in the world.
And in all of these crises and conflicts,
regional players have picked sides
trying to maximize their advantages
and bleed their foes.
We're seeing a worldwide contest
between the forces of order and disorder.
Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas
are trying to erode
the international system.
If Hamas
succeeds, it will encourage others,
Hezbollah, the Houthis,
to flex their muscles as well.
Defeating Hamas is a daunting challenge.
That terrorist group
is hoping
for a massive Israeli overreaction
that produces thousands
of civilian casualties
and bogs down Israeli troops.
Hamas is also hoping for the collapse
of any possible deal with Saudi Arabia.
The more brutal Israel's response,
the more likely it is
that that deal will collapse.
Israel's goal should be to respond
to Hamas
deal with the Palestinian issue
in the way
that still allows
for the resumption of negotiations
on Saudi normalization.
That is the strategic prize.
The establishment of normal relations
between Israel and Saudi
Arabia would be the severest setback
for Hamas Hezbollah and Iran.
One lesson is clear
the United States cannot walk away
from the Middle East entirely.
It can forswear military interventions
and it can recognize
the centrality of Asia.
But it needs to remain politically
and diplomatically active in the region.
American engagement
is a stabilizing force in the world.
For those unconvinced.

ON THE WAR BETWEEN ISRAEL AND
HAMAS IN A SWEEPING INTERVIEW
WITH ""60 MINUTES.""
HE TOUCHED ON BRINGING THE
AMERICAN HOSTAGES HOME AND
WHETHER U.S. TROOPS COULD BE
SENT INTO COMBAT.
ALSO TALK ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN
CORRIDOR IN GAZA AND HIS MESSAGE
TO HEZBOLLAH.
&gt;&gt; WE'LL TO EVERYTHING IN OUR
POWER TO FIND THOSE WHO ARE
STILL ALIVE AND SET THEM FREE.
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER.
AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO
DETAIL OF THAT, BUT WE'RE
WORKING LIKE HELL ON IT.
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU FORESEE U.S. TROOPS
IN COMBAT IN THIS NEW MIDDLE
EAST WAR?
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THAT IS
NECESSARY.
ISRAEL HAS ONE OF THE FINEST
FIGHTING FORCES IN THE COUNTRY.
I GUARANTEE WE'LL PROVIDE THEM
EVERYTHING THEY NEED.
&gt;&gt; YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE A
HUMANITARIAN CORRIDOR THAT
ALLOWS SOME OF THE 2 MILLION
GAZA STNS OUT OF THE AREA?
&gt;&gt; YES.
&gt;&gt; YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE
HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES BROUGHT
INTO GAZA.
&gt;&gt; YES.
&gt;&gt; SO YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE
ISRAELI TOTAL SIEGE OF THE GAZA
STRIP?
&gt;&gt; I'M CONFIDENT THAT ISRAEL
WILL ACT UNDER THE RULES OF WAR.
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU SUPPORT ISRAELI
OCCUPATION OF GAZA AT THIS
POINT?
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A
BIG MISTAKE.
&gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE HAMAS MUST BE
ELIMINATED ENTIRELY?
&gt;&gt; YES, I DO.
BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE A
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, THERE
NEEDS TO BE A PATH TO A
PALESTINIAN STATE.
&gt;&gt; I WONDER WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE
TO HEZBOLLAH AND ITS BACKER
IRAN.
&gt;&gt; DON'T.
DON'T, DON'T, DON'T.
&gt;&gt; DON'T COME ACROSS THE BORDER,
DON'T ESCALATE THE WAR.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; CHRISTIAN AMANPOUR IS LIVE IN
LONDON WITH MORE.
AND OBVIOUSLY THEY TRY TO DO
WITH WORDS EVERYTHING THEY CAN
TO AVOID A LARGER WAR.
BUT NONETHELESS BIDEN SAYING
THAT WHILE HAMAS MUST BE
ELIMINATED, REOCCUPYING GAZA
WOULD BE A MISTAKE.
HOW DO YOU READ BETWEEN THE
LINES HERE OF WHAT HE IS SAYING
BUT MOST IMPORTANT WHAT ISRAEL
AND ITS ENEMIES ARE HEARING?
&gt;&gt; THERE AREN'T ANY LINES TO
READ.
WE DON'T KNOW AND NOR DID THE
ISRAELIS OR AMERICANS KNOW WHAT
THE FINAL END GAME IS.
WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU DESTROY
AND D
DEC
DECEMBER A MATE HAMAS.
WHAT IS THE FINAL END GAME.
WIDER WAR THAT THE UNITED STATES
IS TRYING TO HEAD OFFA MATE HAM.
WHAT IS THE FINAL END GAME.
WIDER WAR THAT THE UNITED STATES
IS TRYING TO HEAD OFF WITH THE
SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY, THAT IS ALSO
A REAL PROBLEM.
WHAT HAPPENS.
HE SAID DON'T WHEN ASKED ABOUT
HAMAS -- RATHER HEZBOLLAH AND
IRAN.
IRAN'S FOREIGN MINISTER MEETING
WITH HAMAS, HAVING BEEN ALSO TO
MEET WITH HEZBOLLAH, HAS
BASICALLY NOW SAID THAT IRAN
WILL NOT STAND IDLY BY IF THE
AIRSTRIKES AGAINST PALESTINIANS
CONTINUE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
THE UNITED STATES -- ISRAEL
RATHER HAS ALREADY BOMBED AIR
STRIPS IN SYRIA IN DAMASCUS AND
ALLEPO AND THERE ARE CONSTANT
SKIRMISHES ACROSS THE BORDER.
ISRAEL HAS NOT SAID THAT IT SEES
A SMOKING GUN FROM IRAN.
CLEARLY NOBODY WANTS TO GET INTO
THAT KIND OF WAR.
AND THEN ON THE HUMANITARIAN
SIDE, THIS IS ALSO HUGELY
COMPLEX BECAUSE, YES, IT IS
CLOSED TO ALL INTENTS AND
PURPOSE, BUT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING
TO ARAB LEADERS WHO ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT A, QUOTE, E
EXODUS, WHERE ARE ALL THESE
PALES
PALESTINIANS BEING PUSHED.
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE
PALESTINIANS PUSHED PERMANENTLY
OUT OF GAZA AND THEN POTENTIALLY
NEVER BEING ALLOWED TO COME
BACK.
THEY ALSO DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT
AS A PRECEDENT, WHAT HAPPENS IF
CERTAIN ISRAELIS, THE RIGHT
WINGERS WHO HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT
FOR INSTANCE JORDAN IS A
PALESTINIAN HOMELAND, THEY DON'T
WANT TO SEE THAT KIND OF PROCESS
HAPPENING IN THE WEST BANK.
SO THIS IS HUGELY COMPLICATED
RIGHT NOW AND NOT AS SIMPLE --
WELL, CLEARY NOT SIMPLE, BUT
JUST THE IDEA OF HUMANITARIAN
CORRIDORS IS ALSO VERY, VERY
COMPLEX.
&gt;&gt; AND TRY DEVOCAL CRITICISM OF
CIVILIAN SITUATION THIS GAZA
FROM THE KING OF JORDAN AND AS
WELL AS THE LEADER OF EGYPT
MAKING IT CLEAR HOW THEY FEEL
THERE.
BUT ANTONY BLINKEN JUST CAME
BACK HERE AND HE IS MEETING WITH
THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER.
NO ONE HAD EXPECTED HIM TO COME
BACK.
HE WAS HERE LAST WEEK AND IT WAS
ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT THAT HE
WOULD RETURN.
THE QUESTION WAS WHAT IS HE
RETURNING FOR, WAS HE RETURNING
TO GET NETANYAHU TO PAUSE OR TO
CONSIDER OR PULL BACK OR IS HE
SIMPLY COMING TO ASSIST IN
NEGOTIATIONS OVER BORDER
CROSSINGS.
WE WILL HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE
FROM THEM IN A FEW MOMENTS, BUT
DO YOU REALLY THINK IS HAPPENING
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS?
&gt;&gt; I THINK ALL OF THE ABOVE
FRANKLY.
THE UNITED STATES IS TRYING TO
KEEP IT FROM SPILLING OVER.
IT HAS TO SUPPORT ISRAEL'S RIGHT
TO SELF-DEFENSE, BUT IT WANTS TO
MAKE SURE IF IT IS AT ALL
POSSIBLE TO KEEP IT TO WITHIN
CERTAIN PARAMETERS.
ALSO, YOU KNOW, THE UNITED
STATES IS IMPLICATED, IT IS
INVOLVED BECAUSE 29 AT LEAST OF
ITS CITIZENS HAVE BEEN KILLED
AND THERE ARE APPARENTLY
POTENTIALLY ISRAELI AMERICAN
HOSTAGES.
SO THE U.S. IS ABSOLUTELY
INVOLVED.
BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE CAUTIONING,
YOU KNOW, THE U.S. WAS ASKED
WOULD THEY PUT BOOTS ON THE
GROUND AND BIDEN SAID DON'T
THINK IT IS NECESSARY.
THEY ARE SENDING STRIKE FORCES.
WHAT FOR, IS THAT FOR COVER,
WHAT IS IT FOR.
AND JUST GO BACK ALL THE WAY TO
1983 WHEN THE U.S. SENT WARSHIPS
OUTSIDE LEBANON AND IN SUPPORT
OF ISRAEL, WAS INVOLVED IN THAT
WAR AND IT HAD A TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE BACKLASH AGAINST THE
UNITED STATES.
MASSIVE KILLINGS AT THE BARRACKS
IN BEIRUT AND ON AND ON AND ON.
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF REALLY
SERIOUS ANTI-AMERICAN BACKLASH
IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD.
SO THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED AS
WELL.
&gt;&gt; AND ALSO THE HOSTAGES.
LAST NIGHT, HE DID POINT OUT IN
THE ""60 MINUTES"" INTERVIEW
SAYING NO NEED FOR U.S. TROOP ON
THE GROUND.
OF COURSE JOHN KIRBY HAD LEFT IT
ON THE TABLE THAT WHEN IT COMES
TO U.S. HOSTAGES, WE WON'T TAKE
ANYTHING OFF THE TABLE IF YOU
NEED U.S. MILITARY POWER
INVOLVED IN THAT.
NOT TAKING IT OFF THE TABLE IS
NOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO
DO IT, BUT NONETHELESS THERE IS
STILL THAT UNCERTAINTY.
YOU HAVE AMERICANS BEING HELD
HOSTAGE AND THAT IS A WHOLE NEW
THING HERE.
&gt;&gt; IT IS.
AND AS I SAY, THOSE HOSTAGE
SITUATIONS, MOSTLY STARTED BACK
THERE IN LEBANON AFTER A
CERTAIN, YOU KNOW, AFTER WHAT I
TOLD YOU ABOUT.
THE THING IS, THE HOSTAGES
ACCORDING TO ISRAELI EXPERTS AND
FORMER HOSTAGE NEGOTIATORS AND
IDF PEOPLE, THEY WILL NOT BE
ABLE TO BE, YOU KNOW, RELEASED
OR FOUND WITHOUT A GROUND
INCURSION.
IT IS ONLY ON THE GROUND THAT
YOU CAN GET TO THOSE HOSTAGES.
YOU ALREADY HAD A DISCUSSION
ABOUT THE PARAMETERS ADDRESS
DA --
AND DANGERS OF THAT.
IF IT IS TRUE THAT SOME OF THOSE
HOSTAGES HAVE ALREADY BEEN
KILLED IN AIRSTRIKES, AND WE
HAVEN'T HAD CONFIRMATION, BUT
THAT IS WHAT HAMAS HAS SAID, IS
ISRAEL'S FIRST PRIORITY TO SAVE
THE HOSTAGES OR IS ITS FIRST --
AND I'M TALKING ABOUT IN A
GROUND INCURSION.
OR IS IT TO DECIMATE HAMAS.

71K-V7Du_FE,Exclusive: CNN meets Israeli troops as tensions rise on Lebanon border,data/en_CNN\Exclusive CNN meets Israeli troops as tensions rise on Lebanon border.jpg,"Over the last
24 hours or
so, there has been intensifying exchanges
of fire between
Israel and Hezbollah
militants that operate inside Lebanon.
Hezbollah is
a terrorist organization
that gets support from Iran,
but operates as a quasi
governmental force, really
inside the borders of Lebanon.
They've been going back
and forth with Israel
over the last seven days.
United Nations peacekeepers
who operate inside
southern Lebanon
say that their headquarters
were hit by a wayward rocket.
Luckily, no one was hurt there.
But it gives you
a sense of the situation
along that border with Israel now
saying that people who live
within two kilometers of that border
should evacuate.
28 villages concern.
Our Matthew Chance is in northern Israel,
not far from that border right now.
Matthew, give us the situation
a very tense situation up
here, close to the Lebanese border here.
Right
within the past
few hours,
the Israeli military has ordered 28
Israeli communities to evacuate
from their
positions very close to that frontier
with Lebanon.
And so that's in process now.
And that follows
a string of cross-border attacks
that have been taking place
over the course of the past 24 hours,
or in fact, even longer than that.
But nine rocket attacks
according to
the Israeli Defense Forces
over the course of the past 24 hours.
They've responded to that
with air strikes and artillery strikes,
some of which we can hear
are being launched
from very close
to this location here,
close to the Lebanese border.
We were also able, though,
to gain some access to that exclusion
zone close to the border.
It's actually four kilometers,
about two and a half miles
back from the border
that they've now said is off limits
to Israeli civilians.
They gave us access and showed us
where
the basically that the front lines were.
It's also the place, remember,
which could really turn this conflict
inside Israel into a much broader
regional war.
And so it's a very dangerous
sort of tipping point here
in northern Israel.
Still,
all the civilians that we talk
we talked to most of them, at least
the soldiers, the politicians
that I've been in contact with as well.
They are so enraged,
so angry at what happened
in Gaza last weekend that they say
they are ready, even bristling
for a fight with Hezbollah.
Take a listen to what one
Israeli commander told me right
close to the Lebanese border.
Are you hopeful still that
Hezbollah will stay out of this war?
I hope there will be another front.
We need to destroy Hezbollah.
You hope there will be another front.
You want the war?
Yes. Why?
What Hamas did in Gaza,
it didn't come from nowhere.
It came from Hezbollah.
It came from Iran.
And in order for us to stop
what happened from Hamas,
we need to stop them also.
Yeah, John.
And the big difference
now, of course, is that for some reason,
the Israeli military were not ready
during the Gaza attacks.
They are very ready up here
in the north of the country.
Matthew was really extraordinary
to see him pointing right there.
It gives you a sense
of how close they are.
He was merely
just pointing a little bit north
to where
Hezbollah operates
with these extremely powerful
and well-trained militias.
Matthew Chance
in northern Israel, please stay safe.
U.S.
Secretary of State
Tony Blinken is back in Israel Today,
he's been in the region traveling
all throughout the region.
For days now.
We're standing by to see
if Blinken will speak to reporters
this hour.
A critical update
potentially coming from him,
given the news
that you just reported, John.
The IDF offered
this also a sobering update
on the hostages
taken by Hamas terrorists.
They now
believe 199 people are being held hostage
by Hamas in Gaza.
They've also said over the weekend
that some
may have been killed in transit,
if you will,
during the trip from Israel into Gaza.
Sara Sidner is right now in Haifa,
Israel, where U.S.
evacuations are underway. Hey, Sara.
Hey, Kate and John.
It's good to see you guys there.
Safe and sound.
We are safe and sound at the moment.
Here in Haifa,
Israel, where we have
just watched in the last 2 hours.
A huge ship
taking away Americans
out of the danger zone and to Cyprus.
We'll get to that in just a minute.
But first,
I want to go to our Jeremy Diamond,
who has been tracking the whereabouts
and and the conversations
that Anthony Blinken
has been having
the secretary of state here
for the second time in just a week
as Israel prepares
for a potential ground war with Gaza.
And as this war rages on.
What can you tell us,
Jeremy, about the plans here?
What Secretary Blinken is doing back here
again, why it was so important
for him to show up in this country
a second time in
such a short amount of time
Well, Sarah, just to give
you a sense
of how fluid
the situation on the ground is right
now, the secretary,
even the reporter is traveling
with the secretary of state,
really haven't had a clear sense
of exactly
who he's been meeting with and when,
although we did just get a readout
from the secretary of state spokesman
that he did indeed meet with the Israeli
prime minister
as well as the presidents
of Israel, Isaac Herzog.
And in these readouts,
we don't have a ton of details,
but it's clear
what the focus of these discussions is
It is the release of those hostages
being held in Gaza.
And it is, of course,
the situation regarding humanitarian aid
being able to flow into Gaza
and having Americans
who are trapped
in Gaza be able to exit southward
and into Egypt.
Over the last
several days,
there has been a lot of finger pointing,
a lot of conflicting information
concerning
when or whether that Rafah
crossing between Gaza and Egypt
might indeed open.
The Egyptian officials
have blamed the Israelis at time.
At times.
And there's been a lot of
conflicting information.
US embassy officials
telling Americans inside of Gaza
to head for that crossing,
expecting it to open.
But as of yet,
we have not seen any evidence
that that crossing has indeed open.
So the question is
whether at the end of this day,
as the secretary of state concludes
a series of meetings
with Israeli officials,
whether we will be in a place
where humanitarian aid
will start flowing into Gaza,
and whether those Americans
and perhaps other civilians
will be able to exit Gaza and into Egypt.
Amid all of this,
we also have the Israeli prime
minister inviting
President Joe Biden to come visit Israel
The president
so far not confirming
whether or not
he intends to visit Israel.
But we do know that today
he was scheduled
to take a trip to Colorado.
He canceled that trip at the last minute
staying at the White House
instead for what
they are describing
as national security meetings,
whether that is a prelude
to a presidential visit here to Israel.
We do not yet know.
But of course, the situation
on the ground remains extremely fluid.
We just had sirens
nearby here in Jerusalem, rockets
being fired in central Israel.
And all of this, again,
amid preparations by Israel
for a potential ground invasion. Sara,
Jared Diamond,
you have been so great on this story.
Thank you so much for breaking that down
for us.
Another important
meeting between the U.S.
secretary of state
and many of the leadership here
in Israel.
I do want to mention
why I'm here and why I'm
where I am in Haifa.
We are about 85
miles from the Lebanon border
where there have been rockets
that have come over,
but far, far, far fewer than
what has come out of Gaza, shot by Hamas
here, rockets coming over the border
because of Hezbollah,
a sworn enemy of Israel's.
But for the most part,
it has been quiet here in the north.
But what has also happened
is that the United States
has been getting so many inquiries
from Americans
who can't simply get out of Israel
during wartime,
many of them with children
who are concerned about their safety,
both mentally and physically.
Finally, the United States
was able to charter an enormous ship
that left from this port
a couple of hours ago.
And on it were American families
who had been stuck here for days
as the war raged on, unable to leave
because there aren't enough flights
those flights are very sparse
and almost all of them
are completely packed, leaving Israel.
So this was one way
to try to get hundreds of Americans
out of Israel.
They just took this.
They are currently in the water
on a ten hour travel time to Cyprus,
which is where they will get off
and be able to book their flights
back to the United States.
We spoke to several families
about why they came.
Many of them live here in Israel.
They are American citizens
who have chosen to live here in Israel.
Some of them have been helping
troops on the border
with Lebanon, taking them supplies,
trying to do their part
for the war effort.
But but many just said, look,
it is time for us
to get our kids to safety
and to
calm the nerves of our family members
who have been watching all this from
the United States. Take a listen.
U.S.
citizens and the U.S.
embassy made it pretty
easy to have a way.
And if for some reason
the borders are closed, we'll swim back
Becky.
All right. So you heard that.
She also said, look, we are coming back
and all of them said the same thing.
We will be back in Israel.
We consider this our home as well.
No matter how long it takes,
we will be back here
to this country,
a country that they love as
much as the United States.",20231016

All business
from the US
Secretary of State
Antony Blinken, meeting with the Israeli
Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant.
Did not take questions,
did not say much of anything.
Other than the U.S.
is firmly behind Israel as it prepares
seemingly for a ground operation
into Gaza.
Let's get straight to Israel, where CNN's
Nic Robertson is.
Nic, what is the latest
on the ground at this hour?
It's been a relatively quiet day
in terms of rocket strikes,
missiles, artillery going into Gaza
and not many missiles
coming out of Gaza either.
It creates the impression
that they're not a pause,
but at least
ammunition in the
in the amount of military activity
to perhaps
give some space
to some of the political discussions.
I said that
and you heard the explosion behind me.
Yes.
The afternoon has become
increasingly punctuated
by heavy explosions.
That does sound like
a missile strike landing on Gaza there.
And perhaps as we go into darkness,
I think we're beginning to see
perhaps a little
uptick in the tempo here.
This is
northern Gaza
right behind me
that we know that in northern Gaza
late today,
the IDF said that
they hit a Hamas commander
appearing to destroy a building,
taking him out, if you will.
And along this border area,
we're seeing that continued buildup
and preparations among the IDF
in readiness for the possibility
of a ground incursion.
Now, I don't know how this may affect
the military operations,
but there was a very, very heavy
rainstorm passed through here
earlier today.
But from a UN
and humanitarian perspective,
inside Gaza, rainstorms
are the last thing they need.
Half a million people
understood to have left northern Gaza.
There isn't enough shelter for them
in the south of Gaza.
Isn't enough food, isn't enough water.
So real concerns
if the weather does deteriorate more
and this more rainstorms,
a lot of civilians inside Gaza
not only trying to dodge missiles,
but will also be caught out in
some atrocious conditions.
Just a
absolutely terrible situation
and of course, as soon as you say
that it's been quiet,
we heard
the airstrikes behind you
as darkness has fallen
where you are on the border, near
the border between Israel and Gaza.
Thank you so much for that report, Nic.
And I want to now go to Jerusalem
and CNN's Jeremy Diamond.
Jeremy,
I know you have been following
and doing
reporting on what
the secretary of state,
Antony Blinken, has been doing,
not just in Israel where you are.
He is now back,
but also the frantic shuttle diplomacy.
He has been engaged in across the region
Yeah.
Then between Secretary of State
Tony Blinken's visit to Israel
last week
and his visit today,
he visited about a half dozen
Arab countries in the region, countries
ranging from Saudi
Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, Egypt,
Qatar, etc.
And all of this
in a shuttle diplomacy
effort focused on several key lines,
the first of which
is the humanitarian situation
inside of Gaza,
trying to get the flow of aid
back into to Gaza
as well as allowing Americans
to be able to leave
through the Rafah
crossing and go into Egypt.
In addition to that,
the secretary of state also focused on
trying to prevent this Hamas
Israel conflict
from blowing up into a wider war.
And then, of course,
there is the issue of those 199 hostages
being held inside of Gaza,
of which
at least 20 of whom
are believed to be American citizens.
Now, we know that
the secretary of state today
met with the Israeli
Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,
as well as the Israeli presidents
and the defense minister.
We just saw the secretary of state
with the defense minister,
where Blinken
effectively reiterated
the US commitment
to the state of Israel to its right.
And what he said is also its obligation
to defend itself.
But one thing became very clear
in this visit today
is that while Blinken
is trying to address
the humanitarian situation,
trying to prevent this war
from becoming a regional situation,
he is not there to prevent war
from a growing bigger
between Israel and Hamas.
And that was evidenced
when you heard the Israeli defense
minister, Galen's,
saying that this will be a long war
and also warning that the price
for Israel to defend itself
will indeed be high.
There is no sign as of yet that the U.S.
is backing off
from this kind
of no daylight position with Israel.
They are fully supporting
Israel in its plans
to widen
this military campaign against Hamas.
What they are trying to do
is to get Americans
out of the Gaza Strip
to get humanitarian
aid into the Gaza Strip,
and also ideally
to try and find some way
of getting those American hostages
who are in Gaza out of there.
And out of harm's way.
Dana, Jeremy,
thank you so much for that reporting.
And today,
a site the world has been waiting to see.
CNN spotted five U.N.
fuel trucks entered Gaza.
It is the first sign
that the Rafah crossing,
the one between Gaza and Egypt,
is even partially open.
But this is important.
It remains closed to people,
desperate Palestinian civilians trapped
in a war zone
As the Egyptians,
they have
to be willing to have that gate open
and have a flow of human traffic
get through that.
And so we're in discussions with them
about what that could look like
and how that can be managed in a way
that that protects
Egypt's national security
interests as well.",20231016
QWYcX3zRbvg,Netanyahu adviser: Civilian casualty numbers from Gaza should be taken 'with grain of salt',data/en_CNN\Netanyahu adviser Civilian casualty numbers from Gaza should be taken 'with grain of salt'.jpg,"&gt;&gt;&gt; AND WE'RE BACK WITH SENIOR
ADVISER TO ISRAELI PRIME
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU MARK
REGOFF.
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" IS
REPORTING THAT THREE SENIOR
ISRAELI OFFICIALS SAY THAT THE
PLAN IS TO WIPE OUT HAMAS'S TOP
LEADERSHIP IN GAZA.
AND TO INVADE GAZA CITY.
WE HAVEN'T HEARD WHAT THE PLAN
IS.
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF AIR STRIKES
ON GAZA.
YOU COULD CONFIRM THAT THAT IS
THE PLAN, TO WIPE OUT HAMAS AS
TOP LEADERSHIP AND TO INVADE
GAZA CITY WITH A GROUND FORCE?
&gt;&gt; JAKE, YOU OF COURSE KNOW THAT
I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO
OPERATIONAL DETAILS OF MILITARY
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE STILL AHEAD
OF US.
I CAN ONLY SHARE THE GOAL WITH
YOU OF THE OPERATION.
WHICH IS BEEN STATED AND I'LL
STATE IT AGAIN, WE WILL
DISMANTLE HAMAS'S MILITARY
MACHINE AND TAKE APART ITS
POLITICAL GOVERNMENTS IN GAZA.
WE WILL DESTROY BOTH THE
MILITARY WING OF HAMAS, ITS
MILITARY MACHINE, AND THE
TERRORIST CAPABILITIES AND
GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES, ITS
GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE IN GAZA.
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY PEOPLE IS THAT, DO
YOU THINK?
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T GO INTO NUMBERS.
BUT IT MEANS THAT WHEN THIS IS
OVER, HAMAS WILL BE INCAPABLE OF
LAUNCHING THE SORT OF HORRENDOUS
ATTACK THAT THEY DID ON OCTOBER
7th.
THEY WILL BE PHYSICALLY
INCAPABLE OF LAUNCHING SUCH AN
OPERATION.
&gt;&gt; SO, CERTAINLY TAKING OUT
HAMAS'S LEADERSHIP, I UNDERSTAND
THE POINT OF THAT.
BUT THE PALESTINIAN HEALTH
MINISTRY IN GAZA SAID 2800
PALESTINIAN HAVE BEEN KILLED AN
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A QUARTER AND
A THIRD OF THEM ARE CHILDREN.
THAT IS NOT HAMAS'S LEADERSHIP.
&gt;&gt; CAN I PLEASE OFFER A WARD OF
CAUTION.
NOW I KNOW THAT THERE IS REAL
SUFFERING IN GAZA.
THERE IS A WAR GOING ON AND
INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE GETTING
CAUGHT UP IN A VERY DIFFICULT
SITUATION.
I DON'T MINIMIZE THAT.
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE WITH A
GRAIN OF SALT ANY INFORMATION
THAT COMES OUT OF THE HAMAS
CONTROLLED MINISTRY OF HEALTH IN
GAZA.
THAT HAS TO BE SAID.
IT IS NOT A DEMOCRACY, THERE IS
NOT AN INDEPENDENT HEALTH
BUREAUCRACY TRYING TO DO ITS
BEST.
EVERY DOCTOR THAT YOU SPEAK TO
AND EVERY HOSPITAL DIRECTOR THAT
YOU SPEAK TO WORKS UNDER THE GUN
OF HAMAS.
THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT.
IF THEY SPEAK OUT OF TURN, THEY
WILL PAY A PRICE.
IT IS LIKE SPEAKING TO A DOCTOR
IN NORTH KOREA OR A DOCTOR IN
THE FORMER SOVIET UNION.
THEY DON'T HAVE INDEPENDENT
OPINIONS.
THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PARTY
LINE AND IF NOT, THEY FACE
VIOLENT CONSEQUENCES.
SO THOSE NUMBERS, THEY MIGHT BE
TRUE, THEY MIGHT NOT BE TRUE.
HAMAS, OF COURSE, HAS AN
INTEREST IN EXAGGERATING
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.
&gt;&gt; SO LET'S ASSUME --
&gt;&gt; AND HAMAS DIDN'T SAY HOW MANY
WERE COMBATANTS OF COURSE.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.
SO LET'S ASSUME THAT YOU TAKE
OUT THE HAMAS LEADERSHIP AND
THEIR ABILITY TO COMMIT
ATROCITIES.
AMBASSADOR HERZOG TOLD ME
YESTERDAY THAT ISRAEL DOES NOT
WANT TO REOCCUPY GAZA SO WHAT
HAPPENS AFTER HAMAS IS
DESTROYED?
WHO WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF GAZA?
&gt;&gt; SO, FIRST OF ALL, MAYBE
ALMOST ANYTHING WOULD BE BETTER
THAN HAMAS.
I MEAN, IF THERE WERE ILLUSIONS
THAT HAMAS HAD SOMEHOW MODERATED
ITS POSITION THAT THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT OF
BEING RULING OVER 2.3 MILLION
PEOPLE, FORCES HAMAS TO BE A
MORE RATIONAL BEHAVIOR, THAT WAS
PROVEN WRONG.
THE VIOLENCE, THE BRUTAL
HORRIFIC VIOLENCE THAT WE SAW
OCTOBER 7th SHOWED THAT TO BE
WRONG.
THIS IS A HARD CORE EXTREMIST
MURDERIST TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION.
AND SO YOU HAVE TO SAY, IF IT IS
LIKE ISIS, HOW COULD IT GET MUCH
WORSE.
SO YOU HAVE TO HIT IT HARD, AND
WE HAVE TO -- WE HAVE TO DESTROY
ITS ABILITY TO ATTACK US.
AND I'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS
WHERE DIFFERENT CONTINGENCIES
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED, WHAT
HAPPENS AFTER, AT THIS TAJ I'M
NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS THOSE
DISCUSSIONS, BUT ISRAEL IS
THINKING THREE STEPS AHEAD.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING NOW IS
NOW IS WE FOCUS ON THE
DISMANTLING OF THE POLITICAL
STRUCTURE.
&gt;&gt; THERE IS A NEW REPORT THAT
ALLEGES SENIOR OFFICIALS IN
NETANYAHU'S OFFICE ARE BARRED
FROM WORKING WITH AN ISRAELI
DEFENSE MINISTRY TASK FORCE
WHICH IS FOCUSED ON PREPARING
INFRASTRUCTURE NEAR GAZA.
BECAUSE THE DEFENSE TASK FORCE
IS LED BY A STAUNCH OPPONENT OF
THE NETANYAHU JUDICIAL OVERHAUL.
IS THAT TRUE?
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NOT READ THAT REPORT
AND I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY OF
THAT.
I APOLOGIZE.
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE SAID THAT ISRAEL IS
UNITED RIGHT NOW.
VERY UNITED.
SO FAR NETANYAHU HAS NOT BEEN
ABLE TO GET OPPOSITION LEADER LA
PEAD TO JOIN THE UNITY
GOVERNMENT.
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?
SHOULDN'T ISRAEL BE AS UNITED AS
POSSIBLE?
&gt;&gt; WELL WE'VE ALREADY UNITED BY
BRINGING IN ONE MAJOR OPPOSITION
PARTY.
AND AS YOU KNOW, THEY JOINED A
FEW DAYS AGO AND WE'VE NOW GOT A
NATIONAL EMERGENCY GOVERNMENT.
WHERE MR. GANTZ, WHO WAS A
SEVERE CRITIC OF PRIME MINISTER
NETANYAHU, STEPPED IN AND
STEPPED IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS
WE HAVE TO UNITE TO FIGHT THE
COMMON ENEMY AND IF YOU LOOK AT
POLLING IN ISRAEL, THERE IS WIDE
SUPPORT FOR THAT SORT OF MOVE.
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED, WHEN THEY
CROSSED THE BORDER ON OCTOBER
7th TO MURDER US, THEY WENT TO
LEFT WING KIBBUTZ, WHERE PEOPLE
IN THEIR LIVES NEVER VOTED FOR
NETANYAHU AND THEY WENT TO RIGHT
WING VILLAGES WHERE EVERYBODY
LIKES NETANYAHU.
THEY DIDN'T CARE IF ISRAELIS
WERE LEFT WING OR RIGHT WING OR
RELIGIOUS OR SECULAR.
THEY KILL US BECAUSE WE'RE
ISRAELIS AND BECAUSE WE ARE
JEWS.
THAT IS -- THE MURDERS AND
VIOLENCE THAT WE SAW ON OCTOBER
7th, THAT WAS THE LARGEST SINGLE
ACT OF ANTI-SEMITIC VIOLENCE
SINCE 1945.
SINCE THE TERRIBLE YEARS OF THE
HAUTE.
WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
THAT FOR MONTHAN HALF A CENTURY.
SO I THINK MORE MANY ISRAELIS,
WE ARGUE ABOUT POLITICS AND
LOUDLY AND PASSIONATELY.
BUT I THINK THESE ATTACKS BY
HAMAS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT WERE A
SLAP ON THE FACE.
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE
HAVE A COMMON DESTINY, AND A
COMMON -- A COMMON SITUATION
THAT WE'RE ALTOGETHER IN FACING
THESE TERRIBLE AND HORRIFIC
CHALLENGES.",20231016
0oM8p96ZFNg,Israeli father describes wife and daughters being taken by Hamas as 'hell',data/en_CNN\Israeli father describes wife and daughters being taken by Hamas as 'hell'.jpg,"One of the family
members desperately holding out hope that
some of these hostages will be rescued
is the only Asher.
He is missing
his wife and his two young daughters.
They were taken
while visiting his mother in law.
Near Gaza.
Our viewers will remember that
we first spoke
to Yoni on the day of the Hamas attack,
just hours after he first saw his family
in this viral video.
Online.
You can see a gunman
placing a cloth over his wife's head.
His mother in law and his two daughters
are huddled in the back of the truck
after seeing this video.
Yoni tried to track his wife's location.
It said her phone was in Gaza.
We have been checking in
with Yoni ever since then.
And I was able to meet him in person
over the weekend.
Traveling to his home north of Tel Aviv.
Here is our conversation
Well, Yoni,
the chance to see each other
and see you in person
How are you doing now?
Well,
eight days
since my wife and two
daughters got kidnaped
I am realizing that
I got to see
the gates of hell.
I got to see how
Hill looks like
I don't know if there are
any more tears left in me,
but it became real.
I became it became clear to me
that I saw her.
I saw what her looks like. And,
you know, it's not only the phone call
that I got from my wife.
10 a.m.
telling me that
they're entering the house shooting and
that we got disconnected.
And it's not even the video.
9 seconds long video, which I saw
my wife getting taken
with my two daughters,
recognizing them just like that.
After a few hours of nerve wracking time,
which I tried to get information,
the hell
was the images.
I didn't watch them.
I heard.
I understand very quickly
that when I saw that when I knew
that there is a possibility
that I get held by such.
I don't know how to call
that they are held by them.
It was even worse than the video
because you think about what I mean
in every moment.
I don't know what they're going
I only saw them kidnaped.
I only saw them
get in on some kind of vehicle.
You can see from that video,
it's really familiar.
My wife getting covered by her head,
Alawite, were screaming all around that.
That was the image I saw last Saturday,
seven of October.
And I tell you,
I don't know if I can explain yet.
But like I said, I don't know
if you ever thought about it,
but sometimes we think,
what is the apocalypse scenario
or what is that
what hell looks like
when I saw the images there in
every minute is forever.
Well, you're living it
forever.
You mean what have you heard about them?
Is the government are they updating you?
Are they telling you anything
about what they're doing
or where they think they may be?
I mean, even things like
are they even able to tell you
whether they think they're there together?
Well,
you know,
there is the channel that the authorities
are in contact with me
but as you know,
these things are not simple.
They're sometimes
can be extremely complicated.
I'm not diplomacy.
I have no diplomacy or security training.
I have no understanding
in this kind of matters.
It's not my area.
But they are in touch with me.
And I only know what I knew last Saturday.
That's the only thing I knew.
And I live here in uncertainty and it's
I'm hanging between the earth and heaven.
And I move in between the desperation
sometimes hope.
But I don't know
I know the time is critical.
I know they they need medicine.
I know they have babies.
My little baby
daughter of five is not yet three.
In January, she will be three the same.
In the same month,
the same month, January.
Also, my older brothers will be five.
They are celebrated together
in the same month.
They are good friends.
They love each other.
I hope that they are alive
and they are well.
And I hope that they are
take care of each other
with their mother.
What happened to this house?
How it became
a media and an office to save them.
I just want them to be here
I can start to explain to you what
smart, beautiful girls they are.
I can't even start We sit here.
I think that you sit here.
This is you have so many visions
of when you and Jerome
may be in the kitchen and they were here
where they were playing.
This is their special area.
But they know area.
I don't allow myself to know
I have.
I can't profound in this visions.
I want to remember
the sound of their voice,
the smell of their hair.
But it's hard.
I know that I have to be strong for them.
I can't look at a video of them.
Not even one.
I know that
many videos were published by us.
Me and my family and friends who are
helping me I didn't watch single one.
Go through your phone and watch.
I can't.
You asked me about
the last few days.
Something.
It was something that
the body and the mind is very hard to.
I don't have any psychology training also,
but I guess it's
something that takes the spirit
out of the body of something because
there is a
I can't I can't even process
You wanted us to look at their shoes
why their shoes, Yoni?
How, you know, they are currently girls.
They they like shoes.
I see pink.
They like are willing to wear
only dresses.
So it's you need to convince them
to wear a shirt and pants and dresses.
Yes, they like they like girly stuff
making us food in this toy
kitchen, bringing me that food.
Thank you.
I can
talk with you about it right now with
I guess
something happened to the mind
and spirit in situation like this.
And for me anyway,
and your wife,
you know,
you must be thinking of her
and how strong she is.
She is.
She's.
You know,
since I have two little daughters,
I learned that
what is the power of of a woman?
What is how strong a woman is
a lot more than us men.
You know,
she sacrificed so much.
It took us three years
to bring to the world.
Was her older
my first born? Yes.
Women
are strong.
And my wife
particularly, it's a very strong person.
But the situation is impossible
and the uncertainties are there
are there things you think about in your
head or things you you would say to her
can only imagine?
There are things now that you say, ah,
if I if I could say them
or if I could talk to her
now, if I could have said
you said anything you would
you want to say to her right now
that I'm sorry
I'm sorry
sorry that I never not always
appreciated her
and I and I did.
But, you know, in these moments,
you think about all the times
before you were on the phone or busy,
the girls would say, to me, Daddy, come
sit with the the wife, my wife, the wrong
um, I just wanted her to know
that I love her with all of my heart.
And I'm sorry
and you know, the worst thing as a father
or have three girls, wife,
two little babies is killed
is this give life.
Why are you not coming to get us?
I thinking about them. Sit there.
Maybe if they're alive and thinking why is
that is not coming and it can.
I want to
I pray that they will forgive me, but
they were recognized.
You know, for children, it's a day.
It's like a month for us. And those.
Oh, they will remember you
I want
I will be in their mind
like they are in my mind.
I have to be strong for them.",20231017

9LVVrfvv9BM,Veteran reporter shows what it's like inside Hamas tunnels under Gaza,data/en_CNN\Veteran reporter shows what it's like inside Hamas tunnels under Gaza.jpg,"The U.S.
says it still knows nothing
about the condition of the Americans
believed to be taken hostage by Hamas.
And while their whereabouts
remain unknown,
some do believe that they could be held in
Gaza's tunnels.
My next guest
has actually walked through those tunnels.
I want to bring in veteran foreign affairs
correspondent Reena nine and Reena.
These tunnels are kind
of a bit of a source of some mystery,
but they are believed
to be just literally
under the feet of the Palestinian people,
as you can kind of see here,
under buildings, under apartment.
We also have some somewhat rare video.
This is from 2017.
Can you walk us through what we are
looking at here, what you've been to to
You know, I have to tell you,
these tunnels are far more elaborate
than the ones I went down.
The ones I went down
were built by teenage boys
that essentially were made of dirt
and are probably one time usage
but you could see
the potential of hostages
being in these tunnels
fortified here with concrete.
What's also so
troubling is as incredible as Israeli anti
detection systems are for these tunnels,
which they do have, it's really hard.
Hamas has gotten smarter over the years
about their ability to get in
and destroy these tunnels.
So you see how fortified it
is, the concrete,
the fact that they can go down into here
and go undetected.
I'm going to show a few more pictures
here.
And you see the dirt around here, the ones
I went through were essentially I'm 54.
I was able to go down
the whole entire route of these tunnels
and then it slowly started to cave down.
These are far better
engineered and constructed
because the tunnels are likely.
These hostages are,
I bet, are potentially the ones that have
are not intended for one time use
their intended for this type of warfare.
Meanwhile, the other story here
is about the civilians.
They are now being asked to evacuate.
We're looking here at this evacuation
not there's really only one place
for them to get out.
And it would be right here.
This is the Rafah crossing
that leads straight to Egypt.
I'm going to show
another kind of image here.
This is what it looks like up close.
What are the challenges here for civilians
trying to get out?
Well, one, it's incredibly unpredictable
and incredibly dangerous.
We know that there have been
Israeli airstrikes and so you constantly
don't know what could happen in this area.
State Department
has also said that if and when the Rafah
crossing eventually opens,
what could happen is it won't be open
for a long, extended period of time.
It'll open quickly
and could potentially close.
You've got all these people
here in the Gaza Strip looking to get out.
That's the one exit point right now
is this Rafah, which enters into Egypt's
Sinai Peninsula there.
So you've got the unpredictability
it's dangerous.
And also, Abbi, the fact that we've heard
that we don't know how long it could be.
And of course,
this is a very significant distance here.
It's a small it's a small space.
But it's a significant distance
if you don't have a lot of means.
If you don't have a lot of means,
and also you don't know how long
you're camping out there for.
So the fact that these people could be
down there trying to get humanitarian aid,
the Egyptians also don't want over
a million people absorbed into Egypt.
So that's a big concern.
While they said they'll allow
multinational people come into Egypt,
leave via Cairo, these Palestinians
coming through don't have that option.
All right. Rana, and thank you so much.",20231017

the growing desperation inside Gaza.
And a warning
some images in her report are graphic
This is what life looks like in places.
Israel told families to flee towards
for their safety, where constant
bombardment has reduced homes to rubble
and wiped out entire families.
The survivors say,
I lost all my relatives.
15 people, this man says.
We were not on the front line or anything.
We were just sitting at home.
What have we done wrong?
The U.N.
warns there are no safe places.
About half a million
people fled here to southern Gaza
after an evacuation order
by the Israeli military But families
desperate for refuge
are still trapped in the war zone.
The dead and injured flooding
a health care system on the brink.
Civilians are caught in the crossfire.
With the death toll mounting,
just over a quarter of those
killed are children,
according to Palestinian officials.
And a
week long siege is strangling the enclave,
the U.N.
says, amid fears food, fuel, water
and medical supplies may soon run out.
Some 2 million
people are crammed into this.
140 square mile territory.
Now, many of them pushed into
an even smaller corner of the enclave.
About half the population are children.
There are not enough shelters to house
the sheer number of civilians
and even those who do find spaces
in overwhelmed schools
turned refugee centers.
It is little comfort
to the youngest victims.
For Shadi Hamid.
There is no one to protect us.
This little girl says
there's no one to come save us.
How are we supposed to live?
How? Answer me.
Prime Minister
Netanyahu has vowed to annihilate Hamas
after a terror attack by the group left.
1400 killed in Israel.
But with Hamas so deeply embedded within
Gaza's population, rights groups
fear a bloodbath.
What we're seeing right now, the direction
that Israel is going to be is going in.
They have said they want to destroy Hamas,
but their current trajectory
is going to destroy Gaza.
Hamas
does not answer to the people of Gaza.
No elections have been held here
since the group seized power in 2007.
Still, it is these residents
that will pay the price.
And with a potential ground
incursion expected
not cost is unfathomable.
Some Abdel Aziz, CNN, London.
Joining me now from Tel Aviv is Jonathan
Conricus, international spokesperson
for the Israel Defense Forces.
Colonel, good to see they can be with us.
Good morning. Thank you for having me.
It's a pleasure, sir.
I wonder if you could just
comment on a report we've just received
from Palestinian sources within Gaza
that there were Israeli airstrikes
around the Rafah crossing in the south,
killing at least 28 people.
Also,
airstrikes in the region of Khan Yunis,
which, as you know, is in the center
of Gaza.
These are all areas which the Israelis
urge the Palestinians to head towards,
to be out of danger for Israeli operations
that were taking place in the north.
What more can you tell us
about those airstrikes in the south?
Yes, the combat operations continue.
We continue to hunt Hamas operatives
to attempt to degrade
their military capabilities, whereabouts
locations, tunnels and rocket launchers
and of course, other things that are part
of this war that has been forced upon us.
And I am not aware of any strike
specifically
in those areas,
but they could have happened.
And anyhow, we continue to operate
and strike Hamas targets
as we have defined before.
And we try to do that
according to the law of armed conflict.
And, of course, to minimize
civilian casualties.
And just as we have
you talked about Rafah,
what is the situation
there as far as you know,
with regards to that border crossing?
Actually, being open so that all the
trucks on the Egyptian side of the border,
trucks filled with humanitarian
assistance, will be allowed into Gaza
because right now the people's lives
are counting on that aid being delivered
Yes, I know that an attempt.
First of all,
I am aware of lots of discussions, report
and quite a lot of conflicting information
about that.
And sorry to say,
I don't have clarity myself.
The only thing I can say
is that the last attempt that I am
aware of that we were involved
in was three days ago
when there was an attempt to evacuate
foreign nationals, Americans and others,
which failed
because Hamas refused to open the gate.
Other than that,
I don't have any updates on the situation.
We understand the complexity and perhaps
there will be news later in the day
about the Rafah and about other issues
pertaining to humanitarian needs.
Confusion in war,
I guess comes with the territory, sir,
but we appreciate
whatever you can do to clarify.
We've just had the news as well
on on Monday that the US President
Joe Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday.
There is an imminent ground
operation in Gaza.
Does the President's visit to Israel,
does that complicate or delay
that ground incursion in any way?
Not as far as I understand.
And I think what I understand
from public statements,
the statements made by Secretary Blinken,
the president is here to show his support
for Israel and that he stands with Israel,
our right to defend ourselves.
And, of course, any
enhancement of our operations
is part of our right to defend ourselves.
I think the president also said
that the Hamas
needs to be destroyed,
and that is exactly our military aim.
We want to dismantle Hamas and make sure
that never again will any terrorist
organization in Gaza have the ability
to perform the atrocities that Hamas did.
On the 7th of October.
With regards to
the military operations and the exodus
from the north of Gaza to the south
that we're just talking about months ago,
that did seem fairly clear
message to Hamas
that a big operation was on its way.
Can you say how long and specifically
where these operations will take place
in the north around the Gaza City,
and what are the risks facing
those who stayed in that area?
And is there a danger of telegraphing
your punches,
if you like, to Hamas militants?
What's coming down the line?
Yeah, three good questions in one lesson.
It is generally not wise for a military
to be advertising its intentions.
And we are aware of the fact that we have
just advertised our intentions
by telling civilians
in northern Gaza to go south.
Why have we done that?
Because we want civilians out of fighting
and we don't want them to be killed.
So there is a balance here
between achieving a military objective
and minimizing civilian damage.
And in this case, which is very evident
and you cannot argue with it.
We have chosen to
you know,
that the sanctity of life
and the helping Palestinian civilians
to go south and not be stuck in an area
that there will be significant
combat activities.
There is a risk
and we will have to mitigate this risk
with the tactics, the weapons and the time
that we use when a knife will operate.
And there is tremendous,
you know, desire in Israel
to see Hamas defeated, to see the scourge
and the terror gone from Gaza.
But Israelis, of course,
also want the IDF to operate it smartly
and in a way that doesn't
expose our troops to undue danger
in an environment that already is among
the most dangerous on any battlefield.
And very quickly, one of the other reasons
why President Biden
is coming to the region, coming to Israel,
and the secretary state, Antony
Blinken, has been there is concerned
that this this conflict with Hamas
in Gaza could spread
and erupt into a much bigger
regional confrontation with actors.
For Iran, in particular, warning of,
you know,
if there are any more Palestinian
civilians who are killed,
if this continues, that
there will be consequences for Israel.
What's what's your response to that?
Well, I read it the same way.
I mean, I see that President Biden
and Secretary Blinken and many
American statements are made exactly
in order to prevent a regional escalation.
The common denominator
or let's say the reason or the power
that could escalate the Middle East
into regional escalation is Iran.
They have their tentacles.
They have their proxy organizations around
Israel, Hezbollah in the north, Hamas,
Islamic Jihad in the south,
and lots of proxies in Syria and Iraq.
And if they decide so,
then maybe they would want to
throw more of their properties
towards Israel.
That would be unwise and definitely not
something that would serve the interests
of the people of the region.
Maybe it would serve Iranian interests,
but definitely
not the people of the region.
And I think that's a very strong message
that the U.S.
is delivering to Iran.
If you're thinking about doing it, don't.
What we are saying is we are prepared
along our northern border in the south,
whoever threatens us
and whoever challenges
our safety and security of our civilians,
we will defend
and we will make sure that they don't
have the ability to do so.
Colonel Corica,
thanks so much for being with us.
We appreciate your time.
Thank you. Good morning.",20231017

MORE ON THE HOSTAGE OF HAMAS
RELEASED VIDEO OF BETWEEN --
MIA SHEM'S MOTHER, ALSO HER
BROTHERS.
&gt;&gt; KAREN, HOW DOES YOUR
DAUGHTER LOOK TO YOU?
&gt;&gt; I SEE THAT SHE HAS BEEN
THROUGH PAIN, SHE IS IN PAIN.
.
SHE IS INJURED, AND SHE LOOKS A
BIT TERRIFIED.
BUT, SHE IS ALIVE, AND STABLE.
&gt;&gt; DOES IT HELP TO SEE HER?
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE, BECAUSE UNTIL NOW
EITHER KNOW SHE WAS THAT ARE
ALIVE.
IT HAS BEEN TEN DAYS, UNTIL
SATURDAY SHE W MISSING ON
SATURDAY, THIS SAID THAT MAYBE
SHE HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED THAT IS
ALL.
SO, I DID NOT KNOW IF SHE IS
ALIVE, ORDERED.
EVERY DAY, THE NUMBERS OF THE
MISSING AND THAT PEOPLE ARE
GETTING UP AND CHOIR AND
HIGHER.
SO, IT'S REALLY TOUGH.
&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE WAS
TAKEN FROM?
WHERE WAS SHE WHEN THE ATTACK
TOOK PLACE?
&gt;&gt; SHE WENT TO A FESTIVAL Y.
&gt;&gt; ALL I KNOW, IT'S SATURDAY
MORNING, IT'S 7:00.
SHE SENT TEXT MESSAGE TO ONE OF
HER FRIEND WHO WAS AT THE PARTY
AND SHE WROTE, THEY ARE
SHOOTING AT, US PLEASE COME
SAVE US.
THAT IS THE ONLY THING I KNOW.
THE OTHER THING I KNEW WAS
RUMORS.
CHEVY WAS SHOT, NO I CAN SEE
IT'S TRUE BECAUSE SHE IS
INJURED, YOU CAN SEE SHE HAD
THE OPERATION IN HER HAND, AND
WENT TO THIS PARTY WITH HER
FRIEND, THEY WENT TOGETHER AND,
WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM.
IT'S NOT IN THE MISSING LIST,
NOT IN THE KIDNAPPED LIST.
HE'S ON THAT LIST.
WE STILL HAVE BODIES THAT WE
DIDN'T RECOGNIZE, BECAUSE WE
HAVE SO MANY.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE INTERVIEWING WITH YOU,
INTERVIEWING WITH SEVERAL OTHER
PEOPLE HEARING US AND HOLD
VIDEOS AROUND THE WORLD THAT
CAN SEE THIS INTERVIEW, TO COME
AND STAND WITH US AND STAND
WITH HUMAN RIGHTS, AND HELP US
GET ME AND ALL THE OTHERS TO
200 IN THE INSOLES, TO HOSTAGES
IS GIVING THE GAZA STRIP TO
COME BACK HOME.
THAT IS ALL WE WANT, JUST TO
GET ME BACK TO US.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE BEGGING THE WORLD TO
BRING BY BABY HOME.
SHE IS ONLY 21 YEARS OLD SHE
JUST WENT TO A FESTIVAL PARTY
AFTER MONTHS THAT SHE DID NOT
GO ANYWHERE, SHE HAS MEDICAL
PROBLEMS, SHE JUST WANTED TO
HAVE SOME FUN.
SHE SHOULD NOT BE THERE.
SO, WE ARE BEGGING THE WORLD TO
INTERFERE AND BRING HER HOME.
ALL OF THE OTHERS WE HAVE LIKE
200 MORE HOSTAGES, CHILDREN,
BABIES, OLD PEOPLE, HOLOCAUST
SURVIVORS.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON,
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE ALIVE,
IF THEY ARE THE, IF THEY GIVE
THEM FOOD.
WE DON'T KNOW WHICH CONDITIONS
THEY ARE IN.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT SHOWING THE VIDEO
THAT HAMAS HAS PUT OUT.
BUT, WE ARE SHOWING OTHER
PHOTOS OF HER.
CAN YOU JUST TELL PEOPLE WHAT
SHE IS LIKE?
WHAT YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW
ABOUT HER?
&gt;&gt; MY DAUGHTER IS VERY MATURE.
I'M A SINGLE MOM.
WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT, AND
SHE IS ONLY 21.
SHE IS LIKE A 60-YEAR-OLD SMART
WOMAN.
SHE IS VERY STRONG.
THAT IS WHY WE ALL BELIEVE IN
OUR HEARTS THAT SHE'S ALIVE.
 KNEW THAT SHE'D NEVER GIVE
KNEW THAT SHE'D NEVER GIVE
UP.
I REALLY KNEW IT.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERY TIME
WE OPEN THE TV AND THEY SAW THE
NUMBERS, IT WAS VERY HARD TO
STICK TO THIS.
SHE IS A SURVIVOR, AND SHE IS
VERY TALENTED, AND I HAVE FOUR
CHILDREN.
I HAVE A SMALL DAUGHTER, TEN
YEARS OLD, AND IS LIKE A MOTHER
TO HER.
SHE IS VERY CLOSE TO HER
BROTHERS.
SHE COOKS FOR THEM, SHE TELLS
THAT THEY'RE TALKING WITH HER
ABOUT EVERYTHING.
SHE IS JONATHAN CONRICUS A
MOTHER LIKE ME RAFAH, AND MY
BEST FRIEND.
SHE IS VERY CREATIVE, SHE
PAINTS, SHE COOKS.
SHE MAKES THE FOOD.
SHE IS THE HEART OF THE MIA
SHEM FAMILY.
&gt;&gt; KEREN SCHARF SCHEM, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO US.
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD
WANT HER TO KNOW, IF FOR SOME
REASON SHE COULD SEE THIS?
&gt;&gt; I WANT HER TO BE STRONG, AND
I WANT HER TO BE SURE THAT THE
WORLD WILL DO EVERYTHING TO
BRING HER HOME.
&gt;&gt; MIA, IF YOU CAN SEE US, WE
WANT TO TELL YOU FROM ALL THE
FAMILY AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN
ISRAEL, WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU.
&gt;&gt; WE LOVE.
YOU WERE WAITING FOR.
YOU &gt;&gt; WILL DO ANYTHING TO
BRING YOU BACK HOME.
WE WILL NEVER STOP, AND AFTER
YOU WE WILL BE HERE.
WILL CONTINUE UNTIL ALL OF THE
200 HOSTAGES WILL BE HOME.
WE NEVER STOP, AND THE WORK IS
WITH US AGAIN.
I'M SURE.
IT IS NOT OUR WAR.
IT'S A VERY BIG WAR.
&gt;&gt; KAREN, THANK YOU, I WISH YOU
THE BEST.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
&gt;&gt; ON THE TAKING OF HOSTAGES,
JOINING ME IS --
FORMER DIVISION CHIEF OF THE
HOSTAGES IN M.I.A. UNIT OF THE
MUSCLE.
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
199 HOSTAGES, THAT'S THE NUMBER
ISRAEL SAYS HAMAS, OTHERS SAY
AS MANY AS 250.
WHAT LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED
FROM HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS THAT
HAVE TAKEN ON, THAT HAVE
HAPPENED HERE IN THE PAST?
&gt;&gt; ISRAEL'S BIGGEST MISTAKE IN
THE PAST WAS NEGOTIATING FOR
PRISONERS.
&gt;&gt; A SOLDIER WHO IS HELD FOR
YEARS, EXCHANGE FOR 1000
PERCENT.
&gt;&gt; ALL THE TOP IN THE GAZA
STRIP ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
RELEASED.
&gt;&gt; ALL THE PEOPLE RUNNING HAMAS
WERE ISRAELI?
THEY GOT OUT.
&gt;&gt; THEY GOT OUT.
THE HEAD OF HAMAS TODAY, THE
OPERATIONAL HEAD OF HAMAS WAS
ONE OF THESE PEOPLE RELEASED.
THESE PEOPLE HAVE AN OBLIGATION
FOR THEIR PRISONERS IN ISRAEL.
PART OF THE REGION FOR THIS
WHOLE THING IS THE RELEASE OF
THEIR PRISONERS.
&gt;&gt; PART OF THE REASON FOR THE
TERROR ATTACK WAS TO GET PEOPLE
TO EXCHANGE.
&gt;&gt; TO EXCHANGE.
&gt;&gt; THEY NEED IS A HISTORY OF
ISRAEL MAKING A DEAL.
&gt;&gt; YES.
&gt;&gt; ISRAEL CANNOT AFFORD HAVING
ANOTHER SITUATION LIKE THIS.
WE CANNOT LIVE WITH HAMAS.
YOU COULDN'T, IF THE HAMAS EVER
RETURNS TO THE GAZA STRIP, WE
ARE FACED WITH A SITUATION.
PEOPLE CANNOT LIVE IN AND
AROUND THE GAZA STRIP, BUT ALSO
IN TEL AVIV.
AS YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF.
YOU WANT THE SHELTER, AND
THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULD
RUN AS A CIVILIAN.
WE ARE LOOKING AT AN
ORGANIZATION THAT IS
FUNDAMENTALIST AND IS PRIMARILY
EVIL.
IT IS NOT ONLY HERT IS ALL
OVER THE WORLD.
LOOK AT THE TALIBAN.
LOOK AT HIS BALL.
A LOOK AT MANY OTHER
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THIS THAT
HAVE A PURPOSE, AND THEIR
PURPOSE IS TO HAVE A JIHAD WITH
US.
CIVILIZATION IS FACING THE SORT
OF SAYING, AND OUR OBLIGATION I
THINK IS THE WESTERN WORLD IN
THE AMERICAN OF THE UNITED
STATES HAVE SHOWN THIS, IS TO
GO INTO THE GAZA STRIP AND
ERADICATE THE.
HAMAS &gt;&gt; SUCH A HORRID LESSON
YOU SAY TO NOT NEGOTIATE.
ON PAPER, PEOPLE CAN SAY, YES
THAT MAKE SENSE, EMOTIONALLY --
&gt;&gt; TERRIBLE.
&gt;&gt; IT IS TERRIBLE.
199 FAMILIES AND THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE RELATED TO THEM WHO ARE
DESPERATE.
&gt;&gt; IT'S TERRIBLE, EMOTIONALLY,
IT'S A TERRIBLE DECISION.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRACTICAL
SIDE OF CONDUCTING WAR IN THE
GAZA STRIP, WITH ISRAEL WILL DO
ALL IT CAN ORDER TO RELEASE THE
PRISONERS.
SOME OF THEM WILL, OR MAYBE ALL
OF THEM WILL BE RELEASED, BUT,
BY FORCE.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ONLY.
WAY &gt;&gt; THE ONLY WAY TO RELEASE
PRISONERS IN THE SITUATION IS
FORCE.
NEGOTIATION, WHAT THE HAMAS HAS
COME BACK TO US AND SAID, TWICE
ALREADY.
WE SAID, ALL RIGHT, WE'RE
WILLING TO NEGOTIATE THE
RELEASE OF THE PRISONERS.
WE WANT FIRST OF ALL, I'M
CEASE-FIRE.
SECOND OF ALL, MEANING STOP
KILLING US.
STOP ERADICATING US.

PRISONERS.

General, always good to have you on.
One of the things
that struck me about the book,
which is an area of expertize
which is something that I hope
the Israelis are reading
is about urban combat
and the 2004 battle of Fallujah,
the largest of the Iraq war Bloody
costly street by street.
And we had General Kimmitt here
not long ago
and he was saying that what Israel
is going to face, what the Israeli forces
are going to face in Gaza will be probably
even more grueling than Fallujah.
What do you think it will be?
Orders of magnitude more difficult.
The enemy has had months
to prepare the defenses.
They'll undoubtedly employ
improvised explosive devices, suicide
bombers, car bombs, tunnels,
a lot of infrastructure that they have.
They know the territory very, very well.
And it's many times the size of Fallujah.
We did a number of urban operations
over those years.
And then more recently, we watched one
that might be more appropriate
as an analogy,
which was the Iraqi security forces
supported by a US led coalition
clearing the Islamic State
out of Mosul, a city about the same size
as Gaza City.
And again, it's very, very challenging
fighting in this hospital bombing.
And by the way, I'll take the side
of the IDF spokesman any day over Hamas.
Needless to say, there are in a democracy,
the truth is going to come out.
They know it.
And they've done apparently a very good
and thorough investigation quite quickly.
But in the case of urban combat,
you're going
to have tremendous damage
to civilian infrastructure.
You're going to have considerable civilian
loss.
You're going to take
a lot of friendly casualties.
You don't just have to clear every
building floor, a room basement tunnel.
You have to leave substantial forces
behind, or else the enemy will REINFELDT
And you have to do this
progressively sequentially.
You have to clear and hold and then
continue farther, spread the oil spot.
In fact, it really should be thought
of as a counterinsurgency operation,
not just a
conventional military operation,
because you are fighting among the people
and because of the importance
of not overlooking
what happens after Hamas is destroyed.
And by the way, a spokesman today said
they also intend to dismantle the Hamas
political structure, the political wing
that's different from the military wing
which is the Hamas terrorists
and also the Islamic Jihad terrorists.
Right.
But then the question is, what next?
Who's going to take over?
Who's going to oversee?
There has to be nation building.
There's going to be restoration
of basic services, repair of damaged
infrastructure, getting schools,
markets, clinics all reopened.
You know that we've learned all of that
sometimes the hard way.
We learned in the fight to Baghdad
that you've got to have a very good plan
with a lot of different assumptions,
because once you take down the regime
and you turn to the folks
that said, just get us to Baghdad, Dave,
we'll take it from there.
That plan proved inadequate.
So I think the big subject of discussion,
I suspect already between
the Israeli generals and the political
authorities is about what comes after.
They're going to take enormous casualties
to do this.
I believe that is right to destroy Hamas.
But you can't have that for naught.
This can't be another case
where you mow the lawn
all the way down to the dirt in this case.
But then you pull back out
and the remnants will be able
to reconstitute themselves.
So what follows?
Could there be an interim
international authority? What is it?
I don't I doubt
I mean, the ambassador told me
Sunday
that they do not want to reoccupy no.
Gaza.
So, I mean, I think the president has said
don't do it.
So it has to be some other.
So what the United Nations
or the Arab League or some group
is going to have to fight
because there will be an insurgency
you know, they'll try to retake, control
the remnants of Gaza and there will be
of Hamas.
There will be some of those there.
So this is the real challenge, Jake.
And I'm not sure it's getting quite enough
attention.
In the book, we talk about the importance
of a strategic leader
getting the big ideas right.
This is crucial.
Getting the strategy right.
Vengeance is not a strategy
And that's my next question.
Component is some,
but you have to do more.
And that's my next question
because I've been thinking about
how and understandably so,
but how immediate and swift the response
by the Israeli
military was in the aftermath of Hamas's
barbaric terrorist attack on October 7th,
which, of course, reminds me of nine 11.
And you remember when I interviewed you
when I did the documentary,
about 20 years of war in Afghanistan.
And I also interviewed General McChrystal
for that same documentary.
And he told me something interesting,
and I want to get your your take on it,
because I said, if you could go back,
what would you do differently?
Listen to your your colleague
and friend, General McChrystal,
right after the nine 11 attacks.
I would have made a decision
inside the U.S.
government
to do nothing substantive for a year.
What I mean by nothing, no bombing,
no strikes, etc.
I would have gone around the world
as the aggrieved party
and built up a firm coalition for what
what we do about al Qaeda.
I would have done a mass effort to train
Americans in Arabic Pashtu,
Urdu, Dari, to get ourselves
ready to do something that we knew
would be very, very difficult.
Now, I said to him,
if you were a president,
you also would be impeached for not doing
it, for not doing anything
after the nine 11 attack.
He has a point, but but he has a point.
And guys have a point.
And I want you to talk about that,
about the idea of
you get you get horrifically hit,
but you take a breath before responding.
Yes. Keep in mind, this is much worse
than nine elevenths in relative terms.
It's like 35,000 people being killed.
Jake, it's actually over 40,000
now because they're up to 1300.
So. Yes.
And so that response, the desire for
vengeance is absolutely understandable.
And there should be vengeance.
There should be destruction
of the organization that did this but
not if you haven't thought through
what comes after that.
And that's, I think, the component of this
that certainly is not yet visible.
I'm sure that they're wrestling with this.
I'm sure part of the reason
the president is going to Amman,
Jordan, is to start discussing that.
And one would hope that
some of the Arab countries in particular
in the region that have often
expressed sympathy for the Palestinians,
will contribute to some kind of effort
that would enable the rebuilding
and so in Prime Minister Netanyahu,
I think, should provide a vision
for what life will be like
for the Palestinian people,
not just in Gaza, by the way,
but also in the West Bank, something
that has just been looming out there
for quite some time In any event,
let's let's let this be a catalyst.
Remember, after the 73 war,
all of a sudden you
had peace between the two warring factions
between Egypt and Israel and arrangements
with Syria and Jordan as well.
Of course, a very different situation.
Henry Kissinger,
I was just in a meeting with him.
He could call for people and get that deal
done.
President of Egypt
Assad in Damascus, the king in Amman,
and Golda Meir.
Yeah, there's nobody here to do that.
So you've got this is much
more challenging in that regard.
And I'd contended the military task
here is more challenging as well.
It's not tank on, tank out in the desert.
Certainly,
there was an existential moment for Israel
when Egypt achieved the early success.
But once that was resolved, that was a
straightforward military operation.
This is much more than just an offensive
operation, a clear hold and build.
You have to
then have what's going to follow.
Absolutely.
Retired General David Petraeus,
maybe they should call you.
You'd be you'd be good to help this.

1wfmV0qOQow,Who is the leader of Hamas in Gaza?,data/en_CNN\Who is the leader of Hamas in Gaza.jpg,"Want to tell you about a man
who is said
to be the Hamas leader
who is central to this war
and the release of hostages.
He's also a key target for Israel.
Sam Kiley has more
on the leader of Hamas in Gaza.
What Israel wants this man dead.
Yayha Sinwar
The leader of Hamas in Gaza.
In the face of evil in the end
is Yayha Sinwar
Well, that man is in our sights.
All his team are and will get to them.
He was first convicted in 1988
for the murder of two Israeli soldiers
and four Palestinians
suspected of collaboration with Israel.
And he spent two decades
in an Israeli prison studying his enemy,
the founder of Hamas
internal security force.
He had hunted alleged
collaborators with zeal and
brothers and was among the movement's
biggest prizes
when over a thousand
Palestinian prisoners
were released in 2011.
For Gilad Shalit,
an Israeli soldier held hostage in Gaza
for five years, he said,
there is no doubt
that this is a nationalistic moment,
par excellence.
It is one of the big strategic monuments
in the history of our cause.
He quickly became head of Hamas
military wing
and on election to the Gaza
leadership in 2017,
effectively abolished
its civilian branch,
ostracized by Egypt over its support
for political Islam.
He repaired friendships with Cairo
and built
regional relationships
that entrenched Hamas power.
It really needed to have
also good relations
with the key Arab state that also shares
the only era border with the Gaza Strip
and with Iran that could supply Hamas
with military and logistical support.
Iran has poured military support
into Hamas under him,
and Qatar has been a major backer
of civilian projects.
He was soon in Israel's crosshairs.
Quite literally,
the IDF tried to kill him in May 20, 21.
Ten days later, he laid out his strategy.
He said
if the world doesn't
take action to stop it, meaning Israel,
there will be a religious war
in the region.
And he soon appeared in Gaza
alongside Egypt's intelligence
chief, Abbas Kamel.
For us,
the US is now relying on Egypt and Qatar
as key players
to try to secure the safe
release of Hamas's 200 captives.
Their main point of contact
is likely Sinwar.
unless Israel fulfills
its promise to kill them.
Sam Kiley, CNN.
The move of
well, a major unanswered question
here is what was Hamas
thinking with their terror attack?
That is the headline for an article
by a journalist at The New Yorker
who recently asked that of a senior
political Hamas official
who is living in in Doha in Qatar.
David Kirkpatrick, who coauthored
that piece, has covered
the region extensively.
He joins us now.
David, the article you wrote
is is fascinating.
What what were they thinking?
You know,
the picture that emerged was desperation.
I should tell you
that when my colleague Adam
Rasgon and I,
both Rasgon
and I spoke to Mousa Abu Marzouk,
he was at pains to say, no,
we have not despaired, we're strong.
But the takeaway was
that they basically feel like their backs
against are against the wall.
It was a, you know, a familiar
litany of grievances
about the occupation,
about Israeli settlements
in the West Bank,
about the management
of the Al-Aqsa mosque,
which is very important to Palestinians
and Muslims everywhere.
But added to
that was an increased sense
of desperation
because of the right wing government
around Netanyahu,
because of the messages
that it's conveying
about its lack of receptivity
to any kind of
Palestinian political entity
alongside side Israel.
And also a sense of betrayal
as the other Arab states
more and more accommodate
themselves to Israel,
you know, begin to recognize
Israel and Saudi Arabia,
the most important of those.
The latest in line
to make an agreement like that.
So it's really a time
when I think from his point of view,
little choice.
So for for Hamas, it would be a success.
If you can talk about the murder
of so many civilians
as a success
in their in their calculus,
as if that Saudi deal
does not go through.
Saudi Arabia does not recognize
the state of Israel.
And also,
they have these hostages
who they have wanted to trade in the past
and I assume want to trade now.
Yeah, that's all true.
You know,
and we pressed him
on the sort of intelligible
strategic reasons.
You know,
did you do this because of Saudi Arabia?
Did you do this for prisoner exchanges?
And there wasn't a clear answer
because he was very frank
that he didn't think they could dissuade
Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia is going to do
what Saudi Arabia is going to do.
And yeah,
I'm sure they'll want to exchange
these prisoners.
But at the same time,
they this
this attack has brought an enormous,
enormous degree of pain on the Gaza
and part of the Palestinians
living in Gaza.
And when we pressed him
about how the strategic advantages,
the practical strategic
advantage of this attack
could justify that sacrifice,
his answers were very abstract,
very nebulous.
He was really looking towards
a very, very distant horizon.
All he could say was, you know, for years
they've been fighting on our territory
and killing us.
This time
we're fighting on their territory
for the first time, which is a
you know, it's a symbolic
victory of sorts, but it's not much.
We should point out
and you point this out in
in the article in The New Yorker,
which I encourage people to read.
He lied to you.
I mean, he denies
that civilians were targeted.
He denies that the
women and children were slaughtered.
He did say some things,
which we found unconvincing about that.
Yeah.
He said, you know, after the Hamas
fighters came in.
Others came in afterwards.
And it was those others
who did these misdeeds.
Yeah, that's true.
I didn't find that very convincing.
He's certainly
not the first military leader
to try to spin in that way.
If.
Is it clear to you
if Hamas expects Hezbollah
to open up a second front in this war?
It was clear
from what he said that they do not.
You know, obviously this is a war.
There's lots of misinformation.
But he was he seemed very candid.
We said, you know what,
if Hezbollah enters this, well,
what if it becomes a regional conflict?
And he said, quite frankly,
we wish, you know,
if only it could
become a regional conflict.
We would love that.
But we don't see any sign of it.
Hezbollah is going to more or less abide
by its cease fire with Israel, he said.
And he did not expect this war to expand
on that other front.
David Kirkpatrick, thank you so much.
It's good to have you on
the program again.",20231018

hg4m7bnDl0s,Breaking down what Biden said in Israel amid deadly Gaza hospital strike,data/en_CNN\Breaking down what Biden said in Israel amid deadly Gaza hospital strike.jpg,"President Biden here in Israel, in Tel
Aviv,
talking about many different things.
Number one,
that he supports unequivocally Israel
after that attack
on October 7th
and talked about his long history
with supporting this country
all the way back to the 1970s,
right before the Yom Kippur War.
Talking to Golda meir,
who was the prime minister
at the time, by the way,
the timing of that and the timing of this
almost exactly the same,
the anniversary of the
Yom Kippur War,
October 7th,
when the attack happened here.
That has really changed this nation
and changed his position
as well as changed what it is
willing to do to Hamas in Gaza.
They are trying to,
as all of the Israeli
officials have said, read
all of Gaza of Hamas.
I want to bring in our Kaitlan Collins,
who is standing by and was in the room,
our David Chalian as well,
and our Clarissa Ward,
who is here also in Israel with us.
Caitlin, I'm going to go to you first.
What stood out to you
in hearing from the president?
I mean,
this was another unequivocal support
of of Israel
from the president of the United States.
Yeah, he loves telling that story there.
At the end,
it was his first time here to
Israel's 1972,
one year
before, of course,
the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
It had this lasting effect on him.
He often
talks about sitting down with Golda meir
when she was the prime minister
of Israel.
Obviously, things are very different now.
Here he is returning
as the president of the United States.
Israel is at war.
He's the first U.S.
president to visit Israel
when it is at war,
something that the prime Minister
Netanyahu noted earlier today.
But as the president came out here
today, Sara, he did make news.
He said that Israel has agreed
to an agreement
to allow humanitarian
aid into Gaza through Egypt.
That has been something
that has been a hold up for
well over a week
now, despite international talks
to create some kind of channel
to allow that aid.
And you've heard
Egyptian officials
say they have trucks
waiting at that Rafah crossing.
That is the only way
to get into Gaza, through Egypt,
waiting to get in.
But it has been held up.
They have blamed the Israelis.
The Israelis have pushed back on that.
The question, of course,
the President Biden did not
note is the timing of that,
when will that aid begin to flow
into Gaza?
But he did say there is an agreement
and he also said that the U.S.
is going to provide $100 million
in assistance to Gaza
and to the West Bank.
Those are two notable developments
coming out of here.
One thing that we did ask
President Biden at the end,
as he did, as you're right,
he expressed that solidarity
with Israel once again,
which was something
his staff previewed on the way over here,
which was tough questions.
They said he was going to have
for the prime minister.
And when you talk to officials
about what
those tough questions could be,
they referenced what's next here.
If Israel does go into Gaza,
if there is that ground invasion,
what does the timing of that look like?
What is the objective of that
and what happens after that's over?
You heard Prime Minister Netanyahu
earlier warning
that this could be a long road
to victory was the phrase that he used.
Of course, the question is how long
and what it looks like after that.
That's President Biden left the room.
He did not answer that question.
He did issue another warning, though,
about one of his main concerns.
One of the biggest things that I've heard
from officials
that I've spoken to in recent days,
which is the idea
that this could escalate into a broader
regional conflict.
And that is only something
that has become
really more illuminated
in the last 24 hours
since that hospital was hit.
I do want to note
earlier today,
the president said
he did not believe it was Israel
that was behind that explosion
at that hospital in Gaza.
He said it was someone
from the other team.
Here he clarified those remarks.
He said he believed that
based on what he has heard
and what he has seen,
that it was an errant rocket
from a Palestinian terrorist group
so that is an update there
and a clarification there
from his earlier remark
that was not very clear
to what he believes it is.
And that terrorist group
that he is referring to,
Israel says it was Islamic
Jihad, not Hamas,
but it is another group
that exists there
that does not believe
in the existence of Israel itself.
I want to go now.
Thank you, Caitlin, for that.
Stick with us.
I'm going to go now to David Chalian.
David, can you tell us about the
just the significance that during
a officially declared war,
that the president of the United States
came into this country trying to get
some humanitarian work done,
coming to just show solidarity,
but just the significance of of him
being here
as we have seen rockets
coming into this country
every single day.
And night throughout.
Meantime, there are explosions
going on in Gaza at the same time
and a huge humanitarian crisis
going on there.
What's the significance
of him being here now?
Well, Sara, you
saw the president himself highlighted
that he was the first president
to visit Israel in a time of war.
He wanted to make sure
everybody understood that it is
indeed a significant move.
And I think it was so clear
what he was doing throughout his remarks.
The whole first half,
as you and Caitlin were discussing,
was that complete
repetition of that
total solidarity with Israel
standing side by side
in total support of Israel.
And I think
when you talk to folks
around the president,
what they believe
that position does
is allow him
to go into the second
half of his remarks,
which was to call on the better angels
and the humanitarian sympathies
of the people of Israel,
and not to get to consumed
by their passions and anger in response
to the terrorist attacks,
and that they keep in mind
who they are as a people.
As he was trying to express the need
for humanitarian assistance, for
the ability for Israel to
by urging some restraint.
And I think when you
when you look at the remarks
and how they were structured,
you see a president of the United States
doing that
very thing we've been talking about,
which is threading a needle here.
Obviously, time will tell.
The future will only tell us
if that is successful.
But it's clear
that's what
the objective was in its visit
And putting a button
on the visit with these remarks.
Yeah,
diplomacy is of the utmost importance
here,
but very, very difficult to actually,
as you put it, thread that needle.
I want to go now
to Clarissa Ward,
who is here with me in Israel.
I am curious from your perspective,
after hearing what you did
about the humanitarian breakthrough.
Hopefully, although it has not happened
and Gaza by
the hour is getting more
and more desperate
for the civilians there.
What how do you think that the
Arab world,
you know, Jordan,
people in Jordan,
people who are protesting right now
in Beirut,
and the response in the West Bank,
how they're going to react
to hearing
the president's comments
from Tel Aviv today.
I think the reactions
will not be positive.
This will be seen as a full
throated endorsement
of Israel and of Israel's
comportment over the last ten days, which
obviously Arab countries have denounced.
I think there will be a lot of talk
about what wasn't said.
There was no call for restraint.
There was no call for a cease fire.
It's important
to remind viewers
that the leaders of these Arab
countries have many young people
who are now impassioned
and outraged and upset
and are taking to the streets.
And so they have to be seen
as taking a hard stance,
as supporting the Palestinian people.
They are also trying,
just like President Biden,
to thread the needle, if you will.
He did say, as you
mentioned, that
there has been some agreement
on the Israeli side
to allow the passage of aid
into Gaza with the
proviso that Hamas does not divert
that aid.
But he also said that he hoped
that would happen
as soon as possible,
with no real clarity or sense
of when that might be.
And I agree with David
that he did issue as well
some gentle warnings to Israel
after the first half of the speech,
which was all about this
remarkable display of solidarity
with Israel.
He said,
We have felt that rage after 911.
We learned from mistakes
that were made after 911.
I believe his quote was,
while you feel that rage,
don't be consumed about it.
And make sure that you have clarity
about your objectives,
that is obviously urging Israel's leaders
to think very strategically
and very clearly about what comes next.
Everybody has been waiting for
quite some time
now for this much
anticipated ground invasion.
There are very real questions,
I think, being asked by world leaders
from many different countries
about what that looks like,
what the tangible result
would be of that.
The Israelis have said
they want to essentially dismantle
and uproot Hamas once and for all.
But still, questions remain.
How do you go about doing that?
Who steps in to fill the void afterwards?
We have heard previously
President Biden
say in an interview on 60 Minutes
that he does not think
it would be a good idea
for Israel to try to rearm, occupy Gaza.
And so I think just a subtle warning
that now is also a time to
take a deep breath
and think very,
very clearly
about what the next moves might be
and what the ramifications
of those might be.
And also a very stern warning,
presumably to Iran,
to Hezbollah, to others in the region
who might be watching this moment,
he said, who might be
thinking of attacking Israel.
He said, quote, Don't, don't, don't.
Sarah.
Yeah, some incredibly
salient points from you there.
Clarissa Ward in Ashkelon,
Caitlin Collins here in Tel Aviv,
and David Chalian in Washington.
Thank you to you all.",20231018

There were no injuries there

Right now

hundreds of protesters
are gathered in the streets

security barriers near the U.S.
embassy.
And these are live. Okay.
So I can't it's
difficult for me to see where
I'm from, my vantage point.
But, yes,
these are live pictures
happening right now.
You see lots of smoke.
You see people in the streets.
They are clearly, clearly terribly upset
about what is happening
next door to Lebanon.
In Gaza in particular,
you can hear the chants,
hundreds of people.
Let's
bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman,
who is in south Lebanon live for us.
Ben, can you just give us a sense
of what you've been seeing on the ground
and what you've been hearing
from from your sources
about these protests?
Well, we're hearing some
large explosions
just to the south of here
near the border with Israel.
But these protests
are very much reflective of
many people in Lebanon, particularly.
It's been simmering
since the 7th of October,
but particularly
since that strike on the hospital in Gaza
yesterday.
Last night, we saw protests outside
the US embassy.
It's north of Beirut.
It's actually not in Beirut.
It's about eight miles north of Beirut.
And of course, again,
we're seeing it today
with protesters
throwing rocks
and shooting fireworks
at the Lebanese police.
Police
responding with water cannons
and lots and lots of tear gas.
It's important to keep in mind
that behind
those barriers, it's
about half a mile up the hill to the US
embassy itself.
There's another explosion
and this embassy is highly fortified.
The staff
are allowed to simply walk out the door
and enjoy the pleasures of Beirut
because of security concerns.
Now, speaking of the embassy,
the State Department has said that
the families of US embassy staff members
and non-emergency
personnel are now authorized
to leave the country
should they so desire on a case
by case basis.
The United States has also advised
Americans not to travel to Lebanon,
and we're seeing a similar advisory
coming out of France as well.
Now, regarding the situation
in south Lebanon.
And we've had two strikes
by Hezbollah on Israeli positions.
Hezbollah puts out
videos of these strikes,
and it appears that, among other things,
they have struck a tank.
Overnight,
we heard a fair amount of explosions.
There's another one in the distance.
I don't know if you can pick that up,
but certainly reflective of the ongoing
tensions here on the border
between Lebanon and Israel. Sara?
Ben, you
have been in this region
for a very long time.
And just to get your sense of things,
for example, during the second intifada,
what things look like in places
like Beirut
and in places
like Jordan in comparison
to what we are seeing now,
because Jordan also has a huge number
of Palestinians that live in Jordan
and that have reacted in a very big way
to what has happened in Gaza.
All of these protests coming,
of course, after a hospital was struck
by someone.
We do not know who at this point in time,
we have not independently confirmed
any of it, but Israel blaming
Islamic Jihad
and, of course, Hamas blaming
Israeli airstrikes.
Can you give us some sense
of just context
of what we're seeing now
in neighboring countries to Israel?
You?
Well, what we're seeing is
where it's boiling over
the anger
that people have been watching
very closely, intensely,
what's going on in Gaza.
There's been scattered protests,
but certainly yesterday
I think that anger boiled over.
It boiled over in Amman,
where protesters
went to the Israeli embassy,
set fires around it, tried to get in,
but were pushed back by Jordanian police.
In Ramallah, Ramallah
is a particularly important city place.
It's essentially
the capital
of the Palestinian Authority there.
We saw
protesters clashing
with Palestinian security forces.
The protesters were calling
were condemning
what is happening in Gaza.
But in addition to that,
they were calling for
the downfall of Mahmoud Abbas,
the 87 year
old president
of the Palestinian Authority,
who many Palestinians see as ineffectual.
He's been passive
during this current war.
He doesn't seem to have any sway
with the Israelis
who don't respect the system of of zones,
the areas that exist in the West
Bank, where
in theory,
the Palestinian Authority
is supposed to be in control.
But the Israeli security forces
go in as they
please without any coordination
with the Palestinians.
In short,
it's a very shaky regime in the West Bank
and much of the anger,
in addition to being directed
at Israel, is directed at what is seen
as a corrupt and ineffectual
Palestinian Authority. Sara,
really good reporting,
really good contacts.
Thank you so much, Ben Wedeman,
for being there on the ground.
Are you still hearing some munitions,
it sounds like, behind you
are scattered.
Yes.
But at this very moment, no matter.
Okay.
All right.
Keeping
you and your crew
as safe as possible
in these difficult conditions.
Thank you, Ben.
Kate, I'm
going to go ahead and
send it back to you.
I just want to mention
we are watching these live pictures
of an extraordinary number of people
who have come out to the streets.
This is in Beirut.
We are watching this live.
People reacting,
so upset to see what has happened,
particularly in the hospital
strike that has,
according to Hamas,
killed hundreds of people,
including obviously
patients, men, women and children.",20231018

THV_OuzC9jM,Military analyst breaks down Israeli evidence in Gaza hospital blast,data/en_CNN\Military analyst breaks down Israeli evidence in Gaza hospital blast.jpg,"And for a closer look at what we do know
and what we don't about this blast,
I want to bring in CNN
military analyst, retired
Lieutenant General Mark Hertling here.
General, look,
we have some video
here, and I want you to
just take a look at this.
This is some footage that seems to show
a rocket going up here
and then something happens.
That's pretty catastrophic
when you see this.
What do you see?
I see a flame out of a rocket
and we've been talking about this
all day.
You know,
and it's a result of
what happened yesterday.
But when you see that rocket
going forward,
this happens a lot
with these kind of rocket
that are supplied by Iran.
It is a rocket motor that doesn't work.
It gets a certain distance
and then it just flamed out
and a rocket has a trajectory of a brick.
Once it doesn't have a force behind it,
so it immediately drops.
So you see it, right?
This is a slow motion there.
Video flame out. Yeah.
So it loses its rocket motor
and then it just drops down.
But what you also have
when that happens is the fuel.
That's part of the rocket
that hasn't burned.
So when it hits the ground,
we'll see next year
the explosion of an explosion
from a viewpoint from the ground.
Now, this isn't a very big piece
of ordnance.
It's a relatively small ordnance.
So the the
the actual explosive isn't that big.
But what is big
is the fuel that it hasn't used.
That caused a lot of cars
in that parking lot to burn.
We see the after effects of that.
We see a very small crater.
If it heads in a crater,
actually take a look
at what you're discussing here.
I'm going to just break this down
a little bit more for folks.
This what I'm showing you here,
this has to be clear,
provided by the IDF.
This shows
what looks like
satellite imagery of the area
where this rocket
may have come down.
Right. This is the explosion site.
They're saying that
if you look over here,
this is what typically you would see
if there was an IDF strike,
even as large
as 19 meters, a much larger crater.
It doesn't seem like we see that here.
And we also have some before
and after images here.
This is the hospital,
the Al-Ahly Hospital.
This is the explosion site
in this area here.
And here it is after.
So you were just discussing
the size of the crater.
We don't
some of the images are not super clear.
No. Whether there was a crater or not.
But when you look at this,
this is up close of the cars
and the side of the fire.
What do you see?
Well,
what I saw earlier
today was a photo of a very small crater
about right here, about right there.
What you see in this
area are a lot of burned cars.
What you see over here are cars
that are not burned.
What you see across at this building,
if you had a picture of the
building, which I think we do
know, I'm sorry,
we don't have an up
close of the building,
but we do have
what we do see
is pockmarks on the side of the building.
Look at this video here.
And it's well, and it will show up here.
You see the burning car.
But is the camera scans over here,
you'll see cars that aren't burned.
Yeah, very close.
So it had an effect of the explosive
capability of a rocket,
which is relatively small,
but a lot of fuel blowing up after it.
That didn't burn off the rocket motor.
So this is evidence of
certainly not a bomb
that would come off of an aircraft.
You see the pockmarks,
the blown out windows,
but not a whole lot else.
I mean, there's not
a whole lot of damages to the building.
Now, the doctors inside of the building
said that there were patients
that were injured
that could have been from the blast
glass flying inside of the building.
But it certainly wasn't
a strike on the hospital itself.
And just briefly,
if you were to have seen a strike,
a true strike coming from Israel,
I want to also,
just as I'm saying,
this show you, this is
an image that
shows, according to the IDF,
the trajectory of this rocket.
And it comes from somewhere
inside of northern Gaza and it goes
this direction across east.
What you have here is something
called a point of origin.
That's where the rocket was fired from.
Right. Where that red dot is.
You see multiple tracers
coming off of those.
Those are the different rockets
that come out of that rocket pod.
The one that came out right here
came out over the hospital. And I.
I believe that that was the one that lost
its engine
and fell on close to the hospital,
not on the hospital.
So this is part of the proof
that the Israeli Defense Forces gave.
They said, hey, here,
this is something called a QS 36 radar.
They use these radars
to connect with the Iron Dome
to shoot down rockets.
So when you see
all these coming off of a missile site
and one dropping
over the top of a hospital,
you can see where it was
truthfully,
an accident,
a missile that that didn't go through
to to its final mission. Yeah.
And as you pointed out
many times,
these are Iranian provided missiles.
They they tend to do that.
General Mark Hertling,
thank you very much
for breaking all of that down for us.
And President Biden
reflecting on the difficult decisions
ahead for Israel's leaders.
Here is part of what he said.
I made wartime decisions.
I know the choices
are never clear or easy
for the leadership.
There's always cost.
That requires being delivered.
It requires asking very hard questions.
It requires clarity about the objectives
and an honest assessment
about whether the path you're on
will achieve those objectives.
Now,
the vast
majority of Palestinians are not Hamas.
Hamas does not represent
the Palestinian people.
I want to bring in now
Aviv Ezra, a senior Israeli diplomat
at the New York
consulate and a former consul
general in Chicago.
Aviv, thank you for being here.
This incident has had
real ripple effects.
And putting aside for a moment
any dispute about who's responsible
and who's not.
We just broke that down.
Has it altered
Israel's plans
for a ground invasion of Gaza?
Well, the way we see it,
this is actually a triple war crime.
On the one
hand, they're sending missiles
from population areas into Gaza.
They're shooting at population,
innocent civilians in Israel.
And thirdly,
when they misfire,
they hit their own population
in the Gaza Strip.
So for us,
this is not only a triple war crime.
It is something that later on that
took a life of its own
into the conversation of who is in charge
and the fake news
that came out of it
with the attack on the station
last 24 hours ago
created a situation
where Israel was guilty
before we finish it.
But I'm sure you can imagine
that that is likely to happen here.
Does the fallout from this,
even if it's as a
result of misinformation,
change the calculus for Israel
as it tries to decide what happens
if there is a ground invasion
and whether that is
something that can be done
or should be done right now?
Well, for Israel,
it's pretty clear
that we have to make sure
that what happened in October
seven would not happen again.
Therefore, we want to make sure that we
extract the pricetag from the period
from Hamas's
the price
tag from the Israeli people
to the Palestinian people,
because they mourn really
the brunt of the burden. Correct.
So we want to differentiate
between the Palestinian people and Hamas.
And like the president said,
Hamas does not represent
the Palestinian people.
Hamas is a terror
organization, a vicious,
barbaric terrorist concession
that needs to pay a price.
And by the way,
when we talk about free Gaza,
I think they talk about
free Gaza from Hamas.
So we
we are doing everything we can
to make sure
to make that differentiation.
We open corridors, safe
corridors, to have the
innocent population go down south.
We invested for days.
We are waiting to make sure
that they make it, that we create safe
shelters over there.
We actually have,
on the other hand, Hamas
pushing them back into the war zone
by that, creating another world.
Do you understand
why there is so much distrust
in the Arab
world of
the information
coming from the IDF
and the narrative about
what happened in this hospital blast?
And how is Israel going to deal
with the fact that some of that distrust
comes from a real place?
Because there have been past incidents
in which the IDF has given
incorrect information?
Well, the IDF, I think, is
most of the time
that we are focused
on investigating and understanding
what happened. It takes time.
This is what happened this time around.
This is what happened in the past.
When we get it wrong, we try to fix it.
And sometimes we also
try to fix things that
that we have got wrong in the past.
I think credibility is crucial here.
We are
comparing between a
liberal democracy
with checks and balances
and a terror organization.
And I think at this time
it's black and white.
We have to, first of all, stand
by Israel, like the president said.
All right.
Ezra, thank you very much for joining us.
We appreciate it. Thank you so much.",20231019
zW76wr0SA3E,Dad wants the world to hear this chilling call of his daughter being kidnapped,data/en_CNN\Dad wants the world to hear this chilling call of his daughter being kidnapped.jpg,"It's been
nearly two weeks since Hamas militants
abducted dozens
and dozens of hostages in Israel,
and their families are growing desperate.
More tonight from my colleague
Erin Burnett, who's in Tel Aviv Erin.
Abbi, it has been 12 days
since those hostages were abducted.
I mean, you have to think about what
they've been enduring in that time,
we understand, maybe held in tunnels.
Who knows what the circumstances are?
And of course,
their families are desperate
for any sign of their loved ones.
They all tell us
they just want a sign of life,
any kind of a sign of life.
Earlier today,
I had a chance to talk
to the parents of two of the hostages,
Maya and E.J. Regev.
They were both abducted by Hamas
at the music festival.
At least 260 people were killed,
of course, at that festival,
and their parents
thought they were among them.
At first,
their father played me
a harrowing phone call
from his daughter,
Maya,
as she came face to
face with Hamas terrorists,
to my husband to
I can hold
onto my call and
my thought
I've heard that.
But I guess that's my effort.
Their method, my
coping
with
whatever she said.
She over
30 wanted to hear my sense of humor
the only bad moments to see me coming
out
you know,
I the suffering
took some water,
some water
some hummus,
the form of
I felt she was the
I thought both of them did
the most.
My son, both both of my child in the car
he chose to kill me.
To kill me. I love you, Bob.
I love you.
The AP, obviously,
it's incredible to watch that.
You can see Marines reaction.
And Alon, of course,
the heartbreak
but they wanted the world to hear
that call.
Ilan had not listened to it
since he actually spoke to his daughter.
Marie had not heard it until that moment.
And you could see her
steeling herself to hear it.
But she wanted the world to hear it
because they want the world to know.
They they also told me
that they saw video on social media
a very brief
one from Hamas that showed their son
taken hostage.
And they haven't seen any video
of their daughter,
although they say
that Israeli authorities
just a few days ago
told them the Israeli army came
and told them on Monday night
that both of their children
are being held in Gaza.
So they thought it
obviously very important
that the Israeli government, Avi,
knew that but the Israeli army refused
to tell them
exactly how they know this information.
But, of course,
I mean,
you can see the anguish
and the pain
as those parents wait and wait
and pray for a sign
of life of their children.",20231019
wG8UShiEHYo,Lebanese militant groups and Israel exchange fire across border,data/en_CNN\Lebanese militant groups and Israel exchange fire across border.jpg,"The Israel
Defense Forces say
it is seeing a significant escalation
on the border with
Lebanon and has been striking back
after some 20 rockets
or so were fired toward Israel.
Today, the Iran backed militant group
Hezbollah says it also attacked
five Israeli military post.
A spokesperson for the IDF
says that tells CNN
that Hezbollah is trying to drag Lebanon
into the conflict,
certainly something people in the region
have been worried about.
CNN's Ben Wedeman is in southern Lebanon
for CNN. Right now.
Ben, what have you been seeing as there
is this concern
that if Israel does, if
and when embark on this ground invasion,
that the fighting could increase
and then Lebanon
could get pulled into this war
Now, Caitlin,
we're hearing a lot of this
cross-border fire
today wasn't just Hezbollah.
There was
focusing mainly on Israeli
military positions
along the border,
but also the military
wing of Hamas got involved
and they claimed to have fired
30 rockets into the upper Galilee region.
But it's important to keep in
mind that
even though certainly
we are seeing more cross-border
fire on this in this area, than perhaps
2006 during that war back then.
But Hezbollah is being very careful
to keep it
within certain limits
to avoid a full scale war.
It seems to be wanting to show
that it is supporting Hamas by doing some
action here without going all the way.
Keep in mind
that this just a few months ago,
the Israeli defense minister said that
if Hezbollah decides
to launch a war on Israel, Israel will
bomb Lebanon back into the Stone Age.
So there is a certain hesitance
and certainly in this area where we are.
There is nervousness
about the possibility
of a full scale war.
We spoke with a shopkeeper here
who told us that
he has his bags packed in his car
ready to go in the event that things
go really south.
So there is nervousness.
But at the moment,
I think
a certain level of violence without going
too far is being maintained here.
Caitlin.
Yeah.
And that's really interesting
given the idea that I mean,
if you see these strikes
going back and forth,
something you say
we haven't seen in 20 years.
And I should note
we're hearing
a little bit of activity here right now
in Tel Aviv. We'll be monitoring that.
But but you're saying
what Hezbollah is doing
is maybe a little bit, but not enough
to provoke Israel.
And that is not the sense
of what's
actually happening on the ground,
what their decision making is
Yes.
I mean,
they are doing
I mean, what we're seeing really in terms
of Hezbollah's
capabilities
is really just the tip of the iceberg.
These are very localized attacks.
They're not lobbing missiles into that
in the direction of large
Israeli population centers.
We're getting
Hezbollah is putting out
videos every day.
They're
they seem to be focusing
on communications,
surveillance and observation equipment.
On the Israeli side, occasionally
hitting tanks and troops as well.
But it's really very military
in its focus,
not what we're seeing,
for instance, in coming out of Gaza.
This is very specific
Caitlin.
Yeah.
And clearly the best,
though, seems worried
that it could go from the state
of where it is right now
to something bigger
because this warning
came out from the State Department
telling Americans who are in Lebanon
leave the country as soon as possible.
They're worried
there may not be commercial options
to do so.
As soon or in the near stage, I guess.
I mean, have you sensed a change
in how people feel?
Are they going about everyday life
or do you think
do you sense something different
since you've been on the ground
Well, certainly in this area
along the border, there is nervousness.
Some people have already left.
Others have left and come back
because
they can't afford
to hang out in hotels in Beirut.
But certainly in general,
if you're talking about Lebanon,
there is nervousness.
And it's not just the US government,
the UK Germany, Australia, Saudi Arabia
and others
have told their nationals in Lebanon
that it's a good time to leave
now while they're still flights
keep in mind
that in 2006
at the beginning of the war
between Hezbollah
and Israel,
one of the first things Israel struck
was the airport in Beirut.
It's also important
to keep in mind that when we're talking
about nationals
of the US,
Australia, U.K., Germany, Canada
and whatnot,
there are
hundreds of thousands of Lebanese
who have dual passports.
So it's not just tourists
who are here or businessmen.
There are a lot of Lebanese
who hold these passports as well.
And in 2006, all of these countries
had to send ships
to take their nationals out
And so we're talking about
not just a few thousand,
we are talking about
hundreds of thousands of people
who in theory should leave.
But many of them are obviously connected
to their land, to their homeland,
and won't be leaving.
But we're not talking about a small
number of people. Caitlin.
Yeah.
A difficult decision for a region that is
certainly on edge.",20231019

ONLY HAS SHE NOT UPDATED FROM
HER POST, SHE TOOK THE STAGE TO
ADDRESS PROTESTORS AND ISSUED A

AND YOU NEED TO WAKE UP AND
UNDERSTAND THAT!

LIKE THIS AND WE STILL STAND BY

WE WILL REMEMBER THIS.
&gt;&gt; AND THE CONGRESSMAN'S TWEET
BLAMING ISRAEL FOR WHAT HAPPENED
IS STILL UP.
CNN'S JESSICA DEAN JOINS ME NOW.
SO, JESSICA, DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN
VERY EAGER TO HIGHLIGHT THE
EMBARRASSING DYSFUNCTION OF
HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHEN IT COMES
TO THE SPEAKER CRISIS, BUT THESE
ARE SOME TENSIONS THAT WE'RE
SEEING AMONG HOUSE DEMOCRATS ON
THIS ISSUE OF ISRAEL AND THE
PALESTINIANS AS WELL.
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE SEEING THOSE FAULT
LINES AND I TALKED TO SEVERAL
HOUSE DEMOCRATS TODAY AND ONE
TOLD ME IN THEIR WORDS THAT HER
COLLEAGUES ARE FURIOUS.
YES, THAT THEY'RE VERY
FRUSTRATED.
IT'S NOT JUST PUBLIC PERCEPTION
OVER THIS.
THEY THINK THESE SORTS OF
COMMENTS THAT GO AGAINST U.S.
INTELLIGENCE ARE DANGEROUS IN A
WAY BY SPREADING THAT MESSAGE.
AND THEY PUT IT TO ME THIS WAY.
THEY SAID WHY IS SHE BELIEVING
HAMAS' WORD OVER THE U.S.
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES?
AND THERE IS I'M TOLD A PUSH FOR
HER TO SIT FOR AN INTELLIGENCE
BRIEFING AND SEE THE
INTELLIGENCE HERSELF WITH THE
HOPE THAT THAT WILL INFORM SOME
MESSAGING GOING FORWARD.
I DID ASK IF SHE HAS DONE THAT
OR HAS PLANS.
I'VE NOT GOTTEN A RESPONSE FROM
THEM.
WE KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR
COLLEAGUES HAVE COMPLAINED TO
THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER IN THE
HOUSE, HAKEEM JEFFRIES, ABOUT
THIS.
I TALKED TO ANOTHER DEMOCRAT WHO
SAID WE'VE SEEN THE HOUSE
DEMOCRATS RANGE FROM BEING
OUTSPOKEN ON THIS.
DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ SAID
THIS WAS A VILE POSITION TO
TAKE.
OTHERS ARE STANDING BACK TO GIVE
HER SOME ROOM TO PERHAPS WALK
THIS BACK.
BUT THEY SAID THAT FETTERMAN
TWEET THAT YOU JUST READ IN THE

HOW A LOT OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS
FEEL RIGHT NOW.
&gt;&gt; I TALKED TO A U.S. SENATOR
WHO ATTENDED A CLASSIFIED
BRIEFING WHO SAID THE CLASSIFIED
INTELLIGENCE MAKES IT CLEAR
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WAS
PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, BUT
ARE DEMOCRATS AFRAID THAT IF
THEY CALL OUT CONGRESSWOMAN
TALIB THAT THEY WILL ALIENATE
AND ANGER THE PROGRESSIVE BASE
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT IS
FAR MORE CRITICAL OF ISRAEL?
&gt;&gt; FAR MORE CRITICAL OF ISRAEL
AND HAS BEEN PART OF THE
DEMOCRATIC COALITION IN WINNING
THESE ELECTIONS IN THE LAST
SEVERAL CYCLES.
SO THEY HAVE BEEN A CRITICAL
PART TO THE DEMOCRATIC
COALITION.
THE SENSE I'M GETTING FROM
TALKING TO PEOPLE IS THERE IS
FRUSTRATION THOUGH BUBBLING AND
WHAT I'M INTERESTED TO SEE IS
OVER THE NEXT DAY OR TWO IF SHE
CONTINUES TO HOLD ON TO THIS.

ISRAEL HAS BEEN CONDUCTING
RAIDING IN THE WEST BANK AS IT
WAGES THIS WAR AGAINST HAMAS.
HOW EXTENSIVE ARE THESE ISRAELI
MILITARY OPERATIONS?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: VERY EXTENSIVE TO
SAY THE LEAST.
THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAID THAT
IT HAD BEEN CONDUCTING WIDE
SCALE WHAT IT CALLS
COUNTERTERRORISM ACTIVITY IN THE
WEST BANK WHERE THEY HAVE
ARRESTED MORE THAN 60
PALESTINIANS IN THE LAST DAY OR
SO.
I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT THE
TENSIONS IN THE WEST BANK VERY,
VERY HIGH.
ESPECIALLY AFTER THAT BLAST AT
THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE THE
PALESTINIANS BASICALLY DO NOT
BELIEVE THE ISRAELI EVIDENCE OR
ISRAELI MILITARY INTELLIGENCE
THAT ISRAEL WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT BLAST.
AND THEY DON'T BELIEVE U.S.
INTELLIGENCE THAT SEEMS TO AT
THIS POINT CONFIRM THE ISRAELI
INTELLIGENCE.
THEY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS
UNDERTAKEN BY ISRAEL AND THAT IS
SOMETHING THAT THEY CERTAINLY
CANNOT FORGIVE AND HAVE BEEN OUT
PROTESTING IN VERY LARGE
NUMBERS.
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SMALLER
SCALE CLASHES THAT HAVE ENDED IN
DEATHS OF PALESTINIANS.
THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITIES SAY
THERE WERE ABOUT SEVEN
PALESTINIANS WHO HAVE BEEN
KILLED OVERNIGHT DURING ONE OF
THOSE RAIDS BY THE ISRAELI
MILITARY.
AND SO, YOU KNOW, THE ISRAELI
MILITARY SAYS IN THAT OPERATION
IN TOKARENE, THEY WENT INTO A
REFUGEE CAMP AND ENDED UP
ARRESTING ABOUT TEN PEOPLE
THERE.
SEVEN PALESTINIANS ACCORDING TO
THE PA, WERE KILLED.
THAT IS JUST RATCHETING UP THE
TENSIONS AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE IN
THE WEST BANK, WHICH IS NOT RUN
BY HAMAS.
IT IS RUN BY WHAT THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
RECOGNIZES AS THE LEADER OF THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, THE
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, WOLF.
&gt;&gt; HOW FEARFUL ARE PALESTINIANS
ON THE WEST BANK OF ISRAELI
SETTLER VIOLENCE?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THERE HAVE BEEN AN
UPTICK, A BIG UPTICK, OF
VIOLENCE BY SETTLERS AGAINST
PALESTINIANS.
I DON'T KNOW IF THE WORD IS
FEAR, BUT IT'S MORE ANGER.
IT'S MORE RAGE IN HAVING TO DEAL
WITH THAT AS WELL.
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN
AN UPTICK BECAUSE OF THIS GROUP
NAMED BAIT SALEM AND OTHERS
LOOKING AT THE ACTIVITY OF
SETTLERS IN THE AREA WHICH HAS
ALWAYS BEEN A FLASH POINT OF
PALESTINIANS EVERYWHERE, BUT
PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST BANK.
I WANTED TO LET YOU SEE WHAT
BAIT SALEM GROUP, THIS GROUP
THAT TRACKS SETTLER VIOLENCE,
THAT BELIEVES IT'S A FULL

TO END.
THEY SAY THE SETTLER VIOLENCE
AGAINST PALESTINIANS HAS RISEN
IN BOTH FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY

do what we were training for,
I think, for years,
but that's not exactly
what we were training for.
I mean, for years,
the fact that
we have those squads in every kibbutz
is to prevent like a small
to to intercept a small group
of terrorists
may be trying to do something
very pinpointed,
not a full military assault
with numbers, with dozens of terrorists
coming to us, with anti-tank
anti-tank missiles.
Altogether more than 30 destination
is that around 35
terrorists were
participating in participating
in the three assaults on the kibbutz.
It all began, of course, around
630 in the morning.
You were sleeping?
Yeah.
You and your wife and me.
And my wife.
In the second floor,
we start with the missile.
And the missile. And
I said to my wife, I
think I hear a missile.
She said, Yeah, I hear this also.
So we on to the to the first floor,
and then we got the missile
on the second floor to hit your house.
Yeah.
Come from the roof and blow everything.
And then.
Then the smoke
start to go
down, open the bomb shelter,
run to the second floor with
two to see if there is fire or something
like this.
And I see that there is no fire.
Suddenly,
I thought we were shooting all around.
I said to Avi, It's not normal.
Do you have radios?
Are you texting?
How are you figuring where each other?
We have radios, but
quite in the beginning,
some of them were malfunctioning already.
The
two just
exactly.
Everybody was.
And what happened?
Because it was
it wasn't actually even going through.
So afterwards, it's ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
So you were really operating alone.
Each of you alone in a cell
basically is basically is at some points.
I had the connection at some points,
although most of
they didn't have any connection.
The radios work.
I didn't know they had a battle.
They were in the other side
of the kibbutz.
I couldn't hear them
because there were three points.
I couldn't hear them.
I had no idea
they were in a battle until noon, maybe
because I wasn't there.
Ghaith But you were at the gate.
They tried to come in the vehicle gate,
and I know and very
we saw
all the burnt out cars
they used to block.
You were able to stop that,
but they burst
through the pedestrian gate.
We have
we have footage of some of this
from the security cameras.
They were actually they were actually
you know,
they were actually shooting
anti-tank missiles on the gate
so that there's
an actual carnage
going on outside the gate.
People are trying to rush
in from the party, people
that were just driving there,
right there,
trying to come in for safety, come in
the gate gates close.
They cannot see the terrorists
and they just go outside
and run through the gate.
And they're being shot
at from short distance,
from down
the terrace of the gate
or trying to come in.
These people are rushing.
So they basically just yeah,
they're it's like picking them off
as they run in
there are actually taking cover
around the gate
from the outside
and finding them
and firing at those civilians.
That's running through the gate
and stabbing them
after they were shot down
to make sure they're dead
and they are engaging.
There is a small army
unit, this bomb shelter outside the gate.
Some of the party
members were hiding there.
So you can see
a group of their is going
and doing their massacre there
and they throw the hand grenades
into the shelter. Yes.
You can see in the movie
the security moves.
You can see the hand of the
they always drove
through hand grenades inside.
So I went down the solo
and starting
moving towards towards the main gate,
but not in a straight line.
I mean, I went through the houses.
I got to parking lot number two
that it's like on the
and there is a hill, a small hill over
watching it but from outside
and there were two, three guys
wearing black.
Looking at the road
I wasn't sure
if this is real people
or maybe I don't know what
And the moment they turned around
they saw AK 47.
So that's how you get of 16?
Yes, all of it is.
We don't use a 47.
So when you you know,
that's not immediate signal
that that that's not us.
I show that this group,
one of them got hit.
The other one,
the other two is scattered.
Do you have any idea how many
obviously, you have M16.
Do you have magazines? But
just a sense of this went on for hours.
How many bullets did you even shoot?
I mean, given
even idea of what you know, you know,
we should have, you know, the hundreds.
I want 240 bullets.
I knew that
I have only a six magazines
and I counted every bullet.
I knew that A, I cannot shoot like
I have a back up or something like that.
So I've been shooting every
every bullet has its only target.
I didn't try just to make them lie.
Right.
And you had to shoot.
You would shoot to kill.
I had to shoot to kill.
So I know you all know you've seen these.
This this is what was found on them.
I mean, at least on somebody, right?
This is their plans.
I mean, of what they were going to do.
I just
was reading through it.
I mean, it's dated October 2022.
They were
I mean,
if that they were planning
for a whole year.
The details in here.
Ellie,
I want to ask you about
one specific thing.
I mean, they knew everything about your
except our names,
but they put their phone numbers in here.
They put,
you know, the task boots,
Mafiosi raid, Plan B 14.
I mean, it's military grade specified.
God is great.
The Badr
Brigades, they label it all
but it but at the top they
they have, you know,
the cameras that are going to be visible.
Who is going to come to help you.
They knew the tank brigade.
But it's this part
I wanted to ask you all about.
This was exactly what they planned
to do inside the kibbutz,
the duty of
where they were supposed to go,
what street numbers, everything.
They know where the generator is.
It is an adjoining area.
And did they
did you now that you see this
and you saw them,
were they trying to execute this plan?
Exactly. Exactly.
Their plan was actually to engage
the security group
to open the main gates
to allow vehicles in
to sabotage
the main power and the generator
and to make as much casualties for
for from
from the security team
and to allow the second wave to go in.
And and the fact that they they know
the exact street
where to go to,
where the generator is and stated it.
I mean, it's street
by street, street by street.
That's exactly where they were executing.
Exactly.
They they came to the exact points
where the gates are.
For instance,
the point beside my house is
the gate is the sound. Okay.
It's a small gate disclosed
in the Hayden gates In the plan,
I actually saw a page
which I saw with the
symbols there
is actually arrows, arrows gate
like when you sit here now
and you think about it, that they they
they didn't just plan and train.
I mean this is
I mean this is a military
I mean this is it said
how do you even react to that?
This took its dates October 20, 22.
It's terrifying because
it is a military plan that
they combattants
the terrorists trained on.
It was quite clear
they knew exactly what they are doing.
They were disciplined.
This is a military great planning
to make very terrifying,
very great information.
Learn great.
You need inside information.
A lot of information.
It's not only Google Earth, what we know.
We know that
the many people from Gaza,
also from the West Bank,
come to the kibbutz to work
and to be in the house.
Dozens were inside, inside
schools, everything.
So there are all these plans,
a very specific, very information
from inside
someone that come to the kibbutz
every day.
We avoid talking about it, make locations
in the and give information to the
I mean
the faction advances from Street 49,
then Street 50,
then the Junction Club,
all Marvel Cinemas gate.
This is I mean,
they gave them
they gave them a rose inside the kibbutz.
You cannot see it from outside.
You cannot see it. Right.
So they
they would have had to have
someone had it.
Is that doesn't
really solve a civil
level of the property,
but don't give them a film of it.
We even right now, I don't know. What do
I not know what I can tell?
I cannot tell each and every.
But they did it
and they do it and they do.
And so we
we tend to think like an army does.
It is if we share some
information from inside the kibbutz.
But you saw outside your gates
what happened.
So the world understands.
Can you
can you just talk about
what happened, what you saw?
I mean, just,
you know, massacre in in in every sense
of the word massacre, Uh,
bloodthirsty.
It's not just.
Okay, Target killing is down.
Continue.
No, no, they they butchered the.
It was
a barbaric in every sense.
There's no need for 550 rounds of the guy
that's already dead on the floor.
Okay? There's no need for it.
I can tell you that. That one of the most
terrible, I think
few minutes in this day
was actually when we went
out of the kibbutz men.
David, families.
We went up to the kibbutz
at about three, three in the morning,
and there was no electricity
also on the road,
meaning was a complete darkness.
And we went outside the gate of our house
the minute they told us to drive
very fast, only to the north,
and we were driving like crazy and
from the gates
we told immediately
the children,
You are lying down on the floor.
Don't look out of the windows
in front of the gate.
There were burnt cars that
I've you can imagine in sheer darkness.
We were driving on the road,
which is the driving way through our
to our home.
I mean, like every day
was I was riding like that
between dead bodies.",20231020

signs this morning

could move into Gaza at any minute.
CNN has seen a buildup of military
right along the border
and now flares late into the night.
This comes as Israeli
government officials
tell CNN's Nic Robertson
that the troops have the,
quote, green light to enter Gaza.
Now, those officials
also say that Gaza
a 50 mile border with Israel,
will look radically different
after any military incursion.
They tell CNN that a tough buffer
zone will be established,
one that would essentially be a
no go zone in
the IDF will be able to go into Gaza
and arrest people
whenever they want,
theoretically on their terms,
much like they can now in the West Bank.
Joining us now at the magic wall.

retired Lieutenant General Mark
Hertling serve. Good to see you.
I want to start with the flares
because Nic Robertson
was pointing this out

that's not the norm necessarily
in this moment. What does that tell you?
It just tells me that the Israeli forces
are looking for something
or they're trying to use a little bit
of psychological warfare
against the people inside of Gaza.
This is not that big of a deal.
It is just to show
potentially the commanders
that are on the scene
where different crossing points
are what they're looking for.
It's to orient
those who are new to the area.
The big question
is, will this become a regional conflict?
The president talked about that
last night.
Let's talk about what we have
just seen in the region.
The fact that two
sources told CNN overnight
that Navy warships, U.S.
Navy warships
operating in the Middle East
had to counter multiple projectiles fired
on the coast of Yemen yesterday.
And then you couple that
with what the Pentagon says are
drone attack
attempts in Iraq and where U.S.
officials are in Iraq and and and Syria.
Yeah,
a couple of things
that happened yesterday.
The drone attack out
off the coast of the Red Sea
and the Gulf of Aden down here
against the USS Carney,
drew a lot of attention.
Integrated air defense from that ship
shot the drones and the missiles down
that were coming out of Yemen.
That's important.
But the range from there to Israel
is pretty far.
And it's
they don't have a great missile force,
let's put it that way.
But the other things that were occurring
are would be a normal day
in some in some countries,
like the drone attack
at Al-Tanf in Syria.
That is a U.S.
military base in that particular reason.
It's been there for a while.
Other drone attacks
outside Air Force Base.
I've been out
there are many times in Iraq,
Erbil, Baghdad
and in the southern part of Iraq
just tells me
that the popular mobilization fronts,
the Iranian backed
rebels are actually targeting
those kinds of locations
just as harassment attacks.
There was also two Israeli citizens
killed in Egypt,
which just shows that there's
a swell of a ground movement
that is a result of
some of the things
that have been going on there.
And all of these Arab street
does not want Israel to go into Gaza.
Just take a step back
to what your point has been.
And I think it's very valuable to note
that these bases, these U.S.
bases are often
harassed or often subject
to drone attacks or rocket attacks.
All of it happening on the same day,
the same day
the president gives
an Oval Office address
as Israel is preparing
for what looks like a ground incursion,
different proxies from Iran.
But does that tell you something?
Yeah, it's a call for it's
a call for harassment.
It's a call for attacks.
It is a jihad.
They are receiving information
from Iran saying
let's upped the ante
a little bit
and show our displeasure
at what's going on in Israel.
Moments ago,
a large group of people
were seen
rallying for the opening of the Rafah
crossing on the Egypt border.
And you can see this.
This is right outside that border
a few miles around that crossing.
There's craters in front of it.
We understand about 20 trucks.
Some of those drivers have told us
they actually saw
the Egyptian moving concrete
as if there was a mate,
maybe the possibility of an opening.
But subsequently, CNN
has learned
that the Rafah crossing
will not open today
as had been anticipated.
But that sense of on the ground
and that that terrain desert
gives you some perspective
on where we stand right now.
Just moments ago,
we did hear from the U.N.
secretary general,
Antonio Gutierrez,
who is at the Rafah border
crossing on the Egyptian side.
So he is there you got a U.N.
compound on the other side
where where we know
people are better
supplied than most places,
but still with dwindling,
dwindling supplies.
And of course, he's standing
where all those trucks loaded with
aid are waiting to enter
Behind these walls.
We have 2 million people
that is suffering enormously.
So these trucks are not just trucks.
They are a lifeline.
They are the difference between life
and death for so many people.
In Gaza.
What we need is to make them move,
to make the move
to the other side of this wall, to make
the move as quickly as possible.
So those cement blocks that I referenced,
we actually have video of that.
CNN has obtained
that from some of these truck drivers
who are sitting there
night upon night and waiting,
moving those blocks
at the entrance of the crossing.
There are those 20 trucks
they are expected to enter
once the crossing opens.
The United Nations is saying that
it needs, though, 100 trucks a day
to provide
adequate aid to the people inside Gaza.
20 trucks right now.
And they need 100 a day.
This comes as Gaza's
main medical facility is in danger
of running out of fuel within hours.
No fuel has been coming into Gaza
now for days.
And, of course, to run a generator,
you need fuel.
All of that is now running out.
Doctors Without Borders
said yesterday
that the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza
City only had enough fuel
to run its generators for 24 more hours.
That hospital is
one of the few places in Gaza
that actually even has electricity
for now.
And on that front,
we have been getting dispatches
from people inside Gaza daily.
And, you know,
we get these small clips
and they cut out
because of the phone connections
because they don't have the power.
Our journalist, Ibrahim Dam on Escape
Northern Gaza in the south was his wife
and two sons.
He's been filing these dispatches
for OUTFRONT every night.
And here's his latest report on
the situation in Khan Younis.
A lot.
And genuineness.
I mean, Sarah, it matters.
A man in front of a lot newness
or no danger and official Baird
will be there.
And in between, the men
lurking the land mines and so on will
but the joy of newness
will cost very much right

I've done my hammamet my soul.
Well, I'm
I've been

my the shuttle side of the of joy.
We actually required to go and didn't get
a little bit of something a month ago.
So
the world is turning into a white cloud.
Something poetic and profound
about that, that horrible image.
Joining us now is Apple Brand.
While the US
executive director
for Doctors Without Borders and Apple,
I appreciate speaking with you again.
I know that
you have a team in this main
hospital in Gaza, the Al-Shifa hospital.
Can you give us any
update on their situation
Yes.
I mean, we are
really beside ourselves
because we often lose contact with them,
as you mentioned,
with the lack of electricity,
the inability to charge
phones, cell signals often being cut out,
very difficult
to get real time
information from the team.
And what we do know
is that our medical coordinator
was warning
that the fuel was reaching
catastrophic lows.
And of course, they will ration
they will try to stretch it out
as much as possible
because you need that fuel
to run generator
for the lifesaving medical equipment,
including incubators
for neonates, dialysis machines
and just just general functioning
for all the trauma surgeries
that they're trying to do.",20231020
9Hh0yIQ0zoo,"Two American hostages being released by Hamas, sources say","data/en_CNN\Two American hostages being released by Hamas, sources say.jpg","We do want to bring you some
breaking news, though, right now.
CNN's Alex Marquardt has that for us.
Alex, this has to do with the hostages
that were being held in Gaza by Hamas.
Yeah, Boris and Brown,
who understand
that two of the American hostages
who have been held
by Hamas are on their way
out of the Gaza Strip.
We've just learned this
from a person
who is familiar with the discussions,
as well as a diplomatic source
who has spoken to my colleague,
Kaitlan Collins.
As we know from the Israelis,
there have been around
200 hostages who have been held
by that militant group, by Hamas
since the horrific attacks inside
Israel on October 7th.
What we understand
from these two sources
is that the two Americans
are a mother and a daughter.
They are currently, we're told,
with the Red Cross
and heading south in the Gaza Strip.
There are two crossings in southern Gaza,
one that goes into Egypt,
the other that goes into Israel.
So right now,
we're not sure about which country
they will be going into.
We're also unclear on the identities
of this mother and child, but we are told
that they are being released
on humanitarian grounds.
That's according to a source
that I spoke with,
because the mother is not in good health.
Now, of course, and Brianna,
this has also been announced by Hamas.
A spokesman
for the militant group
said that the mother and daughter
are also being released,
they say, on humanitarian grounds, but
also because they want to
contest the claims being made by Biden
and what they call
his fascist administration,
because there are false and baseless.
So we have this
mother and daughter, American citizens,
who have been held by Hamas
for much of the past two weeks.
Now, we understand
with the Red Cross on their way
out of Gaza, guys.
And Alex, to clarify quickly
the next steps.
Is it clear
exactly where they're headed next?
Is it going to be Egypt or Israel?
What do we know now? There are two.
There are two crossings, two gates
in the southern part of Gaza,
one called Kerem Shalom,
which is between Gaza and Israel.
The other one, Rafah,
which we've been talking about
so much because of
the question about aid.
And that is where the aid
would go from Egypt into Gaza.
So right now, it is not clear for us.
Certainly they were abducted in Israel.
We know that.
So there is, of course,
a good chance
that they could be then
taken back into Israel.
But at the same time,
it may just be easier
for whatever reason, logistics,
operational security, to
to have them go into Egypt.
But I think
one of the important points is now
they're there with an independent party
there with the Red Cross, the Red Cross,
And so that is the best news.
They are no longer.
We understand, in Hamas custody,
although, of course, Hamas does control
the entire Gaza Strip.
So this is not a done deal.
Things are still
obviously extremely fluid.
But here we have both our sources outside
of Gaza as well as Hamas themselves
saying that these two Americans
are being released.
All right, Alex,
I want to bring in Kaitlan Collins,
who is in Tel Aviv.
The two of you reported this story out.
Kaitlyn, is there anything
and I don't even know
if there's an answer to this
at this point,
but can we read
into anything at this point
if the they're being released
because the mother is in poor health.
Could this be an acknowledgment
on the part of Hamas
that they need to perhaps release people
who are not doing well,
that they want people
who maybe are in good health
if they are going to be
using them as pawns as they perhaps later
try to utilize them in
some kind of prisoner exchange?
Can we read into anything at this point?
I think a lot of that remains to be seen.
I mean, this was a big question.
Once Hamas had captured
so many of these hostages
and taken the boat into Gaza
after that
October 7th attack,
that was a
question
was if they are going to try to use them,
as we had seen in the past
when Hamas had kidnaped an IDF officer,
that there was a lot of negotiation
over, that it took years.
And in the end, Israel released,
I believe there's about a thousand
Palestinian prisoners in exchange
for that Israeli officer.
And so that was kind of the basis
that people were looking
at these hostages and the questions over
what would happen here.
And we've heard Israeli officials
say they were not negotiating with Hamas
for an exchange for the hostages.
But this news is incredibly significant.
I mean, these hostages, of course,
there's been an open question
of what their fate would be,
what would happen,
especially as we are waiting to see
that ground incursion potentially happen.
And I can just tell you,
we have not heard anything
from the prime minister's office
here in Tel Aviv tonight
on the release of these two
American hostages
that Alex and I have reporting on.
They have not confirmed it.
We are waiting to see what they say
about this.
We also have not heard
from the White House
on this front either.
But I just want to tell you,
this is something
that is still
every single day here
in Tel Aviv, everywhere in Israel.
This is something that everyone's
talking about.
Of course, Shabbat
happens on Friday evenings.
This is when everyone, their family,
their friends get together
and have a dinner in the Jewish faith.
And earlier,
we went to this
this ceremony
for all of these families
of these hostages.
And they had this
incredibly long dining
table set up with a seat
for every person who is believed
to have been taken hostage by Hamas
and therefore will not be
with their families for Shabbat dinner.
And it was an
incredibly emotional moment.
And so
just this news in and of itself
that two of them
have been released,
that they are alive
is something that is going to be helpful
to these families
who are waiting for any piece,
any scrap of information
about their loved ones.
And so, of course, the question remains
what happens to the other hostages?
What does that look like going forward?
I think there are still so many questions
for these two American hostages
that are being released,
including where
they are going to be released
and to whether that's Egypt,
whether that's here into Israel.
Those are still big questions
and we're still waiting for details
over what that looks like.
And also, Brianna,
as you mentioned, what it could mean
for the others
and how Hamas plans to use them.
One other thing
I will say that
we talked about last night
and this was in an interview
with The New York Times,
a Hamas leader said that
they are not even in control
over all the hostages,
that there are other terrorist groups,
obviously, in Gaza,
and they did not have full control
over them.
Obviously,
something that would complicate
getting the release of these other
hostages. Caitlin, please stand by.
We want to bring in
Jim Sciutto now
because, Jim,
you just spoke to a long time
hostage representative.
That's what I spoke to. Jonathan Frank.
So sure you've spoken with him before.
He's been involved.
For instance,
the release of the American travel
read from Russia
also worked on the trafficking case
in North Korea.
And I asked him
what in his experience,
a release like this might indicate.
He said,
given the number of hostages
that Hamas is holding to release to
could be an attempt
just to relieve the pressure somewhat.
I mean, you're in the midst of it,
a quite aggressive,
devastating Israeli
air campaign threat of a ground
offensive, demands
for humanitarian supplies
to relieve the pressure.
Does not necessarily portend
that all the hostages
are going to be freed quickly.
He makes the point
and Caitlin made this point as well,
that in previous hostage
exchanges with Hamas,
they've demanded a great deal
in return, particularly
when it involves a soldier,
friends, for instance,
Gilad Shalit, a thousand
Palestinian prisoners were released.
So so it may be, as you look at this,
that you have different
kinds of hostages.
Here's a mother and daughter,
apparently that the mother in ill health.
They can
make the case that
this is more of a humanitarian case
for soldiers.
They might deal differently
for men of military age.
They might be
They might deal different
differently as well.
But again,
Hamas is a group that takes hostages.
Hamas is a group that kills civilians.
We don't need more evidence of that.
A decision like this does not mean
Hamas has changed.
It means that it sees something
it wants something in return
or it sees
this as being in their advantage.
And perhaps there was some pressure
applied from outside as well.
And Alex, I understand
you have some information
about how this negotiation went down.
Well, Jim is absolutely right
in terms of the pressure
being applied from outside.
Hamas is considered
a terrorist organization, of course, by
not just Israel,
but the United States as well.
And that means that those two countries
don't have a direct dialog with Hamas.
So in this situation
and this has been the case
for much of the past two weeks
since these 200 or so people were taken,
is that it was primarily Qatar
that was engaging with Hamas
They are the main conduit for
Israel in the U.S.
to talk to that militant group,
which has
several Hamas leaders
who live in their capital in Doha.
So this really has
been the portfolio that the U.S.
has asked Qatar to undertake
when Secretary
Anthony Blinken was crisscrossing
the region,
going to all these
different Middle Eastern countries.
He very quickly went to Qatar,
and that was because
they have this direct line into Hamas.
And so
here this is
both according to the sources
that we have spoken with,
but also Hamas themselves,
the result of this negotiation
between Hamas and Qatar.
But no doubt the presence of these
still around
200 hostages who will still be
in the custody of Hamas and other groups
we understand,
or subgroups
all across the Gaza Strip
that is going to
wildly complicate the efforts
of the Israeli
military, who, of course,
we believe
are going to go into Gaza on the ground
any day now.
We've been talking about this
sprawling network of tunnels
throughout the Gaza Strip.
We understand that the hostages
may be in those tunnels,
maybe in the bunkers.
And so as Israel goes in
to try to decapitate the Hamas
military and political leadership,
not only are they
trying to minimize the civilian death
toll on the Palestinian side,
but they're obviously trying to
make sure that that nothing happens
to these hostages
and try to get them out.
So while Israel is saying
that they're not going to be negotiating
with Hamas,
over these hostages, this effort by Qatar
will be ongoing to try
to get more than just these
two Americans out.",20231020

But I can just say for
the part of the United States
that this continues to be

distinguishes us, distinguishes
from terrorist groups like Hamas
which not only have
absolutely no concern for
for innocent human life.
They intentionally use
innocent human lives to hide beh
to use as quite literally
as human shields, knowing that c

Just following up on that, a Ham
has issued a statement
through Abu Zubaydah.
And I know with the huge caveat
that it's a terror group
and one is not attach
credibility to that.
But they have said
that all the hostages, the civil
hostage,
which include the Americans,
could be released,
that this could be
the start of something bigger
if there are no airstrikes.
Would this be a moment where
if it's under Israel's
discretion, obviously
it would be wise to pause,
to give it more time

And it was notable,
without going into details
that in the president's statemen
he said
he expressed his thanks to Israe
to Qatar, rather,
in partnership with Israel.
A notable connection there.
The obvious inference
is that they were working
together on this.
Does this give you hope that
despite everything that's happen
that there could still be
a broader relationship
and avoid a wider war?
Thanks, Andrea.
So two things there.
First,
it's very simple.
Hostages should be released imme
and unconditionally.
That's been our position from da
It remains our position.
And to your point,
I would not take anything
that Hamas says at face value.
I'm not sure anyone in this room
would take at face value or repo
something that ISIS had said.
Same applies to to Hamas.
Our position is clear.
Every hostage needs to be releas
and needs to be released.
Now,
there is no doubt
from my own my own travels in th
that one of the important things
throughout this
this very difficult period
and since the attack,
the unconscionable attack by Ham
is
to continue
to find ways
for countries to cooperate, coor
when it's in their interests to
And we'll continue to look to th

of humanitarian assistance
to the men, women and children i
who would so desperately need it
We work on that every day.
And I think
we can say that
we've seen some of that cooperat
The broader question,
though, I think, is
usually important,
because what's abundantly clear
the vast majority of countries,
the vast majority of people
want the same thing
They want a region
where countries are working toge
where relations are normalized,
where there's greater integratio
where people are
working together,
studying together,
traveling, doing business.
Overwhelming
majority of people want that.
And we want to see as well
the rights and aspirations
of the Palestinian people
fulfilled in the context of that
of region.
And that's one vision.
And it remains very much
alive in every conversation. Tha
The alternative is equally clear
and it's very stark.
It's Hamas.
It's Hezbollah.
It's Iran.
It's destruction.
It's death.
It's terrorism. It's darkness.
So the more we are able to make
that first vision
the more I'm convinced that
that's the vision that everyone
or virtually everyone will subsc
So even as we are
working through this challenge,
this crisis, it's important
to keep that vision alive,
because it's important that peop
that there is an alternative
and that everything that they ho
and that they aspire to
is going to be best addressed
through what I've just described
that first vision.
We'll continue to do that.

that their trucks and their work

about two hostages
being freed from Hamas by Hamas.
Other families
are watching this news tonight with hope.
It has been two weeks
since Omer Shem Tov said
parents have seen their son,
a 21 year old, which was with his friends
at the Noah Music Festival
when Hamas attacked on that day.
Amir was eventually
handcuffed, placed
in the back of a pickup truck
and kidnaped.
That morning
was the last time
that Amir's family heard his voice,
as he called them frantic and terrified.
Phone.
Phone call to another phone call.
You sound much more panicked,
much more hysteric.
And even then,
one of the phone calls say
that they are running away.
They are carrying a lot of friends,
but they start to run.
So they he lost some of his friends.
And while he was running,
he's saying that
they are shooting all over.
And he say that even see some dying
people.
And I love you.
I love you
from you must have been so panicked
to hear your 21 year old son
telling you it's not just rockets,
it's there's gunfire.
People are running and being killed.
Yes. Yes.
It was like
we could understand from his voice
that this is something
that we could not understand,
even what he's experienced over there.
He told me he was panicked.
He was afraid.
He said that they got into the car
and they're trying to escape from there.
My daughter and
I told him, send us a live location.
He said, Alive location.
And then the phone was stopped.
And then we started to see that
the the the point is moving like
not in the right way, Not coming home.
Not coming home at all.
It's it's moving to the border.
And my daughter start to cry.
And she told us,
listen, it's it's not the way.
It's not the way.
And I called him to say,
Olmert, It's not the way.
And
he didn't answer.
The phone was ringing
and he didn't answer.
And then we saw that he's
getting into
who was behind the lot of it.
It was the border.
And then in the evening, we got the video
that was published by the Hamas,
that Omer, who is
he's a hostage, is over there.
We saw we saw Omer and Croft in a
in the back of pickup.
We think he's handcuffed in a truck. Yes.
With his friend.
There were alive
there was no blood
or something on his glove.
And and that's was the only
the only
single signal that we got for him.
And it's been
almost two weeks.
Tomorrow have been two weeks.
I mean,
what have these two weeks
been like for both of you?
We didn't.
We are not sleeping.
We.
We are not eating.
We
all of of
of the things that we are doing now.
It's just
to to to shout all over the world
our pain
that
no mother in, in all over
the world needs to feel like mother
and father needs to feel
like we are feeling. Now
imagine that
your son is going to a party
and the next day
people
murders, kidnaped him
and, you know, know
if he's eating, sleeping,
if they are beating him.
The basic
thing of the mother is to
protect, to protect
her son.
And I cannot protect my son.
And
it's driving me crazy.
And
it's I'm talking not only
for myself, I'm talking
for a lot of families.
You must understand that
people were in the safe place.
Their whole
their were sitting, eating breakfast.
Some of them was sleeping.
And then these terrorists came in
through their house and murder
and took them from their house,
from the place
that it's the most safe place.
And they took him babies,
children,
teenage
mothers, fathers,
grandmothers.
And he's he's 21, but he's your baby.
I mean, what is what's he like?
What's his personality?
What is he
you were saying
he kisses you
three times on the cheeks all the time.
Are you the amazing guy?
He's a party guy.
He's by himself.
He's a deejay and he likes very much
all these kind of festival
music festivals.
So that's Omer.
Very, very happy guy.
Very happy, very funny, funny, very cool.
He marries.
So cute.
We call him Sunshine because they
like the sunshine.
Everybody wants to be next next to him.
The last time Amir's family saw
him was at Shabbat dinner two weeks ago.
He was there like he always is.
He's always the life of the party.
As they talked about his big personality.
And that night was the night
that he went to the Nova Music Festival.
The next time his parents heard from
him was in a series
of panicked phone calls.
The next day,
when they realized that
the festival he was at
was being attacked by Hamas.
The ceremony tonight in this huge table
that you see is for all the families
whose loved ones are being held
hostage tonight,
whose loved ones
won't be at Shabbat dinner tonight.
And Amir's family is hoping
that he will be back
at their Shabbat dinner at their table
very soon.
Can you show me the video
that you were showing me a moment ago?
Yes.
I'm losing.
And that was a picture of your family?
Yes.
How many times
have you watched that video?
Oh, my God.
I saw it,
you know, at the beginning
when Dana posted.
I saw it, I don't know, maybe 100 times.
And each time I'm crying
and I get very emotional.
Even now, when I see that,
you get very emotional.
And also the song say
you're going to get out from this.
Don't be afraid from here.
Yes, you are going to get out of it.
If you could talk to him right now,
what would you say to him?
Come back. Enough's enough.
You did enough trouble.
Just come. Come back.
And
that I love him.
That I miss him.
That I want every.
Every day
when he is going, he is coming to
me, is telling.
He's hugging me, telling me, Mom,
I love you.
He's kissing me three times.
And he's going. So
I
hug the and
that's what I want
very much to walk him and smiling
for relief to hear
what the IDF said today
that they do believe
most of the hostages are still alive.
You know, for us, it's a
it's give me some light.
But until we don't see them,
I want to say something about that.
My son have asthma.
He cannot breathe. Well.
And I also every day when I'm come,
when I'm waking up and I don't have
I cannot breathe.
I'm taking my Valium
and I'm thinking about all
that is there.
And you've done this.
He's
whatever you call it.
And it's the minimum thing
that the monetary thing
that they need to do.
First of all, it's it's unbelievable
my to be there
for my own needs at that moment.
Has he ever left one of
his pylons
and all of this stuff again,
or the emotion that
it's all for?
That is what the and I
want to thank Amir's
parents, Shelly and Marcus.
They were so gracious
with their time today,
despite being so clearly
filled with grief for their missing son.
These families are devastated.
Their lives
have been completely uprooted.
Amir stood at one point,
had a small smile on his face
when he told me
he can't wait for his son to come home
so you can tell him to go and clean
his messy room.
My heart is heavy for them tonight
and for every family
who had an empty seat

43exO3on0c0,Clarissa Ward explains what aid has made it into Gaza,data/en_CNN\Clarissa Ward explains what aid has made it into Gaza.jpg,"The Rafah crossing into Egypt
was briefly opened this morning
to allow the first convoy
of aid trucks to enter
the besieged Gaza Strip.
For the latest,
I'm joined by CNN's
Clarissa Ward in Cairo. Clarissa.
When all was said and done,
what was actually on those trucks
and what is needed but was not provided.
So, Michael, on those 20 trucks,
you basically had food, water, medicine,
all those things desperately needed.
But one thing that wasn't on
those trucks was fuel.
The Israelis have had
serious reservations
about allowing fuel to go in.
They're worried
it could be diverted by Hamas.
But the UN is really concerned
that fuel supplies are now down
to maybe two or three days
and that fuel is so desperately
needed to power generators,
which are the only things
that are allowing these hospitals
to continue to function to the extent
that they are still able to function.
Also important to note, 20
trucks is nothing
in the grand scheme of things
before this latest spasm of violence.
You would have 455 trucks a day
according to the UN, of aid
going into Gaza.
Now you've had two weeks.
Relentless bombardment.
No aid. Mass displacement.
Humanitarian catastrophe.
So 20 trucks, the WFP is saying,
could maybe meet the needs
of 30,000 people in terms of food.
And they need to reach about 900,000.
That's why you're hearing
full throated
calls from the U.N.,
other humanitarian organizations, saying
this needs to be a sustained,
continuous humanitarian corridor
and not a one off. Michael?
Clarissa, big picture,
among the reasons for Rafah
being such a choke point
is that at this stage
it's the only perimeter of Gaza
not sealed by Israel.
True.
That's right.
The Rafah border crossing is controlled
by the Egyptian side
and the Egyptians have said
they also don't want to have
a massive outpouring
of potentially hundreds
of thousands of Palestinians
into the Sinai Peninsula,
which is where that border crossing is.
Egypt has been fighting
an insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula
for many years now.
Egypt already has huge social problems,
poverty.
And so you've heard Egypt's
president say, listen,
the answer to this is not us taking
a million refugees
that we simply can't care for.
The answer to
this is agreeing upon
a sustained, continuous
humanitarian corridor,
establishing
humanitarian zones
inside of southern Gaza.
We heard Secretary of State
Antony Blinken talk about that, too.
But the issue is getting all sides
to come together
and agree on the conditions
that would allow for that.
And in the meantime, Michael, of course,
it sounds like a cliche,
but it could not be more true.
Every day,
every hour is so crucial
for the people inside of Gaza
who are not only facing
relentless bombardment.
But what the UN is calling
an unprecedented
humanitarian catastrophe
that is unfolding.
Clarissa Ward, thank you so much.",20231021

joining us now with the latest.
Salma, Gaza's hospital are facing
the hospitals there.
They're facing severe shortages.
And, of course, there's
no fuel on these aid trucks.
What more can you tell us
about the aid that's coming in
and how that is going to play out?
I think it's crucial
we put this aid into context.
We understand from local officials
that these 20 trucks are 3%, just
3% of what was normally coming in
on a single day
in Gaza
before this crisis
even began in
these trucks have to distribute
this aid as airstrikes continue
to rain down without.
Fuel to put.
Into these trucks.
And they're feeling this huge gap,
this huge deficit.
Hospitals are running out of medicine.
Kids are drinking seawater
because there's no clean drinking water.
The humanitarian crisis is just huge.
I want to
I want you to take a look
at the situation on the ground.
I do warn you, these images are graphic.
As these aid convoys enter Gaza.
Hospitals in Gaza are crumbling.
Everything is running out
from surgical equipment to medicine
and the tiniest lives are left
hanging in the balance.
Of their lives.
We need power.
We need access to clean water.
This doctor says without basic services,
this will be a humanitarian catastrophe.
Already, seven hospitals and 21
primary health care facilities
here are out of service,
according to Palestinian officials,
because of shortages
after intense diplomatic efforts.
Prayers of relief
at the Rafah border
crossing
as a trickle of aid
was allowed in from Egypt.
But the tow truck convoy is only a drop
in the ocean
of need here, equivalent to just 3%
of what
entered this enclave
daily prior to the conflict.
More than 200
additional trucks of assistance
remain stalled on the Egyptian side,
according to the U.N..
And every hour costs lives.
And so
far, no civilians
can leave beyond Cleeve.
Ten year
old Palestinian American Aiden
is among those trapped.
And we have no place to go.
All the streets are bombed.
There they're literally gone.
How are we. Supposed to go out?
And how it's all closed.
Even if people are allowed out,
it will be a limited number.
Most likely only those
with foreign passports.
Sealing some 2 million
others, half of them children,
into this hellscape.
But some refuse to go,
even if they could.
Fearing Israel intends to bomb
and besiege them out of their homes,
never to return.
Even as Mahmoud buries his children,
he says he will keep fighting
just to exist here.
Sorry.
We will still be patient.
As long as we are alive on this earth,
we will be patient, he says.
We will never leave this land.
After the October 7th terror
attacks, when Hamas killed
more than 1400 people in Israel
in a brutal surprise
incursion, Israel
vowed to wipe out Hamas.
But with hundreds of airstrikes
pounding the densely populated
enclave a day,
innocent blood is being spilled.
Innocent children were struck down
while they were sleeping.
This woman shouts.
What did they do?
Did they carry weapons?
These are innocent children
who know nothing.
Tell us, when will this end?
There are calls for a cease
fire to get civilians
out of the war
zone and allow more aid into Gaza.
But the pleas fall on deaf ears so far.
Israel is preparing for the next phase
of its operations,
a potential ground incursion
that can only bring more suffering.
And when we talk about this
trickle of aid,
I also want you to think about
just how much it required
to get such a small amount of help
into the enclave.
President Biden was directly involved
in these negotiations.
There was intense
diplomatic efforts,
a flurry between Egypt
and Israel
in the United States
to just bring in this tiny amount of help
that, again,
aid workers
say is going to be used up immediately.
And we're looking at
a humanitarian crisis
that isn't just unfolding on the ground,
but is actually being expanded,
added to intensified hour
by hour by those airstrikes
that continue to push.
Wounded people, displaced people.
Into places
where shelters are overwhelmed.
Hospitals are overwhelmed,
that the fear here is that
this is simply not enough
and there could not be enough
coming in the days in the days ahead.
Some Abdul-Aziz
with the reporting for us.
Thank you so much.
Joining us
now is Cindy McCain,
executive director of World Food Program
and former ambassador
to the UN Agencies
for Food and Agriculture.
Ambassador McCain,
thank you for your time.
I want to fill out
the picture of perspective,
what was sent in on these first 20 trucks
compared to what is needed.
So fill that out for us if you could.
Well,
first of all,
thank you for having me
and thank you
for talking about this issue.
I witnessed the container,
all the trucks for medical supplies.
Of course,
we took in food, water taken in.
And as we said,
it was a very small amount.
Is 20.
As for this
convoy, convoys like this to be sustained
and to be safe
and continue to run
and continue to go into the country,
this is a catastrophe
going on on the ground there.
People are starving to death.
There's no water, as you know.
There's no electricity. There's no fuel.
This this is ripe for disease
and much, much more.
So I'm really pleading with the world
community to please get in here and help.
Ambassador, as you've heard
from some of our reporters,
especially Clarissa Ward,
who's been there on the ground
near the crossing,
I mean, she's been saying
this is just a drop in the ocean
because you have 28 trucks coming in.
Compare that to 450 trucks
that have been coming in
every single day into Gaza.
What is the World Food Program?
What are you doing to
I guess, what kind of conversations
are you having to
to open a sustained
humanitarian corridor?
Well, I have talked to
everybody involved that I can find,
and that includes the secretary general
as well as our
our other folks
with our various partner agencies around.
This is something
that has got to be sustained and saved
and, of course, has to be
it has to be much more of it.
This cannot be the only
or the last convoy that simply can't be.
So I'm looking to I'm
helping the leadership
in various countries around this around
this can help us.
I help remind the world
that we need to get in here
to help
those who cannot help themselves
and are about to starve to death.
What are you hearing from
your partners there in Gaza?
Understand that there were
dozens of bakeries
that the World Food Program
partnered with,
and now there are just a couple
that are operational.
Give us some context on the
the capabilities.
Once supplies reach people there,
what they can do with it.
Right.
Well, first of all, we
Djibouti was already in Palestine
and we were already in the area.
And so so we are people are still there.
So what does this mean?
We have the capability
and have
logistics ability
to bring in large
quantities of food, etc..
But right now, what's left on the ground,
as you know,
many of the bakeries were bombed.
Many of them just don't have supplies.
And the ones that are operational
are have very minimal ability
to do just that.
We are bringing in emergency food rations
right now.
This is
this is food
that people can eat immediately,
Do not have to cook.
Sure,
we can sustain themselves
a little bit longer
until we can get the longer
lasting items that they need in there.
But once again, 20 trucks will not do it.
We need as as
Clarissa said, there are 400
some trucks going every day.
We need those 407
trucks filled with food
to go in every day.
All right.
And in terms of
your message to the people on the ground,
because logistically, I mean,
I wonder how this is going to work.
Right?
28 trucks coming in.
There's way more need than that.
How do you know how the people on
the ground are going to prioritize
who gets what?
Well,
in the case of World Food Program,
we we that's what we do.
We prioritize.
We know where it needs to go.
We know where the where the people are.
Also staying with regard
to hospitals, community centers,
where they've been, where they fled to.
So we're going to make sure
that the food gets right
where it's supposed to go
and that it makes it
to the correct people.
Let's be very clear about that.
We have the kind of capabilities
to track and trace our food.
And more importantly,
we are able to on the ground
make sure that our beneficiaries
are the real beneficiaries
that should be getting the food.
So we're going to do everything
we can to make sure it goes right
where it's supposed to go.
And that's what he's good at.
We're good at logistics.
We're good at this.
And so that's why
we we're the largest organization.
That's why we continue
to do the kind of work that we do.
Most of most Americans
first met you
when your late husband,
Senator John McCain,
was running for president.
He was the Republican nominee in 2008.
One of the candidates
for the nomination this time around.
Florida Governor Ron
DeSantis has said that
not a single dollar of U.S.
aid should go into Gaza.
I wonder what your reaction to that is.
Listen, it's not just Gaza.
This problem is worldwide.
We have the Sahel. We have Sudan.
We have
hundreds of thousands of refugees,
millions fleeing into Chad.
This is not a problem
that's solely in Gaza. This is worldwide.
So to say somehow
you're not going to give aid to anybody
is is just cruel.
There are people starving to death.
And the United States
always steps up is always
the first and we're always the largest
because that's who we are as Americans.
So I would challenge Mr.
DeSantis on that, on that topic.
Well, thank you for taking time out
on a very busy day.
Appreciate the work you do,
Ambassador Sidney McCain, Thank you.",20231021
SR_EAWjPUM0,Woman recalls being told her sister was killed by Hamas at Nova Festival,data/en_CNN\Woman recalls being told her sister was killed by Hamas at Nova Festival.jpg,"We're learning much
more now about the lives
lost in those brutal Hamas
attacks on Israel two weeks ago.
Among them,
23, 23 year old Sheera Ayalon.
She and a friend
were killed by Hamas terrorists
at that Nova music festival.
Sheera, sister Adaa Ayalon
joining us now from Tel Aviv.
Eldar, thank you so much for joining us.
I wish we were just talking
under different circumstances
and let me express
our deepest condolences to you
over your sister's death.
First of all,
what can you tell us about
what happened to her?
SESTERO
Thank you for having me.
Two weeks ago, Sheera
and two of her friends went to their
Nova music festival
and Saturday morning at 7 a.m.,
she recalled my dad telling him there was
a bombing over there,
which
sadly become a regular thing in here.
She told him that she's scared
and she's going to wait for the panic
to come and come home.
But 30 minutes
up there,
she didn't answer her phone anymore.
She was missing for five days.
And after five days,
we got a message from the army that
they recognized her body.
Her body
lay down in the forest for five days.
Apparently literally
surrounded the party.
The been planning that
for a while, apparently.
And they just came inside, started to
automatically shoot everybody over there
stealing the stuff from the bodies.
Nothing.
After they done over there,
they went to the nearest CDs
and people came, just broke
into houses, steal family babies,
kidnap
200 people, 200 people,
killing thousands of people.
And
for the state, while she was missing,
I tried to find some information
and watch the videos in Telegram.
Apparently the Hamas cleared themselves
killing people,
then upload it into romantic dark.
So I watched
all the horrible things that they did
and
we were managed just to locate her phone
the first day we saw it in Gaza.
So if they kidnap her,
but apparently she was murder,
they shoot her in the back at around
8 a.m..
It took to a lot of her friends.
It was driving the party
while I was looking for her
and the stories were the same.
They said that once
the shooting was started
and it was a complete chaos,
they hide in the forest for hours.
They describe it
like they are running
away from the Nazis.
They tried to
call for help
from help from the army and the police,
but nobody came
because that there were hundreds
of tourists
just shooting cars and the streets
so nobody can get
over there to help them.
And apparently there were so many dead
bodies over there that
it took them like they couldn't
get the bodies to the hospital anymore
because all of the hospital were full.
So they bring the bodies
to collect the bodies
and bring them to the near armory,
which is why they it took them six days
to recognize her and bring her through,
to bury her.
And
she, like
she lay in the forest
for six days before we buried her.
So said DA.
Tell us a little bit
about your sister, Shira.
What was she like?
She just started her life.
She was 23.
She just came back from India.
She was very peaceful and kind.
She was about to start university
psychology degree
and she was very gentle
and very, very dedicated.
And she had nothing to do with this war.
Like,
I can even imagine what kind of monster
tends to hit innocent kids.
Not not soldiers,
civilians, innocent civilians.
It just came to party
and to celebrate life.
And we are heartbroken
like we were devastated about her.
She was so delicate and so peaceful and
very nonviolent.
She had nothing to do.
I don't think that she
could have survived the attack.
No way that she could have made it.
So, so awful.
The IDF, as you know,
says more than 200 people are being held
hostage in Gaza right now.
I know your family tracked your sister's
phone there
thinking she was perhaps
one of the hostages.
What was it like for your family
during this awful, awful time?
My parents actually said that
they prefer her to be that
than to get kidnaped because they know
that a terrorist, they abuse
the people that kidnap,
they abuse the dead bodies.
They write the woman over there.
So
they were hoping for her to be dead
on the spot.
And yeah, they shut her from the organs,
so she was dead on the spot.
I guarantee
I had hope that maybe she got kidnaped
and maybe we can create those those pigs
someday.
I don't know that it's time
that they kidnaped the soldier.
It took
us five years to find his location,
but I have hope that at least we can free
those two.
Had kids and a lorry and baby.
Those people don't deserve
and deserve for this.
They're probably in a very bad situation,
like psychologically
and have very bad health situation.
I know that most of them
been held
after they already got shot, so
they're dying there in a cell.
Some videos of the Hamas.
They came
like while I was
when I was looking for her,
I watched hundreds of videos on the mom.
And I think the people that they
they feel
count them little babies in front of them
are very old people.
And most of them were injured,
like very badly injured,
like with wound on their legs
and in the stomach.
So
I really hope that we can free them
as best as we can, because we have
we have.
And I
as a country, we
we have responsible for them like we have
we have responsibility for them
to keep to save them.
Adara, I alone.
Thank you very much
for spending a few moments with us.
Our deepest, deepest condolences
to you
and to your family
and the loss of your loving sister.
And as we say, the finale of Russia.
May her memory be a blessing.",20231021
c3bTGgCfNyI,Ret. US general predicts Israel’s strategy for a ground battle in Gaza,data/en_CNN\Ret. US general predicts Israel’s strategy for a ground battle in Gaza.jpg,"With me now,
CNN military analyst, retired Major
General James Spider Marks.
Spider, great to see you here.
John,
this is the restricted area right now
where the Israeli military is massing.
We have seen satellite images of tanks
lining up, literally lining up here,
preparing to go.
I can show you where that is.
This is not privileged
top secret information.
The Israelis have made very clear
where this is happening.
Those pictures were taken from up here.
We can also assume there might be tanks
preparing elsewhere in this restricted
so and so, Spider.
What are they doing now
and what are they getting ready to do?
Yeah.
At this particular point, John,
what they're doing is what we call pre
combat checks.
Individuals and teams
are getting ready to go.
There's a lot of silence.
There's a lot of focus.
This is business.
Nobody's messing around.
They're also doing rehearsals.
What's going to take place on the ground?
They've got a scheme of maneuver.
They have a plan.
They're using sand,
what we call sand tables.
And they're trying to figure out
what they're going to do.
They're going to refine that.
But simultaneously, they're doing
intelligence collection.
We'll talk to me
about the intelligence collection
right now.
What different
types of intelligence are you?
Yeah, well,
what they're probably using, I would
I would imagine,
is they're probably using drones.
They want to get the drones up
in the air.
They want to get the very latest
because those plans will be altered
based on many drones.
Yeah.
Imagery, imagery, intelligence
And the thing that they can do
at their level,
you know,
the individual operators can fly drones.
They can get intelligence
that's going to affect them
in a very tactical way.
They're also probably putting
special ops teams, very small teams
across into Gaza.
There's lots of chaos.
There's a lot of smoke.
There's a lot of haze.
There's a lot of stuff going on
so they can infiltrate folks
to put eyes on targets as best they can.
So I would imagine
that's taking place as well.
And they're also tracking the cell phones
of all the Hamas leaders.
Signals intelligence,
signals intelligence. Exactly. Correct.
And that's why they're that's why
there is targeting
taking place right now in southern Gaza,
because that's where a lot of the Hamas
leadership phones are located.
Yeah, we were talking about that
right here.
This is this is the imagery from Rafah.
You can see where
some of those things are taking place.
We have some video here
also of the trucks
coming over right there.
But as you were looking at that,
you think that they made those strikes
because they were following
signals intelligence. Absolutely.
And you look at where Hamas was located.
Look, they're not completely
and exclusively focused in the north.
Got it there throughout Gaza.
Let's go back.
I want to talk about these tanks
that we see preparing to go in
when they do make that decision to go
in, whether it's this weekend
or a few days from now,
what paths do you think they'll take?
Yeah, I think what's going to happen
if it's more than just tanks,
these are combat arms teams.
So you've got infantry
that's mounted,
you've got armor forces,
you've got artillery, etc..
And it's going to be preceded
by good intelligence.
I think what they would probably do,
look, the Wadi Gaza comes through here.
That's a river marshland.
Yeah, it's the wetlands.
I think what they would do is they would
enter in from here.
They'd come in on
multiple axes of advance.
They'd come in from the north.
Of course they'd come in here.
And also, Israel has a navy.
They've got
what's called Corvettes,
which are small, smaller attack ships.
They've got 45 patrol boats
and they've got 10,000
sailors on active duty.
I would also anticipate activity
that would look like this,
because what Israeli Israel wants to do
you want to secure this combat zone,
you want to secure the perimeter,
and then you go,
all these units will link up,
go to the same place, link up
then you begin the operation
to go after very specific targets.
And those targets, John,
are really the political
and military leaders of Hamas people,
the people they want to go after them.
And I think they would
probably have either
a kill or capture mission
in this particular case.
I would imagine it's a kill mission.
Second thing,
they want to go
after is the tunnel complex,
which is extensive, as you realize.
I can show you
they're going to lose this.
This is a map of what
the tunnels look like
in 2021 is some time ago
they've probably expanded and redone it.
But you can see
some of the tunnel imagery
that was there
that that is the most difficult task
that they have to take on.
This is urban terrain
with the subterranean peace
and Israel has got to identify,
they have to deny
and they have to destroy those tunnels.
That is a man combat suck.
That's going to draw people into it.
This is going to be a difficult,
difficult fight.
All right, Spider,
thank you so much
for explaining all this.
Don't go far because obviously,
you know, more things could be happening
very, very soon. Thank you very much.",20231022
gji_20BZiDM,CNN forensic analysis suggests what may have caused Gaza hospital blast,data/en_CNN\CNN forensic analysis suggests what may have caused Gaza hospital blast.jpg,"I'm Anderson Cooper, live in Tel Aviv.
Tonight,
a new CNN forensic analysis confirms that
the deadly blast at the hospital complex
in Gaza did not come from Israel.
Joining me now is Jeremy Diamond in
Ashkelon.
So, Jeremy, what do you know
Well, Anderson, our investigations
team has conducted a really thorough
analysis using dozens of videos
taken from social media,
but also live broadcast and footage
filmed by a freelance journalist
working for CNN inside the Gaza Strip.
In addition
to that, their satellite imagery.
And they also spoke
with several explosives
and other military experts
who analyze these very images
and CNN's analysis
effectively suggests that this blast
at this hospital inside the Gaza
Strip was caused by a rocket launched
from Gaza, a rocket
that appears to have broken up midair.
And then at least part of that rocket
fell down on that parking lot
outside the hospital,
causing the explosion
that has killed
hundreds of people over there.
Now, these weapons and explosives
that explosives experts who CNN spoke
with, they all agree
that this is the most likely scenario.
Now, at the same time, a definitive
conclusion on this simply can't be reached
without recovering physical evidence
from the site, which is very difficult
given the limited access
that journalists have to the Gaza Strip
and also the fact that that territory
is indeed controlled by Hamas.
Now, I want to take you through two key
moments here, because one of them is from
this live broadcast
that was being broadcast on Al Jazeera,
where you can see the rockets
that were being fired.
Around the same time
as this blast occurred,
one of those rockets
appears to burn out in the sky
before crashing into the area
where the hospital is.
The second piece of evidence,
Anderson, is the crater and this is a key
piece of evidence that the Israeli Defense
Forces have also pointed to as
they tried to make the initial claim
that this was not them,
that this was caused by a rocket fired
by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
The crater that was caused by this
explosion was three by three feet wide,
about one foot deep.
And all of the experts that CNN spoke
to agreed that this is not consistent
with the kind of crater
that you would see from a bomb
that would be dropped from an aircraft.
And they also said
that it is not consistent with any kind of
artillery fire on that kind of a position.
Now, all of this doesn't change
the fact that Palestinian officials
continue to insist
that Israel is responsible for the strike.
Israel, of course, denies that and has
pointed to this very same rocket scenario.
What it also doesn't change is the anger,
the eruption of anger
that this hospital blast has caused
in the Arab world, in the Middle East.
We have watched these protests
over the last couple of days at U.S.
embassies, at Israeli embassies
in the region.
And ultimately,
you know, the majority of these this
this hospital blast has really become
quite a touch point, Anderson.
And I don't think
that that is going to change
despite this latest analysis, Anderson.",20231022
Q0NQFeLzsd8,Volunteer Israeli medic recounts horror of Hamas attack,data/en_CNN\Volunteer Israeli medic recounts horror of Hamas attack.jpg,"For two weeks now, Israel and Gaza
have been at war.
Israel and Hamas have been at war.
And the region is confronting
all the horrors of what
that actually means.
I want to bring in now
Amy Galliano,
a volunteer medic with United Hatzalah.
Now, Naomi,
on the afternoon of the Hamas attack,
and I just want everyone to know
when they're looking at you
now you're at work,
you're out saving your lives.
That's what you do.
Yeah, I know you are.
So I really appreciate you
just taking a few minutes to talk to us
because I know that
you want the world to know
and to be very aware of what happened.
And you think it's important that day.
On the afternoon of the Hamas attack,
you were
you were on call
looking for anyone who survived.
You were you were getting those calls.
You were going to the
kibbutzim along that border.
How do you even
cope with what you saw
before we even talk about what you saw?
How do you cope with it now?
Naomi?
So right now,
thanks to United SLA
and other organizations in Israel,
I have a full psychological treatment
and the other.
Day special treatment is called EMDR.
It's a system
that works on the brain
that helps you cope with traumatic events
before you develop
post-traumatic symptoms.
So I have that.
Sort. Of like.
You're getting.
Yes.
Now, me, I know that you witnessed
horrific things
with your own eyes
as you were trying to save lives.
I know that, again,
you have chosen to talk about this
because you don't want the world
to be able to turn away and forget
what happened, what you saw
with your own eyes.
What do you want people to know
about what you saw?
The first thing that I
want them to know that probably.
Hamas is.
ISIS,
the act
and the horrific things that we suffer
are beyond not worse
than anything compared to
her or any movie or any horror movie
that you could ever, ever imagine
being or
anywhere.
Begin with the babies that we saw dead.
Bleeding, beheaded
to the women that we saw
in the same situation, the same.
Poses, the blood to the elderly.
Yeah.
Let me your
take your pick.
Everything
Naomi, I have,
I think along with many others,
I felt frustration that
beheading became a part of this,
that that
the horrific things
that everyone knows
occurred, that why that would be
something that needed to be proven
when so many horrific other things also
happened.
But I just want to be
clear that you did see those acts.
You did see
people who had been beheaded.
Fortunately, I have seen that.
I've seen people that.
Their limbs have been taken. Out.
I've seen
mothers dead on top of their babies.
That were also dead.
I've seen
burned bodies of young.
Girls, young men,
people of.
All ages.
Babies burn, baby.
Burn them.
They're like,
I can't even start to describe the smell.
But at the beginning,
you don't even realize
what you're smelling.
It smells like barbecue, you know?
Doesn't make any sense.
And when you take a look
a little bit closer to both sides,
you realize that.
It is.
Bird meat. And its.
People.
Yeah, it's people.
Yeah.
And
it's something that
I don't think I
will ever be able to raise from my head
or from my mind.
Or my dream.
Naomi,
Was there anyone that
was in a position
that you were able to help them
when you got there?
Yes, it was.
It was around.
It took us so, so much time
till we found people
that were actually alive.
And when we did, we were able to help.
Yeah, thank God.
But compared to the dead people and.
The amount. Of dead, it wasn't.
It wasn't a lot.
But yes, we were able
were able to save a few families
from Bury
that we loaded
the ambulance with four
or five injured
at the same time
because there was no time
we were under fire
and we have to load the ambulance
with as much.
Injured as we can.
And they were severely,
severely injured in
their lungs because they.
They breathed
smoke for
at least three or 4 hours
because the terrorists, Hamas,
burned their houses.
Once they realized
they cannot go into the safe room.
So they just burned the whole place down.
And the family.
That stayed inside, some of them.
Were alive
and we were able to help them and
and save them and some of them not.
My God,
the fact that some of them were alive
and you were able were able to save them.
I mean, what a miracle.
What a miracle that is.
I mean, Naomi,
who obviously
this is how you reacted in a moment
that no one can comprehend
being in, you reacted by going in.
You talk about being under fire
as you're trying to save people.
Did you realize that you could have died?
Did you realize that
this was all still happening
while you were there or did
you even process it.
At that time?
You don't stop to process it.
You just think I'm here.
I'll do my best to stay alive
because I have to save more life.
I have to get back to my family.
So even you under fire, you try the best
as you can to stay alive.
If it's lying on the floor,
if it's try to hide behind cars,
if it's staying really, really quiet.
Even though with you an ambulance,
even though you're
driving through the night,
but you don't turn the light on,
you drive in complete, complete darkness
because, you know,
if you stay alive,
then you could save more lives.
And that's what you do.
Hour after hour.
Well, that's what you do.
I think so many of us I listen to you and
it's it's truly unbelievable.
It's an inspiration
that it's hard to even comprehend.
And you're still doing it, Naomi.
You're still you're still going out.
You're still able to work now.
Yeah.
Well, I took few days off this past week.
Now I'm back here.
I'm in Ashkelon right now.
I have my crew with me and my ambulance
on the other side over here.
I have the ambulance behind me right now.
I can be inside the ambulance.
I can't be inside the ambulance.
We have to be outside.
We have safe places here.
Because if there's any alarm
on, we have to go into the safe place.
And only when it stops, we could go out
and start safe with the rescue people and
and hoping that no one got hurt.
That's our best hope.
Well,
Naomi, I want to thank you very much.
Before you go,
I just want to ask you
a very simple question,
which is now that you've taken the time
to share these horrors
and to relive them
because you want people to hear that,
is there anything else
you want to tell anyone
watching about
what's happening in Israel,
about how you feel?
Is there anything else
you just want the world to hear?
Thank you so much for doing this.
I just want the world to know that
these things should never happen again.
You should know that Hamas is ISIS.
The acts.
That we saw
are against any humanity that possibly.
Be existing in this world.
And go home to.
Your families
and hug your kids and love them and
be with them.
Because from what I saw, maybe.
You could never know if.
It's the last day or the.
Last moment and you're
just tell your family
that you love them every day.
And if you're in a situation,
try to do your best
to help others,
because sometimes
even the smallest help
could change the world for someone else.
Naomi, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for taking the time.
Nima Galliano,
as you can see in Ashkelon, Israel, out
empty out right now, going to save lives
even after what she has endured and
taken the time and agony
to share it with all of us.",20231022
aCugwURWg7Q,What might be giving Israel pause before incursion? Expert lays out possible factors,data/en_CNN\What might be giving Israel pause before incursion Expert lays out possible factors.jpg,"A spokesman for the
Israeli Defense Forces.
The top spokesperson
says that it will start
firing more airstrikes
starting from today
and that a ground invasion
will begin once
the military conditions are optimal.
Well, joining me
now is the former State
Department negotiator
for the Middle East, Aaron David Miller,
along with former Department of Homeland
Security official Juliette Kayyem.
And thanks very much to you both.
Let me just start, Aaron, with you.
We know that Israel has been ready
to go for days at the military,
has been ready
a state of incredible readiness.
And when they
they now are giving 24 hour
leaves, 2 to 2 soldiers.
We've heard they come in, they come out.
I mean, they are ready.
And yet they have not yet gone.
What do you think is giving the pause?
Well, first of all, Aaron,
thanks for having me.
A lot of factors.
I think number one, there's weather.
Number two,
there's Israeli indecision
about the breadth and depth
that precisely
how they're going to do this.
Number three,
the president's visit,
I think, may have actually engendered
a good bit of thinking
on the part of the Israelis with respect
to the way they're going to do this.
And finally, I think the cruelest dilemma
is hostages.
Israelis are torn between
their commitment
not necessarily
to avenging the deaths of four,
1400 people,
but to preempting the possibility
this could ever happen again on one hand
and their commitment
to redeem the living.
I mean, you've been there now.
You've seen
you've talked to the families,
hostage, hostage redemption,
retrieving Israeli soldiers
and civilians dead
or alive from the battlefield
is a national priority.
So this is the cruelest dilemma of all.
Although I think in the end,
undermining
Hamas and destroying its capacity
to govern in Gaza
will probably be the greater priority.
And yes,
and it
it appears they've been making that
that as clear as they can.
And as I said,
the families of the hostages,
sometimes with anger,
sometimes with acceptance,
seem to know
that there isn't
any ambiguity there for them,
which only one can imagine
that cruel reality
for those for those families
who are so desperately hoping.
Juliet, The thing is,
of course, as Israel
waits, is ready
and waits, there's obviously
the military issue of that,
which is how long
can you be at such a state of readiness
with 360,000 people on a border?
And wait, know,
how long can you stay like,
you know, down on the start moon
On the start line. Right.
There's also the question
that as they wait,
the frustration builds around the world.
The protests that we've seen
obviously have been widespread
around the region.
But one particular one
that stood out to me
that I keep mentioning
because I think the scale
just really hits me.
80,000 people
protesting out
outside the consulate in Adana, Turkey.
Adana Turkey is not a place
that most people in the United States
even heard of. 80,000 people.
They had to shut that consulate.
So what are the risks here? Yeah.
The risks are multiple.
I think these are the ones that
the President Biden has been trying
to highlight
to the Israelis
based essentially on our lessons
in Afghanistan.
One is after being attacked,
after we were attacked on 911,
one is what is the end game?
It is one thing to say,
you know,
for those of us in counterterrorism,
we are going to make Hamas not able
to govern in Gaza, then what right is is
are the Israelis actually anticipating
in Gaza?
And if not, then then who is right?
So that's the first part.
The second is
the issue of civilian deaths.
You know, going back 20 years, we were
we were probably not thinking about what
civilian deaths meant in Afghanistan.
Well,
it essentially meant
that you were radicalizing populations
that might not
otherwise have been radicalized.
So, you know, obviously,
the human rights issues are key.
And and
the third is,
if you don't have an answer
to the first two questions,
how do you stop a regional conflict
if you you know, Biden's success
so far, I have to
say, is in is what's not happened.
Right.
I mean, in other words,
the Israelis have not gone in yet.
There hasn't been.
There's there's regional
anger and there's lots of criticism.
But you haven't had the kind of unrest
that one might have
anticipated last Saturday.
So that's that's the dialog
that has to go on it.
But but
what's the endgame here for Israel?
You're not going to govern God's is Gaza.
I mean, that's that's their challenge.
And but, Erin, it also
comes as there's been this,
you know,
incredible backlash in the United States.
It's not just pro-Palestinian rallies.
Of course.
It's it's horrific.
Things like
Polo Sandoval was just reporting
with the head of a synagogue
being stabbed to death outside her home.
I mean,
there are horrific
things happening right?
There is
there is a backlash
that that is that is building.
And the reality of it is, is
how dangerous is this in the U.S.?
Erin.
Well, here and that's a
that's a question
you and I could talk about
probably for days.
Given the divisiveness, the polarization,
hate speech, social media,
the behavior of certain
American politicians
which encourage this,
I think is extremely dangerous.
Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.
And that's
those currents
clearly are going to be fed
by what happened
on October 7th and Israel's response
in Gaza.
No question about that.
Our own broken house, frankly, is in
some respects
as much on display in the president.
I think, in his remarks
day before yesterday
addressed this question.
But I think it's absolutely critical
that we continue to talk
about the importance
of tolerance, of mutual understanding.
And, of course,
as Juliette notes,
Department of Homeland Security, the FBI
follow these these groups.
If, in fact,
you're talking about organized responses
as closely as possible.
Right. Right.
And the president did,
of course, talk about
how horrible both things
are Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, that
the US must not succumb to those.
Thank you both so very much.",20231022
lGXgCyZvBzo,Humanitarian worker describes why it's 'impossible' to evacuate northern Gaza,data/en_CNN\Humanitarian worker describes why it's 'impossible' to evacuate northern Gaza.jpg,"Nearly 40 tons of medical aid
and disaster
relief supplies for Gaza left
India for Egypt this morning.
This is according to India's
Ministry of External Affairs.
Despite the Rafah crossing
opening for a short time
yesterday to allow trucks
with aid, 20 trucks to be exact,
to pass through.
It remains unclear
if or when the border will reopen today.
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez
joining us now
with how President Biden is responding
to the humanitarian efforts.
Priscilla.
Well, in a statement just yesterday,
the president
attributed this to days
of diplomatic engagement
at the highest level.
Of course, these attacks.
But eight trucks passing through happened
on the heels of President Biden's
trip to Israel,
as well as secretary of State
Antony Blinken.
High stakes shuttle diplomacy
over the last several days.
Now, in a statement,
the president went on to note
that this is a critical and urgent need,
saying, quote,
I made it clear
from the outset
of this crisis in both
my public statements
and private conversations
that humanitarian assistance
was a critical and urgent need
that had to get moving.
And I express my deep
personal appreciation
for the leadership of President
al-Sisi, of Egypt, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel
and the United Nations
to allow the resumption
of this assistance.
And, of course,
we should also mention
that President Biden
did speak with Egypt's president
this week,
where the two agreed for this crossing
to be opened.
But, of course, this remains a challenge.
We have heard from aid organizations
who have welcomed
the trucks
that have been able
to pass into Gaza so far.
But they note
that this can only be the beginning.
They still need so much more.
So the White House still working on
trying to facilitate that,
working with their counterparts
in the region, while
also keeping a focus
on getting Palestinian Americans
out of Gaza,
which they have still not been able
to do.
Amara.
Victor Alvarez for us, thanks so much.
Joining us
now is the Belfast
spokesperson for the Palestine
Red Crescent Society.
Thank you for being with us.
Let me start with the 17 trucks in Egypt
waiting at the Rafah crossing,
hoping to get into Gaza.
Our reporters have spoken with those.
Truck drivers say they're optimistic.
What can you tell us about
what's on the trucks and the probability
that they'll get across that
border today?
Good evening.
Thanks for having me.
So, yes,
as you highlighted,
there are dozens of the trucks
who are still waiting after
crossing the border, waiting to get
into Gaza.
What we have received up
to now
is a tow truck hoping
this will be a glimpse of hope
for the entry of the rest of the trucks,
because
20 trucks is only like a drop
in the ocean of need.
We still need a lot in terms of food,
even water.
2 million Palestinian civilians
now are with no food or even water
besides electricity,
as well as not only one hospital,
all hospitals in Gaza are witnessing
a collapse,
the state of having shortages
and medicine,
medical supplies,
as well as running out of the fuel.
And by the way, if fuel was not also
delivered by the first shipment
of the humanitarian aid,
which included food,
water, medical supply and medicine,
but not fields.
Are you getting any indication
as to when,
if at all, there will be a sustained
delivery of aid into Gaza?
So basically, all the
international organizations,
along with countries,
have been working
due to all the last week long
to get the aid there.
And hopefully now after this aid
was already in
to continue
working and advocating
for the entry of the humanitarian aid.
This this should not be a one time.
We need a humanitarian corridor
to allow the entry of medical supplies
and the humanitarian aid
at all the time in a safe way
to guarantee to fulfill the needs
of the humanitarian situation
now in Gaza,
because the humanitarian situation
is literally catastrophic,
whether in terms of extreme
shortages of food and water
or even hospitals
who are now running out of fuel.
And without the fuel, simply
all hospitals can't operate.
And that electricity means
killing thousands
of Palestinian civilians who were injured
and now inside the hospital.
So all of the aid does not include fuel.
That's why
we still count
on the international community
to keep advocating for the entry
of the humanitarian aid,
not only from the border,
but from all borders
to control the from the Israelis,
because as an occupying power
has a responsible military to ensure
to provide
the essential needs
for civilians in Gaza,
as well as hospitals who are implementing
their health care worker services.
And this should be not continued.
Health
care facilities and hospitals,
along with civilians,
should not pay the price
and should be protected and respected
according to the.
Item that the Israelis concern
is that the fuel, if it gets
in, will make it to Hamas.
Let me ask you about the latest
leaflets dropped by IDF
that and the Israelis contest this
CNN translation.
But it is that if
Palestinians do not move
south, they may be seem
partners of the terrorists.
What can you tell us about
your organization's ability to provide
aid to northern Gaza
if the order from
the IDF is to move south?
We know that there are still
many thousands of Palestinians who are in
northern Gaza.
Yeah, let me clarify something.
In the targeted area
where Israel and threatened
to be evacuated
around a million and 200,000 Palestinians
who are live and the Gaza and the north.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
were still stuck in Gaza, in their homes
or any schools or even hospitals.
They couldn't find their way
to evacuate themselves
simply because of that
and asking people
to evacuate themselves
under continuous bombardment.
Besides, there is no transportation,
complete destruction
of the roads and infrastructure.
So absolutely, they have no way to go to.
They don't have an option
to choose either.
It's the same case
for hospitals because Israel
not only asking civilians
to evacuate themselves
under continuous bombardment,
evacuation orders
from Israeli occupation forces
for around a 20 foot hospital in Gaza
and then ordered to evacuate,
which are absolutely impossible
to implement W at all, has announced that
evacuation orders for hospitals
are impossible to implement
and they constitute a death penalty
for the patients.
Our hospital is one of the hospital
that have received the evacuation order.
We have 500 patients,
some of them in the intensive care unit,
and we will not be able and accept
to rest the lives of our patients,
most of them, or to.
Ensure an impossible situation
for those hospitals as well.
Nebel of gaza. Thank you very much.",20231022
KjA4Xz4bRU0,House Intel Chair on why he thinks Hamas released American hostages,data/en_CNN\House Intel Chair on why he thinks Hamas released American hostages.jpg,"The Biden administration
is asking Israel
to delay its ground incursion into Gaza.
That's
according to two sources
briefed on discussions
who say that the delay
would potentially allow
for both more negotiations
over the hostages
that Hamas took on October 7th
and also would allow for more
aid to be allowed
to be delivered
to innocent civilians in Gaza.
The sources say that Friday's
release of two American hostages,
Judith and Natalie Ronan
from outside Chicago,
signaled that negotiator
negotiators believed
they could make progress
on freeing
some of the more than 200 hostages
believed to be currently held by Hamas.
Joining me now to discuss
is the chairman of the House Select
Committee on Intelligence, Congressman
Mike Turner of Ohio.
Congressman, thank you so much
for joining us.
So two
American hostages were released by Hamas.
This is obviously a brutal
terrorist group.
They didn't release the hostages
out of the goodness of their hearts
or for humanitarian reasons.
So why did they release the hostages?
What did they get in exchange?
Well, certainly there continue
to have negotiations and discussions.
But what we're very aware of,
which, as you
just noted, is, you know,
Hamas is a franchise of Iran,
that the brutal terrorist attacks
that have occurred in
Israel are going to result in an Israel
entering into Gaza and in taking
this conflict to Hamas itself
in order to diminish their ability
to continue to to threaten Israel
as we see that unfold.
Certainly getting humanitarian
aid is important.
Getting the hostages back are important.
And as their opportunities
that those break, you know, certainly
they need to be pursued.
But if the United States
should not be dictating to Israel
the prosecution of this conflict,
they certainly are on the ground.
They know the risks.
They know the consequences.
And certainly the United States supports
their efforts to diminish this
this terrorist threat.
How involved were American officials
in securing the release
of these two American hostages?
And are you optimistic
more hostages might be released?
You know,
how do you know
how many more Americans
are currently being held
hostage in Gaza by Hamas?
You know, I would certainly
say that, you know,
Hamas needs to release all hostages
and certainly all American hostages.
You know,
there are some reports
that have been public now
that perhaps all of the Hamas
leadership was not aware
of the brutal terrorist attack
that was going to occur into Israel,
that maybe some surprise
and leadership of Hamas that they now
find themselves
with tanks on their borders
and a conflict going to ensue.
And they may see that
these hostages
are an important opportunity to
to return them back to Israel
and the United States
so that they can get out of the way
and hopefully address this issue of
how will they move
from a terrorist organization
and state
a franchise of Iran
to an area where there can be peace.
So obviously,
as the chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee,
you're a member of the Gang of Eight,
you get to see the very top
classified intelligence
who is responsible
for the explosion at the Baptist
Hospital in Gaza Tuesday, which
the Palestinian health ministry,
which which is obviously controlled
by Hamas, blamed on the Israelis.
But U.S.
intelligence seems to have concluded
it was
actually more likely
to have been caused
by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Who is responsible,
according to the evidence you've seen?
And how conclusive is that intelligence?
Well, my my counterpart,
ranking member
Jim Himes from Connecticut,
the two of us received a briefing
that included
not just the conclusions
by the administration,
but also the assessment.
What was the process undertaken
in order to determine
that this was not the fault of Israel?
And both of us concluded, in fact,
we released a statement
that we concur with
the administration's conclusion
that this was not a result
of Israeli action.
There are there is a Democratic member
of Congress who is out there
still blaming it on Israel.
And I've heard some members
say that she should be briefed.
And I'm wondering,
is there an intelligence briefing
being offered to members of Congress
so that everyone can be informed
as to what the the latest information is?
Sure.
William
Tracey has actually done
a very good job of pulling together
both the leadership in the House.
We've been to the
meeting with Jake
Sullivan and National Security Council
and
getting their information
and get a briefing directly from him.
Plus all of the House of Representatives.
We're called into a briefing
where we both had
the Office of Director
of National Intelligence
and the Department of Defense.
So there's been a tremendous
amount of effort
to get information to members.
And I think this is very important,
as it has been in the Ukraine conflict,
especially as the administration moves
forward to look for an aid package
to get through Congress
for both the conflicts in Ukraine and
and Israel.
Based on what you know,
do you think the Israelis
are doing enough
to protect the innocent civilians
in Gaza?
I'm sure you've heard Israeli
leadership say that
Palestinians are victims
of Hamas as well.
And then they are.
I mean, there is no question, you know,
there was an election in which Hamas
came to power in Gaza
and then suspended all elections
and certainly the people in Gaza
are captive to them.
And they're certainly
a brutal terrorist organization
that that is is ruling that.
And I do think
that the people in the Palestinians
in Gaza are victims of them as well.
Israel has done
a great deal of effort
to try to get people
to move out of the way
as they go in to try to remove Hamas
and its
ability to execute terrorist acts.
This certainly is going to be very,
very difficult.
I don't
do know that the United States is working
both on the intelligence side
and the strategy side
with Israel
to try to determine ways to increase
the the the security
of Palestinians in the area
who are not involved in Hamas.
But this is obviously going to be
be very, very difficult.
And it it goes both to the
the security
and safety of the Palestinians
and the Israelis that must be removed.
President Biden just announced
a $105 billion aid package
for Israel, Ukraine,
Taiwan and the southern border.
Obviously,
the legislative branch
of the United States government
can't do anything
until House Republicans pick a speaker.
A Do you support the package?
B.
At what point does
the dysfunction of House Republicans
jeopardize national security?
Right.
I do support the package.
I think it's incredibly important
that we move forward
to make certain that we stand up
against the authoritarian regimes
that are trying to undermine democracies
that are our allies.
I think also that we should be more
focused on Russia
as a threat to the United States
than we've have been,
because this is not
just an issue of Ukraine or not Ukraine.
This is an issue of
Russia's our adversary,
and they intend to do us
and our allies harm.
And of course, with Israel,
this is one that has great clarity.
We've all seen and have just
been saddened by the atrocities
that we've seen
and the need for
addressing the issue of Hamas
with respect to the national security.
Clearly, having a house
that's not function is
is certainly a security
threat for our country.
The this
aid package,
though, is not being delayed
as a result of the House.
At this point, the Senate has taken up
this aid package.
It looks like
it will be about two weeks before
that package
comes out of the Senate itself.
And certainly we all hope
we'll have a speaker by that.
There are seven candidates
so far for speaker.
Is there
one that you particularly
are leaning towards
and do you think that
that person can get 217 votes?
You're getting 217
is obviously going to be very difficult.
And is his the sort of Rubik's
cube of of the answer to all of this?
I supported Kevin McCarthy.
I supported Jim Jordan.
I supported Scalise.
I supported Jim on the floor also.
I think we need to find someone
who hopefully can get to
to 17 before
we're all poised
and very drama fashion on the House floor
trying to determine how this will unfold.
I really hope in the next several days
as we come together
as the Republican caucus,
that we're able to resolve that
so that we go
unified to the House floor
and deliver a speaker.
I hope you don't take this personally,
but do you guys have any
idea how clownish you look?
Well, you know,
Jake, I'm
very fond of saying that
Congress is a lot like high school,
but even more so.
So hopefully we'll get past this.
And, you know,
I certainly have been part
of the governing majority,
and I'm going to stay part of that
and look forward to
those who are on the fringes,
hopefully coming together.
So that we can get as speaker.
I said that to Congressman
Womack last week in high school,
and he said that that's an insult
to high school students.
It's more like junior high.
Congressman Turner,
Chairman Turner, good to see you.
I hope you guys pick the speaker
sometime soon.
Thanks, Jake.",20231022
HnlI0ToSnro,Former US General says it will be 'exceedingly difficult' to destroy Hamas,data/en_CNN\Former US General says it will be 'exceedingly difficult' to destroy Hamas.jpg,"In his almost
four decade long
military career, retired General
David Petraeus faced
plenty of insurgencies,
mainly Iraq and Afghanistan.
What do his insights
from an extraordinary
career tell us about this new war
between Israel and Hamas?
David Petraeus joins me now
alongside the historian Andrew Roberts.
The two are coauthors
of the new book Conflict
The Evolution of Warfare
from 1945 to Ukraine.
Andrew is, of course, now
Baron Roberts of Belgrade.
You have been elevated to the peerage.
Dave, let me start with you.
This issue of destroying Hamas.
Is that a realistic goal?
I think it is a realistic goal,
but it's going to be
exceedingly difficult.
We've seen how long it takes
to clear cities roughly
the size of Gaza City.
Nine months
for the Iraqi security forces
to clear the Islamic State out of Mosul.
As an example, with our assistance,
IDF much better, much more capable.
But still, it's going to be very,
very tough in how they do
it is very important.
Again, we had a question on the wall
always, Will this operation
take more bad guys off the street
than it creates by its conduct
and you've got to be careful
that the answer to that
is going to be yes.
And there has to also be a vision
for the future.
They can accomplish this mission.
But then keep in mind
that the definition of destroy
in military
doctrinal terms is render
the enemy
incapable of accomplishing his mission
without reconstitution.
So whatever it is
that follows has to ensure
that this cannot be reconstituted.
Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic
Jihad will try to come back
so that whatever it is
that takes over from the Israelis
and they have to determine that urgently.
Ehud Barak was absolutely right on that.
But they're not going to just do
humanitarian assistance
or reconstruction.
They're going to have to conduct
a counterinsurgency campaign
to keep Hamas in the Islamic
Jihad from coming back.
When you did the surge,
one of the things
that seemed to be so successful in that
postwar operation was you brokered
a reconciliation between the Sunnis
and the Shias politically. Yes.
So, I mean,
do you need some kind
of political vision? Very much so.
There has to be a vision
for the people in Gaza,
for the Palestinians,
that distinguishes very clearly
the war is not on them.
It's actually to make their lives better.
If they will reject Hamas,
their life will be better.
By the way,
the same for those in the West Bank.
There has to be that.
And again,
what we did is we said to the Sunnis,
if you'll break with Al Qaida
in Iraq, support us first
and then the government and then later.
The same with the Iranian supported
Shia militia. Let's strip you away.
And of course, we defeated
then the other elements,
the militia
that remained, and also al Qaeda in Iraq
and the Sunni insurgent groups.
So that that vision is crucial.
And again,
I think Ehud Barak had
that exactly right as well.
A quick thought on
Hezbollah before I go to you.
Do you think Hezbollah will
launch a serious attack from the north?
I don't think they want to do that.
But the pressure will grow
as the damage and destruction.
Inevitably,
there are going to be
civilian casualties.
Urban combat is fiendishly difficult.
And I can't imagine
a context
that is more difficult than this one.
Hundreds of miles of tunnels,
suicide bombers, an enemy
that doesn't wear uniforms,
uses human shields,
civilians, and,
of course, the over 200 hostages
that are still there.
So that's going to be very,
very challenging for them.
And again, you have to have this vision
that's going to try
to separate the people from Hamas.
Again, also in the West Bank as well.
Hezbollah, though,
got hammered
in 2006, much worse than we realized
at the time.
We reassessed at several occasions.
They'll do the occasional attacks
and all the rest of that.
I don't think they want to launch
all 150,000 rockets,
which would be devastating for Israel,
but then would be even more devastating
for Hezbollah. And they know that.
And just operationally,
of course, it's also very good for Israel
to be able
to promise
the Palestinian Arabs
that they will be able
to go back to Gaza,
because then you could
physically also separate them
from the Hamas
that you're trying to fight in Gaza.
Lots in history that bears that out.
Historically, historically.
You talk about
militia has been
one of the great successes
of counterinsurgency.
What do you draw
as the key lesson
to succeeding in a counterinsurgency?
Well,
the way that Malaysia worked
is that they were able to offer
the people independence.
Malaysia became independence in 1957,
and that was immensely important
in winning
what was said at the time
to be the hearts and minds.
That was coined the phrase.
Yes, exactly.
And that.
Meant they matter and no matter here as.
Well.
And so Gerald Templer
coined that phrase and and it worked.
And it wasn't just in Malaysia.
It also worked in the Oman campaign
where they were able to offer
progress sexual, physical,
educational, agricultural,
medical progress.
And that's also something that obviously
could be an important part to play here.",20231022

ERIN BURNETT IN TEL AVIV STARTS
IT OFF.
THAT IS QUITE A CLAIM BY
PRESIDENT HERZOG.
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS?
&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT.
LET'S GO THROUGH WHAT THEY SAY
THEY FOUND.
THEY SAY THEY FOUND A USB ON ONE
OF THE HAMAS MILITANTS INVOLVED
IN THE ATTACKS, AND ON THAT USB
THERE WAS INFORMATION FROM WHAT
HAD BEEN AN AL QAEDA 2003
OPERATIONAL MANUAL WHICH
INCLUDED A PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS
ON HOW TO ASSEMBLE A CYANIDE
CHEMICAL WEAPON AND HOW TO
DISPERSE IT WITH CRUDE DRAWINGS.
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING.
THEY ARE HOWEVER CLEAR THAT
THERE WAS NO INDICATIONS AT
LEAST WE'VE RECEIVED NO
INDICATIONS FROM THE ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT THAT THERE WERE ANY
PLANS TO DEPLOY SUCH A WEAPON.
JUST THAT IT WAS ON THAT USB.
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE WERE
BATTLE PLANS FOUND ON OPERATIVE
AS WELL, WE'VE SEEN THOSE
OURSELVES THAT GO THROUGH EACH
OF THE KIBBUTZIM THAT WERE
ATTACKED, STREET BY STREET, AN
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF DETAILED
INFORMATION.
AND ON THOSE PLANS WE DO KNOW
TALKING TO SECURITY AT AT LEAST
ONE KIBBUTZ THAT THEY FOLLOWED
THOSE TO THE ""T"" AND WENT ITEM
BY ITEM.
SO WE CAN'T MISS THE
SIGNIFICANCE, BUT THERE IS NO
INDICATION AS OF YET THAT THERE
WAS ANY PLAN TO USE ANY SUCH
WEAPON.
&gt;&gt; THE BARRAGE OF AIRSTRIKES
OVERNIGHT, 320 TARGETS IS WHAT
THE IDF IS SAYING, WHAT ARE YOU
SEEING AND HEARING THIS MORNING?
&gt;&gt; SO 320 AIRSTRIKES, THEY GIVE
OUT NUMBERS MOST DAYS.
SO RUNNING AT A 500 STRIKE OVER
48 HOUR PERIOD.
THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT
IS HAPPENING IN GAZA.
THE PALESTINIAN HEALTH AUTHORITY
THERE IS SAYING THAT FOR EXAMPLE
NEAR RAFAH THAT THERE WERE FOUR
STRIKES THERE ON INDIVIDUAL
HOMES AND THAT 29 PEOPLE WERE
KILLED.
IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY.
BUT IT DOES SPEAK TO SOMETHING
BOTH SIDES ARE ACTUALLY AGREEING
ON, EVEN IF NOT EXPLICITLY,
WHICH IS THAT THE ISRAELI
STRIKES ARE EXTREMELY TARGETED.
SO TARGETING SPECIFIC HOMES
WHERE THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE
ARE LINKS TO HAMAS MILITANTS,
ALSO TALKING ABOUT ISLAMIC
JIHAD, THAT THEY ARE INCLUDING
PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD
TARGETS AS LEGITIMATE TARGETS IN
ADDITION TO HAMAS MILITANTS
ITSELF.
WE'LL GET TO NIC IN A MOMENT TO
HEAR MORE, BUT THERE ARE DAYS
WHEN WE'VE HEARD THE ASSAULT,
YOU CAN HEAR ARTILLERY.
HERE WE DO HEAR OFTEN THE THUDS
OF THOSE BOMBS AND IT HAS BEEN
QUIET TODAY.
IT WAS QUIET YESTERDAY.
AT LEAST FROM WHERE WE'RE
STANDING AT THE BEGINNING TWO
WEEKS AGO GHOEN I WAS HERE.
IT WAS A CONSTANT THUD THAT YOU
COULD ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY FEEL
THROUGH YOUR BODY THROUGHOUT THE
DAY.
WE ARE NOT HEARING THAT.
SO THAT IS DIFFERENT.
AND THERE ARE THOSE THOUSANDS OF
TROOPS MASSED ALONG THE BORDER
WAITING FOR THE GREEN LIGHT TO
GO IN, ALL UP ALONG THE 25 MILE
LONG BORDER.
ISRAELI OFFICIALS HERE HAVE BEEN
WARNING FOR DAYS BUT THE
QUESTION ROMAINS WHEN EXACTLY IT
WILL HAPPEN.
AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU WHO HAS BEEN PRESENTED
WITH MANY POSSIBLE OPERATIONS
THAT HE COULD GREEN LIGHT, THEY
COULD GO ON, SO WE'LL SEE
WHETHER THIS WAIT INDICATES A
SHIFT IN HIS DECISION MAKING ON
WHAT GOING IN ENTAILS.
NIC ROBERTSON AS PHIL SAID IS IN
ISRAEL.
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: OVERNIGHT LAST
NIGHT THE LATE EVENING HOURS
INTO THE EARLY MORNING HOURS,
REALLY HEAVY BOMBARDMENT SHAKING
THIS HOUSE, THE MOST SUSTAINED
AMOUNT OF MISSILES AND ARTILLERY
THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED HERE.
AND WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR TWO
WEEKS.
TODAY AS YOU SAY MUCH QUIETER.
WE HEAR DRONES IN THE SKY, BUT
NO SOUNDS OF IMPACTS HERE IN
NORTHERN GAZA.
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE
HEARING AS WELL IS THE REASON
THAT THE GOVERNMENT HERE IS --
NETANYAHU'S GOVERNMENT IS SO
CONCERNED ABOUT HUMANITARIAN
PAUSES, THEY THINK THAT THAT
WILL BE USED BY HAMAS TO GAIN AN
ADVANTAGE, TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF
THE PRESSURE THAT THEY ARE
FACING AT THE MOMENT.
AND THIS PRESSURE DESIGNED TO
HELP MOVE ALONG HOSTAGE
RELEASES, TALKING TO SOME OF THE
TROOPS WHO ARE CLOSE TO THE
FRONT HERE, THEY TALK ABOUT, YOU
KNOW, BEING TOLD TO BE READY FOR
ACTION AND THEN ACTION NOT
COMING AND SORT OF STOOD
UP/STOOD DOWN.
BUT SPEAKING TO PAST VETERANS OF
WARS HERE, THEY SAY WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS HERE BEFORE, WE CAN
STAY OUT AND DO THIS IN THE
FIELD AS LONG AS WE LIKE.
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TROOPS
AT THE FRONTLINES, THAT IS A
FORCE WAITING TO GO.
BRISTLING WITH BATTLE READY
TROOPS, FARMERS' FIELDS NORTH OF
GAZA CHURN WITH A CONTROLLED
FURY OF A NATION READYING FOR AN
INCURSION TO STRIKE HAMAS.
YET THEY ARE WAITING WITH NO
EXPLANATION WHY.
FEELS LIKE THE EARLY RUSH FOR
BATTLE READINESS HAS PASSED.
TROOPS  SS ARE DEPLOYED STANDIN.
THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG CAN
THEY BE KEPT OUT HERE.
ACCORDING TO FORMER IDF GENERAL,
AS LONG AS IS NEEDED.
THERE ARE MILITARY GAINS.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE NOW IMPROVING OUR
INTELLIGENCE AND OUR CAPACITY OF
TARGETS.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT THE POLITICAL
CAL COULD YOU RACE HERE IS MORE
COMPLICATED.
&gt;&gt; I THINK BOTH IN WASHINGTON
AND IN JERUSALEM THEY UNDERSTAND
THAT THE LEGITIZATION WINDOW IS
CLOSING QUICKLY.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: CIVILIAN LOSSES IN
GAZA ARE GROWING.
MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEM
CHILDREN ACCORDING TO
PALESTINIAN HEALTH OFFICIALS.
LENGTHY NEGOTIATIONS HAVE LED TO
TWO AMERICAN HOSTAGES RELEASED.
A TINIMENT A OF HUMANITARIAN AID
HAS CROSSED INTO GAZA THAT
ISRAEL FEARS ENDS UP IN HAMAS'
HANDS.
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU CALCULUS OF WHEN TO
SEND IN GROUND TROOPS HAS NEVER
BEEN SO FRAUGHT UNDER PRESSURE
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE FOR MORE
HOSTAGE RELEASES.
&gt;&gt; NETANYAHU IS IN A REAL
PROBLEM.
HE CANNOT SAY NO TO BIDEN BUT HE
CANNOT SAY YES TO THE
HUMANITARIAN AID THAT DRIFTS
INTO NORTHERN GAZA.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT HE IS ALSO
UNDER PRESSURE AT HOME TOO.
MILITARY AND OTHERS HAWKISH FOR
DECISIVE BLOW AGAINST HAMAS.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE FINISHING PREPARING,
YOU KNOW, THE GROUND FORCE
BECAUSE WE'VE CHANGED PLANS, WE
ARE GOING TO -- FOR HEAVY
MANEUVERING.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: NETANYAHU'S DILEMMA
COMPOUNDED BY HIS DEPENDENCE ON
AMERICAN WEAPONS.
&gt;&gt; THE PRESSURE FROM WASHINGTON
IS REAL.
IT IS REAL AS STRONG AND THE
PRIME MINISTER SAYS MANY TIMES
TO HIS MINISTERS, LISTEN, WE ARE
GETTING FROM THE UNITED STATES
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHERE LESS THAN A
WEEK AGO THESE FIELDS WERE
TEEMING WITH TANKS, TROOPS
MAKING LAST MINUTE REPAIRS,
TODAY JUST TRACKS IN THE SAND.
THERE IS A SOLDIER'S JACKET
HERE, BREAD AND BAG ON THE
TABLE.
THE QUESTION IS, WHERE HAVE ALL
THE TANKS GONE, FORWARD FOR
INCURSION OR BACK TO BASE FOR A
PAUSE.
CLOSE TO THE FRONT LINE IN GAZA
THESE DAYS, MORE QUESTIONS THAN
ANSWERS.
AN INCURSION STILL HIGHLY
PROBABLE BUT WHEN.
AND WHILE WE'VE BEEN STANDING
HERE THE LAST FEW MINUTES, WE'VE
HEARD SMALL ARMS FIRE, GUNFIRE
COMING FROM THIS DIRECTION OVER
HERE WHICH IS THE DIRECTION
TOWARDS THE BORDER.
WE CAN'T TELL WHAT IS ACTUALLY
HAPPENING THERE, BUT I THINK
THAT IT IS INDICATIVE OF THE
TENSIONS ALONG THE BORDER FENCE
AT THE MOMENT.
&gt;&gt; NIC, HERE IS THE THING PEP I
KNOW YOU ARE SAYING TROOPS CAN
TELLING YOU THAT THEY CAN
INDICATE INDEFINITELY AND YOU'D
EXPECT THEM TO AND ISAY THAT.
BUT THE REPORT THAT U.S. IS
PUTTING PRESSURE ON NETANYAHU TO
WAIT, IT MAKES SENSE, BUT HOW
LONG CAN NETANYAHU WAIT AND DOES
HE LOSE HIS POSITION OF STRENGTH
AND AUTHORITY BY APPEARING TO
CAVE TO U.S. INTERESTS ON THE
TIMING OF WHAT HE DOES?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU KNOW, I THINK
PART OF THE CALCULUS FOR
NETANYAHU WILL BE WHAT DO HIS
ENEMIES IN THE REGION PERCEIVE.
IF THE UNITED STATES AND
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS ABLE
TO TELL ISRAEL NOT TO GO AFTER
HAMAS, FOR MANY ISRAELIS THAT
WILL ULTIMATELY LOOK LIKE A SIGN
OF WEAKNESS AND THE CALCULUS
WILL BE WHAT WILL HEZBOLLAH DO
KNOWING THAT, KNOWING THAT THEY
ARE POTENTIALLY ABOUT TO LAUNCH
ATTACKS ON ISRAEL AT SCALE IF
THE IDF GOES INTO GAZA.
SO I THINK THAT THAT ALL BECOMES
PART OF THE CALCULUS.
CALCULUS THAT ISRAELIS
THEMSELVES GENERALLY DON'T FEEL
SAFE AFTER THE BARBARIC ATTACKS
MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AGO.
I THINK THAT HE CAN HOLD BACK
FOR A WHILE, BUT EVERYONE IS
POISED AS AN EXPECTATION.
BUT THEN IT BECOME AS QUESTION
WHAT PRECISELY IS THE IN-DURING
GOING TO DO, HOW BIG WILL IT BE,
HOW MANY CIVILIANS WILL BE IN
THE WAY OF THAT INCURSION.
BUT WHEN IT COMES BACK TO HOW
LONG CAN THEY WAIT, ONE VETERAN
OF THE 1967 WAR, ARAB/ISRAELI
WAR SAID WE WERE HELD IN THE
DESERT FOR A MONTH AND WE
TRAINED, WE PRACTICED.
AND ACTUALLY THAT WORKED TO OUR
ADVANTAGE.
SO I THINK THAT THE PSYCHE HERE
IS NOT JUST SOLDIERS WILL TELL
YOU WHAT THEY THINK YOU WANT TO
HEAR AND WHAT THEIR COMMANDERS
WANT YOU TO HEAR.
I THINK THE PSYCHE IS WHAT IT
TAKES, WE'LL DO.",20231023

-S-CE_zE5wk,Sources say 2 more hostages released by Hamas,data/en_CNN\Sources say 2 more hostages released by Hamas.jpg,"We are
beginning with breaking news
in the Israel-Hamas war.
Sources telling CNN
that the terror group Hamas
has released two more hostages
who are believed to
be Israeli citizens Anderson.
Yes, you know,
two Americans were released last week.
Sources
also saying that today's release
is happening
with the help of officials from Qatar
who are involved in the other release,
as well as well as Egypt this time.
CNN chief national security correspondent
Alex Marquardt
joins us with some details,
along with CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins.
Caitlin, let's start with you.
What exactly do we know?
Obviously, we have some information
that we are not giving out
until all of this is confirmed,
because this is still
a very fluid situation.
They are not in
Israel, is my understanding.
Right.
It's an incredibly fluid situation.
And so we are holding off
on some of the details
while we run those down,
because this is a very
sensitive situation.
We want to make sure we get everything
completely right.
But what we do know
is that two more hostages
have been released by Hamas.
We are told
I'm told that they're not actually
in the custody
of the Israeli government yet,
but that they are on the way there
right now.
And so that is part of the sensitivity
around this reporting
about these hostages.
Obviously, given their situation.
But this is significant.
I am told that they are both
two female hostages
that have been released.
They, of course, would be only the third
and the fourth hostages in total
to be released in the hundreds
That we do believe,
according to the IDF,
that Hamas has in their custody
at this moment.
And so what we are
still trying to figure out, Anderson, is
whether or not they are dual citizens.
We do know they are Israeli citizens,
but maybe they have dual nationalities,
as we've seen
with a lot of these hostages
and the people
who were abducted by Hamas.
So those are details
that we are still trying to figure out.
But it does appear that this came about
from some quiet mediation
that was happening
behind the scenes with the Egyptian
and Qatar governments
that have been obviously playing
a really significant role
in trying to get these hostages
released,
because Israel has made very clear
from all officials
that they are not personally negotiating
with Hamas
for the release of these hostages.
And I do think this is a big part
of what we are seeing here
when it comes to the timing of what
everyone is waiting to happen
next in Gaza,
which is that
Israeli ground invasion
that we know
officials have said
and telegraphed quite
clearly is expected to come.
There have been discussions with U.S.
officials, with other government
officials about holding off on that
until more of these negotiations
for these hostages can happen.
And so right now,
what we are working to confirm
is the identities of these two hostages,
where exactly they are now.
And once
they get into the custody of the IDF,
which, Anderson,
as you know, is
what happened with those two hostages
last week, they came to the Gaza border.
They were
then given over to the IDF
who brought them to a military base
first in central Israel.
That's where they greeted
their parents before
having those medical checkups
and obviously kind of debriefings
of what they've been going through.
Yeah, And Alex, there's
usually this interim step right handed.
Usually Hamas,
wherever it's holding them,
hands them over to the representatives
of the international community,
the Red Cross,
and then they make that transfer
to two IDF officials.
These are two.
There were two that
the remains who we talked about
last week.
Let's talk about the timing of this.
Clearly,
Hamas has many captives in their custody.
They could release all of them
if they wanted to.
They are releasing them two by two.
What does that tell you?
Well, it's certainly good news.
No one's going to tell you
otherwise, Anderson.
This is fantastic for those families
as well as for the Russians
who saw two of their family members
come back on Friday.
But no doubt, Anderson,
whether it's the U.S.
or Israel or Qatar,
which is leading these negotiations
along with Egypt.
They would like to see
much bigger numbers.
I mean,
we heard from the IDF earlier today
that there are
some 222 hostages who are in custody.
So we certainly don't want to see, you
know, this
these hostages coming out two by two.
The the the
Qataris are
now pushing
for much bigger numbers,
say dozens or scores of the civilians
of the foreigners
who are still in custody.
In terms of the mechanics, Anderson,
you know, obviously,
Hamas is not going to come face
to face with Israeli officials
as they hand over prisoners.
So you have the U.N.,
which operates independently inside Gaza.
You have the Red Cross, which operates
fairly independently inside Gaza.
And so what has happened today,
we understand, as like
it did on Friday,
the same mechanism of Hamas
handing these two captives
over to the Red Cross.
They will
then be taken
to somewhere along the border.
We don't know where.
There are two formal
large border crossings in southern Gaza.
One goes into Egypt,
one goes into Israel.
But frankly,
there are
there are a number of places
all along that fence line
where you are seeing today
all of those Israeli troops
where the Red Cross could
then hand those two Israeli
women over to the IDF,
as Caitlin mentioned.
They would
then likely be taken to a military base
to get checked up to make sure
that they're okay.
Hamas has claimed
that the previous release
was for humanitarian reasons.
It's not clear
what shape the run on women are in.
But we do understand
from the White House today that the U.S.
that U.S.
officials have debriefed
or are going to debrief
the two Americans
to gather intelligence,
to get a sense of where they were
held, how they were held,
and any other kind of information
that they could glean
from those two women.
But, Anderson, certainly
the bottom line here is that
everyone wants to see
a lot more hostages being released.
And that is why there is this pressure
on the Israeli government
to delay their incursion
into Gaza Anderson.
Yeah, and the international
Committee of the Red Cross has
has repeatedly requested access
to all the hostages who remain in Gaza.
They have not been allowed access.
They've also requested proof of life.
Last we heard, they had not received
any of that
from from those holding them
as long as jihad or Hamas.",20231023

tmJf7cFKxik,Israeli man sees his home for first time since Hamas killed his family,data/en_CNN\Israeli man sees his home for first time since Hamas killed his family.jpg,"Tonight, we are learning new
details about the two Israeli hostages
who were just released
in recent hours by Hamas.
Now, read
Cooper and Heaven
Leave sheets were abducted
from their kibbutz
along with their husbands
who still remain hostages tonight.
This war is being fought
not on some remote battlefield,
but in quiet communities
where families
previously grew their crops
and raise their kids.
Just yesterday, an Israeli
soldier was killed
and three others were injured
during a raid in the area of Kibbutz
Safi near the Gaza Strip.
I was there just 24 hours before.
Or you can see Gaza
from people's backyards.
About ten reporters
were taken inside this kibbutz
to see the horrific aftermath
of the October 7th attack.
I want to show you what we saw.
But I do want to warn you
that some of what you're about
to see is graphic.
Kibbutz Kaisa
Farms is
less than three miles away
from the Gaza
border,
a quiet community
where residents grow
avocados
and raise poultry and their families.
But as the sun rose on Saturday,
October 7th,
the kibbutz that around
300 people called home
became the site of a massacre
as Hamas
militants stormed inside
and murdered
14 people, kidnaping four others.
Major Marcus Sheff, a reservist
in the Israel Defense Forces,
watched from home
as the brutal attack unfolded that day.
Now he's leading a small group
of foreign press into the kibbutz
for the first time.
Wanting the world
to bear witness
to the atrocities firsthand.
You know, the shock you feel that
after two weeks we've seen the damage
and yet it's still
hard to to absorb the full whole.
The stench of death is thick in the air
as you walk along the tree lined streets.
But if you didn't look too
closely,
you'd never guess that a slaughter
took place here.
Then you notice the bullet hole and Jenas
Mia touches door.
The 90 year old grandmother
who loved gardening
was in her bathroom
when Hamas militants
shot her in the head.
Her blood is still smeared
on the entryway.
Two weeks later,
if you didn't look over here,
it just look like a regular home
on a Saturday morning.
Orange juice sells the newspaper or mail
some cookies.
When you look over here at the kitchen,
you can see people have gone through it.
They opened all the cabinets.
There's
still cups in the sink.
Her kettle is still out.
And Gina is one of several
who was brutally murdered in her kibbutz
on that Saturday morning.
The Zach family lived
just down the street.
Parents, Itai,
Eddie and their 14 year old son,
Soggy were at home when the attack began.
Their older
children, Hadar and Toma, were away.
We reach 24 year old Hadar on face time.
What's through there?
What's what was through that window?
This is the first time
he's able to see the charred
remains of his family's home.
Experts told me that he opened the moment
and found my dad
laying on the ground with my dog,
just watching the doors
so that there was one coming in
the bodies of his mother
and little brother
were found hugging each other
in the nearby bomb shelter
where they asphyxiated
after militants set their home on fire
just days before Soggy was
dancing his heart out
at a Bruno Mars concert in Tel Aviv.
Just I'm 24.
We have ten years between us.
It's hard for me to see my little brother
because it was my child.
Haidar and his sister Tomer
are now orphans.
His grief and his anger is palpable.
It's kind of absurd to me
that you guys saw me first
and is someone from Israel,
You know what I mean?
I love my niece's make.
It was just amazing for the government.
I have more of the support
just 24 hours later
in the Kissa film area.
An IDF soldier is killed
and three others wounded
during a raid ahead of Israel's
expected ground invasion in Gaza.
An ominous warning shot
of what is yet to come.
It's difficult to watch.
And I do want to note
that we got permission
from these families
to go into their homes,
something that
that felt invasive to be there
but was so important to them
and to her daughter to be able
to see his house for the first time.
I want to express our gratitude for them,
for letting us in, to see their pain
and to tell their stories
as well as to Major Marcus Scheff
for taking us inside that kibbutz.",20231024

SON ON MY PHONE.
IT HAD BEEN SHOWN TO ME BY A
SOLDIER AT THE MUSIC FESTIVAL.
WE RECORDED OF HIS PHONE, WE
HAVE PERMISSION FROM HIM TO DO.
SO IT HAD NEVER BEEN RELEASED

PULLING HIMSELF WITH HIS ONE
WEEK HAN, HE'S A LEFTY, AND HIS
LEFT ARM WAS BLOWN, OF PULLING
HIMSELF IT IS ONE-WEEK HAND
ONTO THE TRUCK, GAVE ME A REAL
GHOST OF HIS STRENGTHS THAT HE
IS HANDLING A HORRIBLE
SITUATION, AND HE IS DOING IT
WOULD COMPOSURE.
&gt;&gt; WE'RE SAYING HE WALKED OUT
CALMLY, WHICH HE DID, BUT I
THINK IT WAS FROM SHOCK.

INSIDE THE SHELTER BEFORE HAMAS

INSIDE.
RACHEL SAYS, AS MANY AS 29
PEOPLE WERE CRAMMED TOGETHER.
THAT IS HERSH, AND THIS IS HIS
FRIEND.
&gt;&gt; HURST AND HIS FRIEND WENT TO
THE FESTIVAL TOGETHER.
THEY'VE KNOWN TO THE SINCE THEY
WERE KIDS.
HONOR WAS BEHIND THE DOOR, AND
BY ANYONE'S ACCOUNT WHICH WE
SPOKE TO, AS THEY WERE THROWING
GRENADES, HE WOULD KEEP PICKING
THEM UP AND THROWING THEM OUT,
PICKING THEM UP THROWING THEM
OUT.
ALL THESE WITNESSES SAID THERE
WERE 11 GRENADES THROWN IN.
HE THREW OUT EIGHT.
&gt;&gt; RACHEL SAYS EIGHT PEOPLE
SURVIVED AND DEVOTED CAPTURED
BY HIDING BENEATH THE BODIES OF
THE DEAD.
HIS FRIENDS ARE TO MAKE IT OUT
ALIVE.
&gt;&gt; HIS PARENTS CAME TO HER
HOUSE ON FRIDAY, AND THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE IDENTIFYING BODIES
ACTUALLY LET THEM KNOW THAT THE
IDENTIFIED HIM WITH DNA, BUT IN
HIS HAND HE WAS HOLDING A
GRENADE.
HIS DEAD BODY HAD A GRENADE IN
IT IN HIS HAND.
THIS MEANS HE IS THE REAL
HEROES.
THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE, AND EVEN
THE PEOPLE WHO WALKED OUT AND
ARE NOW IN GAZA, IT IS BECAUSE
OF HONOR.
&gt;&gt; HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO GET
THROUGH EACH DAY?
&gt;&gt; I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE WE
HAVE TO KEEP RUNNING TO THE END
OF THE EARTH TO SAVE HIM.
WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING AND
BELIEVING THAT SOMEHOW HE GOT
TREATMENT, AND HE IS THERE, AND
HE IS IN PAIN, AND SUFFERING,
BUT HE'S ALIVE AND THERE.
THERE ARE ALSO THE MOMENTS IN
THIS UNIVERSE THAT WE NOW LIVE,
WHERE YOU SAY, MAYBE HE DIED ON
THE TRUCK.
MAYBE HE BLOOD OUT IN THE
TRUCK.
MAYBE HE DIED YESTERDAY.
MAYBE HE DIED FIVE MINUTES AGO.
THERE ARE THOSE MOMENTS WHERE
YOU THINK, HOW ARE THESE
THOUGHTS EVEN, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND THESE THOUGHTS.
THEY ARE REAL THOUGHTS.
&gt;&gt; THEY OFTEN GO DOWN TO SEE
THEIR SONS ROOM.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS HERSH
GOLDBERG-POLIN'S ROOM?
&gt;&gt; IT'S A STEEL DOOR BECAUSE
IT'S OUR BOMB SHELTER AS WELL.
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN FEEL HIM HERE CLOSE,
HIS GLOBE, HIS BOOKS, AND
MOMENTOUS, IT'S ALL JUST AS HE
LEFT THEM.
RACHEL DID MAKE HIS BED HOWEVER,
SHE WANTS IT READY FOR WHEN HE
RETURNS.
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE A PORCH THAT'S
FACING SOUTH, AND THEY WENT OUT
FRIDAY NIGHT.
I WAS SCREAMING TO HIM.
HOPING.
FRIDAY NIGHT WE BLESS OUR
CHILDREN TRADITIONALLY, AND
JEWISH HOMES YOU BLESS YOUR
CHILDREN ON FRIDAY NIGHT.
SO, I WAS SCREAMING.
IT'S A TRADITIONAL BLESSING
FROM THE BIBLE.
I WAS SCREAMING THE BLESSING TO
HIM.
MY HANDS OUT.
I USUALLY PUT MY HANDS ON HIS
HEAD WHEN HE'S HOME.
&gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THE BLESSING SAY?
&gt;&gt; IT SAYS, MAY GOD BLESS YOU
AND MAY HIS FACE SHINE UPON YOU
AND BE GRACIOUS TO YOU.
MAY GOD'S COUNTENANCE BE LIFTED
UP TOWARDS YOU AND GIVE YOU
PEACE.
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU WANT PEOPLE TO
KNOW ABOUT HERSH?
&gt;&gt; HE'S A SUPER CURIOUS KID,
AND THIS WANDERLUST HE
DEVELOPED WHEN HE WAS SIX OR
SEVEN YEARS OLD HAS BEEN HIS
LIFE, OBSESSION ALWAYS ASKING
FOR MAPS AND GLOBES AND ATLAS
IS FOR HIS BAR MITZVAH.
THESE LAST FEW YEARS HE'S
REALLY SAVED EVERY PENNY TO GO
ON THIS TRIP THAT HE HAS A
TICKET FOR ON DECEMBER 27TH.
HE WAS GOING TO GO TO INDIA,
AND THEY'LL ALL POINTS.
EAST &gt;&gt; RACHEL AND JOHN WERE ON
THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE.
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE WORLD
TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE PLAY OF
THE HOSTAGES, PARTICULARLY
THOSE LIKE HER TO HAVE SERIOUS
WOUNDS OR MEDICAL ISSUES.
&gt;&gt; AS AMERICANS ISRAELIS, WE
HAVE BEEN EMBRACED BY THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT.
THE SUPPORT IS THERE.
THE EMPATHY IS THERE FROM THE
U.S..
WE ARE OBVIOUSLY HUNGRY FOR
MORE THAN THAT.
WE WANT ACTION.
WE WANT RESULTS.
THERE ARE HOSTAGES FROM
SOMEWHERE AROUND 30 COUNTRIES,
WHY HAVE WE NOT YET SEEN PRIME
MINISTERS, FOREIGN MINISTERS,
GLOBAL LEADERS SCREAMING TO GET
THE WOUNDED HELP?
&gt;&gt; RACHEL ALSO GOT TO BE IN A
POOL WITH OTHER AMERICAN
FAMILIES AND PRESIDENT BIDEN.
&gt;&gt; HE STAYED FOR 90 MINUTES AND
LISTEN TO US, AND CRIED WITH
US.
&gt;&gt; I KNOW LOSS, I HAVE LOST TWO
CHILDREN, I LOST MY WIFE, AND
I'M TELLING YOU THAT YOU NEED
TO GO THROUGH THIS, BUT YOU
ALSO NEED TO REMEMBER THAT YOU
WILL BE STRONG AGAIN FOR YOUR
FAMILY.
HE SAID THINGS THAT BECAUSE HE
KNOWS LAWS, SO IT WASN'T
PLATITUDES, IT WAS SOMEONE
SPEAKING WHO HAS LOST CHILDREN,
SPEAKING TO A MOTHER WHO LOST
HER TWO CHILDREN.
IT'S WAS REAL MOMENT OF COMING
TOGETHER JUST AS PEOPLE WHO
KNOW WHAT'S PAIN IS.
THIS VERY EXCRUCIATING PARTS OF
PAIN.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A PARTICULAR KIND OF
PAIN.
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.
THERE IS NO PLAYBOOK FOR THIS
THAT WE KNOW OF.
THE GAME DAILY IS HE ALIVE?
IS HE GETTING TREATMENT?
DID HE DIE 15 DAYS AGO?
WE ARE ON THE HEAD OF A PEN,
AND EVERY DIRECTION YOU FALL IS
A BAD DIRECTION.
SO, A LOT OF HOW WE GET THROUGH
THE DAY WHEN YOU ASKED THAT
REPORT IS WE'RE TRYING TO
BALANCE ON THE HEAD OF THE PIN
AND JUST GET EVERYTHING DONE
WITH THE HOPE THAT HE WILL COME
HOME TO US ALIVE, AND HE'LL GO
ON THAT TRIP WITH ONE HAND.

WITH ME NOW IS VETERAN CHIEF OF
JERUSALEM POST.
THE SITUATION WITH THE HOSTAGES
IS SO HORRIFIC AND SICKENING.
DO YOU HEAR, WHEN YOU TALK TO
PEOPLE DO WHAT DO THEY TALK
ABOUT FIRST, WHAT DO YOU HEAR
FROM PEOPLE?
I THINK THE RALLIES ARE IN A
STATE OF SHOCK AND TRAUMA.
THEY'RE ALSO IN THIS WAITING
GAME, NOT KNOWING WHETHER THIS
GROUND OFFENSIVE IS GOING TO
HAPPEN OR NOT.
THERE ARE 360,000 PEOPLE WHO
ARE MASKED ON THE BORDER, AND
THAT AFFECTS FAMILIES ACROSS
THE COUNTRY.
PEOPLE, SIBLING, SPOUSES,
PARENTS IN SOME CASES.
SO, I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE
MOST OF.
THE HOSPITALITY WAGING IS VERY
MUCH ON PEOPLES MINDS.
THAT HAS BEEN VERY MUCH THE
CONVERSATION THIS TIME.
&gt;&gt; HAMAS COULD RELEASE ALL
THEIR HOSTAGES RIGHT AWAY.
THE GAME THEY ARE PLAYING OF
RELEASING TWO BY TWO IS VERY
CLEAR THAT THERE IS A TACTIC
THERE AND THE STRATEGY THERE,
THE MANIPULATION OF IT.
IT IS INCREDIBLE TO ME THAT
WOUNDED HOSTAGES, AND FANS,
TODDLERS, PEOPLE WITH SEVERE
MEDICAL CONDITIONS ARE STILL
BEING HELD.
&gt;&gt; IT'S SHOCKING.
THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE
ANYTHING WE'VE ENCOUNTERED OVER
THE PAST TWO WEEKS.
I DON'T KNOW THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE HAS THE VOCABULARY TO
ENABLE US TO DESCRIBE WHAT
WE'RE GOING THROUGH.

IF I'M POPPY HARLOW WITH PHIL
HARDING.
WE ARE LIVE IN TEL AVIV WHERE A
HOSTAGE RELEASED BY HAMAS
YESTERDAY IS NOW SPEAKING.
SHE'S TELLING HER STORY.
THIS MORNING, AT THE HOSPITAL,
85-YEAR-OLD YOCHEVED LIFSHITZ
TOLD REPORTERS HOW SHE WAS
ABDUCTED AND HELD CAPTIVE
UNDERGROUND FOR WEEKS.
&gt;&gt; THE GRANDMOTHER SAYS FOUR OF
HAMAS FIGHTERS STORMED HER
KIBBUTZ DURING THE MASSACRE AND
TOOK HER WAY ON A MOTORBIKE AND
BEAT HER WITH SIX.
SHE SAYS THEY TOOK RENT HAMAS'S
UNDERGROUND TUNNEL NETWORK AND
HELD HER WITH FOUR OTHER
HOSTAGES.
THEY HAD GUARDS, A DOCTOR, AND
A PARAMEDIC WHO TOOK CARE OF
THEM, GAVE THE MEDICINE.
SHE SAYS HAMAS HAD A STOCKPILE
OF SHAMPOO AND OTHER TOILETRIES
FOR HOSTAGES TO USE.
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE HUGE NETWORK OF
TUNNELS UNDERNEATH.
IT LOOKS LIKE A SPIDER WEB.
WHEN SHE FIRST ARRIVED, THEY
TOLD HIM THAT THERE ARE MUSLIMS,
AND THEY ARE NOT GONNA HURT
THEM.
AND THAT THEY ATE THE SAME FOOD
THAT THE HAMAS WAS EATING.
&gt;&gt; HAMAS HAS NOW RELEASED FOUR
HOSTAGES AS ISRAELI TROOPS GEAR
UP TO LAUNCH AN ASSAULT THEY
SAY ON GAZA BY GROUND, SEE, AND
AIR.
ISRAELI MILITARY SIT STRUCK
MORE THAN 400 TARGETS ACROSS
GAZA IN THE PAST DAY, KILLING
HAMAS COMMANDERS AND FIGHTERS.
THIS AS MORE THAN 200 HOSTAGES
ARE STILL BELIEVED TO BE HELD
BY HAMAS INSIDE GAZA, AND WE'VE
LEARNED THAT INCLUDES 30
CHILDREN.
LET'S GO TO ERIN BURNETT.
SHE JOINS US LIVE IN THIS HOUR
IN TEL AVIV.
AARON, HEARING FROM HER, ALL OF
THOSE DETAILS, INCLUDING, BY
THE WAY SOME CRITICISM OF THE
IDF AND LACK OF PREPAREDNESS,
WAS REMARKABLE THIS MORNING.
&gt;&gt; IT WAS REMARKABLE.
SHE DIDN'T HAVE CRITICISM FOR
THE IDF, YOU KNOW HOW THEY
OBVIOUSLY WERE NOT THERE.
YOU KNOW, ALSO, POPPY,
SOMETHING STOOD OUT IN THE
MUNDANE NECESSITY.
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TUNNELS.
WE KNOW THESE TUNNELS HAVE
VENTILATION.
WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN KNOWN TO
HAVE AIR CONDITIONING.
THIS IS ALL BEEN REPORTING THAT
WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ISRAELIS
OVER THE YEARS.
BUT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE
SAYING SHE WAS HELD UNDERGROUND
FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS, THAT
THERE WAS SHAMPOO, THERE WAS
ANTIBIOTICS, THERE WAS A GUARD
PER HOSTAGE IN THE EXPERIENCE
SHE HAD.
THAT THERE WERE MEDICS AND
PARAMEDICS AND OBVIOUSLY SHE IS
ELDERLY.
THE OTHER WOMAN WHO WAS
RELEASED ALSO ELDERLY AND HAD
MEDICAL NEEDS, AND THEN THEY
HAD THE MEDICINE NEEDED, AND IF,
NOT SOMETHING SIMILAR TO
REPLACE IT.
IT IS PRETTY STUNNING.
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO CONTRAST
THAT WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING
ABOVE THE GROUND, RIGHT, WHERE
THERE IS NOT WATER, NEVER MIND
SHAMPOO.
THEY DON'T HAVE WATER, THEY ARE
USING TOILET WATER.
THERE IS NO MORPHINE FOR ANY
KIND OF AMPUTATIONS,
ANTIBIOTICS, NO.
BUT HAMAS HAD STOCKPILED ALL OF
THAT AND HAS ALL OF THE
UNDERGROUND.
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE LEARNING
FROM HER.
&gt;&gt; SO THAT, POINT ERIN, WE WANT
TO PLAY THIS OUT FOR ON THIS.
BECAUSE IT GETS AT JUST HOW
PREPARED THEY WERE FOR TAKING
HOSTAGES, INCLUDING AT THE
SCALE THAT THEY TOOK.
THEM TAKE A LISTEN.
&gt;&gt; THEY LOOKED VERY WELL
PREPARED.
THEY PREPARED IT FOR A LONG
PERIOD OF TIME.
ALL OF THE NEEDS FOR WOMEN
NEED.
SHAMPOO, CONDITIONER.
ME &gt;&gt; DID THAT SURPRISE YOU?
I KNOW EVERYONE WAS SURPRISED
BY THE SCALE OF THE ACTUAL
TERROR ATTACK ITSELF.
BUT THE PREPARATIONS FOR
HOSTAGE TAKING ALSO SEEMED TO
BE A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF THE
PLAN.
&gt;&gt; YES.
WHEN THEY SAY PREPARED FOR
WOMEN'S NEEDS, THEY WERE THERE
FOR PREPARED, I MEAN, LET'S
JUST GO AHEAD.
I THINK WE'RE BEING HONEST
ABOUT.
IT MEANS THEY HAD TAMPONS AND
THINGS.
THAT IS A LEVEL OF PREPARATION
FOR WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO.
AND IT SHOWS THAT THEY WERE
GOING TO TAKE PEOPLE OF ALL
DIFFERENT AGES.
IT SHOWS A PREPARATION FOR
THAT.
AND WE SAW THAT IN THE PLANS
THAT WE'VE SEEN IT TAKEN FROM
THE BODIES OF HAMAS MILITANTS
WHO WERE KILLED IN THE
TERRORIST ATTACK.
YOU KNOW, THAT IT LAYS OUT WHAT
THEY WERE GOING TO DO IN EVERY
SINGLE KIBBUTZ, AND THEY ALSO
LAID OUT VERY EXPLICITLY THE
ONES THAT I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO
READ WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO
WITH HOSTAGES.
TAKE AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.
HERE IS THE COMMUNAL EATING
AREA IN THIS CABOOSES, WHERE
THEY GO, THIS IS HOW YOU GET
THERE, HERE IS THE MAP.
IT IS CIRCLED.
TAKE THE HOSTAGES TH
SO THAT WAS VERY MUCH A PART OF
THE PRINTED PLAN.
AND I SEE THE OTHER END OF IT.
THE LEVEL OF PREPARATION THAT
WENT INTO IT.
AGAIN, IN THE MUNDANE REALITY
OF HAVING FEMININE HYGIENE
PRODUCTS.
SHAMPOO, ANTIBIOTICS.
IT IS THOSE VERY SPECIFICS THAT
I THINK THAT ARE MOST STRIKING.
&gt;&gt; FOR SURE, AND ERIN, I ALSO
WONDER ABOUT IF WE WILL LEARN
FROM HER OR SOME OF THE OTHER
HOSTAGES RELEASED HOW MUCH THEY
HAD, WHICH WOULD INDICATE HOW
LONG THEY HAD BEEN PLANNING, OR
HAD BEEN PLANNING TO HOLD THE
HOSTAGES.
SO WE'LL SEE.
I ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS STRIKING
THAT HER DAUGHTER, SHARON,
SPOKE AT THAT NEWS CONFERENCE
AS WELL.
AND THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT
HER DAD, WHO OF COURSE, IS YOU
VETS HUSBAND.
LISTEN TO THIS.
&gt;&gt; MY MOM AND MY DAD WERE
SEPARATED AT THE VERY
BEGINNING.
&gt;&gt; WE DO NOT KNOW, FROM MY
MOM'S STORY, WHAT HAPPENED TO
MY DAD.
WE DO KNOW THAT HE WAS INJURED.
&gt;&gt; INJURED, AND VERY LIKELY
COULD STILL BE BEING HELD.
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.
THEY WERE HELD IN SEPARATE
PLACES.
SO AS MUCH AS HAMAS AGAIN
GIVING THIS IMAGE OF HUMANE
TREATMENT TO HOSTAGES, YOU MUST
REMEMBER AGAIN THAT THEY WERE
HOSTAGES.
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
PEOPLE WHO DID NOT GET TO
BECOME HOSTAGES.
DEPLORABLE, INHUMAN METHOD OF
THEIR BRUTAL MASSACRE AND
SLAUGHTER.
BUT THEN, WHEN THEY DO TAKE
PEOPLE HOSTAGE, THEY WOULD
SEPARATE.
SO A HUSBAND AND WIFE NOT BEING
TOGETHER, SHE DOES NOT KNOW
WHERE HE IS.
AND THAT OF COURSE IS THE
OBVIOUS RAISED POINT.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE
BEING HELD, AND ARE THERE ANY
BEING HELD IN LARGER GROUPS.
WE KNOW HAMAS HAS SAID THAT
SOME OF THE HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN
KILLED IN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'VE BEEN
KILLED, WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY
WERE KILLED BY ISRAELI
AIRSTRIKES OR ANYTHING ELSE.
BUT ALL WE KNOW AT THIS POINT
IS WHAT HAMAS HAS SAID.
THEY'VE INDICATED 22 OF THEM
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN STRIKES.
WE JUST DON'T KNOW IF IT IS
TRUE.
THE ISRAELI FORCE IS PREPARING
FOR THE GAZA GROUNDED PATIENT
GETTING COUNCIL FROM AN
AMERICAN MILITARY LATER IN THE
ISRAEL MARINE CORPS LIEUTENANT
JAMES GLIM WAS HEAD OF THE
MARINE FORCES SPECIAL
OPERATIONS COMMAND, AND IT IS
UNCLEAR THOUGH, WHILE OF COURSE
HE HAS THE EXPERIENCE AND THE
RESUME FOR SUCH A SITUATION, IT
IS UNCLEAR WHAT HIS SPECIFIC
ROLE IS HERE.
BUT UNOFFICIAL DOES SAY GENERAL
GLYNN HAS DECADES OF EXPERIENCE
AND CAN ASK, WHAT THEY SAY, ARE
THE HARD QUESTIONS, AS UNITED
STATES DOES NOT HAVE A CLEAR
SENSE OF ISRAEL'S INTENTIONS IN
GAZA.
THEY SAID THEY ARE GOING TO GET
RID OF HAMAS AND ALL RESPECTS.
BUT BEYOND, THAT WHAT THAT
ACTUALLY MEANS, THEY HAVE NOT
PROVIDED ANY SPECIFICS.
CNN'S NIC ROBERTSON IS IN
SDEROT, ISRAEL, WHERE HE HAS
BEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF
THIS WAR.
AND AS WE HAVE BEEN IN THE
MIDST OF WHAT IS NOW 17 DAYS
INTO A WAR, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING
IN TERMS OF MILITARY MOVEMENT
THIS MORNING, AND THE CONTEXT
OF WHAT?
MORE THAN 300 STRIKES THAT
ISRAEL IS SAYING THEY CONDUCTED
IN THE PAST 24 HOURS IN GAZA.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.
JUST GO BACK TO WHAT YOU ARE
SEEING THERE ABOUT THE FORMER
MARINE GENERAL.
I THINK THE ONLY PIECE OF
CONTEXT HERE, OF COURSE, IS THE
FACT THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS
SOME MARINE EXPEDITIONARY UNIT
OF 2000 WHO HAVE BEEN ON
READINESS AND STANDBY TO COME
IN AND GIVE LOGISTIC SUPPORT
ANOTHER UNSPECIFIED SUPPORT TO
THE ISRAELI MILITARY.
AT A TIME WHEN THERE ARE
AMERICAN HOSTAGES BEING HELD BY
HAMAS INSIDE GAZA.
SO IT SEEMS, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH GENERAL
TO COME AND GIVE WHAT SORT OF
ADVICE, YOU ARE ALSO PICKING
ONE WHO WOUL VERY FAMILIAR
WITH THE SORT OF EXPERTISE,
READINESS, OF WHAT THESE
MARINES WHO ARE SITTING JUST
OFF SHORE HAVE AT THEIR
DISPOSAL.
IT SPEAKS TO ME AS A NATION AS
WELL.
OF COURSE, THAT IS NOT WHAT WE
ARE BEING TOLD, BUT WHEN IT
COMES TO THE READINESS, WE
HEARD FROM A PRIME MINISTER
TODAY, PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU
WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING WITH THE
FRENCH PRESIDENT, EMMANUEL
MACRON, WHO HAS GIVEN HIS
SUPPORT TO ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO
STRIKE BACK AT HAMAS.
THE PRIME MINISTER SAID IT
COULD BE A LONG WAR.
I'M STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT HE
SAID IT COULD BE, BECAUSE UNTIL
NOW, HE'S BEEN VERY, VERY
CLEAR.
SAYING HE WILL GO AFTER THEM,
AND WE WILL GET THE JOB DONE.
WE WILL COMPLETELY GET RID OF
HAMAS.
BUT I THINK THIS IS ALSO
INDICATIVE OF THE FACT THAT
THERE IS NO STEPPING BACK FROM
THE POSSIBILITY OF A GROUND
INCURSION.
WE ARE NOT SEEING ANYTHING ON
THE GROUND AT THE MOMENT THAT
WOULD INDICATE THAT.
WE ARE STILL HEARING HEAVY
DETONATIONS COMING FROM WITHIN
GAZA, WE'VE HEARD MILITARY
HELICOPTERS IN THE AREA THIS
MORNING.
SO WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE
ISRAELI DEFENSE CHIEF YESTERDAY,
AND GENERAL STAFF, KIND OF
GENERAL STAFF SAYING THAT THEY
ARE READY.
THAT TROOPS ARE READY, THAT
THEY ARE GETTING ADDNAL
TRAINING.
BUT I THINK THE POSTURE IS SET
FOR WHEN THE COMMAND COMES.
THAT THE TROOPS ARE READY FOR
THAT INCURSION, VERY CLEAR THAT
THEY ARE BEING PAUSED.
VERY CLEAR THAT THAT HAS TO DO
WITH HUMANITARIAN AID, HAS TO
DO WITH HOSTAGES, NEEDS THAT.
BUT THE FORCES, THEY'RE READY
TO GO.
I DON'T SEE ANYONE PULLING IT
BACK AT THAT MOMENT, ERIN.
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, NICK ROBERTSON,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ALONG WITH THE GAZA BORDER AND
SDROT, I WANT TO GO NOW TO THE
IDF SPOKESPERSON, LIEUTENANT
COLONEL PETER LERNER.
LIEUTENANT, I APPRECIATE YOUR
TIME.
I'M GLAD TO SPEAK TO YOU THIS
MORNING.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU FIRST CHANCE
TO RESPOND TO WHAT WE WERE
SAYING WAS ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT STOOD UP AS THESE HOSTAGE
HAVE SPOKEN OUT.
THAT HAMAS WAS PREPARED FOR
THIS, FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS,
SHAMPOO, ANTIBIOTICS, AND
PARAMEDICS, MEDICAL CARE,
EATING THE SAME FOOD AS THE
HOSTAGES EIGHT.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?
&gt;&gt; WELL, CLEARLY, ERIN.
THEY WERE PREPARED FOR THE
ATTACK.
WE SEE JUST THE MAGNITUDE OF
THEIR ATTACKS.
THEY HAD A VERY CLEAR PLAN OF
ACTION, SO IT SHOULD NOT BE ANY
SURPRISE TO US THAT THIS IS
WHAT THEY HAD UNDERGROUND AS
THEY ABDUCTED OVER 200 PEOPLE
INTO GAZA.
I REMIND YOU, THEY DID A
COORDINATED ATTACK WITH MORE
THAN 20 POINTS OF BREACH,
OVERGROUND, AT GROUND, AND
ETSY.
THEY PENETRATED SOME 30
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES ACROSS
THE SOUTHERN PART OF ISRAEL.
AND MURDERED AND OVER 1400
PEOPLE.
SO WHY SHOULD WE BE SURPRISED?",20231024

nz7pS3Hwle8,Sources: Hamas used landlines to avoid detection and plan attack,data/en_CNN\Sources Hamas used landlines to avoid detection and plan attack.jpg,"One big question since
October 7th is, is how how did H
carry out
such a successful, sophisticated
if you can call it that,
terrorist attack while
keeping it all so secret?
And today, we're learning
that old school technology
may have played a major role.
CNN's chief investigative corres
Pamela Brown, joins us now from
Pamela, what does the intelligen
Well, Jake,
sources are telling me and my co
at Cohen that a small group of H
operatives used hard
wired phones in the tunnels
beneath Gaza
to communicate
over a period of two years.
That's according to intelligence
with U.S.
officials Now, those old fashion
landlines allowed Hamas leaders
to communicate underground with
another in secret.
They avoided using computers
or cell phones
in order to keep from being trac
by Israeli or U.S. intelligence.
According to these sources, and
it worked, Jake.
Instead, they held meetings in p
among a small group
and they stayed off
all digital communications.
So this partially explains
why Israel and the U.S.
were caught
so off guard by the attack
and how 1000 Hamas fighters
were able to pour across the bor
without being stopped shown here
And this propaganda video
released by Hamas.
Now, all of this communication h
in the miles of underground
a tunnel system beneath Gaza
that the IDF nicknamed the Gaza
You heard the hostage
there in the story
you just played, Jake,
talking about the spiderweb of t
That's where
apparently these phone lines
were hard wired underground.
And another way
Hamas was able
to keep this under the radar
is that they kept the planning
of the October 7th attack
a secret even from other members
Only a very small group
knew about this mission
until just before it was carried
Hamas ground unit commanders and
were in training for many months
and they were kept
in a state of general preparedne
I'm told,
but only found out
about the specific plans
just a few days
before the terrorist attack.
And one of the sources said
some of their
training above ground was observ
by Israeli officials,
but did not ring major alarm bel
The thinking
was, I'm told, was, oh, Hamas
always tradespeople like this.
It didn't look different.
But of course, we know now, Jake
and Pamela, Israel
actually found these hard wired
phones in Hamas
strongholds in the past, though,
Yeah, that's right.
Israeli military found a similar
of communication system
when they raided a city
in the northern West
Bank over the summer,
according to an Israeli official
They called this
a joint operational command cent
and it had hard wired communicat
and closed
circuit surveillance cameras
to give advance
warning of Israeli troop movemen
So clearly,
this is something that has been
in their playbook, Hamas
has had in their playbook,
and they used it
to execute this operation,
as you pointed out, successfully
All right.
Pamela Brown, thank you so much.
I want to bring in Mark
Regev with me here in Tel Aviv.
He is the senior adviser
to Israel's Prime
Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,

to the United Kingdom.
Thank you so much for being here

If Shin Bet,
the Israeli

if it knows so much about Hamas,
why wouldn't

There are all sorts of issues
that need to be investigated.

Hamas won't let them out.

keeping them hostage.

SEES IT THROUGH THE STRIKES.

HAS BEEN REPORTING ON AND BECKY
ANDERSON AS WELL.
WHICH IS SOURCES SAYING THERE
WERE SIGNIFICANT DISCUSSIONS
ABOUT HOSTAGES.
MORE THAN 200 HOSTAGES BEING
HELD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
BORDER FROM WHERE YOU ARE, AND
THE QUESTION THAT YOU POSED, AS
YOU'RE SEEING THE INCREASE IN
ACTION RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES,
HOW THAT COULD IMPACT THE
ABILITY TO GET THE HOSTAGES OUT
AND WHETHER THERE'S ANY
CONNECTION AT THIS POINT.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE DIPLOMACY
AROUND THE TABLE IS IN ESSENCE
HOSTAGES FOR HUMANITARIAN AID.
A HUMANITARIAN PAUSE OR HAMAS
HAS SDD FOR A FIFTH-DAY
CEASE-FIRE.
THEY ARE NOT ABOUT TO HAVE A
CEASE-FIRE.
THERE'S BEEN INCREASING PRESSURE

DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.

I'M ASSUMING YOU COULD HEAR IT,
WAS THE SORT OF THING WE HAVE
JUST BEEN HEARING REPEATED,
REPEATED, REPEATED OVER THE PAST
FEW HOURS.
THAT SEEMS TO HAVE A MISSILE
FROM A FIGHT JET.
BUT THE IDEA THAT HAMAS WAS
TALKING ABOUT A CEASE-FIRE, THE
IDEA THAT THE HOSTAGE RELEASE
COULD COME AS PART OF A DEAL
WHERE THERE COB A THIS IS ALL
DIPLOMACY, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER
PART OF THE EQUATION AND THAT'S
THE MILITARY PART.
BOTH SIDES GO TOE TO TOE, MAKE
THEIR DEMANDS, WAIT FOR THE
OTHER SIDE TO TAKE CONCESSION
ISES.
THESE ARE CONCESSIONS, AS WE
SAY, OVER FUEL INTO GAZA OR
HUMANITARIAN AID.
BUT THERE ARE ALSO THE TWO SIDES
ARE GOING TOE TO TOE IN MILITARY
TERMS WAITING FOR THE OTHERS TO
BACK DOWN.
IT WAS ONLY A FEW HOURS THEY
WERE FIRING ROCKETS INTO TEL
AVIV THAT HIT AN APARTMENT
THERE.
THE IDF CLEARLY STEPPING UP ITS
ACTION IN THIS PART OF GAZA
TONIGHT.
SO THESE ARE ALL WAYS OF
PRESSURING THE OTHER SIDE AND
WHERE THE TALKS NOW STAND, AS
THERE IS NOT A CLEAR PAUSE IN
THE MILITARY OFFENSE.

&gt;&gt; JUST LIKE NIC, WE HEARD
EARLIER IN THE DAY THERE WAS
PERHAPS SOME PROGRESS IN THE
HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS, BUT NOW
WHAT WE ARE HEARING ARE THE
SOUNDS OF WAR.
THE MOST INTENSE BOMBING AT
LEAST IN TERMS OF WHAT I CAN
HEAR FROM MY POSITION HERE IN
ASHKELON THAT I HAVE HEARD IN
THE THREE WEEKS I HAVE BEEN HERE
COVERING THIS WAR.
WE ARE HEARING INTENSE AND
REPETITIVE THUDS, BOMBING,
ARTILLERY, ALSO CLEARLY GOING
OUT.
WHAT WE'RE ALSO SEEING IS HAMAS
RESPONDING WITH AT LEAST TWO
ROCKET BARGES TOWARDS SEVERAL
ISRAEL AND HERE TOWARDS
ASHKELON.
SO THIS IS CERTAINLY TAKING ON A
DIFFERENT TONE AND TENOR FROM
HERE.
IT'S HEART TO SAY IF THIS IS THE
FINNING OF THAT INVASION, THAT
THEY HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT WILL
BE HAPPENING AT SOME POINT.
WE KNOW THAT IN RECENT DAYS,
ISRAELI OFFICIALS HAD CLEARLY
TOLD AMERICANS THEY WERE WILLING
TO GIVE THEM A FEW DAY OS TO SEE
HOW THESE HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS
DEVELOPED.
WHILE WE DON'T KNOW OFFICIAL WLI
WHETHER THOSE TALKS HAVE
COMPLETELY COLLAPSED, WHAT IS
CLEAR IS THAT ISRAELI OFFICIALS
WERE NOT GOING TO WAIT
INDEFINITELY IN ORDER TO MOVE
FORWARD WITH THEIR GROUND
CAMPAIGN.
AGAIN, WE ADOPT KNOW WHETHER
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO
SEE ON THE GROUND.
WE'RE SEEING AN INTENSIFICATION
OF A STRIKE ON GAZA.
THERE'S ALSO REPORTS OF
TELECOMMUNICATIONS BEING OUT.
IN ADDITION, WE KNOW IN RECENT
DAYS, WE HAVE SEEN A STEPPED UP
PACE.
NOT ONLY OF THE AIRSTRIKES, NOT
ONLY OF THE TARGETING OF THE
ITEMS, BUT ALSO INCREASING RAIDS
INSIDE OF GAZA.
THERE'S BEEN TANKS GOING INTO
GAZA TO CARRY OUT TARGETED
RAIDS, TO TAKE OUT ONLY SOFT THE
TUNNELS AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE.
WHAT WE ALSO AWE LAST NIGHT WAS
THE FLO TILL LA 13 GOING INTO
SOUTHERN GAZA AND CARRYING OUT A
RAID THERE AS WELL.
ALL OF THAT IN THE LEAD UP TO
WHAT WE ARE NOW HEARING, WHICH
AGAIN IS A VERY SERIOUS
INTENSIFICATION OF AIRSTRIKES,
MUCH LOUDER BOMBING THAN WE HAVE
HEARD PERHAPS IN THESE NEARLY
THREE WEEKS OF THIS WAR.
&gt;&gt; JEREMY, THANK YOU.
STANDBY.
YOU WANT TO BRING IN GENERAL
MHURTLING, WHO WAS THE COMMANDIG
GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES
ARMY EUROPE AND THE 7th ARMY
GENERAL.
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING WHEN YOU
HEAR OUR REPORTERS
&gt;&gt; WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE
REPORTING IS EXCELLENT FROM
NORTHERN GAZA.
I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN THE SOUTH.
JEREMY TALKED ABOUT WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN THE SOUTHERN
EXTREME WITH THE ISRAELI NAVY
BUT ALSO IN KHAN YUNIS.
ARE THERE THE SAME KIND OF
EXPLOSIONS GOING ON IN THOSE
AREAS?
I THINK THE ISRAELI DEFENSE
FORCES ARE GOING TO HIT ALL
SECTORS OF GAZA.
JEREMY POINTED OUT OVER THE LAST
SEVERAL DAYS AN INCREASE IN AIR
STRIKES AND INCREASE IN
INTELLIGENCE PROBES BY GROUND
FORCES WHICH WENT INTO GAZA AND
THEN CAME OUT, WHICH TELLS ME
THEY WERE SEEKING MORE
INTELLIGENCE, MORE TARGETING
DATA, FOR A FINAL PUSH.
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING PRIMARILY, I
BELIEVE, FROM THE AIR FORCE AND
PERHAPS EVEN ARTILLERY FIRE FROM
OUTSIDE OF GAZA, IS A
PREPARATORY STANCE BY ISRAEL.
THEY ARE CONDUCTING FINAL PREP
FIRES, PUTTING A LOT OF FORCES
IN IT, AND REMEMBER, THESE
WEAPONS DON'T JUST KILL.
WHAT THEY'RE BOMBING GAZA WITH
AND HITTING THEM WITH ARTILLERY,
IT'S ALSO PSYCHOLOGICAL.
WHEN YOU'RE UNDER THAT KIND OF
FIRE AS A TERRORIST OPERATION,
YOU KNOW SOMETHING BIG IS
HAPPENING.
AND THEY'VE BEEN UNDER THESE
KIND OF BOMBS FOR THE LAST 20
DAYS.
AT THE SAME TIME AS NIC RIGHTLY
POINTED OUT, THE ISRAELI DEFENSE
FORCES HAVE BEEN MOBILIZED
ALMOST 20 DAYS NOW.
YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP A LARGE
FORCE OF 300,000 WAITING IN A
FIELD FOR THAT LONG.
THEY TEND TO START LOSING THEIR
EDGE.
AND THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT, THE
ONE MR. NETANYAHU WHO IS GOING
TO PULL THE TRIGGER AND START
THE OPERATION, AND ALL
INDICATORS ARE HE'S BEEN HOLD
BACK BECAUSE OF THE DIVISIONS
WITHIN HIS CABINET, WHEN HE DOES
THAT, HE HAS TO HAVE THE FULL
FORCE OF THE ATTACK GOING.
WHETHER OR NOT GROUND FORCES ARE
GOING TO COME IN AND GO BACK OUT
OR COME IN WRIT LARGE AND STAY,
YOU KNOW, THAT'S YET TO BE
DETERMINED.
BUT I WOULD SUGGEST IT PROBABLY
TONIGHT OR TOMORROW IS GOING
TO -- WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME OF
THE MAJOR EFFORTS OF THE ISRAELI
DEFENSE FORCE GOING IN WITH MAIN
FORCES TO STRIKE SOME OF THE
TARGETS THEY'VE BEEN COLLECTING
INTELLIGENCE ON.",20231027
D4ijJkr_d_A,'Who takes over?': Tapper presses Netanyahu adviser on the future of Gaza,data/en_CNN\'Who takes over' Tapper presses Netanyahu adviser on the future of Gaza.jpg,"&gt;&gt; CNN's Becky Anderson in Doha
are, Qatar, we appreciate it.
Senior adviser to Israeli prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
and ambassador to the united
Kingdom, mark Greg is with us
in tel aviv.
First, let me ask you, military
people in Israel not just the
United States have their own
language.
When the idf says that military
ground excursion has expanded,
ground operations expanded, I
didn't know, what does this
mean that ground operation is
expanding.
Doesn't mean Israeli troops,
soldiers on the ground in gaza?
?
&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna go into
anything operational especially
if the operation is ongoing.
But I can say that, yes, we're
beefing up the pressure on
hamas.
That pressure increase and
continue to increase until we
achieve our goal.
&gt;&gt; Is there are a ground,
ground operations expanded does
that mean it's happening it's
what it sounds like to me again
I don't speak military lingo
whether it's in the Pentagon,
idf what is it mean?
&gt;&gt; I said a moment ago
operations are ongoing.
&gt;&gt; I still don't know that
means.
&gt;&gt; What about this barrage of
airstrikes going on in gaza
right now.
&gt;&gt; I cannot go into anything
technical, I can say this we
are focused on our goal which
is the elimination of hamas,
the destruction of its military
capabilities, military machine,
and the end of its political
control over the gaza strip.
&gt;&gt; The idf released earlier
toy, a 3D map of command and
control center of hamas, the
idf says it's under a hospital
in gaza.
It's not photographs, it's a
graphic depiction, where does
it where it is that information
come from?
&gt;&gt; That information is enclave,
based on Israeli intelligence.
If you ask the gazans who are
honest with you, they'll tell
you for years they've known
that how mask uses hospitals,
in this case a sherpa hospital
for their command and control.
The idf spokesperson and people
in gaza must have seen it, when
the war started on the 7th of
October with that massacre,
they expected Israel to strike
back.
There was a surge of hamas
activists, terrorists, scores
of them finding shelter.
&gt;&gt; So, obviously, it's been
known and it's been reported,
Anderson's been to gaza, it's
known that hamas fires rockets
from civilian centers from
apartments, et cetera --
&gt;&gt; From schools, U.N.
Facilities.
&gt;&gt; It's been reported, it's not
just idf claiming it but it's
been reported by independent
journalist on the ground.
This is real consider hospitals
to be targets, there are also
as you will acknowledge,
patients, doctors, nurses in
these hospitals.
&gt;&gt; We were pointing out the
facts, we want the world to
understand the enemy that we're
up against.
A ruthless enemy that has been
reported widely, has no trouble
massacring Israeli civilians,
they did so in all the gruesome
reality that we saw on October
seven.
They have no qualms whatsoever
about impending themselves and
humanitarian buildings like
hospitals.
Which it shows us exactly what
we're up against.
When this is over and we have
defeated hamas, we've destroyed
it's military machine, we've
removed it from the position of
power it holds in gaza today.
I think not only we doing
Israelis of flavored freeing
these terrorists from the south,
or doing the people of gaza
favor, or freeing them from
this extremist dictatorship run
by a bunch of cutthroat
terrorists.
&gt;&gt; Who takes over in gaza when
and if you defeat hamas?
Who takes over?
&gt;&gt; We will defeat hamas, will
eliminate them.
&gt;&gt; Who takes over?
&gt;&gt; We have contingency plans.
We're looking at different
scenarios, we've been
discussing them with friends
and allies, like Washington, at
this stage I cannot go into
details.
The focus at the moment is
defeating hamas.
And anything is superior,
preferable to continue hamas
ruling in gaza.
We've seen what it brings, it
brings them a spare we saw on
Israel and October seven.
We don't want to go back there.
&gt;&gt; Senior hamas official says
hamas is ready to --
defeat troops if they enter
gaza.
He went on to say, quote, the
resistance is ready.
What I laid out what your
soldiers are gonna be facing in
gaza, it's it is, the
challenges this vast network of
200 kilometers of tunnels that
they've been building for 20
years.
It's very sophisticated, the
defense minister said to me
earlier today, all the money
going to gaza over the years
not to build university, not to
build factories, to build
tunnels and by rockets.
A ruthless terrorist group
Wellington blow themselves up
and do anything, use their own
people as a human camouflage,
urban where fair or the
toughest warfare there is, 2
million civilians you do not
want to Cal, you don't want to
hurt them, you're unfortunately
killing them.
But you do not want to.
We're making an effort not to
like your killing a lot of
them.
This is a task, it's seeming
impossible and you are sending
soldiers and duet.
&gt;&gt; Obviously, --
&gt;&gt; On top of a humanitarian
crisis ongoing.
&gt;&gt; First of all, the entire
situation wherein is precisely
because hamas attacked us on
October 7th, were responding to
hamas.
I have no doubt that we're
going to battle facing risks,
you're 100 percent correct.
The enemy is horrific and it's
barbarity, it's fanaticism, and
it's disregard rules of war,
that's clear.
The young soldiers going, you
need to do this why, the
current status quo, this
terrorist I.S.I.S. Enclave in
our southern border is
unsustainable.
We will not live like that any
longer.
We saw what they are capable of
doing.
We saw a gruesome, terrible
horrific violence.
We refuse to live with that
neighbor anymore.
We are now going to a redo",20231027

IWLNF_s6xkM,Why some ultra-Orthodox Jews are enlisting in the IDF,data/en_CNN\Why some ultra-Orthodox Jews are enlisting in the IDF.jpg,"The Hamas attacks have caused
a significant shift here
in Israel
among many and the ultra-Orthodox
Jewish community.
Traditionally, they refuse
to sign up for military service,
which is mandatory
for most men and women
in Israel after their 18th birthday.
But that's changing.
After the October 7th Hamas attack
that killed 1400 men, women and children.
A limitation they want to see made about.
Moti.
Lightner reads
the Torah at least an hour every day.
Decision on his family as one of the 1.2
million ultra-Orthodox Jews or Hassidim
who live here in Israel for decades.
Many in his community
have fought against Israel's
mandatory military service
for every Jewish Israeli man and woman.
As soon as they turn 18.
This year, the ultra-Orthodox
tried to get a law passed
to exempt them from having to enlist.
A major source of friction
in Israeli society.
Then October 7th happened.
Have you ever fired a weapon
and picked up a weapon before? No.
I never heard the gun.
Something like this.
That is about to change in.
The few days
I will go to the Israeli army.
Leitner enlisted
after the murderous attack
by Hamas on men,
women and children in Israel.
That killed 12 as Israel then.
It completely shook
us, Broke all conceptions, he says.
We thought we had the privilege
to stand at the side and not be part of.
And now we realize
it's just not sustainable.
He says most of the ultra-Orthodox here
believe their jobs are to keep
the Jewish religion
alive and well, spending their days
studying the Torah.
But often
because the Israeli military
reported between 2019 and 2021,
only about 1200 or so ultra-Orthodox Jews
were conscripted annually.
That's out of 12,000
potential applicants.
Why did the Hassidim, the ultra-Orthodox,
not want to serve in the Army?
It was. Silly.
The ultra-Orthodox people in Israel
have an ethos, according
to which studying
Torah gives the nation
a metaphysical layer of defense, he says.
So if it's my home issue,
a lot of them are not.
But he says he cannot see
how that is enough now.
And he says he knows many other Hassidim
feel the same.
It's part of the same.
I personally sat in my living room
and just cried for a day.
We can't just go on with our daily lives.
We said, never again.
After the Holocaust.
And if we want to be able
to say that again to next generations
and promise our children
a sustainable future,
we have to solve this issue.
In Hebrew, this sign says,
Together we will win.
It's very rare
to see this kind of
nationalistic language
in ultra-Orthodox
neighborhoods like this one in Israel.
You're also seeing a lot of Israeli
flags plastered all over the place.
That just doesn't really happen
during normal times.
It gives you some sense
that opinions among the ultra-Orthodox
have changed in a bit.
Infanti, writing
his wife's
opinion, has certainly changed,
but she does worry about one thing.
I worry more
if we don't know how to hold a weapon.
And I also want to know
how do I want a license for a gun?
Also, there is a role.
You know, we are not in Switzerland.
There is one more difficult thing
he has to do with his family
before he goes to serve.
Tell his children Yehuda.
Elizabeth and Abigail.
Nine, seven and six years old.
They play oblivious to the changes
they're about to experience
at home due to war.
Now, Moti Lightner is not the
only member of his family
that is going to go enlist.
He has enlisted
and so has his twin brother who lives
in California.
His twin brother is leaving
there to come to Israel.
They hope to go into the armed forces
together.",20231030

hyqFFsRifFM,‘You decided to still drop a bomb’: Wolf presses IDF spokesman on Israeli airstrike on refugee camp,data/en_CNN\‘You decided to still drop a bomb’ Wolf presses IDF spokesman on Israeli airstrike on refugee camp.jpg,"Back now to our breaking
news here in the Middle East.
A massive explosion
at the largest refugee camp in Gaza.
Joining us now is Lieutenant
Colonel Richard Hecht.
He's the international spokesperson
for the Israel Defense Forces.
Thanks so much for joining us.
I want to ask you first
about this massive blast
that we all just saw.
We saw the video at the Jabalya
refugee camp in Gaza.
Is there anything more
you can, first of all,
tell us
about how this explosion happened?
I will.
Thanks for having me.
So we'll be coming out in the next
hopefully hour with more data.
But I can update you
now that there was a very senior
Hamas commander in that area.
Sadly, he was hiding again, as they do
behind the within civilians.
And that's all I can say at this point.
We're looking into it
and we'll be coming out with more data
as we learn what happened there.
A lot of individuals.
So can you confirm
it was an Israeli attack
that destroyed a big chunk
of that Jabalya refugee camp?
Yes, I can.
We when we were focused
on the target as your
senior commander, Wolf,
I will be updating
you with more data
as the hour moves ahead.
But even if that Hamas commander
was there, amidst
all those Palestinian refugees
who are in there
in that Jabalya refugee
camp,
Israel still went ahead
and dropped a bomb there
attempting to kill this Hamas
campus. Hamas commander.
Knowing that a lot of innocent
civilians,
men, women and children,
presumably would be killed,
is that what I'm hearing,
that the United States
and that's not what you're hearing, Wolf.
We again,
we're focused on this commander, again,
who you'll get more Doctor
who this man was
killed, many, many Israelis.
And we're doing everything we can.
It's a very complicated battle space.
That could be infrastructure there.
There could be tunnels there.
And we're still looking into
and we'll give you more data
as there are moves ahead.
But you know that there
are a lot of refugees,
a lot of innocent
civilians, men,
women and children
in that refugee camp as well.
Right.
This is the tragedy of war, Wolf.
I mean,
we as you know,
we've been saying for days, move south.
If aliens are not involved with Hamas,
please move south.
And just trying to get more information.
You knew there were civilians there.
You knew there were refugees,
all sorts of refugees.
But you decided to still drop a bomb
on that refugee camp attempting
to kill this Hamas commander.
By the way, was he killed?
And whether or not that is.
I can't confirm yet.
There will be more updated.
Yes, we know that he was killed
and by the civilians there.
We're doing everything we can
to minimize.
I'll tell you, I'll say again, badly.
They are hiding themselves within
civilian population.
And again,
we are doing this stage by stage,
and we're going to go
after every one of these terrorists
who was
involved in that genius attack on the 7th
of October Wolf.",20231101

DPNVq3BXy-U,'Nobody can win a war like this': Jewish student reflects on Israeli-Hamas war,data/en_CNN\'Nobody can win a war like this' Jewish student reflects on Israeli-Hamas war.jpg,"A Cornell University
student will appear in court
after he was arrested
and charged with threatening
to kill and injure Jewish students.
According to court documents.
The suspect posted
at least one threat from the area
where the university is located
and also admitted to posting the threat,
posting the threats in an interview
with the FBI.
CNN's Athena Jones, very latest on this.
She also sat down with a group of Jewish
high school students
about this terrifying and dangerous rise
in anti-Semitism.
Athena,
now that first and foremost
after the arrest at Cornell, what is
what is the latest that you're hearing?
Well, we know that
this suspect, Patrick Dye,
is expected
to appear this afternoon in court.
They'll discuss, you know,
his representation,
whether he'll be able to be
released on bail or not.
But this all comes as Jews, Jewish people
all across
America are concerned
about the rise in anti-Semitism.
I sat down with five Jewish
teenagers, and concerns
about anti-Semitism
are the very first thing
that that came up in that discussion.
Another thing that really struck me
immediately upon
sitting down with them
is just
what a strong connection
each and every one of them has to Israel.
Each of them has family
and friends there.
They've gone
multiple times to visit
Israel over the course of their life.
They consider this a second home
and they spoke about their concerns
about how the war
will impact their loved ones in Israel,
how it affects their lives
here in America,
and how it will affect the world.
It's a situation that hits close to home.
We're such a tight knit community.
This is like our family.
It's this shock that's like consistent
and you can't escape it.
I started
reaching out to people to check up,
and it was hours later.
I'm still checking up on people
and there's still more people
to reach out to
and talk to and people that
I was really worried about.
What have the last few weeks been like
being here in America,
observing what's going on in
Israel and Gaza?
I think it's been this
sort of balancing act of worrying about
like, when's the other shoe
going to drop here in America
and caring for and like making sure
to be a good support system
for like my friends and family in Israel.
Waiting for the other shoe to drop?
How do you mean?
I feel like right now in America,
we're in kind of this grace period
with Israel
where Israel was attacked
and the
general feeling towards
Israel is still fairly positive
and that pity
is not going to be there anymore.
And I think that that's
when bad things are going to start
happening in America to Jews.
I disagree with the fact that
the majority of American sentiment
is one of pro-Israel or pity or sympathy.
I think now that,
you know, Israel has been
bombing Gaza and
there have been attempts
to get the hostages back and all this
all that the military apparatus.
They say the political response
to the war has been
that especially what
they're seeing on social media.
It's a very,
I think, inherent Jewish value
in times of grief
to sit in your pain
and sit in your discomfort
and faster in prayer and community
and acknowledge what's going on.
And that's our way of dealing
with grief and processing.
And I think to have such raw pain
be turned into something
political is
very, very difficult to deal with.
It's an impossible situation
when you've been attacked
by this terror group
that's also governing
and hiding behind its own people.
I can't, like watch
innocent Palestinians die, but like,
it's like you poke a bear
and Hamas poked a bear
and then went
and hid behind a
behind a bunch of little cubs.
It's hard for me to hear.
Free Gaza, a free Palestine,
because that's not that Hamas is hurting
Gaza's citizens
just as much as it's hurting
Israeli citizens,
like being pro-Palestine or pro Gaza
should not mean being pro Hamas.
How do you think this ends.
When you're
working on the amount
of precedent that there is
with Israel, with Gaza,
with the Palestinians, with Hamas?
I don't foresee this ending
in a way that will feel very final.
Israel has lost
the innocent civilians in Gaza have lost.
Nobody can win a war like this.
And so what does the end look like?
It looks like loss.
Where do you find the hope
in a situation like this?
I have no hope that this conflict
will be resolved in the next century.
Like not at all.
I think this will be an almost immutable
fact of the Middle East
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
This is where I turn to religion
and prayer.
God, you know, really
the core of Judaism.
And that's
that's helping me get through this.
Frances Geller was planning
to spend a gap year in Israel
before going to college.
That plan is now uncertain.
I truly believe
that perseverance is in our DNA.
We've been on
we've been around for all this time.
They try to get rid of us.
They won't.
And how can you not believe that?
That's who we are.
Hopefulness and fighting.
And it's undeniable.
So a really powerful and
important conversation
with these teenagers.
And another thing that struck me
from this conversation
is this overwhelming desire
to help every one of them
feels guilty
that they can't do more
from their perch here in America.
One young man said that his best friend
and he
they live parallel lives
until his best friend's
family moved to Israel.
And now
his best friend is in a few months
going to be joining the Israeli military.
And here he is
in America
feeling like he can't really do much.
So a lot of
feelings of helplessness and guilt
consuming them.
Just to reinforce,
these are high school students.
I'm just amazed at their eloquence
and their ability
to put voice
to the complexity of the pain
and what they're living through,
but also knowing that this started
with a terror attack coming from Hamas.
But my God, John.
Yeah.
And also living with the fear
now that they feel
increasingly under threat.
I will say.
Athena, terrific job.
Thank you. Thanks. Thanks.",20231101

I5fBPAKpaKo,CNN anchor asks IDF spokesman where Palestinians were supposed to go after strike. Hear his response,data/en_CNN\CNN anchor asks IDF spokesman where Palestinians were supposed to go after strike. Hear his response.jpg,"the Israeli defense forces spokesman lieutenant
general Jonathan conricus.
Colonel, I appreciate your time again, obviously
in these early hours of the morning for you.
You heard that man there, you know, asking
the question about his family who are dead.
What did they do to deserve this?
What is your reaction, colonel, to these accusations
that you hear that the strikes on the jabalia
refugee camp are hitting civilians and amount
to a massacre by the idf?
&gt;&gt; Hi, Erin.
Sad images, really, at the human level when
I watch it and I detach myself from the reality
that we are facing, I see sad events and I
see people suffering, and that is not something
that we intend to.
What I could say to that man without even
a drop of cynicism is you should've evacuated,
you and your family, you shouldn't have been
there.
That doesn't mean that we wanted to kill anybody,
it just means that when we warned Palestinians
two weeks ago to evacuate that
[7:10:29 PM]
two weeks ago to evacuate that specific area
because there was going to be major combat
operations, they should've heeded the warning
and they should have left.
The sad reality that is unfolding now is that
the civilians in gaza are paying the price
for the atrocities of hamas.
We are fighting a battle here to defend ourselves.
We cannot allow a situation for hamas to continue
to exist after the atrocities of October 7th,
and in order for us to be able to safeguard
ourselves, we have to eradicate hamas wherever
they are, even if they're hiding in tunnels
underneath populated areas.
&gt;&gt; Colonel conricus, to the point about wanting
them to leave, these are 100,000 people in
a refugee camp.
By definition, they lack resources.
Where were people like that supposed to go?
Was it even reasonable to tell them to go?
They don't have anything to begin with.
&gt;&gt; No, no, that is unfortunately not accurate
at all.
I'd like to explain why.
If you look at the footage that
[7:11:29 PM]
If you look at the footage that you're showing,
you don't see tents.
This isn't some makeshift refugee camp.
These are permanent dwellings of Palestinians
living in a palestinian-controlled area under
Palestinian rule.
These aren't refugees no more than my grandparents
are refugees who came from Poland and Morocco
in 1948.
This is the time scope that we are talking
about.
These aren't refugees, and it's not a refugee
camp any more than half of the population
in modern Israel are refugees or the expulsion
from Arab countries in 1948.
So --
&gt;&gt; Colonel, I understand your point about
permanence.
I'm sure king Abdullah would say the same
about refugee camps of Syria and Egypt and
Jordan.
But, while I understand the point you're making
about the permanency of the residents, they
are poor.
They can't leave --
&gt;&gt; Erin, yes, they could, they could.
They made a decision.
The fact that they made the wrong decision
does not make them a target.
That is not what I'm saying.
I am saying that we warned
[7:12:29 PM]
I am saying that we warned ahead.
Everybody in jabalia knows the same guy who
was holding the page listing the unfortunate
death in his family, I feel for him.
But he knows that hamas is there.
He knows that the place is full of what they
call resistance.
All of them know it.
And they know that there will be fighting
there.
And they know that the safest place for them
to be is not there.
It's in the south.
&gt;&gt; So let me ask you a question about, though,
how you know what you're striking.
Because I know you put out a statement today,
the idf did, at least, colonel, regarding
the second strike in 24 hours in jabalia camp.
And a quote it is that based on precise intelligence,
idf fighter jets struck hamas command and
control complex in jabalia.
Colonel, of course, we all know Israeli intelligence
failed in the leadup to the hamas terror attack
on October 7th.
How do you know that Israeli intelligence
is right now?
&gt;&gt; Erin, I think you asked the same question
three weeks ago,
[7:13:31 PM]
same question three weeks ago, and I think
I will provide the same answer that I'm saying
now.
We are basing our military operations of intelligence.
We continue to monitor their communications.
We continue to listen and see what they're
doing.
We issue information, not claims, but we issue
names, faces, and positions of dead hamas
commanders and key operatives.
We do that because we do still have excellent
intelligence, very granular intelligence of
what they are doing of their whereabouts.
Granted, I cannot argue with what you said
the first part.
Yes, we failed on October 7th, clearly.
And that needs to be investigated.
But definitely that does not imply that our
intelligence is wrong on the contrary.
We continue working based on that intelligence,
and we generate more intelligence.
Our ground troops are there in friction with
the enemy.
Every encounter when we meet the enemy, we
defeat them, even if we have casualties and
then we generate more and more targeting",20231102

UWl2BivEwnM,Dramatic video shows rockets fired into Gaza,data/en_CNN\Dramatic video shows rockets fired into Gaza.jpg,"how does this activity that
we're now seeing from your
Cara, not far from gaza, how
does this activity for us --
compared to what we have seen
over the past few nights.
&gt;&gt; Wolf, the past few nights
it's not been as intense as
this, we have not seen this
level of illumination, we've
occasionally seen flares with
--
heavy debt to nations but as I
look, there another missile,
not sure what kind of missile
it, was literally right from
the start --
these --
seem to be slightly smaller
missiles, but the area here
that's being illuminated by the
flares is much bigger than
we've seen recently.
You just saw a flash come out
there, I just saw on other
missile come down and impact on
the ground.
Possibly the way that the
trajectory of that missile is
possibly, coming from a
helicopter, it's just not
possible for us to say
precisely at the moment.
There is a clear focus of fire,
here this firepower and the
illumination being fought on
the edge of what we estimate to
be gaza city, I just saw a
rocket fly to the right out of
gaza, we watched the right
towards --
to see if there's any
interceptions from I am bone,
but there's a red tracer
fearless really flying from
gaza to the right.
This is normally from our
experience here been Iraq it's
coming out of gaza.
I don't see any interceptions,
I'm hearing interceptions, I'm
seeing the flashes from
interception to missiles being
fired out.
While this is going on, here it
is clear to me from where I
stand right now that hamas, or
one of the other groups is
firing rockets out of gaza even
while they run this heavy fire
right now, I heard at least two
detonations from the iron dome
interceptor missile shield from
systems that are slightly to
the north of us here,
intercepting those rockets
flying out of the city.
What this tells us right now is
the battle is having an intense
moment, the troops are trying
to engage with hamas, as they
try to have illumination,, they
try to use this light to get
their way more safely into
combat with hamas.
Hamas of course, hamas is
fighting on its own territory,
it has set, trumps it knows
words tunnels are, it knows how
it can try to leak idf troops
entice them into a certain
neighborhood so that they can
bring fire to bear on them.
All of this illumination here
will give the idf troops on the
ground, better visibility of
the threats that are white.
Them it won't mitigate against
him, Taliban it is an attempt
for them it appears to be able
to at this moment penetrate
some neighborhoods that until
15 minutes ago were in complete
darkness.
You're just seeing another
flash of light on the ground
there as something has
detonated.
I'm watching another rocket
system in multiple parts of
second one coming down there
into the city.
It is this fire that is very
concentrated, another rocket
just came down, I'm seeing the
arc of the tracers after it.
This is a very intense amount
of firepower that's going down
on this confined location here
wolf.
Surprising, almost surprising
that hamas was able to fire out
Iraq at there.
I'm seeing flashes off to the
north which is a hit to me,
interceptors have been fired
from iron don't up there again,
possibly another intercepting
anr rocket.
You're seeing the flares --
were watching flares that are
dropped over gaza, you will see
one flare drop to flares, maybe
create --
and it will go to darkness.
This is different.
This is flare after flare after
flare, illuminating this area
now for, we're looking at
perhaps 15 minutes now wolf.
&gt;&gt;
Just to remind our viewers of
what we're seeing, this is our
camera instead wrote, just
outside of gaza.
We're seeing these live cameras,
a massive Israeli airstrike
campaign underway right now
towards various targets in
northern gaza, as we can see
right there.
You see all the smoke, you see
the rockets coming down.
This is a major new development.
We also saw some rockets coming
in from gaza towards Israel
that appear to have been
intercepted by Israel's iron
dome.
System.
But, we are seeing this very
intense system, Nick, standby
for a minute.
You are not too far away from
all this drama that is
unfolding, it seems like a
major new chapter in Israel's
air campaign against hamas
targets in gaza.
Ben wedeman, you know gaza
well.
You've been there.
I've been there as well.
But tell us a little, I know
you are in Beirut right now,
when you see these live
pictures coming in of this
massive Israeli air strike
assault on northern gaza right
now, what do you think?
&gt;&gt; Well, what I'm thinking is
from looking at the pictures,
Nick is in sderot, which
overlooks a fairly open area
that goes to the edge of the
populated parts of northern
gaza.
That seems to be where much of
this fire, the flares, are
being focused.
Obviously they are trying to
make sure that those areas are
clear.
But after those areas, you
start getting into the very
crowded urban parts of the gaza
strip.
The suburbs of gaza city.
That's WHE there is going to
be a real danger of high
civilian casualties.
Nick was quoting the Israeli
authorities, talking about
precision strikes, precise
information.
But what we know is that
oftentimes, it's not as precise
as it could be or should be.
And already, what we've seen is
the death toll in gaza well
over 9000 at this point.
So, as they move forward into
this populated area, the death
toll is likely to soar.
Not just that, what we've seen
is in the days since the ground
incursion began on Friday, is
that hamas is using maximum
advantage its knowledge of the
terrain.
It's tunnels that it has been
built, and booby traps, and
whatnot.
And therefore, this is going to
be a very bloody fight all
around.
For civilians, for the Israeli
military, for hamas and this is
probably going to be a very
long and difficult battle.
Street by street, house by
house, perhaps even room by
room.
But clearly, just looking at
these pictures, they are laying
down smoke, flares, there's
incoming --
looks like artillery.
I'm just looking at the
pictures now.
Artillery, rockets, and
obviously there are ground
troops in there as well.
Certainly, in all of my time of
watching Israeli military
action going into gaza, this
looks like the most intense
I've ever seen, wolf.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're making a very
important point, this is a very
in tense air assault on
northern gaza right now not far
away from sderot, Israel, where
nic Robertson is just north of
Israel right now.
You see these rockets coming in,
pounding and pouncing when
Israel has undertaken a massive
air assault like this it sets
the stage for a ground invasion,
that is about to come in, I
suspect that's what's going to
happen in this part of gaza as
well as Israeli ground to rips,
tax, artillery will move in
after this area is pounded with
these heavy airstrikes that are
ongoing right now.
We are showing our viewers live
pictures of what's going on in
gaza.
[Sound of artillery]
It is really, really intense.
Let's go back to Nick
Robertson.
You are therein sderot, nic,
you have a much better sense of
what's going on.
You say you've not seen
anything along these lines.
Here comes some more rockets
into gaza from, presumably,
Israeli planes flying overhead.
Go ahead and give us your sense
of the enormity of this
development right now.
&gt;&gt; Wolf, I'm standing right
next to our camera man, John --
who is filming this.
We have a high vantage point
overlooking gaza.
It looks to us as if this is on
the northern edge, towards gaza
city.
As Ben said, there is open
ground from the border fence
that you saw, or you're about
to see.
I'm seeing it in realtime.
There's a delay.
A big flash coming out from the
epicenter of that smoke.
This is the biggest, most
sustained use of flares.
It appears, smoke as well on
the ground.
We have seen, in recent days,
at the beginning of the
incursion, how the idf used
heavy smoke to blanket the
area.
This is a military tactic so
that they can move in unseen.
We are seeing it again now.
We are seeing big flashes at
the southern end of that smoke.
And what the idf is describing,
this evening, is a very new
situation for them.
A much stronger situation for
them.
Whereby they say they have
encircled entirely gaza city.
If they have encircled gaza
city, as they say, potentially
cut the north off, the north of
gaza strip off from the south
of gaza strip.
Potentially, meaning the
Israelis now are blocking any
hamas in the north of the gaza
strip from escaping to the
south.
You are now watching a battle,
in some, ways one of the team
here was just talking about it.
In some ways, it is sort of
medieval in that it is
surrounding a city.
You are seeing the smoke, and
the flares, and the flash is
all coming from an area that is
now constrained and contained
within idf forces.
As Ben was saying, the civilian
casualties on the ground,
people have been told to get
out of the way, they don't know
how to get out of the way.
They are stuck in their houses,
they are stuck in their homes.
They are getting caught up and
killed, in high numbers.
During this operation.
But what we are witnessing now,
our efforts by the idf to
mitigate against casualties for
their own forces.
Because they are operating in
hamas territory.
Territory that the hamas troops,
hamas fighters, have been able
to potentially lay booby traps,
have been able to set areas
where they want to draw the
Israeli troops into, so that
they can use these armored
piercing rocket propelled
grenades that they've been
using.
Effectively, against Israeli
armored tanks, and armored
fighting vehicles.
So, this is --
this battle, really, that we
are seeing now, kicked off 20
minutes ago now.
20, 25 minutes ago.
And it is intense in this area
around gaza city.
You continue to see the rockets
come in from above, the flashes
at the southern end of the
city.
Underneath this, we don't know
how many idf forces are
actually on the ground.
The boom that you are hearing,
that's artillery going off
behind me as well.
It's probably what is causing
the flashes that you may be
seeing on the left of your
picture.
I saw another flash, there at
the northern end of gaza strip,
just now, that looks like
something coming up out of
gaza.
A rocket that didn't go far,
perhaps it fell short.
But anything that comes up from
the ground is most likely, from
a center, that's mostly fired
up by hamas or another group
inside of gaza.
Anything that is coming out of
the sky like this, rocket right",20231102

Barbara's end.
And doctors, and it is
incredible to finally see.
I know you are literally on
your way, back home.
I can only imagine the
conflicted feelings you have
about that, you are eager to be
going home, but of course leave
behind so much suffering.
How do you feel right now?
&gt;&gt; Well, just as you said, I
feel mixed.
I am relieved to be on my way
home, I know being there, I
couldn't do anything to help
what was going on.
But also, yeah, just so sad for
the people of gaza, and
concerned about what is going
to be going on in the next
weeks to months to, however
long it takes to getome peace
there.
&gt;&gt; And, there is so much
suffering.
I know Barbara while you are,
there it was so hard for you to
get any contact.
I mean, your husband, Paul who
we respect to every day,
sometimes he got a text from,
you sometimes he couldn't even.
And he was obviously quite
distressed.
But you know, there were times
he told us you are sleeping in
a car with six other people.
You had reported that food and
water were in short supply.
You have seen people fighting
over food outside of the
compound where you were.
And you talked about a toilet
shared by 800 people, which
just to imagine the thought of
that what that means for,
people the duress.
What more can you tell us about
the conditions inside gaza
right now, doctors and?
&gt;&gt; Well, it is great that the
aid is moving in, but there is
so much more aid that is
needed.
And so, it's so difficult.
The --
ran out of water.
And we were getting short on
water.
And at one point, we only
thought we had about two more
days of food left.
And, we were able to have
someone risked their lives and go to north, gaza and get some
food for our.
Group and we were the fortunate
ones.
Really, people were just having
trouble just getting food,
finding food in the grocery
stores.
And getting water.
A friend of mine there today
says he is drinking the tap
water, which is salty, and not
safe, 80% of the water there is
unsafe.
So it is concerning, it is
concerning about the health.
And like you said, the toilet
issues, the sanitation, that's
--
dysentery for those, especially
the children there.
And you know, that's half of
the population.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes and of course the
population to which you have
dedicated your career, and your
life and your care.
For doctors in, I mention your
husband Paul, and I just want
to bring him into the
conversation.
Because he was with us, and
everyone watching every day,
sharing any update he had, from
you throughout this entire
ordeal.
I know you can see Barbara,
literally on her way to come
home to you.
How does it feel to finally be
in this, moment to see her, to
know that she is safe, and you
know that she is on her way
home to you?
&gt;&gt; Well it's incredible.
It's one of those things where,
I knew it would happen, but it
seemed like time was dragging
on.
And then at some point, I did
get pretty pessimistic.
But otherwise, I am just very
happy that she is on her way
home.
&gt;&gt; Doctors in I mean, I know
that you can talk.
But here in this moment.
I mean, is there anything that
you would want to say to Paul,
before you get on that plane.
And, obviously you'll be with
him tomorrow, right at this
time?
&gt;&gt; Yeah I you know, I think
it's harder to --
we had challenges here.
But you know, it's harder to --
and so I really, I really
appreciate all the love and
support --
and.
And I just am also there for
them.
&gt;&gt; Well they had such
incredible care for.
You doctors, you mentioned your
conflicted feelings, because of
what you are leaving behind.
This was not your first trip to
gaza, you have been several
times before, to help children
there.
Do you think you will go back?
&gt;&gt; I have to talk to Paul about
that.
I definitely want to come back,
and continue to work with
Palestinian children.
But, we will have to make that
a family discussions, right.
&gt;&gt; Paul?
&gt;&gt; Yet we'll, we'll have
vigorous discourse on that,
yes.
&gt;&gt; I can only imagine.
I guess I'm glad that, I guess
I'm glad eavesdropping on your
conversation here, it made us
all smile, in such a moment of
darkness and pain and
everything that you have
witnessed and endured, doctors
and.
My thoughts are with you.
And police have a safe trip
home, and we will all be so
glad that the two of you will
be reunited, and your son as
well.
So thank you, again.",20231103

mQopuWAIons,Hear what UN official told Amanpour about the reality in Gaza,data/en_CNN\Hear what UN official told Amanpour about the reality in Gaza.jpg,"JUST SAID THAT YOU HAVE
NOTIFIED THE ISRAELIS AND THEY
KNOW VERY WELL THESE LOCATIONS.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU
BELIEVE, BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY,
I'M AFRAID, CONTESTED TOPIC
RIGHT NOW.
WHY DO YOU THINK THESE CIVILIAN
AREAS ARE BEING HIT.
&gt;&gt; THE FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE
IN OVERCROWDED AREAS, IN URBAN
AREAS, WE KNOW THAT FIGHTING IS
TAKING PLACE IN GAZA CITY RIGHT
NOW, BUT WE HAVE STILL, WE
ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE STILL
AROUND 3 TO 400,000 CIVILIANS
IN THIS AREA, SO TO TAKE THE
EXAMPLE OF THE JABALIA CAMP, IT
WAS ONE OF THE MOST CROWDED
CAMPS IN THE GAZA STRIP, BUT WE
STILL BELIEVE THERE AROUND
40,000 PEOPLE REMAINING THERE.
SO YES --
INCLUDING THE UNWASHED SCHOOL,
UNFORTUNATELY, HAVE BEEN
UNFORTUNATELY ALSO HIT --
ARE MORE SAFE THAN ANYWHERE
ELSE.
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU CATEGORIZE THIS,
THEN?
IS IT ACCIDENTAL?
IS IT A WAR CRIME?
IS IT DELIBERATELY NOT
DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN
CIVILIANS AND HAMAS FIGHTERS?
&gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL
LAW, THERE IS A --
PROPORTIONALITY, AND ALSO OF
DISTINCTION.
WHEN I WAS BRIEFING THE
SECURITY COUNCIL, THE NUMBER OF
PEOPLE BEING KILLED SO FAR IS
SO STAGGERING, THAT THIS CANNOT
BE COLLATERAL ANYMORE.
&gt;&gt; CAN I ASK YOU, BECAUSE WE'RE
TALKING TO YOU, AND WE HAVE
THIS OPPORTUNITY, YOU HAVE BEEN
INSIDE GAZA FOR THE FIT TIME
SINCE OCTOBER 7TH, YOU'VE
CALLED IT, I BELIEVE, THIS MOST
SAD DAY IN ALL YOUR
HUMANITARIAN WORK?
TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT?
&gt;&gt; I WAS FIRST TO GAZA 30 YEARS
AGO.
GAZA IS A SOCIETY I KNOW VERY
WELL, IT WAS A VIBRANT SOCIETY.
IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY SAD,
BECAUSE I VISITED THE SCHOOL,
AN OVERCROWDED SCHOOL,
SHELTERING THOUSANDS OF
DISPLACED PEOPLE, AND BASICALLY
THE ONLY ASK THAT PEOPLE HAD AT
THAT TIME WAS GIVEE WATER,
PLEASE GIVE ME A LOAF OF BREAD,
AND LATER ON, I WAS TALKING TO
MY STAFF AND GAZA, AND THEY
WERE CONFIRMING THAT TODAY THE
GAZA STRIP IS RUNNING OUT OF
EVERYTHING, RUNNING OUT OF FUEL,
RUNNING OF FUEL, FOOD, RUNNING
OUT OF MEDICINE, AND THE MARKET
IS COMPLETELY DEPLETED.
IT'S EXTREMELY SAD TO SEE HOW
MUCH NOW THE POPULATION IS
COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT --
DEPENDENT ON INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY --
WHICH IS NOT IN POSITION
ANYMORE TO DELIVER AT THE SCOPE
WHAT THEY NEED.
WHAT I SEE RIGHT NOW IS I AN
ENTIRE POPULATION BEING MOVED
TO THE SOUTH, AND WHICH
BASICALLY HAS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING AVAILABLE.
MANY OF THEM LEFT WITH VERY
LITTLE THINGS.
AND THEY ARRIVED IN THE SOUTH,
WHICH IS COMPLETELY OVERCROWDED,
TWICE AS POPULATION NOW, NO
MARKET, NO GOODS AVAILABLE
ANYMORE, AT THE MARKETS,
SERVICES ARE COLLAPSING, AND
THEY ALL DEPEND ON US RIGHT
NOW.
&gt;&gt; SO DO YOU UNDERSTAND, AND DO
YOU ACCEPT, WHAT WE SAW, WERE
INSTANCES OF LOOTING, AND THE
INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITIES SAID
THAT THE SOCIAL FABRIC IS
STARTING TO BREAK DOWN IN GAZA.
&gt;&gt; THE SOCIAL FABRIC IS INDEED
BREAKING DOWN, THE CIVIL ORDER
IS BREAKING DOWN, AND I
UNDERSTAND, YOU HAVE HUNDREDS
OF PEOPLE, QUEUING IN FRONT OF
BAKERIES NOWADAYS, JUST WITH
THE HOPE TO GET A LOAF OF BREAD,
AND WE ARE NOW PUT IN
SITUATIONS WHERE IT IS BECOMING
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO OFF OF
BREAD FROM THE BAKERY THAT WE
ARE SUPPORTING, TO BRING BACK
TO OUR SHELTER, JUST BECAUSE
YOU HAVE 100 OF OTHER PEOPLE
EXPRESSING THEIR HUNGER IN
FRONT OF THIS BAKERY, AND I
UNDERSTAND ALSO THAT THIS
HUNGER IS TURNING INTO ANGER
AND WITH THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY, AND --
AND THE UNWASHED IS THIS FACE
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, IN
THE GAZA STRIP.
&gt;&gt; EVEN DESPITE WHAT WE
UNDERSTAND IS A HUMANITARIAN
TRICKLE, I'M CALLING IT A
TRICKLE, YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS,
WHAT'S COMING THROUGH RAFAH?
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHRISTIANE, WE NEED
MUCH, MUCH MORE.
BEFORE OCTOBER SEVEN, THERE WAS
AN AVERAGE OF 500 TRUCKS INTO
GAZA, AND THIS WAS ALREADY
DESCRIBED AS BEING A BLOCKADES,
AND YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR
THE POPULATION OF GAZA STARTED
TO BECOME MORE DEPENDENCE OF
THE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN
COMMUNITY.
WE WERE, FOR EXAMPLE, PROVIDING
50% OF THE CALORIC NEED OF 1.2
MILLION PEOPLE BEFORE THAT.
TODAY, AFTER AN ALMOST TOTAL
SIEGE, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A
HANDFUL OF TRUCKS COMING IN TO
THE GAZA STRIP AT A TIME WHEN
THE MARKET IS ALSO COMPLETELY
DEPLETED, AT A TIME WHEN THE
LAST REMAINING PUBLIC SERVICES
HAS COMPLETELY COLLAPSED.
SO YES, THIS HANDFUL OF TRUCKS,
BASICALLY DON'T DO ANYTHING TO
REVERSE THE FACT THAT GAZA, THE
GAZA STRIP, IS BEING STRANGLED
BY THE SIEGE.
&gt;&gt; FELIPE, CAN I ASK YOU THIS,
THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY
OVER FUEL, FOR INSTANCE.
AND REPORTS CITING ALL SORTS OF,
ISRAELI, WESTERN, OTHERS,
MIDDLE EASTERN, THEN OVER THE
YEARS HAMAS HAS STORED AND
HOARDED ALL THAT IT NEEDS IN
ITS UNDERGROUND TUNNELS, WHERE
THERE'S FOOD, MEDICINE, FUEL,
FOR ITS WAR EFFORT.
AND THAT IT COULD HAVE ENOUGH
TO FIGHT FOR 3 TO 4 MONTHS.
GAZA IS A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE
AND WHEN HE WENT 30 YEARS AGO.
OF WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
THE HAMAS AUTHORITIES,
VIS-À-VIS TAKING CARE OF
CIVILIAN NEEDS?
&gt;&gt; SO LISTEN, WHAT I CAN TELL
YOU IS, NO ONE RIGHT NOW IS
TAKEN CARE OF THE CIVILIAN
NEEDS.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUEL,
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT HAS
THE MILITARY BEEN BUILDING UP
OF THE HAMAS, IN THE GAZA STRIP,
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE AS
AN ROY R. RESERVE A FUEL HAS
COMPLETELY DEPLETED, AND WE ARE
LOOKING AT WHERE AND WHAT OTHER
FUEL IS AVAILABLE IN THE GAZA
STRIP.
THERE'S --
COMMERCIAL FUEL, THAT WAS
AVAILABLE, AND THERE WAS ALSO
FUEL THAT WAS BROUGHT IN BY THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, TO
SUPPLY THE ELECTRIC PLANT.
OVER THE LAST WEEK WE HAVE
CONFLICTION WITH THE ISRAELI --
THEY'RE REMAINING FUEL, THE
REMAINING COMMERCIALUEL,
WHICH WAS AVAILABLE IN THE GAZA
STRIP, WHICH MEANS, IN THE
COMING DAYS WE WON'T BE ABLE
ANYMORE TO SUPPLY BAKERIES,
SUPPLY HOSPITALS, SUPPLY THE
WATER STATION, BUT IN THE
COMING DAYS WE MIGHT EVEN BE
UNABLE TO MOVE OUR TRUCKS
WITHIN THE GAZA STRIP, TO
PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE
TO 700,000 PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE,
SHELTERING IN OUR PREMISES, BUT
ALSO TO THE REST OF THE
POPULATION.
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO SAY, IT STRUCK
WITH ME WHAT YOU SAID AT THE
BEGINNING, WITH ALL THE
CHILDREN WERE ASKING YOU FOR
ANSWERS OF WATER AND A PIECE OF
BREAD.
IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR THAT.
AND ALSO YOU, YOURSELF, AS
UNWRAP, HAVE LOSUR DOZENS
OF WORKERS TELL ME WHAT'S THE
SITUATIOTH YOUR OWN
EMPLOYEES ON THE GROUND?
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE LOST, AS OF NOW, 72
STAFF.
THE LAST STAFF I JUST HEARD WAS
DISABLED STAFFER, SHE WAS DOING
COATING, WE ONE YEAR AGO
PUBLISHED A VIDEO ABOUT WHAT
SHE WAS DOING VERY PROUD OF,
AND SHE'S THE LAST PERSON
REPORTED KILLED AMONG 72
PEOPLE.
I MET THE STAFF YESTERDAY IN
GAZA, BASICALLY THEY ARE
SHARING THE SAME DIFFICULTIES
AS ANYONE.
THEY WERE LIVING IN SHELTER,
THEY'RE STRUGGLING ON A DAILY
BASIS TO FIND BREATH, TO FIND
WATER, TO PROTECT THEIR
CHILDREN, AND DESPITE THAT, AND
DESPITE THE HEAVY LOSSES WITHIN
THIS ORGANIZATION, THEY REMAIN
COMMITTED TO DO WHATEVER IS
POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO
THE PEOPLE IN GAZA.
BUT IT'S A CONSTANT DAILY
STRUGGLE, BUT I HAVE TO SAY
THAT I TAKE A LOT OF
INSPIRATION IN THE STRENGTHS
AND THE DEDICATION.
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER
WITHDRAWING STAFF, JUST LIKE
SOME WOUNDED PALESTINIANS ARE
BEING EVACUATED?
DUAL NATIONALS ARE BEING
ALLOWED TO LEAVE.
&gt;&gt; WE ARE --
SCALING UP OUR OPERATION, I
HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR WE, NEED
TO SCALE OUR OPERATION, WE
SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO TALK
ABOUT 50, 60, 70, TRUCKS.
THIS OPERATION NEEDS TO BE
BROUGHT UP AT SCALE, IF WE WANT
TO RESERVE AN ONGOING, CIVIL
BREAKDOWN, BUT IF WE WANT TO
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DO NOT
START TO DIE BECAUSE OF THE
IMPACT OF THE SIEGE, BECAUSE OF
OUR DIFFICULTIES TO BRING OUR
SUSTENANCE AT SCALE, TO THE
GAZA STRIP.
&gt;&gt; FELIPE, I WANT TO ASK YOU
ATTACH A QUESTION.
EVERYTHING IS DISPUTED, NUMBERS
ARE DISPUTED, DEATH TOLLS,
WHO'S A CIVILIAN, WHO'S A
FIGHTER.
THIS PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, IS
A HAMAS-RUN AUTHORITY IN GAZA,
AND THE OFFICIALS IN RAMALLAH,
SAY THAT NOW OVER 9000

SIDES.
TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID.

CREDIBLE AS HAMAS NUMBERS.
--
I DON'T TRUST YOU ARE NUMBERS,
THEY ARE NOT RELIABLE.
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, I CAN TELL YOU THAT
THE 72 STAFF MEMBERS OF ON WHAT
ALL ARE RELIABLE, THEY HAVE
BEEN CONFIRMED, THESE ARE OUR
FIGURES, AND IF I COMPARE IT TO
72 WITH OUR 13,000 STAFF IN THE
GAZA STRIP, WITH A 9000 BEING

fRkHKa3I5bg,Ex-CIA director weighs in on the use of drones to locate hostages held by Hamas,data/en_CNN\Ex-CIA director weighs in on the use of drones to locate hostages held by Hamas.jpg,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu says there will be
no temporary ceasefire
unless all hostages held
by Hamas are freed.
That is despite Secretary of State
Antony Blinken
calling for a pause today as he met
with Israeli leaders in Tel Aviv.
Meantime, in his first public remarks
since the conflict began,
Hezbollah's leader, Hassan
Nasrallah, praised
Hamas's attacks on Israel
while adding
that Hezbollah's
primary goal is a cease fire.
He said the possibility
of a larger
regional conflict with Israel
is a, quote, realistic option.
Joining us now to discuss
is Leon Panetta.
He's a former secretary of defense
and CIA director
in the Obama administration.
Sir, thank you so much for being with us.
The leader of Hezbollah
making a lot of threats,
not offering many specifics, though.
How precarious do you think
the situation is right now
along Israel's northern border?
I don't think there's any question
but that
the situation remains so precarious.
You know, we're
we're in the middle of the war.
But Israel is proceeding to
go after Hamas.
If they're right and they have, in fact,
taken out Hamas leaders
and are continuing to do that,
if Hamas feels
that their back is against the wall.
There's no question in my mind
that they're going to ask for help
and they'll turn to Iran,
obviously turn to Hezbollah.
But all of Iran's proxies in the region
from Iraq down to Yemen.
And so I think
the potential for a possible expansion
of this war is real as secretary.
CNN has learned that the U.S.
military is sending surveillance drones
to fly over Gaza
to try to help the IDF locate hostages.
What can you tell us
about the capabilities of those drones,
especially in a situation
where the hostages
are likely being held
in tunnels underground?
Well, I think it's very important
if you're going to do
the kind of targeting
that I think is necessary
to be able to go after Hamas.
You're going to
you're going to have to
not only use drones.
You're going to have to use
human intelligence as well.
But that's pretty much what we did
in going after al Qaeda after 911.
And we could not have been able
to establish those targets
without the help of drones, but also
without the help of human intelligence
people on the ground.
So I'm hoping they can get
that kind of combination
working with them,
because that is the most effective way
to make sure
that you are accurate
in going after Hamas.
President Biden
and his administration has been urging
Israel and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
to consider pausing its operation in Gaza
for a series of different
humanitarian objectives.
And then Yahoo!
Is determined to press ahead
and not have any kind of cessation
of hostilities.
What's the correct course of action,
you think, from both a political
and a military perspective?
If you were advising the prime minister?
Well, first of all, I'm
glad that Secretary Blinken
went to the area
and asked for that kind
of humanitarian pause.
I think it's very important
for the United States
at the highest level
to stay in touch with the leadership,
not just in Israel, but in the
the countries that adjoin Israel.
Look,
this
this is a situation
where the issue is going to be
is the price right for Netanyahu?
He obviously is in the middle of a war.
His tanks are there.
His troops are there.
They're going after Hamas.
He's not particularly interested
in slowing that process down.
We all understand that.
On the other side,
Hamas is holding these hostages
and very frankly, they don't care a lot
about the human side of these hostages.
The question is going to be
what kind of price do they get
if they're going to release the hostages.
So so right now,
I don't know that the price is right
on either side.
What could possibly help
is to be able to
develop an approach where
you want Hamas to
release the hostages, but in return,
they're going to get the release
of Palestinian prisoners.
That that could, I think, be possibly
the kind of price
that might result in that kind of deal
being fulfilled
as those negotiations,
those conversations are ongoing
specifically to get hostages out.
I'm wondering what you make of that
apparent disagreement
between the United States
and Israel
over the correct course of action
to take on on a pause?
Well,
you know, look,
I think the president's
been right to urge a pause.
There is a pause that is necessary
in order to be able
to provide the humanitarian relief
that is critical for the Palestinians
and it's critical
for others
that obviously
have been injured in this war.
So it's the right
it's the right thing to do.
And I think,
you know, from my own experience,
I think the key is to continue
to pressure the Israelis
to be able to provide
not not only a pause, but to make
make it possible to
get humanitarian aid into Gaza
so that we can provide the food
and the the care that is essential
to deal with those
that have been injured.
I think if Israel needs to know that
while there is a lot of support,
obviously for their ability
to defend their country
and go after Hamas,
that in order for them to be able
to maintain their credibility,
they also have to keep an eye
on how to provide
humanitarian relief
to those that have been hurt.
Secretary Leon Panetta,
thanks so much for sharing your time
and perspective with us.
Good to be with you.
Of course.",20231103

its bombardment of Gaza
and tonight acknowledging
it was behind a deadly blast
outside the al-Shifa
hospital in Gaza City.
Now, we want to warn you,
the images we're going to show you,
they are graphic
as they've been coming in,
according to multiple videos
that CNN has Geolocated.
We you can see through here.
Bloodied bodies
just strewn across the ground
near an ambulance.
A spokesman for the Hamas
run health ministry claims
authorities had organized
a medical convoy from the hospital
to the Rafah crossing.
That spokesperson says
that the ambulances
as the
when the ambulances
started to move south, they were hit.
And a director of the hospital
tells Al Jazeera
this medical teams
and paramedics lost their lives.
Regrettably,
some of the wounded lost their lives.
Tonight, the International Committee
of the Red Cross confirms
it was aware of a convoy
that would be carrying patients
from northern Gaza to the south.
But according to the Israeli military,
it struck an ambulance
that was being used by Hamas.
Here's the quote from the IDF.
An IDF aircraft struck
an ambulance
that was identified
by forces as being used
by a Hamas
terrorist cell
in close proximity
to their position in the battle zone.
A number of Hamas terrorist operatives
were killed in the strike.
However, it
also appears
civilians were also killed and injured.
And that is why today, Secretary of State
Tony Blinken on his third
trip to Israel
since the October 7th
Hamas terror
attack, pressed Israel's leaders
to do more
to protect civilians in Gaza
and allow more humanitarian aid
to enter the 25 mile long strip.
That public request
was rebuffed
by Israel's Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
saying Israel objects
to any temporary cease fire
unless Hamas frees all 241 hostages.
So that means more strikes in Gaza.
And tonight,
we have another dispatch
from an aid worker, Mahmoud Shalaby.
He's been sending updates
to OUTFRONT from northern Gaza.
The focus on the Israeli
offensive tonight, Shalaby describes
what he witnessed
after a blast near his home.
Many fathers
carrying their daughters
and their children
and crying like babies.
And I saw one child. One child
who's who's about 12 years old,
who was saying, I did nothing.
I did nothing.
Civilians saying the very same thing
on both sides
of the Israel-Hamas war now.
Jeremy Diamond is OUTFRONT
live along the Israel-Gaza border for us.
Melissa Bell is in Cairo, Egypt.
I want to start with Jeremy.
Jeremy,
what more are you hearing about this
strike on the
in an ambulance
on an ambulance in Gaza City?
Well, first of all,
I mean,
you saw
those images, scenes
of absolute devastation
outside al-Shifa
hospital where this convoy of ambulances
was apparently heading south.
Palestinian health authorities
say that this convoy of ambulances
was carrying
wounded individuals
who were heading to the Rafah crossing
with Egypt
in order to get those wounded
individuals evacuated.
As we have seen
over the last several days,
some wounded have been allowed
to leave into Egypt.
But Israel paints
a very different picture here Kate.
They say that
these ambulances
were being used by Hamas operatives
and that it targeted those ambulances
for that reason,
saying that it killed
several Hamas militants in this strike.
Israel also points out
that it believes
that Hamas has used ambulances
in the past to transport
not only Hamas militants,
but also some of its weaponry.
CNN cannot, of course,
independently verify
those claims in Israel
so far has not provided
any evidence for that.
But what we do know,
Kate, is the toll of casualties
here, according to the Hamas
run Palestinian Ministry of Health.
15 people were killed in this strike,
50 others were wounded.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health, again
says that injured people
were being carried in these ambulances.
It also says that it requested
the International Red Cross
to accompany the convoy.
The Red Cross confirming
that it received that request,
but says that it did not take part
in this convoy.
Nonetheless,
this is raising more questions
about Israel's tactics in this war.
Following the strikes
earlier this week
in the densely populated
Jabaliya refugee camp.
Meanwhile, Kate, Hamas
is continuing to target Israeli
towns and cities
targeting
population centers, civilians, targets
in Israel.
Earlier today, Kate,
our team was very close
to one of those strikes.
A rocket came in about 100 meters away
from where a number of journalists,
including my team,
was positioned in their roads.
And I want to show you this video shot
by my photojournalist, Mathias.
Some you can hear the power of that
rocket coming in. Listen.
And Kate, following that strike,
we were actually able to see the crater
where that rocket made impact
and damage several vehicles
that actually landed.
At least
one of those two rockets
landed in the courtyard
of a kindergarten.
There were no children,
of course, there at the time.
School is has been closed
since theroad for the time being.
But obviously, as you
know, Kate, the Iron Dome missile
defense system takes out the overwhelming
majority of these rockets,
but it does not take them all out.
Kate. Jeremy, thank you so much.
Jeremy Diamond in Israel for us.
OUTFRONT with me
now, Lieutenant Colonel
Jonathan Conricus.
He's the International spokesman
for the IDF.
Thank you so much for coming on.
What more can you tell us
about the strikes on the ambulance?
Why did you strike so near a hospital?
Hi.
Thank you for having me.
There's fighting ongoing.
We are at war against Hamas
in northern Gaza and all over Gaza.
But the focusing
on the northern Gaza Strip.
Our forces saw terrorists
using ambulances
as a vehicle to move around.
They perceived a threat and accordingly,
we struck that ambulance.
I must say that this is not the first
and not the hundredth time
that Hamas operatives,
including senior leaders,
make use illegal use
of ambulances on the battlefield.
They use them as their taxis
in order to get from one place
to another, specifically seniors.
And it is not the first time
they did it in 2014.
They are doing it again.
And we are well within our legal rights
according to the laws of armed conflict.
Once they use it
and we perceive it as a threat to attack,
who in that strike?
Who can you.
Who was taken out?
I mean, were they high level
operatives within Hamas?
Do you have
the names of who was taken out
or who was being targeted?
No, this wasn't a targeted
killing of someone.
This was during combat.
Our troops saw
that they were using the ambulance
and trying to
either escape or attack using that.
And that is why they were struck.
Hopefully, we'll be able to provide
intelligence and more footage
and information about it.
But we have other information
which were
also able to show
and have shared with CNN and others
of how ambulances have been seen.
And we have caught it on camera.
Ambulances have been seen in
Hamas locations, Hamas camps
where they are
next to the locations
of their headquarters.
And they are used
not to transport wounded,
but in order to get senior
and other commanders
from one place to another
without the risk of being followed
or attacked by the IDF.
The numbers from the Hamas
run Ministry of Health coming out
are 15 killed,
and I think it was 50 wounded.
There's no distinction
in those numbers
of who was civilian and who was,
you know, connected with Hamas.
Do you know a combatant or a terrorist?
Yes. It's okay to say those words.
Do you know?
I know I see a lot of
pictures of young men.
I do not see weapons.
Maybe there were conveniently
hidden before TV crews came there to
for this whole orchestrated event.
But the bottom line,
we know that there were Hamas
operatives there.
I don't have the finite number,
but I am certain that there were Hamas
activist terrorists
there who were trying to use an ambulance
in order to facilitate their movement
while fighting was ongoing.
Colonel, today earlier today,
I spoke with an American politician
who supports Israel and supports Israel's
right to defend itself.
He's also on
the Armed Services Committee,
and he says that the bombing of innocent
civilians needs to stop
and the way he said it is today.
And here's what he said to me.
He said,
I don't think if you're
using hundreds of civilians
as a human shield,
meaning Hamas,
and you have one terrorist,
that that justifies a bombing,
why not go about
this in a more surgical way?
Yeah, I don't think that that is ever,
ever the case. One for one.
That doesn't seem logical for me at all.
And that doesn't at all
compute with the calculations
that I am aware of that the IDF does.
It would have to be Yassin
while and Mohammed together
to warrant
that kind of collateral damage.
That is not the case.
The sad reality
is that we have asked civilians
to evacuate, including in the pictures
that you're showing
from different areas in Gaza.
We have asked them to evacuate
because we know that Hamas
is trying to use them
as their human shields.
We know that it will be dangerous.
And we have told them
this isn't a safe place to be. Go south.
Those that have stayed
have done it at their own agency,
which is regrettable.
I'm sure that some have been forced
to stay by Hamas, which is appalling,
and a war crime
preventing civilians to flee to safety
by Hamas is an active war crime,
which they should be criticized
and called out for doing.
And I don't think
that the focus should be on
what Israel is doing
in order to defend ourselves.
And please let me say that this started",20231104

said, Stay here, don't move.
If you move, you're dead.
And they took all the knives
that we had
said, Don't do anything stupid.
And
meanwhile, your l my my kid,
my, my 11 year old, she started
communicating with the commander,
asking him, why are you doing this?
Why did you kill my sister?
And he said, You're.
Don't worry.
Your sister is with Allah.
She's safe now.
She's with Allah.
Zaki, all this time cannot talk.
He's shocked.
He's not functioning.
Because he saw his kid dead.
And it was just holding his head
and crying.
And I was looking at him.
And, you know,
when you have this impression
of nothing behind it, it was like that.
So he is one of the strongest men I know.
Every time I did something happens.
He's the one that holds the situation.
It
it was
it was painful to see him like that.
And then they said, okay.
You and you.
And they were pointing at something.
And in the movie
he said, you when you get up,
you're coming with us.
And they cuffed his hand with
white stripes and barefooted also,
I think.
And they said,
okay, you're coming with us.
And they took them.
They were in front of the back door.
They asked, whose car is it?
And he said, This is my car.
To us, they said, okay, stay.
Stay on the ground or you will be killed.
We'll shoot you or you be dead.
So we stayed.
We told our husbands.
Listen me, we said.
We said we love you. Don't.
Don't do anything stupid.
Don't be a hero.
Just do what they say, please.
And the kids started yelling.
Don't take him. Do.
Thank you. And?
And they said, No, no, it's okay.
He'll be back. He'll be back.
They promised the kids.
He would be back.
We couldn't do anything.
And he was into, I think,
530 in the afternoon
that that we heard people
talking around us, you know, and we just
looked outside, peeked outside.
Yishai peeked outside and said, there
there's somebody is
walking around the house.
They said,
child, child, which is IDF, IDF.
They're are actually our saviors.
They took us out of the house, actually.
But the kids didn't want to go.
They said, Please,
I don't want anybody else
to be dead in this house.
I don't want
anybody else getting murdered.
The kids didn't want to go.
It took me
20 minutes
outside the kibbutz just to breathe
because I couldn't breathe all the way.
I am shackled on me and yelled near me.
And we went.
We went out like this.
Sorry.
Your 11 year old daughter
and your nine year old son,
as and Taki had already been taken.
Already been kidnaped?
Yeah.
And my son, your daughter.
Was dead and her.
Body was left in the house.
It was left in the house.
I couldn't.
They didn't let us go there.
We asked them to go to see my son,
the terrorists.
They didn't
let me see my, my,
my daughter before I went.
They didn't.
I couldn't.
I couldn't say goodbye.
I couldn't.
She stayed there for three days
and her body.
Yes, in a pile of blood,
you know, on the floor.
Your kids, your Elisha, her.
They're okay.
Fine.
Okay.
Look, you tell me.
It's like sanity in insanity.
It's.
It's one day's up and one days down.
They cry, they miss.
They're dead.
They're nine and 11 years old.
Yes. They are.
We buried, man.
A week and a half ago,
they were there,
and it was
I think they had to do it for the closure
because I don't think you understand
at that age death.
I don't think you understand
that your sister is dead without seeing.
And actually, I hope they didn't see
the funeral was some kind of closure
and they missed her.
She painted a picture that he.
Could bury.
With with Marianne in jail was really,
really, you know,
quiet and
and and didn't want to come.
They didn't want to see it.
It was a closed casket, of course,
you can see it.
And they wanted to hug her.
And they wanted
to, you know, just better hair
her curls and hold.
Her hand.
And they couldn't.
Their older sister.
Yes.
And they they admired her.
She was a loving kind.
She was a ray of light.
She was pure, pure good.
Seriously, she was so good.
I don't know. Understand.
How can you kill?
It's like killing a unicorn.
You can never.
Kill a unicorn.
But now we're really united and focused
about bringing Saki's Suzuki home
alive and well.
What do you think?
Is it
Is it hopeful that he will come home?
Yeah, he will come home.
He will come home to us. Yes. He has to.
Alive and well.
Yes, the way he got out.
I hope so.
I know he will.
I'll do anything.
Anything in my power
or everybody's power.
I will use
everybody's power just to bring him and
all of the hostages home.
But him especially.
Yes, he's my husband.
He's my better half.
He's my stronger.
Half. I need him.
He needs to mourn his daughter.
He needs to hug his kids.
He didn't do.
Anything to deserve this.
Nothing peaceful, man.
He just, you know. Lived in the kibbutz.
He was Jewish and lived in the kibbutz.
That's it.
That's the reason.
That's the reason my son was murdered.
Hateful.
Just pure hate.
Pure hate.
Nothing. Nothing more.
She didn't do anything.
What? An 18 year old playing.
Volleyball in love with her, with her.
Boyfriend can do.
What did she do to them?
Nothing.
Just living in the kibbutz.
On the border of Gaza.
That's the problem.
That's. That's her fault.
That's where she was murdered.
Yes, that's was everybody was murdered
because it was a slaughter.
They killed women and children.
They have a nine month
old baby out there.
How can you take what did he do to you?
What what did he do to you?
Nothing. Is he a soldier?
What did he do to you?
They have grandmothers,
85 year old Alma, which is my neighbor.
She's sick.
She needed medicine.
They took 15 year old Dafna
and 80 year old Ella.
They killed her father and her
her almost stepmother and step brother.
They shot him in the back.
How do you do it? Why?
And they did nothing.
They weren't armed.
They weren't did nothing.
Nothing
purely hate.
There was that what happened?
It's it's
and we
know that the death cannot be.
We had it a long time ago.
We said never again.
And it did happen.
It did.
So I'm asking everybody,
everybody, everybody in the world,
in the US, everybody that can help
stop this hatred, stop
this crimes, Bring bring them home.
Bring the hostage home, please.
Your beautiful 18 year old daughter, My.
That's my son.
As we say, Zichron Olive Raha,
May her memory be a blessing.
And this is chuckling.
I'm sorry.
Let's hope that sorry.
49 year old dad, a father
that's been kidnaped
being held in Gaza by Hamas,
let's hope he comes home soon. Yes.
When they
when he comes home, let me know.
I'd like to come meet him. Okay.
I will. I will.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Okay.",20231104
4v6k0bINc34,Palestinian American mourns 42 family members killed in a single day in Gaza,data/en_CNN\Palestinian American mourns 42 family members killed in a single day in Gaza.jpg,"A Palestinian
American family
is in mourning
after 42 of their relatives
were killed by airstrikes in Gaza
in just one days time.
Three generations of this
family were gone.
The youngest among them,
just three months old.
Some of the images
you're about to see are disturbing.
CNN's Isabel results
brings us their story.
A crowd of neighbors
and survivors
working together to bury loved ones
wrapped in white burial shrouds.
Their bodies are carried
and lined up inside a mass grave.
They belong to one family
thousands of miles away in the U.S..
Family members
across three states are united in grief.
I'm still in this nightmare.
I'm still not
I haven't woke up here in Florida.
John, Abu Shaaban
can't bear the unimaginable loss.
That's my cousin, his son.
Three generations gone in a single day.
Back to back air
strikes, a family
says, in Gaza, killing 42 relatives.
The youngest just three months old.
Abu Shaban tells CNN
a video shot
by a neighbor shows
charred ruins and rubble.
All that's left
of the so-called family compound.
We've never seen in this day and age, one
where the whole world is
watching, innocent people just being torn
apart, family,
whole families just wiped off the map.
The family blames
the deaths on Israeli airstrikes.
CNN cannot independently confirm that.
Israel has launched numerous airstrikes
on Gaza City
since the terror attacks
on October seven,
including multiple strikes in the area
that day.
The Israel Defense Forces
did not comment
on the purported airstrikes.
I mean, in my family members,
we have no Hamas members.
They're just ordinary people.
Doctors and grandmothers and grandfathers
and uncles and aunts and and children.
I mean, if you want to exterminate Hamas,
you should go to the source.
Among the dead, four brothers,
all doctors.
Family members say
they operated Gaza's
largest network,
a family owned by clinics
and independent journalists
on the ground captured the aftermath
and the moment survivors pull body
after body from beneath the rubble,
including Mona Abu Siobhan's uncle,
his wife and son.
The three had recently left their home
in a different part of the city
to stay at the second wheel compound.
Mona says
their previous home,
where they were at before
they were told to evacuate,
so they assumed that
they were going to be safe.
So they went to a safe area,
a safe house, basically.
Watching from afar, an Ohio,
Mona is pleading
not only for a ceasefire,
but long term action.
You know, we can't just say,
okay, we're going to stop bombing
and then it's over.
You have to give them,
you know, their dignity.
You have to give the Palestinians
a place to call home. In Minnesota,
community members
fill up an Islamic center,
praying in support
of the so-called family. Alone.
In the face of so much loss,
their family has no time
to properly mourn, overcome
by constant worry
for the more than 2 million
Palestinians in Gaza
caught in the crossfire.
There's a sense of helplessness.
There's no
you know,
the only thing we can do is pray.",20231104
y4Iv6W0dOhU,Retired colonel predicts Israel’s next steps in war,data/en_CNN\Retired colonel predicts Israel’s next steps in war.jpg,"Joining me now is CNN military analyst colonel&nbsp;
Cedric Leighton. Colonel, thank you for your&nbsp;&nbsp;
time this morning. First off, I want to get your&nbsp;
reaction to secretary of state Antony blinken in&nbsp;&nbsp;
ramallah. He with was just there meeting with&nbsp;
Mahmoud abbas, the Palestinian authorities&nbsp;&nbsp;
president. What does that tell you, especially&nbsp;
that he is engaging once again in shuttle&nbsp;&nbsp;
diplomacy. Weighs at the summit Saturday meeting&nbsp;
with the foreign ministers of Egypt and Qatar and&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jordan. What do you make of of this?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, good morning, Amara. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think what secretary blinken is doing&nbsp;
is trying to shore up support among the&nbsp;&nbsp;
Palestinian authority as well as the Arab&nbsp;
nations for a two-state solution. He would&nbsp;&nbsp;
like the Palestinian authority also to take over&nbsp;
the administration of gaza once Israel achieves&nbsp;&nbsp;
its goals of destroying hamas. Whether or not&nbsp;
Israel can achieve the goals is, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;
another matter. I think the goal of&nbsp;
the secretary of state is very much
[6:10:46 AM]
secretary of state is very much to get&nbsp;
the Palestinian authority represented by&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mahmoud abbas in on his side and make that&nbsp;
work for him from a political standpoint.&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; What are your thoughts on this four-hour window&nbsp;
for this safe corridor? That window is about to&nbsp;&nbsp;
close at 2:00 P.M. Local time. It's a little after&nbsp;
1:00 there. And Elia brought up these issues. How&nbsp;&nbsp;
do you get the messages to the civilians dealing&nbsp;
with power outages and internet outages in gaza,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and let's say they do get the message.&nbsp;
Of course, resources is a huge problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;
right, because no fuel, as we heard from the U.S.&nbsp;
Special envoy, David Satterfield, no new fuel has&nbsp;&nbsp;
gone into gaza since the war began. How helpful do&nbsp;
you think this safe corridor that idf is opening&nbsp;&nbsp;
will be for the civilians to move south?
&gt;&gt; I think it's too short a time period.
[6:11:47 AM]
period. Four hours is not enough time to get&nbsp;
people out, especially those that have special&nbsp;&nbsp;
needs or are in, you know, in a place where&nbsp;
they can't really get transportation. So far,&nbsp;&nbsp;
to my knowledge at least, we have not seen&nbsp;
a stream of refugees on foot marching down,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, the highway there. So Elliot is right.&nbsp;
If you don't have any internet connectivity,&nbsp;&nbsp;
if you don't have power, there is a risk that you&nbsp;
might not get that message. The Israelis have in&nbsp;&nbsp;
the past distributed flyers. They air dropped&nbsp;
flyers into the Palestinian areas to get them&nbsp;&nbsp;
that kind of a message. Whether or not they&nbsp;
did that in this case, I'm not sure. But they&nbsp;&nbsp;
are definitely -- the Israelis are definitely&nbsp;
trying several ways to get the message to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thoblem that they have is it's not coordinated&nbsp;
with other aspects of their military operation&nbsp;&nbsp;
or doesn't seem to be, at least.
&gt;&gt; You know, there is a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;
aid still at the border that needs to get in.
[6:12:47 AM]
needs to get in. Of course, we are still&nbsp;
talking about hostages that the U.S. And&nbsp;&nbsp;
Israel are quite involved in trying to get&nbsp;
released. But there is also what seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;
be a public split that's forming between the&nbsp;
U.S. And Israel. That how you see it? Because&nbsp;&nbsp;
you have Netanyahu who is saying there will&nbsp;
not be any kind of ceasefire or a pause until&nbsp;&nbsp;
all hostages are released. But then you also&nbsp;
have the secretary of state blinken publicly&nbsp;&nbsp;
stating there needs to be a humanitarian pause.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the secretary of state is trying to very&nbsp;&nbsp;
much bridge the gap between the dezur for&nbsp;
a complete ceasefire and Israel's public&nbsp;&nbsp;
stance at least on the issue of either a&nbsp;
ceasefire or humanitarian pause. In fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;
they are doing some humanitarian pauses&nbsp;
like the one that's in existence right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but the fact of the matter is that Israel has&nbsp;
its war aims and it believes it can't be seen to
[6:13:49 AM]
it believes it can't be seen to be deviating from&nbsp;
them, and they think this kind of a humanitarian&nbsp;&nbsp;
pause may be a slight deviation or a large&nbsp;
deviation in their minds, perhaps R from their war&nbsp;&nbsp;
aims. So the secretary has a bit of a problem here&nbsp;
in the effort to kind of bridge that that gap.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's a difficult needle to thread in this case.
&gt;&gt; What is your sense of what is happening on&nbsp;&nbsp;
the ground? Last we heard Friday is that&nbsp;&nbsp;
Israel encircled gaza city. What happens next?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm not sure that the encirclement&nbsp;&nbsp;
has been completed but may have been by this time.&nbsp;
You know, the encirclement is designed to besiege&nbsp;&nbsp;
or starve out the hamas fighters. When they do&nbsp;
that and we see the map of gaza right there,&nbsp;&nbsp;
gaza city in particular, that's in the center of&nbsp;
the gaza strip. And the idea there is not only to&nbsp;&nbsp;
encircle that area, but also to make it possible&nbsp;
for Israeli ground forces to enter a certain
[6:14:52 AM]
ground forces to enter a certain zone within&nbsp;
that city and then be able to go in and,&nbsp;&nbsp;
in essence, clear that zone. That's going&nbsp;
to be difficult for the Israelis to do. I&nbsp;&nbsp;
think that might be the next step,&nbsp;
but they have to watch the tunnels,&nbsp;&nbsp;
they are going to have to make sure that they&nbsp;
don't get ambushed and, you know, also watch for&nbsp;&nbsp;
improvised explosive devices. So those are the&nbsp;
kinds of challenges that they have right now.&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of risks&nbsp;
going in there on the ground.",20231105
GFYRmADgT1Q,Hear what Bernie Sanders thinks about Israel's response to Hamas attack,data/en_CNN\Hear what Bernie Sanders thinks about Israel's response to Hamas attack.jpg,"Across the U.S.
this weekend, large crowds
of pro-Palestinian protesters
took to city streets
to call for a cease fire.
And on Capitol Hill Friday,
dozens of activists were arrested
after entering the offices
of several senators.
One of those senators
is here with me now,
independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Senator,
thank you so much for joining me
this morning.
Four weeks ago, more than 1400 Israelis,
mostly civilians,
were slaughtered in their homes
and at a festival.
You've been critical
of Israel's response recently.
How do you think Israel
should be responding?
Well, this is what you got.
So I think clear to most people
what combusted.
And Hamas
is an awful
terrorist organization
is they slaughtered
1400 people in cold blood.
Israel has a right to defend itself.
But what Israel does not, in my view,
have a right to do is to kill thousands
and thousands
of innocent men, women and children
who had nothing to do with that attack.
So the immediate concern for my mind
is that we have got to stop the bombing.
Now, you had six had over 600,000
people pushed out of their homes.
Where are they going?
You're saying in the United Nations
facilities overcrowded,
the sound of water, the sound of food,
the sound of medicine, not enough fuel.
You've got a humanitarian disaster
that has to be dealt with right now.
So, Senator. The the issue.
I'm sorry, Go ahead.
No, please go. Ahead, Don. Okay. So
what you're saying about
what you're saying
about the lack of food and water
and so forth,
I think that most people in the West,
certainly the U.S.
believes that that is
because Hamas is hoarding it.
And the other question is,
how does Israel it is. Not just.
How does Israel destroy Hamas.
With that?
Hamas is burning it.
They are. It's more than that.
That's what Israeli's policy has been.
Okay. So combination of fact.
Let's get to the other
let's get to the other point
that you made,
which is really the key one,
which is innocent civilians dying.
And they are how should his Israel
destroy Hamas
post attack on these innocent civilians
in Israel
without hurting killing innocent men,
women and children
when a Hamas is hiding behind them
and putting them in danger?
How does that work?
Well, that is exactly the right question
to be asked,
the military experts,
of which I am not one.
But clearly, yes,
they have Israel's right
to defend itself.
Hamas has sworn that's what its goal is.
It's to destroy Israel.
They've got to deal with that.
But there's got to be a better way
than killing thousands of men,
women and children.
So, once again, the immediate concern is
you've got to
have a pause in the bombing.
You've got to take care
of the immediate disaster.
Israel has got to change your charging.
Let me just say this.
The United States
of America provides
$3.8 billion every year to Israel.
We have a right.
Israel can do what they want.
They're an independent country.
But we have a right to say sorry.
You need a new military strategy.
Go after Hamas.
But that means
but do not kill innocent
men, women and children.
You mentioned money.
There is going to be a measure
before you relatively soon for the House
passed 14 more than $14 billion.
And there is going to be
at least
some version of that in the Senate.
Will you support that?
Or were you put conditions on?
Well, we'll do it.
The bill will
see what the bill looks like.
But I think it's terribly important
that as we debate that the Saudis will
you want
this money,
you've got to change
your military strategy.
The other point is we have to give hope
to the Palestinian people.
They are living.
They were living before
October 17,
the disastrous situation in Gaza at 75%.
Youth unemployment, massive poverty.
And right now in Israel,
you're having the Netanyahu government,
an extreme right wing government
with racist.
The board
trying to make it impossible
for a two state solution
in the West Bank.
They're killing settlers there.
So what we need
is the world to come together
to give hope to the Palestinians.
We need a two state solution,
and we need to have
many of the very wealthy
countries in the region,
the United Arab Republic,
Saudi Arabia, Qatar.
They are extraordinarily wealthy.
The United States work for the community
in order to provide some hope
and decency of freedom
to the Palestinian people,
which Hamas will have to do.
I just you're right about that.
They have a lot of money
and they, to this point,
have not been really willing
to use that money in that region
to help their fellow Arabs.
I want to just clarify
one thing, Senator, if I might.
You support a humanitarian pause in Gaza
as some of your fellow progressives say
that there should be
a full on cease fire,
which would require an agreement
on both sides to halt the fighting.
Do you support a cease fire?
And if not, why not?
Well, I don't know how you
can have a cease fire
permanent cease fire
with an organization like Hamas,
which is dedicated to turmoil
and chaos
and destroying the state of Israel.
And I think what the Arab countries
in the region understand
that Hamas has got to go.
So what we need right now,
the immediate task
right now is to end the bombing,
to end
the horrific
humanitarian disaster
that the build go forward
with the entire world for a two tier
two state
solution to the crisis
to give the Palestinian people hope.
Senator Democratic Congresswoman Rashida
Tlaib released a video on Friday.
I want you to watch part of it.
Mr.
President,
the American people are not with you
on this one.
We will remember in 2024
that last screen
said Joe Biden
supported the genocide
of the Palestinian people.
I know you know
the definition of genocide.
It is defined as a crime
committed with intent
to destroy a national,
ethnic, racial or religious group.
Do you think that's
what Israel is doing here?
What's going on right
now is a horror show.
We don't have to quibble about words.
Thousands of men,
women and children are being killed.
It has got to end right now.
And one of the things that concerns
me, Donna,
is there's not been enough
talk about the right wing
Republicans are doing right.
They don't want
any aid to go to the Palestinians.
Somebody should be talking about that.
Somebody should be talking about
how Trump wants
to expel Palestinians from this country.
So it's you know,
you can disagree with Joe Biden,
but on his worst day,
it'll be 100 times better
where Trump and the right wing.
So you think that Rashida Tlaib
should save her ire for for Trump
and the right way
and not for the Democrat.
Rashida is no friend of mine.
Her family comes from Palestine.
I think she has been shaken,
as all of us are about.
What goes on is going on
right there, right now.
Yeah,
we have to address
that humanitarian crisis.
But if anyone thinks
that Trump is going to be better
than Biden on this issue
or any other issue for that matter,
I think they are sorely mistaken.
And I understand that.
I also understand
and I know, you know, that words matter.
And I want to ask about what she said.
Look, look,
we're not words matter,
but what matters more down to Israel
have a horrible humanitarian disaster
that has to be dealt with right now.
You call it whatever you want to call it.
It has to be dealt with.
Women and children
cannot be bombed with £2,000 bombs.
And we need the entire.
When she says from the river to the sea,
when she says from the river to the sea,
which the ADL says is anti-Semitic,
she says it's aspirational,
but the ADL says it is anti-Semitic.
Do you want her to stop
using terms like that
when others and others.
Are going down?
You know what I want to know else
this is what
President Obama just said the other day,
I think quite correctly.
And we all got to deal with this
enormously complex issue
and slogans like the River to the Sea.
If the
if that means the destruction of Israel,
that's not going to work.
People are saying Israel, right.
A wrong way for you all the way.
That's not going to work.
This is a horrendously complex
that you've got a right wing government
in Israel
which is racist
and the people, by the way,
the good news is last poll
I saw,
only 18% of the people of Israel
want Netanyahu to stay in office.
I hope they get rid of him.
I hope they put in a government
which understands
the severity of the crisis
and can help us move toward
a two tier state.
Senator, on the other hand,
in terms of Hamas,
you got a terrorist organization
that cannot be trusted for a minute.
This is, as President Obama said,
a very complex issue.
Senator, real quick and you're
you're really alluding to this in your
in your answers and our discussion here.
You really are in a unique position,
maybe even a difficult one,
because you're a leading
progressive voice in American politics
and you're also Jewish
and you have family
who died in the Holocaust.
How difficult is this for you?
This is like this is
nothing to do with me, Don.
What this is, is
as a nation,
we are living now, in my view,
for a more difficult moment
than we have lived in my lifetime.
You know, people are worried about
they've had the pandemic, worried
about climate change,
worried about the attacks on democracy.
Our health care system is is collapsing.
And we have artificial information
which is going to,
you know, make radical changes
to the economy.
You've got a crime all over this country.
People are worried.
The concern
all that I am begging
people is understand
slogans are not going to do it.
Social media is not going to do it.
We need a serious discussion
of how the hell we got out of this
difficult situation.
Maintain democracy, bring peace
to the world,
and it ain't easy.
But slogans are not going to do it
on any side.
Senator, thank you so much for your time
this morning.
I really appreciate it.
Thank you, Don.",20231105
gX7tBAfy8XE,Family members of hostages held in Gaza desperate to be reunited,data/en_CNN\Family members of hostages held in Gaza desperate to be reunited.jpg,"Thank you so much for joining us.
I'm
so sorry for what you're dealing with.
Or nine family members
were taken by Hamas
to have been released, three killed.
How how are you coping?
You know, coping is a
is a really big word.
I think each and every day
I wake up and I just start doing
everything I can,
everything in my power
to try to bring them back
in any means necessary.
Two of your family members were released.
Judith and her
teenage daughter, Natalie Renan.
Describe the moment when you saw
those two
family members
walk across the border from Gaza.
They've been through hell.
They got back
in the same clothes
that they were kidnaped in.
We were relieved by their release
and thankful for the
American administration
and President Joe Biden
for the efforts to bring them back.
They gave us a lot of hope for returning
the other family members
and all the other hostages.
Have they spoken to you about
those weeks in captivity?
We spoke a lot.
What has been said in these conversations
are between us.
We're just happy to have them back
and with that,
we don't have the privilege to celebrate
as well as
the privilege
to mourn our dead family members,
which was
buried through through these days.
I can't allow myself to really
open myself
to feel something because
it can break me down.
And I really need to to keep going
every second until they're all back.
Of all the family members
that have been taken hostage by Hamas.
The youngest is just three years old.
What are your hopes for the
for the coming days,
the coming weeks in terms
of getting news of your loved ones?
When you see the innocence
of someone who has her
literally her whole life
ahead of her and then you
you try to imagine where she is now
under a tunnel
at gunpoint.
She's three years old.
We are at the point that any
any news is good news.
We hope for any sign of life.
Shunick, Your
your cousin Rehman
and her husband were captured by Hamas.
What do you know
about what happened to them?
My cousin got into a safe room,
and at seven in the morning,
she started to say that
she sees terrorists
outside of her window.
The kibbutz is built on line by line.
The houses are line by line.
So she saw them moving line by line
using explosives,
yelling, shooting.
So at 825 in the morning, she texted her
mum and said, Mom, they're shooting
at us.
The window is shattered.
She then left her
mum a voice message at
830 in the morning.
She told her that she loves her.
She loves her dearly
and she's sorry she's not there with her.
And that was it.
And it's 330
when the army reigned control
in the kibbutz.
They found the house
glass shattered,
bullet holes, signs of struggle,
some blood.
And they were gone.
Anthony,
Hamas has released a video of your cousin
pleading for a ceasefire.
We're not going to show that video,
but I would like to gauge your reaction
upon seeing that
and hearing what she said.
So, first and foremost,
thank you for not showing it.
Secondly,
when I saw the video,
my first reaction was to smile
because she's alive.
Just imagine for three weeks not knowing
over three weeks now,
not knowing
if she's alive or dead, not knowing
if she's well.
Several hostages have been released
or rescued.
Does that give you hope?
It's a very tricky question
because I have hope.
I've had hope for the past
three and a half weeks.
But we're dealing
with a terror organization.
The Israeli prime minister has said
has rejected calls for a ceasefire,
saying now is the time for war.
Qatar, which is negotiating hostage
releases, has said
that would jeopardize our negotiations.
What do you think about that risk?
I plead and even demand
that anyone
who has any influence on this matter
put the hostages on the first priority.
The community that was affected
the most on October 7th was a community
that fought the most for coexistence
and believed in peace.
And it everything in their power
to push for it.
We are peaceful people.
We want peace. We don't want revenge.
If I can turn to you, Ellen,
your sister in law, Aviva,
and her husband Keith, aged
in their sixties,
grandparents taken hostage by Hamas.
What can you tell us about them?
Aviva
has dedicated her life to
the kindergarten,
to a caretaker.
She takes care of babies.
Are her life is family.
My wife, Sandy, says all the time
that if Aviva is in Gaza and
and if she's taking care of babies,
she's going to be okay
because that's her life.
Keith
is just like one of these,
like very friendly.
It comes to any any place.
It comes says hello to
everyone is just super friendly.
Both of them are just,
you know, gentle people.
The last thing I would ever imagine,
you know, for them.
Thank you so much
for sharing your stories.
And I really hope that you reunited
with your loved ones very soon.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you for having us.",20231105
8IsuRY6leu4,John Bolton: Biden's red line on Iran is disappearing,data/en_CNN\John Bolton Biden's red line on Iran is disappearing.jpg,"Secretary of State
Tony Blinken added a surprise
start to his already packed schedule
to the Middle East.
He was in Iraq earlier today.
Let's get some perspective
now from former
Ambassador John Bolton, Donald Trump's
national security adviser.
Ambassador Bolton,
thanks very much for being with us.
What's your view at this point
on this idea of a humanitarian pause
in Gaza
that the Biden administration
has been talking about?
That is not something that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu wants to hear about,
but it goes slightly towards
where the Arab leaders
want in the region.
They want a cease fire,
but the Biden administration
is not quite on board with that just yet.
Is a humanitarian pause
something in the middle
that that should be
pursued at this point?
No, I think this is very serious.
I think
the Biden administration
is sliding away from its support
of Israel.
I think nobody's taken into account
how Hamas and
its puppet
masters in Tehran really are manipulating
public opinion
in the United States and elsewhere.
This is a very serious matter
that's going on here.
And there is no connection
between what Israel is doing
in the northern part of the Gaza Strip
and opening the border
for proper shipments of humanitarian aid.
This is a problem
Hamas has caused on both sides,
letting the aid in
and letting people out
who want to get out.
So I think Israel is entirely
justified here
in saying
Hamas is so utterly untrustworthy
that they don't
get the benefit of a humanitarian pause
and certainly not a cease fire.
But what about these
civilian casualties in Gaza
that are on the rise of ambassador
as the Israeli military
keeps hitting these these Hamas targets?
They are
killing a lot of civilians there.
I mean, we've seen some of the video.
You've seen some of the video
just leaving massive craters
and some very densely populated areas.
Children are being killed.
Hospitals are being
flooded with patients.
If you were in the position
of national security adviser right now,
would you at least privately say
to the Israelis
that they should be more selective
in their targeting? What do you think?
Well,
I think you have to
think there's evidence
they're not being selective.
You know, the moral question here
basically centers on who is responsible
for these civilian casualties.
And the answer is Hamas.
They're the ones that have weaponized
the entire Gaza
Strip over a 15 year period
where Israel hasn't even been present.
They're the ones that put
their own civilian population
in jeopardy.
And it would be a cruel irony here
if the group
that committed the atrocities on October
the seventh
by committing further atrocities
is of endangering its own population,
somehow is allowed to skate free.
I would call that the terrorists veto
what Israel is doing
and it's always subject to qualification.
But is picking legitimate
military targets,
what information tells
it are
legitimate military targets,
which it is entitled to do
in the exercise of its self-defense.
It's not entitled to target civilians,
civilians.
It's picking
it says it's picking Logitech
at military targets.
And it's made the decision to
to try and get all civilian casualties
minimized by giving advance warning
and has made the judgment
which international law
permits in armed conflict
that the military target
is sufficiently serious to justify
the tragic risk of civilian casualties.
And unless somebody can say
they're doing something else,
they are entitled
to do what they're doing.
And do you think the Israelis though,
need to at some point,
perhaps in the near future, make a more
of a transition to ground force,
ground forces
conducting house
by house, street by street
searches for Hamas leaders, as opposed to
these bombs
that some of this bombing
that has been going
on, these strikes,
these airstrikes that are going on
which can have
a pretty heavy civilian toll.
Well,
so so can house by
house, street by street conflict.
I think Israel,
both as a political matter
and as a moral matter,
is entitled to try and minimize
its own casualties.
I think this focus on on the situation
in Gaza
also obscures
what's really going on here, as
does all this talk about
not letting the conflict spread.
It has already spread.
Well, let's try and summarize
what's actually happening.
One of America's closest allies
is under multiple attacks
and threats of attacks
by a coalition of some of America's
greatest enemies.
Now, at least at the political level
and maybe more, including Russia,
this is extraordinarily serious.
This is not about the Gaza Strip.
This is about
the survival of Israel
and threats to the United States.
And I don't think the administration
either understands it
or is willing to admit it.
And I think that has
an extraordinarily negative impact
on our ability to resist this threat.
Let me ask you about this op
ed that you have in The New York Post.
You said President
Biden is risking
American lives by refusing
to hold Iran
responsible for the Hamas
attacks on October 7th.
I mean,
the president has been standing
pretty shoulder
to shoulder with the Israelis.
I know you've acknowledged that,
but do you really want a war with Iran?
Is that is that the right approach here?
I don't think it's
a question of what we want.
I think it's a question of what
Iran wants.
I think there's no doubt here
that Iran has called the shots
from the beginning.
We don't know
what their full strategy is.
But but the
the center of this conflict
is with the mullahs in Tehran.
The administration has said
that they won't tolerate
attacks on American personnel
by Iranian surrogates, terrorist groups
in Iraq or elsewhere.
And yet the attacks have continued.
Biden has drawn a red line and the.
And it's disappearing
right in front of us.
I think that does endanger
American lives.
Across the region.
We're not talking about
some kind of military option
when it comes to Iran right now. Are you?
Of course I am.
If if Iranian surrogate groups
kill Americans,
the Iranians need to pay a price for it.
They don't take our restraint
as a goodwill gesture.
Jim they take it as weakness.
Right.
But
knowing what you know about
the experience
of the Bush administration
with the Iraq war, the war on terrorism,
launching a war against Iran,
entering into a military conflict
with the Iranians, obviously,
obviously is going
to have major consequences in the region.
Look, nobody wants it.
Israel didn't start this.
We didn't start this.
It's Israel that's under attack now.
It's Americans in the region
that are under attack.
How many are going to be put at risk?
We've been very lucky.
I would have to say
some of the Shia groups in Iraq or
are incompetent
would be a polite way to put it.
And we haven't had a serious
loss of American life.
We've had some and some wounded.
But the day could come
when we would see
significant American casualties
as a result of the actions
of Iran's surrogates done absolutely
with their knowledge
and probably direction
So what do you do then, Jim?
You just say it's too bad, isn't it
too bad?
Yeah. Let me ask you this. I mean,
that's obviously
would you have got to go there?
That's what you're
talking about, a hypothetical.
Would you retaliate?
I mean, sure it is.
That's right.
But it could happen tomorrow.
Obviously, that
raises a whole set of issues.
And obviously war options
would be on the table.
And in a situation
like that, as you know, Ambassador,
any American president
would look at those options
in that kind of situation.
Let me ask you a couple
of political questions.
The new House
speaker, Mike
Johnson, has been tying
aid to Israel to cutting funds
for the IRA.
Do you agree with that?
Look, I think that's something
that Republicans should be doing more of.
I would certainly
vote in favor of whatever
aid Israel needs,
but I think we've got to make
some choices
reducing domestic
expenditures, domestic
welfare expenditures,
wasteful domestic spending.
I think the idea that the tying
the aid to something
that is unpalatable to the president
may help get the aid to Israel.
These are legislative tactics,
but I don't see any reason not to be more
aggressive in that sense.
All right.
Ambassador John Bolton, thanks
very much for your time.
We appreciate it. Glad to be with.",20231106

forces say
they are conducting
a significant operation,
including strikes
against Hamas targets in Gaza.
CNN team near the border
capturing these images of flares
lighting up the night sky
just a short time ago.
And joining me now
to discuss
is IDF international spokesperson,
Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus.
Colonel, thanks very much for your time.
We've seen a lot of these explosions
and fires last night and tonight.
What can you tell us about
what we're seeing?
What are these strikes going after?
War continue?
Well, first of all, good evening.
Thank you for having me.
War continues in Gaza.
We are striking Hamas
and we are going strong.
Hold after a stronghold,
according to our plan,
in a systematic effort to dismantle Hamas
from its military capabilities
in order to make sure that October seven
never happens again.
But specifically, you can't
tell us what the strikes are about
at this point.
They are about underground infrastructure
that Hamas has in various
populated areas.
And we have troops on the ground,
infantry, armor combat engineers.
They are striking
and they are also directing
fires from the air,
according to intelligence
that they have on the ground.
And intelligence
that is being generated
all in an effort
to strike Hamas militants.
And there was a special focus
on Hamas commanders
in the IDF also says that Israeli
forces are ready to shift
into an offensive mode
at any moment
on the northern border with Lebanon.
Can you tell us about that?
Well, actually, our posture
along the Lebanese
border has been very defensive,
and we've only been responding to attacks
from Hezbollah today.
An Israeli
civilian was killed
when a anti-tank missile
that was fired from Lebanon
by Hezbollah at an Israeli community
An Israeli civilian was killed
and others were wounded.
And there has been rocket attacks.
And that's.
Now
we are deployed in significant strength
and are ready to respond
to any escalation coming from Lebanon
and continue
to warn the state of Lebanon
and Hezbollah
that it would not be in their interest
to escalate the situation.
And, Colonel.
All weekend
long, we've seen images of carnage
in Gaza.
The civilian death
toll appears to be going up with every
Israeli strike inside of Gaza.
I know you've said
and your counterparts have said that
you're not targeting civilians.
You're doing
your best not to target civilians,
but yet there are
scores of civilian casualties.
I'm wondering, at what point do you say
these strikes have accomplished
all that they can accomplish
and you have to shift to a more ground
based offensive inside of Gaza
to make sure that you're not causing
an excessive
number of civilian casualties?
Yeah, I agree.
I mean, we have said
and we will
continue to say that we are not fighting
against the civilian population.
They are not our enemy. Hamas is.
And the sad reality and the reason behind
all of this really sad footage
that we see
coming out of Gaza, it's
not the Israeli activity.
It's the fact that Hamas
systematically, systematically
hides behind those civilians.
You know, there's
an ongoing operation to try to evacuate
Palestinians civilians
from northern Gaza.
More than 800,000
have already made the smart decision
to do so.
We've opened specific
humanitarian corridors yesterday
and today for the continued
unhindered flow
of Palestinian
civilians south to safer areas.
There is water in the south.
There is access
to food and medicine in the south.
And it is
definitely a safer
and the safest area
to be in the Gaza Strip.
And we continue to call on the population
to move south.
We don't want them in the battlefield
and we don't want them in harm's way.
We want Hamas to stand up and fight.
And we are going to
take the battle to Hamas.
And we really hope
that the civilian population
won't continue to be held
by Hamas as human shields.
And you say you want the civilians
to move south
so they're out of harm's way.
Wouldn't a humanitarian pause
facilitate that help in that effort?
Why?
Why stand against that idea
of a humanitarian pause right now?
Why not be open to something temporary
so civilians can safely
get out of these areas?
I totally agree.
And that's what I said.
We've done that twice in two days.
Yesterday and today,
there were humanitarian corridors.
We opened up an area
along Salahadin Road,
which is the main road.
And we told the Palestinians
before we listened
between ten and two,
there's going to be a pause
and we will facilitate the free
and unhindered movement from the north
south of Gaza
so that you can be in relative safety,
take your belongings,
take your family and go
We have done this twice.
We have issued
a statement in exactly what we're doing.
Okay.
And forgive me for interrupting,
but I just want to make sure
because the terminology
is important to get right here.
Are you saying that the IDF did have what
you consider to be a humanitarian pause
this weekend?
As had been requested
by the Biden administration or Israel?
Is this your own version
of a humanitarian pause?
Can you just clarify that?
Yeah, I will happily clarify.
Yesterday and today, for many hours
with prior notice and warning,
we facilitate that.
We stop firing in certain areas
of northern Gaza,
which is the main combat area.
And we called on Palestinians
to move south. Many did.
Not enough.
More than 800,000
have left northern Gaza, which is good.
But we want all of the civilians
to be out of harm's way.
And we did
so not once, but twice
in order to facilitate more.
The sad reality is that even
these efforts were hindered
by Hamas,
who started firing at the convoys
and Israeli troops in that area.
And then,
unfortunately, that humanitarian window
was eventually closed.
But the bottom line is,
I think that
we don't only talk the talk,
but we actually do it on the ground.
And we have for two
days in a road, facilitated
safe access
and safe transit
of Palestinian civilians.
I understand
it is underreported
because perhaps it doesn't go
according to the narrative,
but we are trying to get civilians
wrong, trying to
And that's what I'm trying to ask
to get that clarification.
And so are you saying
that these humanitarian windows
that were opened up over the weekend,
do they meet
to the satisfaction
of the Biden administration,
what they were calling for
and having some kind of pause
to facilitate
the movement of civilians
out of harm's way?
Do you have confirmation
from the Biden administration that, okay.
Thank you for doing that,
or has it not reached that level yet?
I don't know
exactly how the administration
feels about it.
I know that we are doing
real honest efforts to get civilians
out of the battlefield.
Not only are we telling them where to go,
but we are also helping
and creating much better
humanitarian conditions in the south,
which is where
we're telling people to go.
There's less combat there.
There is access to water by the way,
from Israel as well.
We've opened
the taps from our side
and there's an inflow of goods.
More and more trucks,
humanitarian trucks come in every day
to the south there's a humanitarian zone.
And at the end of the day,
it's the best thing for civilians to do.
And we are facilitating it, honestly,
because we want a battlefield
where we can face Hamas
and make sure that we engage them
and them only
and beat them on the battlefield
to make sure that never again
will they be able to attack Israel
All right, Colonel Conricus,
thank you very much for your time.",20231106

WYOrk2tpKaQ,"In rare announcement, US says guided missile sub has arrived in Middle East","data/en_CNN\In rare announcement, US says guided missile sub has arrived in Middle East.jpg","The US is using a submarine
to send a message to Iran
to stay out of Israel's war against Hamas.
US Central Command posted this photo
of a guided missile submarine.
Apparently heading through the Suez Canal.
That's up contains up to 154
extremely powerful Tomahawk cruise
missiles on board.
It is very rare
for the Pentagon to reveal anything
about the locations of its missile subs.
Telling the world that this sub is now in
the region is a clear message
to Iran and its proxies
to leave Israel alone.
So let's bring in
CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann
with more on this.
So despite being forthcoming
about these additional reinforcements
or and we continue to see an increase
in the number of attacks against U.S.
forces in the region, most
believe that they are
at the hands of Iranian proxies.
So what does that say about the type
of deterrence the US is using right now?
Correct. So let's deal
with both of those separately.
First, there's the issue of the submarine,
a guided missile submarine, an Ohio class
heading through the Suez Canal there.
And that joins a list of U.S.
forces, certainly naval forces
already in the region to carrier
strike groups on amphibious ready group.
That's more than 10,000 sailors right
there alone, as well as that submarine.
The Navy and the Pentagon are normally
very secretive about submarine operations.
So when you see them surface, it is very
much a statement as it is the case here,
the Ohio class sub transiting through
what appears to be the Suez Canal there.
A message
very much to Iran and its proxies,
but they have not been silent either.
The U.S.
has attributed many of the attacks
and we've seen 38 since October 17th
against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria.
Many of those attributed to or blamed on
Iran and its proxies in the region.
Most of those have been carried out
by suicide drones.
One way attack drones or rockets
there have been about 20 minor injuries
to U.S. forces.
The vast
majority of those attacks were intercepted
by essentially defensive measures
at the U.S.
facilities.
In U.S. positions in Iraq and Syria.
But the barrage has kept up at a fairly
steady pace.
These are not large barrages.
These are almost sort of ones and twos
when it comes to rockets and drones.
But they are still significant
because that message of deterrence
clearly not getting through to the extent
that it's supposed to,
or at least to the extent
that the Pentagon wants it to.
So this is something
the U.S. is keeping a very close eye on.
Do these militias in Iraq and Syria
try to get more involved?
Do they up the pressure
and up the attacks on U.S.
forces?
That is something the Pentagon is watching
very closely be on.
This is we're getting word
now that President Biden spoke
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu this morning to discuss
the latest developments in Israel
and its war on Hamas.
CNN Pentagon
correspondent Oren Liebermann, thank you
All right.
Want to turn
now to Israel's war against Hamas,
because what we saw over the weekend
may indeed have been one of Israel's
heaviest bombards months of Gaza.
The war torn territory
really getting pummeled
overnight,
both in the air and on the ground as well.
The IDF is saying that it has cut off
the northern part of the enclave
from the south, effectively
splitting Gaza into two parts
and warning that its forces will continue
to attack the enclave with strength.
Israel is urging civilians
to escape to the south in order
to avoid the airstrikes, but many say
there is just nowhere safe to run.
The death
toll throughout Gaza is skyrocketing.
The Hamas controlled Ministry of Health
says there are more than 10,000
Palestinians who have been killed
since the war began last month.
Most of them women and children.
The US secretary of state,
meantime, wrapping up a whirlwind
diplomatic tour in the region.
Earlier, he's been on this trip
so many times in the past few weeks
before leaving Turkey,
Anthony Blinken underscored the importance
of protecting all civilian lives.
We know the
deep concern here for the terrible toll
that Gaza is taking on Palestinians,
on men, women and children
in Gaza, innocent civilians.
A concern that we share and that we're
working on every single day.
We've engaged the Israelis on steps
that they can take
to minimize civilian casualties
All right.
CNN's Jamie Diamond joins us
live now from Sderot in southern Israel.
Jeremy, it is highly likely that the IDF
is going to be officially entering
Gaza City in the coming days.
Just walk us through
how the IDF expects that Hamas
is actually preparing for that moment.
Well, there's no question
that the Israeli military has prepared for
the fact that Hamas
has been reinforcing its positions
inside of Gaza City, which is Hamas's
stronghold in northern Gaza.
And, you know, over the weekend,
when I was inside Gaza with Israeli
forces, it was very clear that even though
they say they have cut off northern
from southern Gaza, the commanders on
the ground were very clear to me
that they understand that Hamas still
maintains extensive tunnel capabilities
below ground that allows their fighters
to flow from north to south.
And that also presents a danger
to those forces in the air
for potential ambushes by Hamas fighters.
And there is nowhere that Hamas
has more tunneling capabilities,
it appears, than inside the densely
populated urban areas of Gaza
City as of yet.
Israeli forces say
that they have encircled that city,
that they have cut off northern
from southern Gaza.
But what they have yet to do is go deep
into Gaza City to engage in what will be
the prospect of very bloody, deadly combat
in a very urban and dense environment.
But what Israel has been doing to prepare
for the possibility
of a significant ground
incursion into Gaza City is
it has been pummeling northern Gaza
with airstrikes overnight.
450 targets were struck by Israel's
military.
We watched last night as
many of those strikes were taking place.
Very bright
flashes of light, very loud booms.
And we are watching once again
as night has fallen here as those strikes
have resumed with quite a series
significant intensity.
Last night,
what we also saw was communications
in Gaza being effectively shut down.
Some of those have resumed today.
But it was notable to see that
because communications have typically
been shut down at very significant moments
in Israel's campaign against Gaza.
So we will see whether Israel decides
to actually go deep into Gaza City.
Clearly, they have encircled the area.
They say that they are establishing
a corridor
for civilians to flee from north to south.
We know that in the past
that has not always been a 100% guarantee
or close to it of safety.
For those civilians.
And so a lot remains to be seen
as Israel's military
campaign develops in the coming days.
Yeah, a lot of the civilians in the north
simply have nowhere to go either.
They have been told to head south. Jeremy
Diamond life was that.
Thank you so much.",20231106

AZ3f0qxerKY,Putin seizes on Israel-Hamas war to rally against US,data/en_CNN\Putin seizes on Israel-Hamas war to rally against US.jpg,"No one
is watching Israel's war against Hamas
more closely
than the Russian president,
Vladimir Putin,
who is now trying to seize on the war
to say that it is
a battle
between the United States
and Israel versus the rest of the world.
Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT
as Israel's
military continues its war against Hamas.
Russian leader Vladimir Putin is framing
the conflict
as part of a global struggle of America
and the West
against the rest of the world.
Even the
new British,
it's the current ruling elites
of the United States
and their satellites
that are the main beneficiaries
of global instability.
They extract their blood toll from it.
While many nations around the world
condemned Hamas
after the October 7th
raid on southern Israel,
killing more than 1400
and taking hundreds of
hostages, including Russians
Russia invited a high
level Hamas delegation
to Moscow for meetings.
A top Hamas leader
saying the group would give preference
to captives
from what they call their, quote,
Russian friends at home.
This request from Russia
we treat more positively
and attentively
than others
due to the nature of our relations
with Russia. So,
so far,
no Russian hostages
appear to have been released.
Still, Moscow
not criticizing Hamas
Instead, ripping only into Israel
for the many Palestinians
killed by the IDF's
ongoing aerial campaign in Gaza
some day, terrorism Condemning terrorism.
We categorically disagree
that terrorism can be responded
to by violating the norms
of international humanitarian law,
including the indiscriminate
use of force against targets
where the civilian population
is known to be located.
But for years,
it was Russia that waged a relentless
bombing campaign
against areas
held by rebels
opposed to Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad.
The U.S.
and various international
aid groups accused Moscow
of deliberately targeting civilian areas,
including hospitals and markets,
killing and wounding scores.
Even though the Kremlin
has consistently denied those claims.
And Russia's war against
Ukraine continues.
Moscow once again
harming civilian structures
overnight in the port
town, Odessa, wounding several people
Vladimir Putin, though, trying to argue
that Russia
is invading Ukraine
to help the Palestinians international.
So does
the nations of These are all soldiers
and officers.
And the choice of a real man,
a real warrior, is to pick up arms
and stand in line with his brothers,
be in a place where the fate of Russia
and of the whole world is being decided,
including the future
of the Palestinian people,
leadership, Palestine.
Vladimir Putin
there errand essentially
trying to pit the entire rest
of the world
against the US and its allies,
including, of course, Israel as well.
And this is not new from Vladimir Putin
pretty much since he's invaded Ukraine.
He's been
speaking about
wanting a new world order, as he puts it,
one in which countries like China
and Russia are much stronger and the U.S.
is weakened Aaron.
Fred, thank you very much.
And I want to go now to Barack
Ravi, the Axios foreign policy reporter,
long time Israeli reporter as well.
All right.
Great to speak with you.
And obviously, you know,
you hear Fred's reporting there
and you've done extensive
reporting on Putin and Russia's
role here.
What is Vladimir Putin doing here?
And I think
what we see from Vladimir Putin
since the beginning of this war
is something that, at least from
my point of view, was very unusual
because for more than a decade, Vladimir
Putin tried to maintain
a close relationship with Israel.
And during this conflict,
he just decided to
throw Israel under the bus.
And when you think about it,
when you try and go like you know,
30,000 feet up,
you maybe know the reason why.
Because if you look at this war, the
I think the person who
gets the most out of this
war is Vladimir Putin
when after the entire world
attention was on his invasion to Ukraine.
Now, the entire attention
of the international community
is on the Middle East.
And it gets gets him a lot of air
to do things without anybody watching.
And Fred showed
that Moscow had invited
top Hamas leaders to visit
after the October 7th terror attacks.
So they made a point, right?
It's not just saying things
between the lines.
It's an invitation to come visit us.
But because, you know, Hamas
has been meeting
with top Russian officials,
including the foreign minister,
Sergei Lavrov,
this has been going on for years,
including multiple times
since Russia invaded Ukraine.
So what do you think this means is
I mean, this is an investment over time.
That's true.
But and it's a big but Vladimir Putin
for years, one of his prides was that
he takes care of Russian speaking
people abroad.
He still sees them as part of Russia
in another part of the world.
And Israel is a country
where you have
1 million Russian speaking people.
And a lot of many of them
were harmed in the October 7th attack.
And Putin didn't seem to care.
And I think that the fact
that they invited
the Hamas delegation
a few days later,
I think that was a clear message.
On which side Putin is on.
It's pretty incredible, though,
the point that you point out,
1 million Russian speakers.
And I think something many,
many may not realize about about Israel.
And some of them, by the way,
some of them are hostages in Gaza
right now. Right.
Right.
As he meets with Hamas
in that context, in this interview
that Prime Minister
Netanyahu just gave to ABC News,
he says, I think Israel
will for an indefinite period
have the overall security responsibility
because we've seen
what happens when we don't have it,
referring to Gaza.
Now, we know his ministers have said
that he's intimated this before Barak,
but he puts the word indefinite on it.
What do you see here?
I think that what we're going to see in
Gaza is in many ways similar
to what we see in the West Bank
in the last 15 years.
And this is that Israel keeps
the overall security responsibility
for itself
coming every night
into Palestinian cities
to arrest suspects of terror activity.
Obviously, Gaza is not the West Bank.
It's not going to be exactly the same.
But I think that when it comes to the do
the policy Israel will try to
do the same thing
it is doing in the West Bank
now in Gaza, again,
after this operation
will end
and who knows
how long it is going to take.
All right, Barak,
thank you
very much, as always,
for your perspective. We appreciate it.
Thank you.",20231107

aftermath of a strike
in the Al-Shati Refugee Camp in Gaza,
according to journalists working for CNN.
The attack came
during intense Israeli bombardment
a bombing Sunday night.
The IDF has not commented
on the incident.
United Nations officials today
said 70% of people in the Gaza
Strip are displaced.
Many living conditions
and living in conditions
a statement called, quote, inhumane.
The secretary general said
the Gaza is becoming
a, quote, graveyard for children.
Israel's ambassador to the U.N.
lashed out at those at the comments
called for the secretary
general's resignation.
Emily Kelly Callahan is a nurse activity
manager for Doctors Without Borders, MSF
She was evacuated
last Wednesday and arrived
back in the US just over the weekend.
First of all, how does it feel to be out?
A lot of people keep asking me that
and I really don't have a good answer.
I obviously have a sense of relief
that I'm home and I'm with my family and
feel safe for the first time in 26 days
and I'm having a really hard time finding
any joy in any of it.
Because me being safe is the result
of having to leave people behind.
People watching
this have seen images from Gaza and
they've seen the hospital images
they've seen the horror of children dead.
Day after day after day after day.
I mean, they've seen all the images
but to actually be there
and to experience
it, you're experiencing all these things
which a camera can never capture.
So can you just talk a little bit about
what stand
when you close your eyes at night,
what is it you think about now?
I think
the answer to that question,
I think I'll start at KITV,
which was we were
we were relocated about five times
over the course of 26 days
due to security concerns.
And one of the places we wound up
was the Communist Training Center.
We call it quits.
That's when people
that evacuated to the South Sea
or in the south.
And then
we went to
below what he calls a line
and there were by the time we left there,
there were 35,000
internally displaced people
living alongside us.
There were children with just massive
burns down their faces, down their necks,
all over their limbs.
And because the hospitals
are so overwhelmed,
they are being discharged immediately
after
and they're being discharged
to these camps
with no access to running water.
There's 50,000 people at that camp now
in four toilets.
They're given 2 hours of water
every 12 hours.
And the toilets for 50,000 people. Yes.
And that's where we were living too.
And they have these fresh open
burns and wounds
and partial amputations
that are just walking around
these conditions.
And parents
are bringing their children
to us, going, Please, can you help?
Please? Can you help?
And we have no supplies
when in situations
where there are
tens of thousands of people
and it is a war
and people don't can't feed their kids.
Things get
strange very fast
and things get tough very, very fast
and people turn on each other.
You saw that up close
at sea.
We were the reason we had to leave
was because we were starting
to be harassed.
People, desperate people
who are losing loved ones right and left
are angry.
And they would point at me and scream
American walking past.
And at that point,
we had no idea what was coming
in the next few days. And
they would
yell things in Hebrew
to see if we were Israeli.
They accused our national staff of either
being traitors or
said, you're
you're pretending to be Arab.
We know that.
You're just pretending to be Arab.
Stop lying to us
and our staff had to defend themselves.
And we said to them over and over again,
you don't have to stay.
We understand if you want to leave us.
And they said, you are family, too,
and we're not going anywhere.
Your staff,
the Palestinians
who worked for MSF,
for Doctors
Without Borders,
we're concerned about your safety.
We would have died within a week
without them.
They they are the only reason
we are alive.
It's incredible that this took so long
to get Americans sick.
People start to move through
that Rafah border crossing.
It's it's inexplicable.
And we were desperate.
We we did a calorie
count at one point
based on our supplies
and figured out that
if all of us there's 50
people with us
living in a parking lot now,
only eight 700 calories a day,
if that's all we had.
We had two days of food left
and that's it.
And our national staff took off.
We had no cell service at that point.
So we had no idea
what had happened to them.
There's bombs going off all around us
because there's no safe place in Gaza,
even getting through that Rafah
border crossing. What was that like?
They didn't leave our side for a second.
You're the national staff
because they feared for your safety,
even at the border crossing,
they made sure they were standing
between us and desperate people.
They made sure that they were talking
to every official
that they could find, trying to push us
through, trying to get us on the bus,
trying to get us out.
And we're sitting there
and we're
watching these incredible men
who have sacrificed everything
for us,
who have sacrificed time
with their families,
their own physical safety,
their own water supply.
They were giving to us.
And we're watching them fight
to get us across the border
knowing that
we were not bringing them with us.
And they didn't they didn't waiver.
Abraham was right in the front
with our passports, fighting
so hard to get us on.
And we get to Irish that night and find
out his parents are dead.
They were
losing family members and friends.
You said if
if it wasn't for your national staff,
you think you would have been killed
by people who were just desperate?
We either would have starved to death
or run out of water.
They were the ones that negotiated
all of that.
They Gaza is a small city,
so everyone knows everyone.
And they would call in favors
and call their friends and say,
who do you know that has food?
Who do you know that's open?
Where can we get this?
And they would drive all over the place
to find water.
And when we ran out of bottled
water in Gaza,
they were the ones that were able
to figure out
that the water truck was coming here
at these times.
And, oh, I know
this guy has a grocery store
and they still have power.
Sometimes I think I can
probably get something from them.
Like when I say
we would have starved to death
without them. I'm I'm not exaggerating
And in the
moments of absolute
desperation of civilians,
they were steadfast and calm
and just talked to them and said,
these people are also
in the same boat that you are.
They have no supplies.
They also have no food and water.
They are also sleeping
outside on the concrete
and did it in such a
beautiful way that they were able
to talk them down with love and kindness.
There was no violence in their heart
and it calmed everyone
around them down as well.
Would you go back to Gaza?
In a heartbeat?
In an absolute heartbeat.
My heart is in Gaza.
It will stay in Gaza.
The Palestinian people
that I worked
with both our national staff
in the office
as well as my staff at Indonesia
Hospital were some of the most incredible
people I've ever met in my life.
Whenever a thing
went off
and we got the notice to move
south of Wadi, Gaza,
I was texting my
my nurses at Indonesia Hospital
and I said,
we we lost a nurse weekend one.
He was killed when the ambulance outside
the hospital was blown up
and I was texting them
when we got the evacuation orders
and I said, Did any of you move south?
Did any of you get out
or any of you coming down this way?
And the only answer I got was,
this is our community.
This is our family,
these are our friends.
If they're going to kill us,
we're going to die
saving as many people as we can.
And I said, If I can ever
have an ounce of
the heart
that you have, I will
I will die a happy person.
They were incredible.
I would like to send out a reminder
that there are civilians seeking
shelter there
and that my doctors and nurses
didn't leave out of loyalty
to their community.
And I know that there is an idea
being pushed right now
that anyone that stayed
behind
is going to be considered
some kind of a threat.
And I want to remind people
that the people
that stayed behind our heroes,
the people that stayed behind,
are they know they're going to die
and they're choosing to stay behind
anyway.
We're trying our doctors, nurses
in the hospital.
I wake up every morning
and I send out a text message and I ask
Are you alive?
And every night before I go to sleep,
I send another message and
says, Are you alive?
Well, Kelly,
thank you so much for your time.
Thank you.",20231107

xliqJ6pxx08,Former IDF soldier believes Israel is making 'a catastrophic mistake' in Gaza,data/en_CNN\Former IDF soldier believes Israel is making 'a catastrophic mistake' in Gaza.jpg,"Welcome to the program.
You've been listening
to some of the reporting
just just airing just before you
and you obviously seeing everything
that's going on around you.
Tell me first,
what has been going through your head
and your heart since October 7th?
Well, since
October 7th,
everything has changed in some ways
and in other ways.
Everything is
my my worst fears are coming true.
I as you mentioned,
I fought in Gaza in 2014.
That war was also preceded by a horrific
terrorist attack,
just like we saw on October 7th.
Three Israeli teenagers
were kidnaped and murdered,
which led to a oh, don't worry
sorry story
which led which led to a horrific
which led to the firing of rockets.
A massive crackdown on Hamas
in the West Bank
and the firing of rockets and
then a ground invasion.
The the images that
everyone is seeing that I'm seeing
remind me very vividly of that fighting.
And frankly it's it's my worst fears
because many people colleagues
in the Israeli peace camp in the Israeli
anti-occupation camp
have been warning
for so many years
saying that
there is no military solution.
We can't just manage the conflict
and maintain a very, very brutal
military
regime of control over Palestinians.
That actually plays
into the hands of Hamas
and plays
into the hands
of these murderous terrorist groups.
And so all I've been doing since then
is trying to share my message, try
to share my experience,
and try to avoid making the same mistakes
that we made in 2014
when Hamas only got stronger
after we bombed them and killed thousands
and we struck them a decisive blow
where that's at least
what I thought at the time.
But I only saw afterwards
that my own government
strengthened Hamas.
You know,
it's pretty intense to hear you say that.
Look,
we know that
the majority of your country
right now is in favor of this war.
They might not be in favor
of the current government,
but they definitely believe
that somehow, somewhere
Hamas has to be defeated.
You're saying
it can't be done militarily.
Tell us.
I guess the first question
really is to you.
Are you out of step
with the majority of your country people
right now?
And are you able still to talk about,
you know, what you saw,
what you feel,
what you've learned, how you've changed,
Yeah.
Well, I'll add,
you know, I'm not a I'm not a pacifist.
I believe that Israel
has the responsibility to defend itself.
Against Hamas.
And, of course,
that includes military actions.
But I think that right now
in Israeli society,
there's a debate going on
as to
whether this war that we're fighting
should be against Hamas
or it should it be against
the Palestinian people.
And you have
members of this current government
who have said
since the horrific atrocities
that we saw in October,
on October 7th against Israeli civilians
and the kidnaping of Israeli
civilians who are still being held
they have made it clear
that they aren't differentiating
between civilians and and Hamas.
Even last night,
a senior member of the coalition
sorry, on Saturday night,
senior member of the coalition
of a member of the cabinet,
Bezalel Smotrich,
the finance minister
and the minister overseeing
the West Bank
and the Ministry of Defense said
that he doesn't
really see
a big difference
between the Palestinian Authority
and Hamas.
The Arabs are the same Arabs.
So there are many Israelis
who disagree with that.
And there are many Israelis
who are questioning the assumptions
and questioning
the lies that they've been told
for so many years.
And maybe it is a majority
who has believed the lies that
our government has told us.
But, you know, I
think that this is an opportunity for a
for partners
of mine in the Israeli peace camp.
I saw
many of my.
Yes,
I can hear you
Let me ask you another question, Ben.
Let me ask you another question.
Okay, Ben.
See, your line is dropped.
We're going to redial you
and we're going to bring you back.
We're going to bring you back
So standby and we'll bring you back.
I want to ask you again about the op ed,
the article
you wrote
for The New York Times
describing what it was like
you know,
in the deployment in 2014 and Gaza.
You wrote,
you know,
that some of your soldiers
were feeling doubts at that time.
And then you wrote your own thoughts
on a piece of paper and you wrote this.
I wrote that
some members of my team had been tallying
the number of soldiers killed
and discussing
whether this operation
was worth the losses.
I think it could be worth it.
I wrote
as long as we decisively eliminate
the threat.
That's the lie they told us
and the lie that's being repeated today
that we can decisively eliminate
the threat of Hamas
through a military operation and see.
How did you come to the conclusion that
you couldn't
Well, you know, one of the voices
that I've listened to over the years
and I've been convinced
by is not just not just the voices
of human rights activists,
but also the voice of the former
head of the Shin Bet, Amy Ayalon,
who is the top counterterrorism expert
and for four
and a half years in the in the country.
And he said this openly.
He said,
the only way to decisively defeat
the terrorism that Hamas represents
is through creating an alternative
and creating hope.
And that means working
towards a political solution.
And our current government has been
fundamentally committed
to opposing a political solution
and to preventing the creation
of a Palestinian state
and preventing Palestinian independence.
So, therefore,
I that's why
I realize that
military alone will not defeat Hamas.
And that's why
I think that our government
needs to be changed immediately.
So let me ask you then as well,
because you talk a lot in your favor
of what you saw in Gaza in 2014.
Tell me,
because earlier
you said you don't believe
that the soldiers distinguish
carefully enough
between civilians and Hamas fighters.
What did you
yourself experienced to make you say that
Well, you know,
in the
area that we went,
we were told that
all the civilians had fled.
And that was true for the most part,
but it wasn't entirely true.
We did find civilians.
There was an entire family
in the second neighborhood
that my unit took over
was an entire family who stayed behind
And the soldiers,
you know, luckily
when they entered the house, they didn't
kill them through live fire.
They gave them food and water.
They guarded them for many days.
But when we pulled out,
the Air Force
flew overhead
and bombed the entire neighborhood.
And eight
members of that family were killed.
I learned this later.
So I've seen this with my own eyes
and I'm not.
And I'm listening today.
I'm listening to my own leaders,
including who I'm mentioned,
Bezalel Smotrich,
who said he doesn't really
differentiate between
the Palestinian Authority,
which recognizes
Israel wants to negotiate
with Israel and Hamas,
which is the terrorist organization
that carried out these atrocities.
The Arabs are the Arabs.
That's what he said on Saturday
night on Israeli television.
So it's hard for me to believe.
I don't believe that
I've seen it with my own eyes.
I don't believe that Israel
is doing everything in its power
to prevent civilian casualties
based on the statements
of members of the Likud
and other members of the coalition.
And I think that that's
a result of the fact that this government
doesn't view
the Palestinian people
as the future partners
for making peace with.
And they are just convinced that
overwhelming military power
is going to bring us safety and security
and this is a catastrophic mistake.
It's the same catastrophic mistake
that led us to the horrific
events of
October 7th And
we absolutely need to change that.
We need our partners abroad.
We need the US government also.
I'm an Israeli, but I'm also an American.
And I expect that the American government
also not just pay lip service to the idea
of pursuing a political solution.
You know,
settlements are expanding
at an incredible rate.
Settlers are illegally taking over land,
not even according to international law,
according to Israeli law.
They're going out
and there are shooting at
Palestinian civilians
and there's no with impunity.
There's no real enforcement against them.
And so I think the our international
partners and allies
need to take a stance
on the side of the Israelis
who are
demanding political solution
and are demanding
differentiation, and that our government
makes sure not to harm and kill
innocent civilians.
Benzie, obviously,
they tell us endlessly
that they are doing their best,
but you can see
allies like the United States
are getting increasingly worried,
not to mention everybody on the ground
about the civilian toll.
There is there are stories
a lot
about dissent being quashed in Israel.
Are you not worried
about what you're saying to me
publicly now,
being accused of siding with the enemy
and the kind of things
that are getting some Israelis in trouble
You know,
it's it's a risk
that I have
to take
for the future of the people of Israel.
You know,
siding with the enemy would be ironic
for my government to accuse me
after my government
in order
to prevent a Palestinian state
actually facilitated
the transfer of hundreds
of millions of dollars to Hamas
and preferred to bolster Hamas
and to de-legitimize
the Palestinian Authority
and Palestinian
human rights organizations.
They designated
Palestinian human rights organizations
as a terrorist organization
that they categorized
Palestinian
diplomatic initiatives as Palestinian,
as diplomatic terrorism.
But Hamas,
they facilitated the transfer
of hundreds of millions of dollars,
and they also crushed
Palestinian hopes of independence,
which also fed the fuel of Hamas,
because that's what Hamas
is the enemy of peace.
And when our government committed itself
to preventing a peace process
and preventing negotiations,
they were actually helping Hamas.
Ben Sanders, thank you very much.
And what you've just said
has been
confirmed by by very many people.
And obviously, we know that governments
were encouraged
to try to make Gaza and Hamas
sort of economically
okay,
thinking that the threat had subsided.
But clearly,
we know that it had not been easy.
Sanders Thank you very much.",20231107
A3TWRghbSsc,White House warns Israel over post-war plans for Gaza,data/en_CNN\White House warns Israel over post-war plans for Gaza.jpg,"I think Israel will, for
an indefinite period will have
the overall security responsibility
because we've seen what happens
when we don't have it.
One month into the war with Hamas,
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is giving his first indication
of Israel's plans for Gaza
after the fighting ends.
This comes
as more airstrikes could be seen slamming
Gaza City overnight.
The IDF says it has secured
a Hamas military stronghold
in northern Gaza
and struck
a cell of about ten terrorists
in an anti-tank missile cell.
Joining us now is White House
Security Council spokesman John Kirby.
Admiral, I appreciate your time.
I want to start with what we heard
just heard from the prime minister
There has been a lot of discussion
about what would happen
after the military conflict is done.
The president has made
very clear he believes that holding Gaza
that that
a essentially
a reoccupation is not a good idea.
What was your take
on what you heard
from the prime minister?
Well, the president still believes that
a reoccupation of Gaza
by Israeli forces is not good.
It's not good for Israel,
not good for the Israeli people.
Will that
Prime Minister Netanyahu speak to
whatever is post-conflict plans?
Or I can tell you, though,
that one of the conversations
that Secretary Blinken's
been having in the region is, you know,
what does post-conflict Gaza look like?
You know what?
What does governance look like? In Gaza?
Because whatever it is,
it can't be what it was on October six.
It can't be Hamas.
One of the conference is Saudi Arabia.
They're hosting a summit
of Muslim leaders this weekend.
There are reports
that Iran's president
Raisi will attend that summit.
What does that tell you?
What's your response to his attendance?
I know that it tells
us anything too specific.
So I think we're going to have to wait
to see how this plays out
and see what kind of a role,
if they actually show up,
what kind of role they play.
I mean,
our perspective is
Iran is a destabilizing actor
in the region.
They support
groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.
They're supporting these militia groups
that continue to fire rockets
at our bases in Iraq
and in Syria and there.
And they're also supporting Putin's war
in Ukraine.
So it's difficult for us to see
whether Iran would have some sort
of meaningful, constructive,
productive discussion about
about conflict resolution at this point,
given that they're the arsonist here.
But again, we'll have to see
what happens at this
at this meeting this weekend.
You mentioned the rocket attacks on U.S.
personnel.
They've also been one way
drone attacks as well.
I believe there's as many as 38
or 39 U.S.
personnel who have been injured
in those attacks or a number of attacks
that have occurred.
Does the U.S.
believe that at this point,
the threshold for an expanded conflict
has not been crossed yet?
We are
still working very hard
to keep this conflict from widening.
Deepening, escalating.
The attacks on our troops
obviously are deeply concerning.
You've seen us retaliate
in the last week or so.
We'll evaluate what we're going to do
in terms of next steps.
We're obviously going to do
whatever we have to do to protect our
our troops in Iraq and in Syria.
Make sure that we make a strong statement
about force protection
and how much that means to us.
But we haven't seen another nation state
or actor
move in demonstrable
major muscle movement ways
to try to deepen and widen
this conflict as yet.
That's one of the reasons
why the president has added
so much more force posture to the region
now, including a,
you know, an Ohio class submarine
which is now in the Central Command
area of responsibility.
We're going to keep watching this
if we have to make additional force
posture changes where we'll do that, too.
Did you think you'd see the day where
CENTCOM would tweet out
a picture of an Ohio class submarine
in transit?
Well, look, it's
you know,
as you know,
it's it's rare for the United States
Navy or our combatant commanders
to talk about
where our submarines are
and what they're doing.
But in this case,
I think it makes perfect sense
when we're trying to send
a strong signal of deterrence
to actors in the region
so that they don't widen this conflict
to let them know
that we've got yet
additional military capability
at the ready
to defend our national interests.
The president spoke
with the prime minister again yesterday
They've been speaking on a very regular
basis.
Admiral, I was struck
by the former prime minister, Ehud Barak,
gave an interview yesterday
where he was talking about
if he could see the window closing
for the military operation
due to the pressure
from regional allies,
the pressure also of domestic
political pressure at the United States,
as the president conveyed
that to the prime minister,
that there is a very small window
of time to conduct these operations.
Well, I won't
talk about the private conversation
between the president and prime minister.
They have a routine
now sort of dialog
as these operations are are ongoing.
And again, they spoke again yesterday.
One of the things that the president
made clear to the prime minister
is that we're going to continue
to stand with Israel.
We're going to continue
to make sure
that they have the security assistance
they need, the tools,
the weapons, the capabilities
to go after Hamas.
That hasn't changed since October 7th.
And it's not going to change
going forward with these.
I wanted to play for you
sound from Jordan's Queen Rania.
She's been very outspoken.
She's also
Jordan is a very critical
ally in the region for the United States.
Take a listen.
If you
manage to eliminate all of Hamas,
what next?
The root cause of this conflict
is an illegal occupation.
It is routine human rights abuses,
illegal settlements, a disregard to U.N.
resolutions and international law.
If we do not address these root causes,
then you can kill the combatant,
but you cannot kill the cause.
She is of Palestinian
Palestinian descent.
I guess the question is to that point
and for regional leaders
who say the same thing.
What is the response right now?
So we certainly agree that Hamas isn't
just an organization.
There's an ideology behind this
this terrorist group that slaughters 1400
Israelis on the 7th of October.
And while you can go
after the leaders
and eliminate the leaders
and disrupt the network,
and we've proven
that we know how to do that
against groups like al Qaeda and ISIS,
it is difficult to kill the ideology.
Now, she's also talking about
history here and
and how things ended up
the way they did in Gaza
and in the West Bank.
And I think that the history
is obviously long.
It's complicated, it's complex.
And it's good
for all of us to remind ourselves
of of how we got here.
But it's also important to remember that
we still believe in a two-State solution
in the United States.
We still President Biden still supports
this as a
is a viable vision and a promise
for both in a Jewish Democratic state
and a free and independent
Palestinian state.
That is a way
we believe that both sides
can live in peace
and security going forward.
And even though we're
in the middle of a conflict, Bill,
President hasn't given up on that.
And we're continuing
to talk to our partners
throughout the region
about how to get back on track
to some sort of viable two state,
two state solution here.
John Kirby,
we appreciate at the time
and your ability
to fight through the leaf blowers
behind you. Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it as always. You bet.",20231107

The Pentagon now says U.S.
forces have carried out an airstrike
against a weapons
facility in Syria linked to
various groups backed by Iran.
CNN's Jeremy Diamond is joining us
from Tel Aviv, Israel, right now.
He's got the latest.
What are you learning, Jeremy?
Yeah, that's right, Wolf.
Two U.S.
F-15 striking a weapons
storage facility in eastern Syria.
This was just confirmed,
confirmed by the U.S.
Department of Defense.
This happened
in response to attacks
carried out by Iranian proxies
in the region against U.S.
personnel in Iraq and Syria.
We have watched over
the last several weeks
as Iranian proxies
have ramped up their attacks on U.S.
personnel and bases in Iraq and Syria.
Since October 17, 40 times,
those bases have been attacked
by those Iranian proxies,
leaving multiple U.S.
service members
with traumatic brain injuries
and other injuries
that the military characterize as minor.
But this is just an ongoing saga
in the potential
for a greater escalation here
as Iran has employed its proxies
to attack not only Israel, but also U.S.
interests in the region.
Earlier today, in fact,
the Houthi rebels in Yemen,
who are also allied
with Iran, took down an unmanned U.S.
aerial drone,
which is another significant move
in this story as we watch to see
whether or not
this conflict
between Israel and Hamas
could potentially escalate
into a broader regional war,
which the U.S.
is very much trying to avoid.
Yes, certainly is,
But it's a very serious
development indeed.
We're also getting
and I
know you're doing a lot of reporting
on this,
a new look inside
Israel's ground offensive
that's ongoing in Gaza.
What are you learning?
That's right, Wolf.
We went into Gaza on Saturday
with the Israel Defense Forces and today
several other journalists,
including Reuters,
getting an opportunity to go inside.
These are very tightly controlled visits,
very limited
window, and military censors
do review footage.
But we are getting a picture
in this case of northern Gaza
and some of Israel's military operations.
This is all happening
as Israeli forces are moving now
into the heart of Gaza City,
according to Israel's
minister of defense.
For several days
now, we've been hearing that
they've been encircling Gaza City
and now they are saying that
they are firmly operating
within that city, a Hamas stronghold.
Of course,
it's very difficult for us
to independently verify
those accounts by the Israeli military.
But all of this is happening
as senior Israeli officials
are making very clear, Wolf, that
the tunnel system that remains below Gaza
remains a tremendous challenge
for Israeli forces.
And tonight,
the Israel Defense Forces confirming that
they have taken out 130 tunnel systems
since this war began.
But, of course, they acknowledge
that many, many more still remains.
Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation
in Gaza, Wolf, remains dire.
We are watching
as hospitals
are running out of medical supplies,
running out of fuels
to carry out their operations.
And the U.N.
secretary general is warning
that the way Israel is carrying out
its military operation,
saying that there is clearly something
wrong there Wolf.
Jeremy Diamond
reporting from Tel Aviv, Israel,
thank you very much.
I want to get some more
now on the crisis in Gaza
as countless Palestinians
flee the Israeli bombardment
in the northern Strip
for an uncertain future in the south.
CNN's Salma
Abdelaziz has a closer look at their
harrowing journey.
Taking only what they can carry.
Families are fleeing Gaza City.
They wave white flags
made of anything they can find.
And as the sounds of war
echo around them,
they signal yet again
that they are innocents.
And now we're supposed
to be in the safe area.
But you can hear the bombs behind us,
he says. All of our houses are gone.
Nothing is left.
How much more can
the Israeli military
has been calling for weeks
on all those living
in the northern part of the strip
to move southwards?
Most recently opening what it called
safe corridors
for limited windows of time.
Pushing thousands here
to Salahadin Street,
where evacuees describe
a harrowing journey.
So we saw along the road destruction
dead bodies
everywhere in the Israeli
tanks with demand to search the youth.
She says.
We saw one young man stripped naked.
We witnessed unbearable scenes.
The only way to reach the route
is by foot or by cart.
For those who can find room.
There was heavy shelling
on our neighborhood
and we were forced to flee.
We have to use these donkey carts
because there's no fuel, he says.
They cut everything off to force us
out of our homes.
Israeli
troops are now in the heart of Gaza City
as Israel's defense minister
apparently declared the entire city,
the whole of the Enclave's
largest population center
a legitimate target.
Azar Gaza is the biggest terror
stronghold that mankind has ever built.
This whole city is one
big terror base underground.
They have kilometers of tunnels
connecting to hospitals and schools.
The U.N.
calls this exodus forcible displacement
and accuses
Israel of the collective punishment
of some 2 million people.
And these
routes can be dangerous and deadly.
This was Salahadin Street
just a few weeks ago.
CNN geolocated and authenticated
these videos
showing the aftermath of explosions
that killed evacuees.
You can see luggage among the bodies.
And many fear
they will never be allowed
to return home.
Some here say
this is reminiscent of the Nakba,
the Arabic term
for the expulsion
of Palestinians
from their towns
during the founding of Israel.
We walked a very long way.
It felt like the Nakba of 2023, she says.
We walked by dead
people who were ripped to shreds.
Children were very tired
because there was no water.
People were dying
and there were elderly who couldn't walk.
And for those who do make it.
Bombardment and siege
await them in the south.
To what do I do?
There is no true escape.
Because ultimately I'm here.
Because I'm at the table.
And thanks to see it in Salma

what it calls the heart of Gaza City.
They said today
it destroyed more tunnels used by Hamas.
According to the IDF,
these tunnels were located near
a school sponsored by the UN.
The IDF also announced
they had destroyed
at least 130 tunnel shafts
since the start of the war.
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said earlier this week
that Israel
would maintain security
over the Gaza Strip for,
quote, an indefinite period.
For Germany, Diamond has more,
including new footage of what
that urban combat looks like.
An Israeli armored
vehicle advances
through the Al-Shati refugee camp,

Moments earlier, the same video

and through the rubble

geolocated several
videos released in recent days
to northern Gaza
in Beit Hanoun,
a Tatra and the Shati refugee camp
indicating Hamas is likely
still mounting attacks in areas.
Israeli forces entered over a week ago.
The videos provide
a limited window into the group's
guerrilla tactics

face as they move deeper into Gaza.
As we are moving
in, we're
fighting more and more close combat urban
combat type engagements.
The Israeli military says
its forces have encircled
and are now operating
in the heart of Gaza City,
where they face
the dangers of dense urban combat
and a vast network of tunnels
Hamas fighters are using to sneak up
on Israeli forces.
The nature of urban warfare is that,
you know,
they go down a tunnel
and come up somewhere else.
And that is exactly why
we are moving slowly.
We're not advancing.
We're not rushing into this.
We're taking strategic positions.
Israeli forces
say they've destroyed
130 Hamas tunnels,
shafts like this one
since launching their ground offensive.
We're just scratching
the surface of that.
But many more still remain.
German Dymond joins us now.
What's the latest on evacuation
options for civilians in Gaza?
Well, Anderson, in recent days, tens
of thousands of Palestinian
civilians have use those evacuation
corridors established
by the Israeli military
over the last several days to flee south.
In fact, just today,
according to the United Nations.
50,000 people took advantage
of a five hour window
to evacuate
south using Salahadin Road,
one of the main arteries
going north south in the Gaza Strip.
And all of this, Anderson, comes
not only as the Israeli
military is ramping up
its military operations in northern Gaza,
but also,
of course, as the humanitarian situation
there has grown worse.
Access to clean water
is extremely limited.
Hospitals are running
out of medical supplies,
running out of fuel
to carry out even basic
operational matters.
And Israeli officials are,
of course,
ramping up their ground
offensive in northern Gaza.
Israeli officials
now saying that Israeli
troops are operating
in the heart of Gaza City,
pressing forward with this advance
as the Israeli prime minister vows
no cease fire
unless hostages are released Anderson.
Jeremy Diamond, thanks so much.
Many Palestinian Americans
who made it out of Gaza
are just now getting home,
facing a very particular heartache.
The relief obviously, to be safe,
but worried every moment
about their friends and family
who are not.
My next guests are Americans who,
along with their almost two year
old son, were in Gaza on October seven,
visiting family.
They just got back to their home,
Massachusetts, rather.
Earlier this week,
Abood Okal and Wafaa
Abouzeid to join us now.
Welcome home.
First of all, how do you feel?
Are you exhausted?
We feel
I had a mixed feeling, to be honest.
I feel I'm happy because we're safe here.
We're back.
But our
thinking
minds
in Gaza,
because I still have my parents
over there, Abu Experience.
I'm still over there.
We take them every every minute
to make sure they're okay.
We made it here just because of Yousef.
I want to make sure he's. He's okay.
He is of his. Your.
Your baby. Yousef is my baby. He's.
He's going to turn two years next.
Next month.
You got home in time for his birthday?
Yeah. Yeah.
What was.
You had gone there both to visit family,
and you had spent
a couple of weeks there.
Obviously, you had no idea
this all was about to happen.
When did you realize?
Was it on the morning of October 7th
that you realized something has happened?
Exactly. Yeah.
I think that October 7th, we
it was 6:00 in the morning local time.
And I think I remember hearing
sounds of rockets launching.
And I woke up
Wafa and I said, I think that is
the sound of rockets.
And we checked out the windows
and indeed it was.
And then a few minutes later,
we were trying to look at news and
and then it was unclear at the beginning.
But then in a couple of hours
as news rolled out of of
what was happening that day,
we realized that we are we are in trouble
and that this is this is a
this is going to be a big event.
What was that going south?
Was it difficult?
And once you actually got together
and headed down there, it was chaotic.
I think
early that day
when we heard the announcement
by the IDF to head south,
there was no timeline given.
There were no specific instructions
other than just go to South of Wadi Reza,
which is basically Gaza
Valley, a landmark.
So everyone scrambled at this point.
I mean, did
you think the border might still be open?
Because I
mean, there was so much misinformation,
so much
I mean, people
didn't know what was going on,
but that Rafah border
has been shut this whole time.
So did you think you could
get out at that point or just thought,
get south and we'll figure it out?
Yeah, we tried a couple of times
going to Rafah border,
but every time we wait
for a couple of hours
and the gate, it's not opening,
so I'll leave.
And you were
you were a house
staying with dozens of other people.
Yeah. 40 people.
40 people. 40 people.
Yeah.
We used to share everything
with 40 people
and getting supplies and things.
What was that like?
It was so difficult.
It was.
You had a Your baby needs milk.
Oh, yeah.
Even that is even that.
Yeah. We.
We used to wake up every morning
thinking about, like, how
we're going to get water, bread, food
a boy would use to go with his brother,
waiting on the line, getting water and
and bread and come back
after seven, 6 hours
with one gallon of water for 40 people
and then like pieces of bread,
it's not enough for 40 people.
So we used to share
with what with the child's.
I mean, I think about it.
I mean, obviously all those kids,
which was he was really scared.
I mean,
what was his sense of what was going on?
I don't myself, I have to be
relaxed
when I when I hear all the sounds.
So I started to teach him, okay,
this is what you hear.
This is a fireworks.
Remember the 4th of July?
It's the same thing.
I don't
know if I don't think he trusted me.
I don't think he believed
that this is a fireworks.
And there's some point.
The middle ground.
At some point.
The milk did run out. Yeah.
Yeah.
The we are now in the beginning
because I knew it's
we're going to run out at some point.
So I started to reduce has his bottle
like from
pole model to half bottle giving him.
So the last five days or a week
so we run completely out of milk.
I used to give him water instead of milk.
It's got to be this
strange feeling of being relieved
that you're out.
And yet
your family's there.
We're still processing
what we experienced.
I can't believe.
I can't believe our short trip
just turned to the nightmare.
And even though we're physically out,
I think mentally we're still there.
I think at some points
it cannot be a worse
to be on the outside.
Nothing is worse
than being inside of Gaza right now.
Whether if you're not dying
from from the airstrikes
or shelling, you're you're
you're at higher risk of dying
because of dehydrate and lack of food.
And and
despite that little aid that's coming
in, it's it's not really making.
It's not moving the needle.
Well, thank you so much.
I'm so glad your your your back. And I'm.
But I understand that
that tug
and that feel of family left behind.
I'm sorry that.
That you have that.
Thanks for having us. Yeah, Thank you.
Thank you, Anderson.",20231110

closer look at military
operations in gaza.
We reported under an escort at
all times.
At a condition, media outlets
must submit footage filmed in
gaza to the military for review.
CNN did not submit its script to
the idf and had editorial
control over the final report.
Let's bring in Oren Liebermann.
Tell us what you saw.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: Wolf, first, it's
nearly impossible to get into
gaza, so the chance to see what
was happening was given to us by
the idf who took us in with a
tank about a mile in.
Not only the progress they say
they're making, but the
challenges they face in a war
that's very much hot.
Through the breach, we entered
northern gaza at the border
crossing.
The land once fertile farmland
is baron.
The trees that might have
provided enemy cover is
destroyed the in the distance,
smoke from an Israeli air strike
is a stark reminder these day 34
of a war that may stretch much
longer.
On Thursday, the idf chief of
staff and head of internal
security service entered gaza
and promised strength through
coop.
Cooperation everyone is doing
Everly just so you can be as
strong as possible, the general
said.
Along our path, the signs of
civilian life have given to the
constant hum of drones.
Our time at the coordination
base for the border cross, first
international media to visit the
site, the terror attack was hit hard here, the scars of machine
gun fire and rpgs still visible.
The base was mostly empty on the
holiday, but not entirely.
Nine soldiers were killed here,
and three kidnapped.
It took 12 hours for Israel to
gain control of the base.
A Monday into the war, more than
10,000 Palestinians have been
killed in Israeli attacks on
gaza, according to
hamas-controlled health ministry
there.
The idf says 35 soldiers have
been killed in the strip since
the start of the incursion.
The October 7th attack killed
more than 1400 people, mostly
civilians.
We stop at an overlook near the
town of jabaliya.
There's a meeting point of three
different tunnels.
That's one, two, three.
They came together here and it
let hamas move underground
quickly below the feet and out
of sight.
Colonel tal says there were many
explosive, many trencheses we
found a storage site with many
explosives.
Even from a distance, the scale
of destruction is stunning.
Homes, neighborhoods decimated.
Colonel tal says the area is
nearly evacuated.
We see sometimes terrorists, but
the majority of civilians
haven't been here for a while.
As we talk, we hear rocket fire
and see the trails of the
launches triggering red alerts.
About 90 minutes inside northern
gaza, we hug the border wall for
safety.
Even here so close to the exit,
we stop briefly to make sure the
way ahead is safe.
In the distance once again, the
smoke from another strike.
The idf spokesperson said the
ground operation in gaza will
only deepen as Israel has said
it's largely encircled the city,
and wolf, I also spoke with the
commander about the humanitarian
corridor we talked about so much
earlier today.
He said they're aware of the
humanitarian corridor.
He knows when it is and where it
is.
Even in the middle of the war,
he knows you don't shoot in that
direction, even as the war wages
around them in other parts.
&gt;&gt; Oren, thanks for that report.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Joining me now to discuss
all the news out of the middle
East, the national security
council coordinator for
strategic communication, retired
admiral John Kirby.
Thanks for joining us.
First, I said to get to the
daily four-hour pauses now being
reported in northern gaza to
allow civilians to flee south.
How will the pauses work?
And have the Israelis fully
committed to them?
&gt;&gt; They have fully committed to
them.
The way it would work, about
three hours before the pauses
will begin, the Israelis will
notify, through a variety of
means, civilization, the pause
will start, here is when, and
advice on the safest passage
out.
They have added a second safe
passage corridor, humanitarian
corridor, they call it, out of
northern gaza along the coast
road.
That's one more than they had
before, in just the last few
days.
This is a step in the right
direction.
This could help reduivil
usage casualties by giving
people the confidence and time
to move out of harm's way.
&gt;&gt; John, is there really
anywhere in gaza that's safe for
Palestinian civilians?
We're told almost half of them
are children.
&gt;&gt; Well, hamas is placing those
children and those families in
harm's way by tunnelling under
their apartment complexes, using
their hospitals and schools as
command bunkers.
They place them directly in
harm's way between the idf and
hamas.
These safe corridors, and they
pauses, this breathing space in
time for people to get out
should help alleviate some of
the anxiety and the worry that",20231110

IS REALLY A PROFOUND LOSS FOR
YOUR FAMILY. WE WERE JUST
SPEAKING, 11 OF THE 17 MEMBERS,
BASICALLY LOST IN ONE INSTANCE.
TELL US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THEY WERE LOST BUT
THEY WERE SPECIFICALLY KILLED.
A BOMB DROPPED ON THEM.
IT WAS IRONIC BECAUSE MY
COUSIN, ABDULLA, WHO LIVES
THERE, SAID IT SAFER WHERE I AM.
THEY WERE BOMBED, NINE OF THEM
WERE KILLED THERE.
THE TWO SURVIVORS WERE MY UNCLE
AND MY COUSIN.
SHE SURVIVED ONLY FOR A FEW
DAYS GOING THROUGH SURGERY
WITHOUT ANESTHESIA, BUT CUT
DIRECTLY INTO YOU, IN THE

MY UNCLE SURVIVED FOR 10 DAYS
BUT HE EVENTUALLY SUCCUMBED TO
HIS WOUNDS.

SBtJMBIG-n4,See what Trump said about US involvement in Israel-Hamas war,data/en_CNN\See what Trump said about US involvement in Israel-Hamas war.jpg,"Former President Donald Trump now
suggesting the U.S.
should take a hands off
approach to the Israel-Hamas war.
Here's what he said
during an interview
with Univision on Thursday
when asked how America might help
stop the civilian killings in Gaza
So you have a war that's going on
and you're
probably going
to have to let this play out.
You're probably going
to have to let it play out
because a lot of people are dying.
There is no hatred like
the Palestinian hatred of Israel
and Jewish people.
And probably the other way around also
I don't know.
You know,
it's not as obvious,
but probably that's it.
All right.
Let's bring in CNN's Max Foster,
who is live from London.
Max, always wonderful. To see you.
Trump also said
Israel needed
to do a better job of public relations,
and he pointed to this rash
of pro-Palestinian protests in the U.S.
and obviously earlier in all of this.
He went after Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for not being prepared.
What what is your sense of
what's going on here?
Well, I think that clip, you know,
if you move away from a lot of,
you know, how he says it
and you know
specifically what he's saying
and what he means,
which is what I try to do
with Donald Trump
when it comes to international policy,
at least it's pretty significant.
What he's effectively saying is,
you know,
he doesn't
see if we look back
at his previous tenure as well
and how he played that out
and what he's saying here
about this Middle East crisis,
it's like
he doesn't see America
as that international policeman,
which actually the rest of the world
has relied on
for decades and decades and decades.
So focusing more on American problems
which a lot of Americans will relate to.
But outside America,
that does have a huge impact
because you and I
are talking a lot
about this
new world order
that China and Russia want to create
America pulling back
for the international stage
and saying they're not going
to get involved in like crises like
the Middle East does create a vacuum.
And you know
who's going to step into that?
So it has huge repercussions.
That little soundbite for me when I
when I look at it
and if he does get into power,
are we going to see
America less president
on the international stage?
So certainly militarily, it seems.
Yeah, honestly,
it's really, really interesting.
You know,
I'm thinking about
how Vladimir Putin
is backing off
of Israeli
support for Israel
that he previously had in the context
of this.
And Trump does
have a way of picking up on things
that are going on in the electorate
and really putting his finger on things
as uncomfortable of a reality is
that might be
he does have a really strong nose for it.
And it's interesting to me
that this is what he's picking up.
Let's also, Max, talk about Nikki Haley,
because in the Republican primary debate,
she did seem to gain more ground there.
She's sort of
becoming the person who is first
in the race for second place
But she did make this statement
about Vivek Ramaswamy on the stage
because the two of them really tangled.
Take a look at what she said.
I am telling you, Putin and President
Xi are salivating
at the thought that someone like that
could become president.
They would love to come back to the mat.
What's your your take away from there?
I mean, what
what does the international community
think, if anything?
I mean,
are these two known
on the national stage?
What's what's the impression?
Well, you know,
people know about international policy,
certainly know about Nikki Haley.
She is this sort of towering figure.
She's got a lot of experience
and certainly stands out in that sense
from the
in the line up
with all the other candidates.
But if you're not into
international policy,
I don't think you would
necessarily know who she is.
People aren't watching these debates
in big numbers at all here
because Donald Trump isn't involved
and they wonder why
they're taking place, that they're not
learning about her there.
I think you really need to be
looking at running a swarm
if you're talking about
international profile
because he is a big deal and tick tock.
My kids will show me
tick tock with him in them.
Very serious
and they never show me
tick tock from Nikki Haley.
And let me just say that,
I mean, in terms of profile,
I would say he's
the only person my kids and their friends
to pick out in that entire lineup.
Apart from Trump.
That is wild and extremely,
extremely interesting.
You know,
the fake one after Nikki Haley's daughter
over tick tock.
So the fact that
people overseas know him
for being on tick tock.
Okay.
Well, it's not necessarily his
own profile.
I mean, it is that as well.
It's also people just picking up
clips from the debates
and they're always about him
and they're the ones that go
viral over here.
I guess that is kind of the
what he set out to accomplish.
All right.
Max Foster,
thank you as always, my friend.
Have a great weekend.",20231110

joins us now from Tel Aviv.
Colonel, thanks very much.
I want to ask you about
what's taking place right now
with the Al-Shifa Hospital
What can you tell us about
what's being done to make sure
some of these innocent
civilians can get out of there,
the babies that have been talked
and so on?
What is going on there
with this hospital?
What can you share?
Hi, Jim.
Thank you for having me.
We are on day 36 of the war
and 239
Israeli hostages are still
being held in Gaza.
Regarding the hospital,
we are in contact with local aut
in Gaza with the manager and oth
and assisting them
and then informing them
where they can go in order
to evacuate from the area.
And we are also trying to coordi
the safe removal and transport
of the remaining patients
that are still inside the hospit
I want to emphasize,
we haven't struck the hospital
and we are not
surrounding it or
applying any pressure on it.
We have troops in the vicinity,
but we have not been engaging
with the hospital or any parts o
And so I guess
maybe you can help us clear this
Why is it that the health minist
claims that the hospital
is completely surrounded?
We've also heard from a spokespe
from the Israeli military,
I guess
one of your counterparts
at a wing of that
hospital is still open
for people to safely evacuate.
Help us sort that out.
What's going on?
Yeah, indeed.
That is what we've told
the Palestinians
as well, that the Eastern wing i
and that all of the people that
there, the displaced persons
that have been seeking shelter,
as well as others
who are in the compound, can mov
And we have instructed them,
even by the names of streets
and locations where they should
When we will do
the next humanitarian window.
As you know, we've been doing th
for the last five days
in various locations in the Gaza
where we've been stopping our fi
calling Palestinians
and telling them to evacuate.
The main road is
Salahadin, the main
thoroughfare of the Gaza Strip,
but then also Al-Rashid Street,
the coastal road.
We've opened that up as well
during select hours of the day,
hours,
which allows Palestinians to mov
and to go to relative safety
in the south.
Again, under our commitment
not to strike civilians
and out of respect
for the sanctity of human life,
which is much more than
what Hamas is doing at this time
And so what can you tell us
about these reports
that we're seeing about tanks
surrounding the hospital?
Is that happening?
And are you conducting an operat
in that area?
I know you said in the past,
Colonel, that you don't target h
and that sort of thing.
But you've also said
and others have said
with the IDF
that sometimes
the hospitals
and these kinds of civilian faci
are used by Hamas for their oper
And so is there an operation?
Is there an IDF operation
going on in that area to find th
and around that facility, that h
Yeah, our troops are definitely
We have
troops that have approached
that area from various locations
We have to understand that
the viewers
who may not have been following
are just joining
that the Shifa
compound is indeed in hospital,
but underneath are layers
and layers of Hamas military act
that they have established
underneath the hospital
whereby they are using the hospi
for military needs, which is a w
It's against the Geneva Conventi
They are endangering the protect
of the hospital by doing so.
And what we have done,
first and foremost,
is to inform the Palestinians
and also the world that we know
that Hamas is using the hospital
for military purposes.
We know that it is
full of Hamas combatants
that are seeking shelter
and trying to hide away from our
underneath the hospital.
That is also one of the reasons
why we are trying to evacuate it
because we don't want Hamas
to continue to use these people
human shields in the future.
I mean, that sounds like
a very difficult
and complicated operation
that you're trying to undertake.
Then
what happens to the hospital
at the end of all of this is doe
the IDF seek to control it, take
I mean, if you have to get at Ha
terrorists who are hiding inside
tunnels underneath the hospital,
one would think
at some point
you have to take over the hospit
or take over the area
around that hospital.
Is that something that you're
seeking to do?
Well, I agree with you totally t
it is a very complex situation
and one that we would rather
not find ourselves in.
But ever since October
the seventh,
we are in this situation
where we have to fight inside Ga
and we have to strike Hamas
wherever there are hiding
underneath civilians in the tunn
and also underneath hospitals.
And our aim is to dismantle all
military infrastructure
and Hamas has embedded
a significant portion
of their military capability,
specifically under Shifa.
And it is our aim to dismantle
all of their military capabiliti
I cannot go into further details
about what, when and where will
I can say that it would be best
for everybody involved,
including those
who will need the hospital
the day after the war, for Hamas
to come out of their hiding
and stop abusing
civilian infrastructure
for military purposes.
If they don't, of course,
we will have to respond accordin
implement our military plans.
And Colonel, I'm sure you saw th
that the secretary of state,
Tony Blinken,
of course, he's
a part of the Biden administrati
and they've been very supportive
of the Israeli
government, of the IDF
throughout all of this.
But the secretary of state did s
in the last day
or so that there have been too m
Palestinians killed in the
Israeli operation in Gaza.
What's the response to that?
Well, I agree that there are man
that have been killed,
and I am
sad about civilians
that have nothing to do with fig
who are killed
or wounded or displaced by fight
That is not our goal.
And I think that the Israeli gov
and the military
has been very
clear and forthcoming
that we are not fighting
against the civilians.
We try to do everything
we can
to get them out of the battlefie
so that we can focus on fighting
And I think that the government
and the military
and we are talking,
you know, at the military level,
we are communicating
with our military counterparts.
We're not only telling them
what we're doing,
we're showing them what we are d
and what Hamas is doing, their v
and how they are using the civil
as human shields.
And we are showing what we are d
the measures that we are impleme
in order to minimize the damage
to civilians.
I definitely hope that, you know
these numbers can come down
and what we are
achieving is basically
we're emptying
northern Gaza of civilians tempo
Exactly.
In order to minimize and lower
the amount of civilian casualtie
that is our aim,
because we seek that operational
to be able to go after Hamas.
And Hamas is under pressure.
You know, they're under pressure
They're indicating
that they're under pressure.
There have been reports of them
shooting at evacuees
and all
kinds of efforts by Hamas
to stop evacuations in various l
We understand
that they're under pressure
because they want
these civilian casualties
occurring to that point
because of the difficulty
and dealing with
these humanitarian pauses
and opening them up
and opening up these corridors a
The president of the United Stat
President Biden, did say in
just the last couple of days
that he thinks that
these pauses need to be longer.
Are you open to that longer paus
Yeah.
You know, already on the ground,
these pauses,
they have an effect on our comba
rhythm and the ability
to conduct our missions
because you know,
when you apply pressure on your
you want that pressure to be rel

Also responding to those request
and statements made by the presi

It started with 4 hours
and now it's five.
Maybe it will be expanded more.
We added another round. Right.
It was only the central route.
And now
we've opened up
a northern route
as well along the coast,
Al-Rasheed Street,
in addition to Salahadin.
So we are definitely listening.
We're definitely
trying to find good ways
of evacuating civilians
to minimize the effect on them
while still doing what we need t
And this is important.
We're not in Gaza
for the or the amusement of it.
We are there
because we are fighting Hamas.

And I understand that.
And but you brought up hostages.
One of the items that has been d
in all of this is
and you're
probably aware of this,
there are multiple parties
involved in these kinds of talks
that the longer
the humanitarian pause is potent
that could lead
to the release of hostages.
There have been negotiations
going on to that end.
Are you open to that

not entirely sure
that that
is the correct working assumptio

dBaQhSrsDYI,Netanyahu shares 3 things to understand about the war,data/en_CNN\Netanyahu shares 3 things to understand about the war.jpg,"Let's start with what's happening at that&nbsp;
hospital. Israeli forces have said that they&nbsp;&nbsp;
are engaged in intense fighting around Al shifa&nbsp;
hospital, the largest medical facility in gaza.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know you say that the hospital sits on top&nbsp;
of a hamas command and control center. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;
of course, there are also patients, civilians&nbsp;
sheltering in that complex getting treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
How do you intend to go after hamas without&nbsp;
putting sick and injured civilians in that&nbsp;&nbsp;
hospital at more risk than they already are?
&gt;&gt; We've called to evacuate all the patients&nbsp;&nbsp;
from that hospital. In fact, 100 or so&nbsp;
have already been evacuated. I've called&nbsp;&nbsp;
for hospitals, and the French president&nbsp;
has sent a floating hospital ship. I've&nbsp;&nbsp;
asked emirates to send a field hospital.&nbsp;
They have. Other countries have done the&nbsp;&nbsp;
same. There's no reason why we just&nbsp;
can't take the patients out of there&nbsp;&nbsp;
instead of letting hamas use it as a command&nbsp;
center for terrorism with the rockets they
[9:03:40 AM]
terrorism with the rockets they fire against&nbsp;
Israel, for the terror tunnels they use to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;
Israeli civilians. Remember, Dana, let's keep&nbsp;
this in focus. Just imagine what would happen&nbsp;&nbsp;
if the United States were attacked viciously&nbsp;
by 20 9/11s, that's the proportion number,&nbsp;&nbsp;
50,000 Americans killed, 10,000 Americans&nbsp;
held hostage including babies, elderly, women,&nbsp;&nbsp;
children, 10,000 rockets falling on your cities.&nbsp;
That's the number of rockets that are falling all&nbsp;&nbsp;
the time on our cities, may fall during this&nbsp;
interview, as a matter of fact, and I'll have&nbsp;&nbsp;
to go to a shelter. What would America do? It&nbsp;
would take all its force and go after these&nbsp;&nbsp;
killers. What if these killers embed themselves&nbsp;
in hospitals, schools, U.N. Facilities? You'd do&nbsp;&nbsp;
everything in your power to get the civilians&nbsp;
out, which is what we're doing. We call them&nbsp;&nbsp;
to leave. You certainly wouldn't give immunity&nbsp;
top the terrorists. We're obviously treading&nbsp;&nbsp;
carefully when it comes to hospitals, but we're&nbsp;
also not going to give immunity to the terrorists.
[9:04:41 AM]
terrorists. So far, even though hamas has&nbsp;
tried to prevent the civilians from leaving,&nbsp;&nbsp;
hundreds of thousands have left, sometimes&nbsp;
having to go through hamas gun points and&nbsp;&nbsp;
gunfire and wants to keep them in harm's way.
&gt;&gt; Just to be clear, sir, Israel will aid,&nbsp;&nbsp;
help these civilians who are quite sick&nbsp;
and inside these hospitals come out,&nbsp;&nbsp;
not just in Al shifa, but there are&nbsp;&nbsp;
other hospitals where this is happening?
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, we're telling them to leave.&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; Telling them or helping them?
&gt;&gt; Helping them by creating safe&nbsp;&nbsp;
corridors. We have designated routes to a safe&nbsp;
zone south of gaza city where there's no fighting,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and we're telling them, go ahead, move. By&nbsp;
the way, 70,000 have moved. Three days ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think 50,000 moved yesterday. More will move&nbsp;
today. We want all the civilians to be moved&nbsp;&nbsp;
out of harm's way. Hamas is doing everything in&nbsp;
their power to keep them in harm's way. Go ahead.&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; Do you believe there are&nbsp;
hostages below that hospital,
[9:05:41 AM]
hostages below that hospital,&nbsp;
Israeli or American hostages?&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; I'm not going to go into the intelligence&nbsp;
picture we have, but you know there's been&nbsp;&nbsp;
this vicious thing -- they take hostages --&nbsp;
imagine a baby is held hostage. Who takes a&nbsp;&nbsp;
baby hostage? I don't know if you have children,&nbsp;
Dana, I'm sure your camera crew has, we all have&nbsp;&nbsp;
children. What is this taking children hostage?&nbsp;
Threatening to kill them. This is savagery of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the highest order. We're doing everything in our&nbsp;
power to achieve two things. One, destroy hamas&nbsp;&nbsp;
because without it, none of us have a future.&nbsp;
It's not only our war. It's your war, too,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the battle of civilization against barberism. It&nbsp;
will pass to other places. Middle East will fall,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Europe is next, you'll be next. The first goal is&nbsp;
to destroy hamas and the second goal is to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;
back our hostages. We're trying to do both.
&gt;&gt; Those are completely understandable goals,&nbsp;&nbsp;
goals that
[9:06:41 AM]
understandable goals, goals that the United&nbsp;
States very much supports, understanding that&nbsp;&nbsp;
hamas is a barbaric terrorist organization.&nbsp;
Israel is not hamas, and the United States&nbsp;&nbsp;
also makes very clear that democracies have to&nbsp;
do better. The secretary of state, Tony blinken,&nbsp;&nbsp;
said that far too many Palestinian civilians&nbsp;
have been killed. What is your response to that?&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; I think any civilian loss is a tragedy and&nbsp;
the blame should be placed squarely on hamas&nbsp;&nbsp;
because it prevents them from leaving the&nbsp;
war zone, sometimes at gunpoint. It's fired&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the safe zone and the safe corridor that we&nbsp;
enacted. The other day to prevent Palestinians&nbsp;&nbsp;
from leaving harm's way, it puts rockets inside&nbsp;
the schools, hospitals. It has tunnels below&nbsp;&nbsp;
children's beds. That's what we're dealing with.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, but because Israel isn't hamas,&nbsp;&nbsp;
is Israel doing everything possible to take that&nbsp;
into consideration? &gt;&gt; Yes, Dana, more than that.
[9:07:43 AM]
&gt;&gt; Yes, Dana, more than that. And more than that.&nbsp;
We're trying to minimize civilian casualties as&nbsp;&nbsp;
a result of our ground action, I think the number&nbsp;
of civilian carpalities is actually being reduced&nbsp;&nbsp;
because people are heeding our calls to leave&nbsp;
the area and defying hamas' attempt to keep them&nbsp;&nbsp;
there, and we'll do everything in our power to&nbsp;
do that. The one example I can give you is this.&nbsp;&nbsp;
These savages, they perpetrated the worst horrors&nbsp;
on Jews since the holocaust. The German chancellor&nbsp;&nbsp;
Schultz called them the new Nazis. Look at the&nbsp;
old Nazis. The allies were attacked by hitler so&nbsp;&nbsp;
they invaded France and then Germany. When they&nbsp;
did that, they went into the cities. They had to&nbsp;&nbsp;
fight the German army that was often embedded&nbsp;
in the cities, in civilian neighborhoods. Many&nbsp;&nbsp;
civilians were killed. Who is the blame laid onto?&nbsp;
Did they say the Nazis -- the allies are wrong,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the allies should stop fighting? They said,&nbsp;
look, use forces as judiciously as you can, but
[9:08:44 AM]
judiciously as you can, but don't give the&nbsp;
Nazis any refuge, don't feed the Nazis.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which is what we're doing, using force in&nbsp;
the most judicious way, we have to defeat&nbsp;&nbsp;
these new Nazis, for our sake, your sake, too.
&gt;&gt; I want to ask about the hostages. Thousands&nbsp;&nbsp;
of families rallied this weekend right across the&nbsp;
street from where you are right now. They're very&nbsp;&nbsp;
frustrated they're not getting more information&nbsp;
from you on where their loved ones are,&nbsp;&nbsp;
believe your government is not doing enough&nbsp;
to get them back. What do you say to them?&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; It's understandable. They're under tremendous&nbsp;
distress, they're under torture. You can imagine&nbsp;&nbsp;
you have your father, your husband, your&nbsp;
son, your daughter taken by these savages --&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; Are you doing enough?
&gt;&gt; We're doing everything we&nbsp;&nbsp;
can around the clock, and I can't talk about it.&nbsp;
I personally met with hostage families -- families&nbsp;&nbsp;
of hostages several times. It tears your&nbsp;
heart out. Yes, we're doing everything and
[9:09:46 AM]
Yes, we're doing everything and&nbsp;
many things that I can't say here,&nbsp;&nbsp;
obviously. But this is one of our two&nbsp;
war goals. One is to destroy hamas,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the second is to bring back our hostages.&nbsp;
We'll do everything we can. We think the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;
world should join us. Demand from the red&nbsp;
cross that it demand vips its to the hostages,&nbsp;&nbsp;
demand unconditional release of the hostages, say&nbsp;
this is barbarism that is unacceptable. I'd like&nbsp;&nbsp;
to see the U.N., the U.N. Secretary-general who&nbsp;
basically laid the blame on Israel, lay the blame&nbsp;&nbsp;
on these savages. Israel is fighting according&nbsp;
to international law. The Israeli army is doing&nbsp;&nbsp;
an exemplarily job trying to minimize civilian&nbsp;
casualties and maximize terrorist casualties.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We theed the international community not to give&nbsp;
support and moral support and legitimacy to sheer&nbsp;&nbsp;
evil that hamas represents. Support Israel.&nbsp;
Attack hamas. &gt;&gt; Prime minister Netanyahu, one
[9:10:47 AM]
&gt;&gt; Prime minister Netanyahu, one of the questions&nbsp;
right now is, when it comes to hostages,&nbsp;&nbsp;
is whether there can be a negotiation that works&nbsp;
towards a deal to free large groups of hostages&nbsp;&nbsp;
in exchange for ap sustained days' long pause in&nbsp;
fighting. Is that acceptable to you? If so, how&nbsp;&nbsp;
long of a pause would Israel be willing to allow?
&gt;&gt; I said we're going to pursue the battle to&nbsp;&nbsp;
destroy hamas to its end. But I also said the&nbsp;
only cease-fire that we would consider is one in&nbsp;&nbsp;
which we have our hostages released. That remains&nbsp;
true. It doesn't mean we can't give humanitarian&nbsp;&nbsp;
pause for a few hours in a place, a specific time&nbsp;
and place where we want to have a humanitarian&nbsp;&nbsp;
corridor and have the people leave safely. We've&nbsp;
done that, and hundreds of thousands have left&nbsp;&nbsp;
the fighting zone in that fashion.
&gt;&gt; How long of a pause would you&nbsp;&nbsp;
be willing to support?
&gt;&gt; So far we've dealt&nbsp;&nbsp;
with a few hours. If you're&nbsp;
talking about a cease-fire --
[9:11:48 AM]
cease-fire --
&gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a&nbsp;&nbsp;
cease-fire. A longer pause, days, for example.
&gt;&gt; That's not a pause. If you're talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;
stopping the fighting, that's exactly what hamas&nbsp;
wants. Hamas wants an end Ms series of pauses&nbsp;&nbsp;
that basically dissipate -- like the Germans after&nbsp;
normandy. Okay, let's have a cease-fire. Hold off,&nbsp;&nbsp;
let us replenish our supplies, get out of&nbsp;
our terror tunnels, let us rearm ourselves&nbsp;&nbsp;
and so on. Obviously we're not going to&nbsp;
do that. In order to have a cease-fire of&nbsp;&nbsp;
any -- a cease-fire in the entire area, that&nbsp;
will require the release of our hostages.&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; The U.S. Says you need an extended&nbsp;
pause in order to get the hostages out.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do you not believe that as well?
&gt;&gt; We don't -- we don't disagree&nbsp;&nbsp;
with that, we need to get our hostages out.
&gt;&gt; The U.S. Also says any postwar plan for&nbsp;&nbsp;
gaza must include palestinian-led&nbsp;
governance and gaza unified with
[9:12:49 AM]
governance and gaza unified with the west bank&nbsp;
under the Palestinian authority. You appeared&nbsp;&nbsp;
to reject that yesterday. You said Israel will&nbsp;
not accept a, quote, civilian authority there&nbsp;&nbsp;
that educates its children to hate Israel.&nbsp;
I want to be clear. Are you saying Israel&nbsp;&nbsp;
would not accept giving control of gaza over&nbsp;
to the Palestinian authority after the war?&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; The first thing we have to do is destroy hamas,&nbsp;
because otherwise they'll do it again and again&nbsp;&nbsp;
and again and they've said so. We'll destroy&nbsp;
hamas. The second thing we have to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;
is there has to be an overriding and overreaching&nbsp;
Israeli military envelope. We've seen, any place&nbsp;&nbsp;
we leave, we exit, give it to some other force,&nbsp;
very soon terrorism resurfaces. The third thing we&nbsp;&nbsp;
have to understand is a civilian authority has to&nbsp;
cooperate on two comboels, one is to demilitarize&nbsp;&nbsp;
gaza, the second is to -- the Palestinian&nbsp;
authority has unfortunately failed on both
[9:13:52 AM]
has unfortunately failed on both counts.&nbsp;
They don't demilitarize the west bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have to do it. We have to fight the&nbsp;
terrorists. They don't deradical lies,&nbsp;&nbsp;
teach children the hate red of Israel, they&nbsp;
pay for laefs, the more Jews they kill,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the more they pay. They refuse to this day,&nbsp;
36 days after this savagery, to condemn what&nbsp;&nbsp;
hamas did on October 7th.
&gt;&gt; If not the P.A. --&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; There has to be a reconstructed civilian&nbsp;
authority. There has to be something else.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Otherwise we're just falling into that same&nbsp;
rabbit hole. We're going to have the same&nbsp;&nbsp;
result. Remember the P.A. Was already in gaza.&nbsp;
When Israel left gaza, it handed the keys over&nbsp;&nbsp;
to P.A. Within a very short time hamas took&nbsp;
over, kicked them out. They're not willing to&nbsp;&nbsp;
fight hamas. They're still not willing to fight&nbsp;
hamas. You have to have some kind of authority,&nbsp;&nbsp;
civilian, Palestinian authority that&nbsp;
is willing to fight the terrorists and
[9:14:53 AM]
fight the terrorists and educating --&nbsp;
important LI must educate the children&nbsp;&nbsp;
for a fewer of peace, peace, cooperation,&nbsp;
prosperity. Cooperation with Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp;
not the annihilation of israelment so&nbsp;
far that hasn't happened. The burden of&nbsp;&nbsp;
proof is on the P.A. And they've failed every&nbsp;
single time. I say that regrettably. Honestly,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we have to be realistic about what we expect.&nbsp;
We can't fall back on formulas that failment&nbsp;&nbsp;
we have to succeed, to succeed to give gaza a&nbsp;
better future. Let's not bring it to a failed&nbsp;&nbsp;
past. Let's create a different reality there.
&gt;&gt; Prime minister Netanyahu, before I let you go,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know you've been asked this several times,&nbsp;
but I have had multiple people inside Israel&nbsp;&nbsp;
reach out to me knowing that I was going to&nbsp;
interview you and say the one thing they want&nbsp;&nbsp;
to hear from you is that you take personal&nbsp;
responsibility for failing to prevent the&nbsp;&nbsp;
October 7th attacks and protecting your people. I&nbsp;
know you say the time for that will come after the&nbsp;&nbsp;
war. Why won't you take responsibility now?
&gt;&gt; I've already addressed that many times.
[9:15:54 AM]
many times. And I said this whole&nbsp;
question will be addressed after the war.&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; Why not now?
&gt;&gt; Well, did people ask Franklin Roosevelt&nbsp;&nbsp;
after pearl harbor that question? Did people ask&nbsp;
George Bush after the surprise attack of November&nbsp;&nbsp;
11th? It's a yes that needs to be asked.
&gt;&gt; The question has been asked.&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; I've said the one thing that is important&nbsp;
-- I've said we're going to answer all these&nbsp;&nbsp;
questions including I'm going to be asked tough&nbsp;
questions. I think right now what we have to do&nbsp;&nbsp;
is unite the country for one purpose, one purpose&nbsp;
alone. That's to achieve victory. That's what&nbsp;&nbsp;
we did. We formed a unity government, the&nbsp;
country is June nighted as never before.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That's what we have to pursue. What the people&nbsp;
expect me to do right now is two things. One,&nbsp;&nbsp;
achieve the victory and bring the hostages back.&nbsp;
Second, make sure that gaza never becomes --&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; Israelis are disappointed that you&nbsp;
won't take responsibility, you said?&nbsp;
&gt;&gt; I said I'll answer all the&nbsp;
questions required, including
[9:16:55 AM]
questions required, including the questions of&nbsp;
responsibility. There will be enough time for",20231112

Israeli Prime

as far as solutions
for post
fighting, push
back on the idea
of the Palestinian Authority run
and said any solution,
we need to have an overriding

military envelope.
Do you agree

Do you still believe
humanitarian aid is a low priori
in comparison to
the Israeli military's needs?
I still believe that, yes.
I think if you're prioritizing
those things, Omar,
the most important thing
is for us to provide
financial assistance
and military
hardware to the Israelis
so they can
do what they need to do in Gaza
regarding the terrorists
who attacked them
and killed over 1200 of their ci
Now, no one likes civilian
deaths of anyone,
whether it's Israeli or Palestin
But let's remember this.
Two things.
First,
there was a cease fire
on October 6th, Omar,
and it was Hamas
that broke
that cease fire
with their attacks on October 7t
And secondly,
Israel has done
much to try to get Palestinians
from the area
where the battle
is going to be
to the southern part of Gaza.
It is Hamas
that is refusing
to let many of those people
go to the southern part of Gaza
because they want to use them
as human shields.
I believe that the that Hamas ca
about Palestinian civilian life
than Israel does.
And so,
you know,
Hamas has to take responsibility
for this.
They could be helping
their civilians significantly.
And we saw a report just today
that Israel said fuel
to run the Al-Shifa hospital
and that Hamas refused to accept
You can't
complain about not
being able to run the incubators
and the life
support systems at a hospital
and then turn down fuel
that's being sent by the Israeli
to be able to work
those those pieces of equipment.
So Hamas is the hypocrite here.
And that's why
I think
the top priority has to be aidin
so that we can put an end to thi
as quickly as possible.
And this this topic was posed to
Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu when he was on our air
a little bit earlier
today on the topic
of whether they've been doing en
to protect
some of the civilians
that have been killed
or at least minimize
the civilians that were killed.
Take a listen to what he told Da

life is tragic

But, Omar, we need to make sure
that Hamas cannot use these civi

to prevent them
from having their military

Watching it all, I do wonder.

I have strongly condemned
the attacks of October 7th

in any way
are blind to the reality that it has been
the principal opponent
of a two state solution

But the question to grapple

to Condoleezza Rice
being protested or disinvited.
Conservative state
legislator has introduced dozens of laws
to protect campus free speech.
In 2021,
House Republicans started a campus
free speech caucus
to protect
free expression and free association
in January 2021.
Florida Governor
Ron DeSantis said
the most important legislative issue
to get right
in the next
couple of years
was the protection
of controversial speech.
Not anymore.
Late last month,
DeSantis reversed course,
directing Florida State
University's chancellor
to close down
campus chapters of Students
for Justice and Palestine.
DeSantis accused the group
of giving material support to terrorism.
Though,
as far as I can tell,
these groups have only organized protests
and rallies,
as the GOP
presidential candidate
Vivek Ramaswamy has pointed out.
Courts have made clear
that verbal support for extremist groups
is very different
and constitutionally protected
from sending money, material or arms
Other conservatives have
tried to publicly identify
and shame students
belonging to groups
that voiced support for Hamas.
A hedge fund manager
proposed to circulate
lists of these students
to ensure that they don't get jobs.
Many donors have demanded
that universities
issue statements
either condemning Hamas
or supporting Israel
Some even insisting that certain rallies
and speakers be banned.
Many college
presidents issued follow up statements
when their original responses
were not seen as sufficiently strong
and said
their support of Israel
or denunciation of Hamas.
This is all a far cry
from where universities used to be
like that in 1967
in the midst of the passions
of the Vietnam War
and the civil rights movement.
A report by a University of Chicago
committee chaired
by the eminent legal scholar
Harry Calvin, eloquently argued that
the mission of the university
could not be fulfilled if the institution
formally took positions
on controversial
political issues of the day.
The committee wrote a university.
If it's to be true to its faith,
an intellectual inquiry
must embrace, be hospitable to
and encourage
the widest diversity of views
within its own community.
It is a community,
but only for the limited,
albeit great
purposes of teaching and research.
It is not a club.
It is not a trade association.
It is not a lobby.
Simply put,
the university is the home
and sponsor of critics.
It is not itself the critic.
The basic argument for free speech
espoused by the Calvin report
is that it is better to hear those
you violently disagree with
than to ban them or silence them.
That way, debate happens out in the open
points a match with counterpoints.
The alternative is to drive
discourse into the shadows
and gutters of political life
where it festers
turns into conspiracy theories
and often erupts into violence.
Growing up in India, I read
with wonder
about the United States's commitment
to freedom of speech,
which was so strong that in 1977
a court ruled that a group of Nazis
should be allowed to march
in Skokie, Illinois or Chicago.
Suburb.
In the 1970s,
the Harvard Crimson ran
editorials
praising Pol Pot's takeover in Cambodia.
I went to college in the early eighties,
an area
in which
it was not unusual
to hear incendiary views on campus
from communist
revolutionaries to the Nobel Prize
winning scientist William Shockley,
who made crude arguments
about the racial inferiority
of black people in this century.
I recall very few colleges
making official statements
about the Iraq war
or even the terrorist attacks of Nine 11.
We are now in a different world.
In recent years,
the pressure on universities
to take political positions has grown.
A turning point
might have been
the murder of George Floyd last night,
when many institutions decided
to demonstrate their sensitivity.
An issue statements.
Once they took a stand on one
political issue,
it is perfectly understandable
that they have been
also asked to condemn
Hamas's attack last month.
But where will it end?
A Pandora's box has been opened
with every major political event.
University administrators
will have to decide
whether to condemn or support it.
Will they find some standard
by which they can explain
why they denounced one terrorist attack
or human rights abuse, but not another
I'm not sure
what it
signifies that many of us
find the embrace
of free speech
outlined in the Calvin
report to be too cold in its neutrality.
We want our institutions to endorse
our own fashions and points of view.
But can they do that
in a diverse society?
In which people disagree
so strongly on so much?
I fear that
far from bringing us together,
the path we are on will drive us
further apart.",20231113

Robertson and
his crew got an up close view of the ash,
the bullets,
the trail of absolute destruction.
The rare inside look at how the IDF is
fighting comes
at a consequential moment in this war.
As the American president
says the strip's
main hospital must be protected
Now, Israel says the
very same facility houses
a Hamas command complex below it.
And CNN reported the story
that you're
about to see under Israeli Defense Force
Escort at all times.
But CNN did not submit its script
or its footage to the IDF.
And CNN retained editorial control
over the final report You'll see now
driving into Gaza
with the Israeli forces.
It's a war zone.
The conditions of our access
only show officers
no faces of soldiers
and don't show sensitive equipment.
We are passing mile
after mile of destruction
buildings blown, collapsed.
Nothing untouched by the fury of Israel's
hunt for Hamas streets here
crushed back to sand shops.
Everything that we see,
no sign of any civilians here.
And the soldiers have been telling us
that even inside the stores,
they've been fighting things
like rocket propelled grenades
ready to use against them
as they were advancing through this area.
Right here,
a few miles in,
we pull up at a command post.
Soldiers living in blown
apartment buildings.
Every building I'm looking at here,
wherever you turn,
it's destroyed and shut up.
Hard to imagine how civilians endured
the bombardment here.
Our next journey much deeper into Gaza.
We arrive a hundred meters from a battle
with Hamas.
Tanks blasting targets
and nearby buildings.
The IDF's top spokesperson
waiting for us.
We are now conducting an operation
inside Gaza next to Rantisi Hospital.
Israel is facing massive
international pressure
over the destruction of homes.
The shockingly high civilian death toll.
And in the last few days over
it's apparently heavy handed tactics
at hospitals.
We are working the tunnel.
The bulldozers rebuild
the tunnels
that we suspect
that underneath the hospital.
Gary has brought us here
to show the connection he says exists
between Hamas
and the Rantisi Children's Hospital.
We are now here
in an
area between a hospital, a school
and a terrace house.
A Hamas commander, he says, live there.
He points out
the solar panels on the roof.
This is a tunnel that was sliding
like this, the floor.
You can see here,
this is the ladder going down.
The ladder going down.
It's going down.
This is a 20 meter tunnel.
And Lucas here.
Look at that.
Look at the final pool here.
But look down here.
The cables are going down to the tunnel.
Okay.
So they're hard
wired into the water to show you
the solar panels on the terrace house,
provide electricity
directly to the tunnel.
We've run into the robot
inside the tunnel, and the robot
saw a massive door
a door
that is on the direction of the hospital.
We're in what is an active fire
zone here.
You can hear the small arms fire.
The IDF say that's
still clearing that area out.
We're getting down here
just taking a bit of cover
because they say
we're still taking classes.
But over here,
we were able to smell what smelled
like rotting flesh
that is perhaps
buried underneath the rubble.
No, no, don't go up like
that.
Expose yourself
as we move off to the hospital.
100 meters away.
We're still taking fire.
We're still conducting an operation.
Operation conducted by our special unit.
The Israeli Navy SEALs
are researching the hospitals.
Gary later tells us he took a big risk
bringing us into such a combat zone.
It is clear he wants this story told.
We're searching here
to see the connection of the tunnel
to the hospital.
Okay, don't. Don't fudge here.
I won't you where the connection?
We are looking for that connection
as we finally reached the hospital.
It is already getting dark.
A huge hole
has been blasted
through the walls into the basement.
Why is the hospital so damaged?
We'll talk about why he's asking us.
So the
let's this this.
We came to this hospital five days ago.
There were still patients
inside the hospital.
We did not enter into the hospital.
He claims since then,
all patients
were evacuated by hospital staff.
We assist this evacuation,
of course, to make it a safe place
for all the patients in the hospital.
We do not know that
the hospital is entirely clear.
We do not know.
We only entered to this area, which was
which was suspected
because we were being fired.
Gary leads us through a warren
of basement corridors to this room.
This was the armory.
Okay.
This was the Hamas armory.
He shows us a few rusting guns
and some explosives.
These guns alone have potentially huge
implications for Gaza's hospitals.
And Israel's
apparent push to take control of them.
The International Committee
for the Red Cross say
that hospitals are given
special protection
under international humanitarian law
in a time of war.
But if militants store weapons there
or use them as a base of fire.
Then that protection falls away.
In other rooms, he shows us a motorbike
with a bullet hole in it
that he suspects
was used by Hamas attackers October 7th
and nearby possible evidence.
Hostages could have been held here.
We are now in the basement
in the same area.
Yards from the motorcycle, we see a chair
we see a rope.
Here,
a woman's clothes or a woman's
something cover and a woman.
She think a
woman was tied up in this chair.
This is an assumption
going to be checked by DNA
for evidence, Hagar says.
Points towards Hamas
and possible
hostage presents
below the hospital
and by bringing us here to this hospital
and showing us the connection
that you believe
exists between the terrorists
and the possibly hostages.
What does this say
about the other hospitals here? In Gaza?
Cynically, Shifa
Hospital is no bisects by intelligence
to be a terrorist hub.
And also, it's
suspicious also in holding hostages.
This is the best shelter
for the terrible war machine of Hamas.
But the hospital authorities said
they have no knowledge of Hamas
or other groups inside the hospitals.
Is that possible?
I think that's not possible.
It's one hospital
to have this kind of an infrastructure.
We knew the terrorists were here.
We knew we knew by intelligence.
And also we got some fire
from this area, from this area,
from this area.
And we were ready to fire
because what we found an armory.
But so much damage all around here.
There is damage all around
here because Hamas
made it impossible for us to fight him.
He built all this infrastructure
in tunnels and in hospitals
around areas populated.
As we exit the hospital.
It is already dark,
but just getting ready to leave
right now.
The firefight
still going
on, still intense
bullets fired explosions
going on up the street there.
This war
and the controversies
surrounding it far from resolved.

about how valuable is the target
What is the risk of civilian los
and how much civilian loss is ac
And these are horrible
calculations that are
but these are calculations
that armies make during war

Sure.
And you're exactly right, Anders
About the way you cast it.
You know what the target is?
You know how valuable it is.
You try to estimate what the ris
are of hurting civilians
and then you have to make the ju
as to whether the target
going after the target,
taking out the target,
is worth the risk of injuring pe
who are innocent
and not part of the enemy force.
But here you're dealing with the
and control node of Hamas.
You're dealing with Hamas
that has deliberately,
cynically located
its most valuable assets
in a hospital
deliberately to try to provoke
outrage in the world
community and discredit Israel
Israelis know this.
They've got really great intel o
When those soldiers go in
in armored vehicles first
and then dismounted into the bui
and it is a very complex compoun
as you saw from the overhead cov
that helicopters
will have drones overhead.
They'll be able to mark
and many positions with lasers.
They'll be able to deliver preci
if there is an opponent there.
And then they've got to go insid
and if Hamas is there,
yes, there could be a shootout
in a hospital corridor
and they're going to have to
get to the bottom of it
and they're going to have to sea
for the tunnel entrances around
So every at every step,
the soldier on the ground,
the tank commander
and so forth is at risk.
He's putting himself out there.
He's likely to draw fire.
He has the right to self-defense
no matter what always.
And he's going to respond
if he is attacked.
But he's got a lot of assets
backing him up,
a lot of other eyes on the battl
So it's everything
that can possibly be done
to protect civilians
and still go after the command
and control at the hospital.
And the Israelis militarily,
they have to do this.
One of the things I'm surprised
there is not more outrage out
internationally about is that Ha
two years, say,
to preparing this attack or a ye
however long it was.
We don't know the exact amount o
that they've been preparing,
but certainly they've been prepa
for quite some time.
They have not made any effort
to build
any bomb shelter
for any civilian,
it seems, in the Gaza Strip.
They built tunnels for themselve
to store supplies and weapons
and to protect themselves.
But there are not bomb shelters
the kind of shelters that you se
on the sides of the road
in Israel
by bus stops to protect against
Those don't
exist on the streets of of Gaza.
Have you in your military experi
have you seen many countries
or territories
with a military that does not
prepare or have some sort of saf
harbor for its civilians?
Well, no, but on the other hand,
Hamas deliberately wants these c
to be at risk.
Well, that's I mean, that's the
Yes, but
but I still find it stunning tha
that doesn't seem to register wi
a lot of people.
Well,
the thing about it, Anderson, is
we call Hamas a terrorist orders
I suppose actually,
the government of the Gaza Strip
they're in charge of everything.
And they have had
received hundreds of millions of
from Qatar and other places
and they have not built
any bomb shelters for their peop
Right.
Because they're not interested
in protecting their people.
They're interested
in provoking
international outrage against Is
They knew that
when they launched this attack
and they hoped to draw Israel in
bog Israel down, cause
a lot of casualties,
do exactly what they're doing wi
opinion, have a lot of voices ou
saying cease fire, cease fire,
cease fire,
and try to stop the Israeli assa
and then declare victory.
That's that's the goal
and show the more civilian casua
that the Israelis inflict,
even though they don't
want to inflict any.
The greater
Hamas believes its chances of su
And, Nic,
I mean, it's accurate to say
that the health officials
in Gaza have denied repeatedly
that Al-Shifa Hospital or others
are being used by Hamas for any
I don't even want to call it
military purposes because,
I mean, for any of their own pur
they have.
And and it's something.
Health officials in Gaza,
Hamas run health officials say i
for other hospitals that
we've been speaking.
CNN has been speaking
with officials from the hospital
over the last few days.
And just going through
our latest information on that,
it appears the most recent over
couple of days, data
that we have
from the hospital itself,
from our Shifa Hospital
they say there are about 7000 ci
taking refuge there
or there were until recently.
It's not clear
how many of those
might have left and about 1500 s
100 or so doctors,
other medical officials
and included in that.
1500, of course, several hundred
as well as well as sort of suppo
in the hospital.
So it's still a big complex,
a complex, complex
and it still appears
a significant
number of people working there.
You would have to assume
that these health officials
would have knowledge
of the whole complex.
There's a lot of people
there would have knowledge
of the nooks and crannies, if yo
There wouldn't be places
that they wouldn't know about wi
within the hospital complex.
So they continue to say
Hamas isn't there.
But I mean, they're considering
about and about Israel.
Yeah.
I mean, anybody who has operated
who has reported from Gaza.
No, I mean, you see rockets bein
from civilian areas.
You see rockets being fired from
the building where you're at.
You're the building.
You know, the time
I was the last time I was in Gaz
I can see where rockets are bein

I mean, they obviously
nobody speaks out against Hamas
for fear of their own safety.
Maybe they agree with Hamas.
Maybe they don't.
And a lot of people don't in Gaz

You can see it
and this is
in a nutshell, people people, pe

Hamas has done this to me
the last time I was there.
And I why am I
the last time I was there,
I watched as the Hamas
two guys on motorbikes
dragged two human beings
along on the ground,
their legs tied together
with rope or chains to the motor
And they were dragging them
through the streets
as a warning to other people.
I don't know what those people
have been accused of,
but they were Palestinians
and they were dead.
And they were being dragged.
They were accused
probably of being collaborators.
And they dragged them
through the streets
as a warning to everybody else
to stay silent and to not collab
we're over time.

XMrnz6G1j1M,Conditions at Gaza hospital deteriorate amid Israel’s military operation,data/en_CNN\Conditions at Gaza hospital deteriorate amid Israel’s military operation.jpg,"Israel attempts
to justify
its raid of the al-Shifa hospital.
Conditions inside
the complex are growing
more dire by the day.
CNN's Dana Bash here has an update
on the humanitarian crisis
unfolding all across Gaza.
Right.
It's a scene
should be filled with innocents.
But these drawings, sketches of houses
paint a picture of all these children
have lost
hope for the displaced.
Now, makeshift shelters in central Gaza
live in limbo with nowhere to go
in the south as more children are buried.
Another warning,
leaflets dropped by the Israeli
military on Thursday,
telling civilians
in southern Gaza
to move and find shelter.
A foreboding signal
that Israel's ground incursion
could soon extend its punishing reach.
Now they are asking us to leave.
Where do we go?
And we want to understand
where exactly we should go.
It should Denia,
the U.N.
rights expert on Thursday
warned that grave violations
committed by Israel point,
in their words,
to a genocide in the making.
As darkness encompasses
doctors in the South
already grappling
with the impact of Israel's
intensifying bombing campaign.
There are growing fears over
what could come next.
Desperate scenes from the north of Gaza,
almost entirely destroyed
by Israel's unrelenting airstrikes, show
just how dire
the situation can quickly become in the.
We have lost contact with our colleagues,
patients
and everyone inside the al-Shifa
medical complex.
What stopped it?
Israeli forces
say they are still active in
and around the al-Shifa hospital.
Gaza's largest,
claiming to have found
an operational tunnel
saw at the hospital complex
with no access to the complex.
CNN is unable to verify either
side's claims.
Israel says its
military operation at al-Shifa
will take time,
raising fears over the safety
and security of more
than a thousand patients
and medical staff now trapped inside.
We are looking at options
for full medical evacuation,
but there are a lot of security concerns.
There are a lot of logistics constraints.
Our options are rather limited.
There were
allegations of people
at al-Shifa being interrogated
and even stripped
are beginning to emerge.
While doctors are detailing
the harrowing decisions
they are being forced to make,
including amputating limbs
to stop the spread of infection,
who, with the communications
blackout, cutting northern Gaza off
for much of the outside world.
CNN has no ability to verify
these accounts
and has reached out
to the IDF for comment.
No videos have emerged from Stone
Shifa Hospital
since the raid began in the early
hours of Wednesday morning.
These are
some of the last pictures
to have been shared with the world.
Premature babies in intensive care.
There is no way to tell
if all are still alive.
Their cries,
some of the last heard heard
the voices of those inside.
And Shifa the silence when it came.
Look, Wolf,
there is still mounting concern
for the safety and security
of those patients
and medical staff,
as well as other civilians
inside the al-Shifa complex.
As you heard there,
it is extremely difficult
to even begin to think about evacuating
some of these patients
who require specialist
medical evacuations.
And as we know, of course, already
there are some 1.5 million Palestinians
who have been displaced
within the Gaza Strip.
And, of course,
while that has been an intense
focus on the al-Shifa complex,
what we are seeing across the Gaza
Strip is continued
aerial bombardment, continued concern
over the mounting death
toll that we are seeing,
Wolf, not of Bashir
reporting live from Jerusalem.
Thank you a very much.
Let's get some more
on all of these developments.
Joining us now,
a spokesperson
for the Israel Defense Forces,
Lieutenant Colonel
Amnon Scheffler Scheffler.
Lieutenant Colonel,
thank you so much for joining us,
first of all.
What more can you tell us
about this, quote,
operational tunnel shaft
that Israeli forces say they found inside
al-Shifa complex?
Is that the extent of what
the IDF has found at al-Shifa so far
when it comes to tunnels,
or is there more?
This is one of
the piers that we found in the area
that we are continuously
also looking for other.
And this shows that clearly
there is a tunnel infrastructure
underneath the al-Shifa hospital.
We found also today
a lot of explosives
and other ammunitions
right
in that courtyard of the al-Shifa
hospital.
Also together with what we found
yesterday in the MRI room.
We also found the car
that you just showed
that is similar to the cars
that were used
on the October 7th massacre.
And it was booby trapped once again
showing how Hamas did not care
and was looking forward
to explode a car
inside the Shifa hospital
that would
surely have killed
also patients and staff of that hospital.
Lieutenant Colonel,
can you say unequivocally
that what's been found
at the hospital shows
this was a major Hamas command center?
What exactly do you defined
as a command center?
Yes, we can say that now, clearly.
And now we're also showing it
on top of the evidence
that we knew from the intel
and that they are U.S.
counterparts have also verified.
What we're seeing here
is a place where Hamas can gather.
We saw the communication tools
that they had.
We saw the intel tools
that they need
in order to facilitate
any kind of terrorist activity
and carry it out
from that infrastructure that they used.
Again, another civilian infrastructure.
Similarly, like they used schools,
like they used mosques,
and also like
they used this
hospital, Al-Quds
hospital, the Rantisi Hospital,
to carry out and plan
and execute terrorist activity.
The director of al-Shifa hospital
there says patients
there are going untreated,
including a lot of children.
Doesn't Israel have an obligation
to deliver critical supplies
to to at least the patients there?
We have an obligation,
a moral obligation, and we wish to.
That is why
today we brought 4000 liters of water
to the hospital.
That is why we brought today
1500 prepared meals to the hospital.
That is why we are continuously talking
to the administration of the hospital
and the doctors
and to see what is needed.
And based on what they said,
we brought in the incubators.
We brought in baby food.
We have designated
an area of the hospital,
the eastern side of it,
that civilians and patients
that can leave
should leave
through the humanitarian corridors
that we are continuously protecting
and allowing those civilians to leave.
And that is why we are in
continuous communication
to find the best way
that we can alleviate
the suffering
that Hamas
is bringing on the people in Gaza.
Are you planning to deliver
fuel to the hospital?
We have offered fuel, 300 liters
that our soldiers brought
while taking a risk to the hospital.
Sadly,
the hospital did not take it in,
probably because the Hamas
was threatening
what would happen to them if they do.
And as I mentioned,
we are in continuous communication
and whatever
the hospital says that they need,
we will try to facilitate that.
The body of an Israeli hostage,
a woman, was found
near al-Shifa hospital.
The IDF says
she was killed by terrorists.
Can you explain the exact circumstances
of her death?
65 year old grandmother,
65 year old died.
Vice was found right
next to the al-Shifa hospital
and brought back to his
to Israel
to be buried next to her husband
that was also murdered
on the 7th of October by Hamas.
We have two goals in this war
that Hamas launched.
One is to dismantle Hamas.
And the second
is to bring back the hostages.
Now, on the day 41
are still being held by Hamas.
And I want to remind everyone,
the safest and fastest way
for these hostages to come home
is for Hamas to release them
and the international community
to continue pressuring Hamas to do so.
So do you know exactly how
this 65 year old grandmother died?
We know that she, on October
7th, was alive
in her bed in Kibbutz
Berri,
and Hamas came in and brutally massacred
10% of that kibbutz
and took her as hostage together
with a nine month old baby,
children, women and elderly.
And now we know
that she has sadly passed away.
As you know, Israel has dropped leaflets
in the largest city in southern Gaza
warning civilians there to leave.
The IDF
previously told people
to move south for safety.
So where are they supposed to go?
Lieutenant Colonel,
where are the ones that are actually
continuously communicating
with the people of Gaza,
looking for the safer areas
where they can be?
Because we knew that
Hamas has its headquarters,
mainly in the Gaza City.
That is where operationally
we chose to start.
But sadly,
as we know, Hamas is operating
all over the Gaza Strip.
More than 10,000 rockets have been fired
from the Gaza Strip
towards Israeli civilians.
And this includes
coming from the southern part of Gaza.
So Hamas is not operating
only in Gaza City.
It's operating also in the south.
And in order
to reach our number one goal,
which is to dismantle Hamas,
we will go them wherever they are.
Yet we are
looking for the safest places
for the civilians of Gaza.
And that is why we've asked them
initially to move
to the southern part of Gaza,
south of the border of Gaza.
And now we're telling them
specifically where to move
within that area.
And also,
while doing so,
we're continuously in communication
with any international organization
that wants to aid
the Gazans, bring in any international
medicine facilities, food
that can be help, including field
hospitals that we're inviting any country
that wants to donate them, to bring them
to the southern part of Gaza
so we can help the Palestinians,
as we said,
reaching the goal of dismantling Hamas
will not only bring it
to be safer for Israelis,
it will also bring it to be safer
for the Palestinians living in Gaza.
Lieutenant Colonel Amnon Scheffler,
thanks so much for joining us.
Thanks for having us.",20231117

ENTERED GAZA WITH THE ISRAEL
DEFENSE FORCES TO SEE THE
TUNNEL SHAFT NEAR AL-SHIFA, AND
WHAT LIES BENEATH.
CNN REPORTED FROM GAZA UNDER
IDF ESCORT AT ALL TIMES, AS A
CONDITION FOR JOURNALISTS TO
JOIN THEM.
THE MEDIA OUTLETS HAVE TO
SUBMIT FITTED FOOTAGE FILMED IN
GAZA TO THE IDF FOR REVIEW.
CNN RETAINED EDITORIAL CONTROL
OVER THE FINAL REPORT, HERE IS
ORANGE REPORT.
&gt;&gt; WE GO UNDER COVER OF
DARKNESS, AS WE CROSS THE
BORDER FENCE IT'S LIGHTS OUT
ACROSS THE GAZA STRIP.
ESCORTED BY THE TANK, SWITCH
INTO PERSONNEL CARRIER FOR THE
FINAL STRETCH.
EVEN THROUGH A NIGHT VISION
SCREEN, YOU CAN SEE THE
MAGNITUDE OF THE DESTRUCTION ON
THE STREETS OF GAZA CITY.
WE OFF-LOAD AT THE AL-SHIFA
HOSPITAL, MAKE OUR WAY ACROSS
--
OR WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.
WE NEED TO KEEP OUR LIGHTS OFF
MOST OF THE TIME OR RISK
EXPOSING OUR POSITION.
CNN REPORTED FROM GAZA UNDER
ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES ESCORT AT
ALL TIMES.
AS A CONDITION FOR JOURNALIST
TO JOIN THIS WITH THE IDF, THEY
MUST SUMMIT FOOTAGE FELL TO THE
ISRAELI MILITARY CENSORS FOR
REVIEW.
WITH THE HOSPITAL COMPOUND WE
WAIT INSIDE A STRUCTURE TO MAKE
SURE THE AREA IS SECURE BEFORE
MOVING A SHORT DISTANCE TO THE
EXPOSED SHAFT.
&gt;&gt; HERE IS THE ENTRANCE, YOU
SEE WHAT'S A LADDER ACCESS, AS
I STEP OVER HERE, IT'S
DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW DOWN IT
GOES.
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A CENTRAL
SHAFT OR STAIRCASE.
AND THE SHAFT THEN DISAPPEARS
INTO THE DARKNESS.
&gt;&gt; WE MOVE AROUND THE OPENING
FOR A BETTER LOOK AT THE SHAFT,
IT'S CLEAR FROM HERE THAT THIS
IS MEANT TO GO DEEP
UNDERGROUND.
&gt;&gt; WHICH DIRECTION WAS THE
TUNNEL GOING IN?
&gt;&gt; WE ASSUME THE TUNNEL GOES
OUT, IT HAS ANOTHER ORDER THIS
WAY, TOWARDS THE HOSPITAL.
YOU EXIT THE HOSPITAL TO
OUTSIDE [INAUDIBLE]
THE WAY HAMAS IS WORKING AS
IT'S GOING OUT SOMEWHERE,
SHOOTING TO THE FORCES AND
GOING BACK INSIDE TO THE SAFE
PLACE.
&gt;&gt; WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO ENTER
THE SHAFT, ISRAELI MILITARY
HAVE SPECIAL GEAR DOWN TO SEE
WHERE IT LEADS.
INSIDE THE VIDEO SHOWS A SPIRAL
STAIRCASE AS THE CAMERA ORIENTS
ITSELF IT MOVES FORWARD INTO A
TUNNEL.
THE TUNNEL MAKES A SHARP LEFT
TURN AND THE END OF ANOTHER
PATH --
AND ARCH CONCRETE TOP.
THERE WAS A METAL DOOR THAT
THEY HAVE NOT YET OPENED AS
THEY FEAR IT'S BOOBY TRAPPED.
THE IDF SPOKESMAN, DANIEL
HAGARI, SOME OF THE HOSTAGES
TAKEN WERE ALSO BROUGHT TO THE
HOSPITAL.
HE SAYS THE BODY OF NOAH
MARCIANO WAS DISCOVERED 50
METERS FROM THE COMPOUND.
&gt;&gt; WE HAD EVIDENCE THEY WERE
HOLDING HOSTAGE HOSTAGES, AND
THEY WERE BRINGING THEM TO THE
AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL, THE PLACES
THEY MAY HAVE HELD THEM.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT PROOF OF A HAMAS
COMMAND CENTER, WITH
HEADQUARTERS OF ME AT THE
HOSPITAL, BUT THEY CONTINUE TO
BUILD ITS CASE THAT HAMAS USES
THE SANCTUARY THE HOSPITAL --
HAVE DENIED.
THE IDF'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE
ITS OPERATION IN GAZA, THE
CREDIBILITY OF ISRAEL AS THE
NUMBER KILLED IN THE FIGHTING
SURPASSES 12,000.
ACCORDING TO THE HAMAS MINISTRY
OF HEALTH.
THE IDF AS ONE OF ITS SYSTEMS
HAVE DESTROYED HAMAS BUT WITH
INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM
MOUNTING, ISRAEL NEEDS TO SHOW
THE TEAR ORGANIZATION USING GAS
AND CIVILIANS AS COVER TO
JUSTIFY AN ONGOING WAR.
OR LIEBERMAN CNN, IN GAZA.
&gt;&gt; OREN GOES INTO MUCH MORE
DETAIL ABOUT WHAT HE SAW IN
GAZA, AND YOU CAN READ ABOUT IT
ON CNN.COM.
CNN'S CLARE SEBASTIAN IS
FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS, AND
JOINS US LIVE FROM LONDON.
GOOD MORNING CLAIRE, WHAT MORE
ARE YOU LEARNING ABOUT THE IDF
VIDEOS THAT CLAIMS TO SHOW A
VIDEO OF A TUNNEL.
AND THE CCTV FOOTAGE THAT
REPORTEDLY SHOWS HAMAS HOSTAGES
BEING BROUGHT INTO THE HOSPITAL
ON OCTOBER SEVEN.
&gt;&gt; YES ROSEMARY, THEY HAVE BEEN
PUTTING OUT PIECES OF EVIDENCE,
IMAGES, VIDEOS CENSUS TARGETED
AND PRECISE OPERATION AT
AL-SHIFA BEGAN OVERNIGHT INTO
WEDNESDAY LAST WEEK.
THEY ASSURED US ON WEDNESDAY,
WHAT THEY SAY WAS AN EXPOSED
TUNNEL SHAFT.
WE'VE SEEN A REAL EXPANSION OF
THIS THE LAST 12 HOURS OR SO.
THE VIDEO SHOWS THE CAMERA
BEING LOWERED, ALLOWING
INTERNATIONAL JOURNALIST LIKE
OUR OWN OREN LIEBERMANN TO SEE
THE TUNNEL SHAFTED SELF.
NOW, WE HAVE THE CCTV FOOTAGE,
WHICH THE IDF CLAIMS HOSTAGES
BEING BROUGHT INTO AL-SHIFA, ON
THE VERY DAY OF THAT HAMAS
MASSACRE IN ISRAEL ON OCTOBER
SEVEN.
WHICH WOULD SHOW, ALTHOUGH WE
CANNOT VERIFY THE AUTHENTICITY,
OR IDENTITY.
BUT IT WAS SHOW THAT THEY'VE
BEEN USING THE COMPLEX SINCE
THE BEGINNING.
WHAT THE IDF SIZES AND INJURED
HOSTAGE, BEING BROUGHT IN,
CLEARLY STILL BLEEDING.
ONE IS NEPALI, AM ONE IS.
TY HAHN LAST MEANWHILE IS
QUESTIONING THE HEALTH MINISTRY,
RATHER THAN QUESTION THE
AUTHENTICITY OF THIS.
SAYING ALL IT REALLY SHOWS IS
THAT ANYONE WHO NEEDS MEDICAL
TREATMENT AT AL-SHIFA WAS GIVEN
THAT MEDICAL TREATMENT.
AND WE SEE ONE HOSTAGE THAT WAS
NOT INJURED.
WE SEE THIS CAMPAIGN FROM
INJURY AL TO REALLY TRY TO
PROVE ITS CLAIM, AS IT HAS BEEN
CLAIMING FOR WEEKS NOW, THAT
HAMAS IS OPERATING A COMMANDING
CONTROL NODE UNDER THE AL-SHIFA
HOSPITAL.
IF THEY CAN CONCLUSIVELY PROVED,
THAT THEY HAVE NOT CONCLUSIVELY
PROVEN IT YET.
THEY HAVE NOT WITH THE TUNNEL,
THEY HAVE NOT GONE THROUGH THE
BLAST PROOF DOOR, THEY ASSUME
IT LEADS TO THE HOSPITAL, BUT
THEY DO NOT KNOW YET.
IF THEY CAN PROVE, AMID
MOUNTING CRITICISM, THAT THE
HOSPITAL IS BEING USED FOR
MILITARY PURPOSES AND IT LOSES
ITS PROTECTIVE STATUS UNDER
INTERNATIONAL LAW.
PRESSURE IS MOUNTING
INTERNATIONALLY, MEANWHILE WE
ARE HEARING FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE THAT HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS
ARE PROGRESSING CLOSER THAN
THEY HAVE EVER BEEN.
THOSE CCTV VIDEOS ADD EXTRA
URGENCY TO, THAT IN PARTICULAR.
ROSEMARY?
&gt;&gt; CLARE SEBASTIAN JOINING US
LIVE FROM LONDON, MANY THANKS.
LET'S BRING IN RETIRED COLONEL
CEDRIC LEIGHTON.
COLONEL, IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE
YOU, I WANT TO BRING US BACK TO
SOME OF THAT VIDEO WE SHOWED AT
THE BEGINNING.
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE VIDEO,
WE SEE A CLOSED METAL DOOR.
AND THE IDF SAYS THAT THAT DOOR
UNDER THE HOSPITAL HAS NOT BEEN
OPENED OUT OF FEAR OF IT BEING
BOOBY-TRAPPED.
WHAT COULD BE BEHIND THE DOOR
THAT WE SEE IN THE IDF VIDEO?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, GOOD MORNING, KASIE,
THERE COULD BE A LOT OF THINGS
BEHIND THAT DOOR, ONE
SUPPOSITION IS THAT IT'S AN
ARMED STORAGE FACILITY BY HAMAS.
THAT THEY HAVE A LOT OF WEAPONS
STORED BEHIND THAT DOOR.
MORE LIKELY, THOUGH, GIVEN THE
TYPE OF DOOR THAT IT IS IT'S A
BLAST DOOR THAT'S DESIGNED TO
WITHSTAND EXPLOSIONS, IT'S
POSSIBLE THAT IT CONTAINS
COMMUNICATIONS GEAR FOR HAMAS
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, THAT
COULD BE IN LINE WITH THE GEAR
THAT THE ISRAELIS HAVE REPORTED
THAT THE COMMAND AND CONTROL
CENTER FOR HAMAS.
THERE ARE ALL OTHER KINDS OF
POSSIBILITIES, BUT THOSE ARE THE
TWO MOST LIKELY.
AND IT COULD BE A COMBINATION OF
THOSE TWO.
SO, THAT'S THE KIND OF THING
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT, CLEARLY,
THEY WANTED TO PROTECT THIS
AREA, HAMAS DID.
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THERE
MAY BE OTHER ELEMENTS THERE OF,
YOU KNOW, ACTUAL TROOPS THERE.
AND ACTUAL HAMAS FIGHTERS THERE.
SO, THAT'S, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.
BUT OF COURSE, THE ISRAELIS ARE
WORRIED THIS MIGHT BE A
BOOBY-TRAPPED AREA SO THEY'RE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET
THERE WITHOUT DESTROYING
THEMSELVES OR DAMAGING THE
EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT BE BEHIND
THAT DOOR.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.
OKAY.
SO, WE ALSO SHOWED AND THE CCTV
FOOTAGE THAT THE IDF RELEASED OF
HAMAS MOVING TWO HOSTAGES ONE IS
NEPALL
NEPALI, THE OTHER IS THAI.
WHERE MIGHT THOSE HOSTAGES BE
NOW?
AND WHAT DOES THE FACT THAT THEY
CAME THROUGH THE HOSPITAL TELL
YOU?
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE
THEY MIGHT BE NOW.
THE SUPPOSITION WOULD BE THAT
THEY WOULD BE IN THE TUNNELS
SOMEWHERE ELSE, PERHAPS, WITHIN
GAZA.
OF COURSE, ONE OTHER
POSSIBILITY, YOU KNOW, THEY
COULD BE BEHIND THAT GLASS DOOR
WHICH I DON'T THINK IS LIKELY.
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW IN A CASE
LIKE THIS.
AS FAR AS THE FACT THAT THEY
CAME INTO THIS HOSPITAL, IF
EVERYTHING CHECKS OUT IN TERMS
OF THE ACCURACY OF THIS VIDEO
AND THES REALLY ASSERTION THAT,
ACCORDING, YOU KNOW, TO THE IDF.
THAT TELLS YOU THAT, CLEARLY,
HAMAS HAS SOME KIND OF ACTIVITY
AT THE AL SHIFA HOSPITAL.
NORMALLY, HOSTAGE TAKERS WILL
BRING THEIR HOSTAGES TO A PLACE
THAT IS SAFE FOR THEM.
AND IT COULD ALSO BE A MAJOR
NODE FOR THEM, EITHER A
HEADQUARTERS TYPE ELEMENT OR
SOME OTHER INSTALLATION THAT
THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER, THAT'S
WHY THIS IS PARTICULARLY
NOTEWORTHY.
&gt;&gt; RETIRED GENERAL CEDRIC

0pD3Ww6P8jc,Hear what college students think about Biden amid Israel-Hamas war,data/en_CNN\Hear what college students think about Biden amid Israel-Hamas war.jpg,"81.
Today, he
made a few jokes about his age
during the annual Thanksgiving turkey.
Pardon?
And late tonight,
this picture was posted
on the president's Instagram account.
It's a birthday cake ablaze
with candles, the comment reads.
Thanks for the birthday
well-wishes today, everyone.
Turns out on your 146th birthday.
You run out of space for candles.
The White House tonight
leaning into
what is considered
one of Biden's biggest
political liabilities his age.
Right now,
he is showing poorly in the polls,
particularly among younger voters.
They backed him in 2020
by about 20 points.
Polls now show that support collapsing.
A new one from NBC
shows the former president,
the former president Donald Trump,
leading President Biden
46 to 42% among 18 to 34 year olds.
What's more, 70% of young voters
disapprove of Biden's
handling of the Israel-Hamas war.
The White House press
secretary was asked
about that disapproval today
by our MJ Lee. This is what she said.
But what
I'll be very clear about
is we
going to not going to govern by polls
here.
We're going to our poll numbers.
We're going to focus on delivering
for the American people.
That's going to be our focus on the war.
And young voters
are the focus
of John King's latest
installment of his series for 360
All Over the Map.
The series tracks
the presidential campaign
through the eyes
and experiences of voters
who live in key battleground states.
Tonight,
Michigan and John King joins me here now.
So, John,
what did you find out this time?
Look, imagine you're back in college,
you're 18 or 19, you're 20.
81. Seems pretty old.
And it's not just the number.
They think he's just far away
from them on the issues.
They think he doesn't
understand their issues,
even though he's tried
to do some things on college debt,
they think they don't get it.
So age was an issue anyway
with this bedrock
piece of the Biden coalition.
And now, John,
when you go to campus,
you see the protests
about the Israel-Hamas war on both sides.
People raise questions
about how the president's handling it.
Midterms are done.
Final's just ahead.
There is a rhythm to life on campus.
And this fall, a raw divide.
I am an Israeli,
Jewish, Israeli American.
My segment is a sophomore
at Wayne State in Michigan,
studying social work,
chatting with friends here
at the Jewish campus
organization Hillel or Hillel
as a police officer down the hall.
That's not normal.
It is now.
Siegman traveled to Washington
last week to join thousands
in support of Israel.
Now back on a campus divided,
the divisions are very clear.
The tension on campus is very high.
Wayne State spans
200 acres in downtown Detroit.
Ibrahim Ghezzal
among the 24,000 students.
I'm Muslim. I'm American.
I'm Palestinian.
Ghezzal calls anti-Semitism
horrible and disgusting.
Do you feel the flip side of it,
or is there more of Islamophobia?
More Islamophobia? And people just say.
I think it's I think it's
disgusting that
standing up for children dying
and women
dying and civilian infrastructure
being destroyed
is being compared to supporting Hamas.
I mean, holding up
a Palestinian flag
does not support Hamas.
Hamas has their own flag.
Nobody's carrying their flag.
This coffee shop is in Dearborn,
where about half of the residents
are of Arab ancestry.
Jocelyne, his friends say a president
they supported in 2020
is now greenlighting an Israeli response
they see as indiscriminate.
And I don't think our country
should fund that type of reaction.
You feel this way
To an extent, yes.
I feel as though
President Biden doesn't value
my life as a muslim American
as much as he values other lives.
Young voters
were a giant part of the Biden
2020 Coalition,
and this urban campus tilts deep blue.
If it's Biden Trump next November,
you would.
I'd go Biden.
Some are.
Malkin is just 18,
a theater major, an E-sports enthusiast,
and an LGBTQ voter
who wishes President Biden
would yield to someone younger.
I think that weird
generational gap is something
that is very, very hard for young people.
So when there's certain things
that we want to be heard as young people
with not only
the conflict out with Israeli
and Palestine people,
but we also have like student loan
forgiveness and all of these different
financial problems
that aren't being handled
when there are very much capable
of being handled.
Malkin isn't ruling out
voting third party,
but feels like a weird
kind of throwaway vote.
Joseph Fisher used to think that way,
but right now he favors
a socialist party.
In 2020, Fisher was just 17,
but he helped the ACLU
register voters back home in Georgia.
So you helped Joe Biden get elected?
I did, yes.
What about 2024?
I will not vote for Joe Biden.
Not this time.
This is Ann Arbor,
the University of Michigan students
writing the names of Palestinians
killed in Gaza.
One of our demands that we're pressuring
Adnan for right now
is complete divestment
from the state of Israel.
You say genocide?
Yes.
The prime minister of Israel
or the president of United States
would say response to terrorism.
Absolutely.
It's and it's absolutely essential
that we call it
for what it is a genocide
and also say
that it doesn't start on October 17th.
It started in 1948
with the creation of the Saudi
colonial state of Israel.
Some Jewish students say talk like that.
Beliefs like that
are stoking an alarming rise
in anti-Semitism.
I wish it wasn't like this,
but this is what we live right now.
50,000 students here
in Ann Arbor
and interest in the college
Democrats is up.
We've had 50, 40, 30
consistently for meetings.
And in the past
it has been closer to maybe
ten, 15,
20 seniors and co-presidents
of the College Democrats,
Anoushka Jala, Saki
and Jade Gray helped
generate big turnout here
in 2020 and again in 2022.
They have weekly meetings
now to plan 2024.
Should we have somebody younger?
Does that come up much?
Absolutely.
It comes up.
And I think that that's a
you know, it's a real point to make.
It's a real conversation to be had.
The immediate challenge,
though, is seeing students
who agree on things
like abortion rights
and defending democracy
at odds over
the Israel-Hamas
crisis and President Biden's response.
You know, Mr.
President,
I've seen you take key
humanitarian steps,
but I think the next step is a cease fire
and I think that that would go a long way
with voters.
I don't know what's happened
next week or next month,
but if the election were tomorrow,
do you think that it is more likely
some of your members would sit out
or look for another option, third party,
because they're mad
at the president about this?
Some of them, yes.
They have shared with us
that maybe this is making me reconsider.
Is it fair to say you're glad
the election is not tomorrow? Yes,
sir.
John, we saw in the latest poll
where former President
Donald Trump
is now ahead of President Biden
with younger voters.
Where does that fit with
the data you're seeing?
We didn't see John either at Wayne State,
which is a very remember in downtown
Detroit, a blue campus
or even at Ann Arbor, a rush to Trump.
But you do see a lot of hesitation
about the president.
So let me just bring up those numbers
as we go through.
And you see the Michigan map here
from 2020.
Here's that new national poll
you talked about.
One key distinction I want to make.
NBC polled voters ages
18 to 34 in the exit polls.
It's 18 to 29.
We do know as voters start to get older,
they're more likely
they're not rushing to the Republicans,
but they're more likely so.
But still, if you look at this
and then if you go back
and look nationally
at 2016 versus 2020,
President Trump got 36% of 18 to 29.
He got 36% again in 2020,
both in 2016 and 20.
President getting 36.
So if he's above 40,
that's a big gain for President Trump.
So what is the issue?
Look at President Biden.
He got 60% in 2022, 55%
for Hillary Clinton.
It was a key
piece of the Biden coalition.
And, John,
when you asked
voters on
campus, number one, the age
they see the president, they don't
they don't see him enough.
And so they think, wow,
he doesn't understand us.
He doesn't get us.
Those college Democrats presence.
They were trying to deal with that issue,
saying you're not just voting
for the president,
you're voting
for who he puts on the Supreme Court.
You're voting for abortion rights.
You're voting to protect democracy.
They were just trying to start
that conversation on campus.
And then October 7th happened.
And you see this divide on campus
where the Jewish students say
they feel afraid
and the progressive students saying
the president should call
for a cease fire.
They say if he doesn't,
they might not vote at all
or they might go third party.
And if you look how close Michigan is,
that would be a problem.
And again, the Biden reelect campaign
certainly knows all this.
It'll be interesting
to see how they choose to address it
over the coming weeks and months.
John King, great to have you. Thank you.",20231121
Cf6inrhxXGc,Israel and Hamas on brink of hostage deal,data/en_CNN\Israel and Hamas on brink of hostage deal.jpg,"A major breakthrough on
hostage negotiations.
Israel's war cabinet is meeting right now
on a deal with Hamas
to free about 50 of the 237 people
being held captive.
It's been 45 days since hostages,
mostly innocent
civilians, were taken by Hamas
on the Jewish
Sabbath, taken during an attack on Israel
when terrorists raped women
and murdered families.
More than a thousand people that day.
For each
spare that fate and instead taken hostage
the unknown and the wait is excruciating
for their families.
Now we are told an announcement of a deal
that will allow
some of those hostages to come home
could be imminent.
President Biden
addressed that moment ago.
We're now very close, very close,
and could bring
some of these hostages home very soon.
But I don't want to get into
the details of change
because nothing is done until it's done.
And we have more to say.
We will. But things are looking good.
CNN is covering the
story from all angles.
Oren Liebermann is in Tel Aviv.
M.J.
Lee is here in Washington
at the White House.
M.J., I want to start with you.
That was pretty remarkable.
Moment from the president
of the United States
to lean that far into where he thinks
that this negotiation is right now.
Yeah, that's right.
You heard the president saying
that we are very close to a deal.
And that very much echoes
what sources have been telling CNN
all morning,
that the US, Israel
and Hamas are on the cusp
of announcing this deal
and it could come as early as today.
I was in the room
when the president made those remarks,
and I did try to ask him at the end
how many Americans he believes
may be among the 50 hostages
initially released.
And he said, I'll have plenty of time
to talk about the hostages,
but not now, basically
declining to go into any of the details.
And I'll let Orrin speak
to the details of sort of the contours
of this potential deal.
But at least for the Biden
administration, this,
of course, Dana,
has been an urgent priority
trying to get these hostages out,
because they have said all along
that they believe
there are at least a handful
of American citizens in the mix
in Gaza being held by Hamas.
And now what U.S.
officials are saying
is that they are hopeful
that three year
old American citizen Abigail
Alden will be among the 50 hostages
that are initially released.
She is the youngest
known American hostage.
Her parents were killed by Hamas.
So this is a very tenuous situation,
but hopefully we are.
U.S.
officials are saying this three year
old American
toddler will be in the mix
of the 50 hostages.
We have, of course, and seen U.S.
officials working around the clock
to try to secure this deal.
Over the last few weeks.
The president, of course,
has been on the phone
with Prime Minister Netanyahu,
the emir of Qatar, the president of Egypt
and other top U.S.
officials have been traveling
in the region as well.
But, Dana,
it's important to underscore,
if this deal were to come to fruition,
this is not only significant
because of the release of hostages,
but because this would mark
the first sustained pause in fighting
and the first major escalatory step
that Israel will be taking really
since the war first began.
M.J.
thank you so much for that reporting.
And let's get more specific
about what sources are telling us.
This deal
may include the release of 50
women and children
And in exchange,
there would be a four or five day
pause in fighting, as M.J.
just alluded to.
Now, three
Palestinian prisoners
would be swapped
for each civilian Israeli hostage
or other hostage being released by Hamas.
Israel would stop flying
surveillance drones over Gaza
for at least 6 hours each day.
Oren, I'm
going to go to you
now about what is happening
in Israel as we speak.
That government is meeting.
What are you hearing about
how that meeting is going
and whether or not they
will approve this deal?
So this
is all
part of a legal and political process
that is required to approve such a deal
and that is required
for a critical part of this,
and that is to approve
the release of Palestinian prisoners
women and children.
So the first part of that is the war
cabinet is meeting,
and that's a very small group of people,
including Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu,
that will lead straight
into a meeting of the security cabinet.
Again, that's a slightly larger group.
And then the full cabinet itself,
that is the government.
And it needs to be approved
that each one of those stages
for this deal to go through.
Now, that's critical
because two partners
in Netanyahu's governing coalition
to far right partners,
I should say,
have already put out a statement
saying they will oppose this deal.
And that could, of course, scuttle it.
And if they want it to go to the extreme,
they could theoretically topple
Netanyahu's government.
But having spoken
to one of the families of the hostages
a short time ago,
they say they received an assurance
from one of the other critical members
of Netanyahu's government
that if this deal is put forward,
it will get approved.
And that gives them
a critical bit of confidence
that having gotten to this point
where we see the process in Israel begin
to approve a hostage deal
in an exchange
and an agreement with Hamas
that would see them free
Israeli and other hostages potentially
that it will get over the line.
And that's what they're looking to now.
And that's important
because these families
have heard the word imminent
before and have heard reports and rumors
that something is about to happen.
But if you speak with them,
they believe there's something
far more tangible here,
something far more powerful, palpable
and real
even if they haven't gotten
an official word
from the government at this point.
Now, these three votes in meetings
that are expected tonight
are not the end of the process.
There is then a 24 hour window
in which
there can be appeals
that the Supreme Court
filed against this.
That, too, will take its time
as that runs its course.
But from the indications
we're seeing here, the government,
Netanyahu feeling
confident as this moves forward
through the evening.
And we will certainly keep
you posted, Dana,
as it moves into the subsequent meetings.
So that's the process which is important.
The politics there
obviously are critically important.
And now let's talk about the people,
the people who are being held.
Do we know anything
about the condition of these hostages
all of them,
but even specifically,
the women and children on that list of 50
who are hopefully going to be released?
The answer is we simply don't.
We know
so little about the nearly 240 hostages
held in Gaza.
And that has been an incredible source
of frustration.
In fact,
a little information we do know
has only come out
from the Israeli military
when it says it has found the bodies
of two Israeli hostages killed in Gaza
and brought them out.
There were several hostages released
very early on, but that was weeks ago,
if not more than a month
ago, in terms of
who is coming out,
the 50 women and children.
We know at this point
almost nothing except that little bit.
On the on the flip side of that.
We also don't know anything about the 150
Palestinian women and children
who are set to be released
as part of this exchange.
So in terms of the details
of how
this plays out, really the
the nitty gritty of this,
we are still waiting for that.
And, of course,
the families of the hostages
still waiting to find out
if their loved ones are on that list
or and
thank you so much for that reporting.
And this potential breakthrough
in these hostage
negotiations
comes a day
after the families of hostages met
in Israel with that war cabinet there,
emotional calls to bring the hostages
home.
That's what happened in those meetings.
Now, we heard
similar emotion
from one of the family members of a
young girl
that MJ was talking about, Abigael Adan.
She she's three years old.
She's being held in Gaza.
This is her great aunt
speaking to CNN this morning.
These people have been in the
dark for 45 days.
Abigail is a beautiful child
who wants to run around and play soccer
with her older brother and sister.
And she hasn't
been able to run around in 45 days.
I don't know where she is. We don't know.
She should be home with her family
and with her sister and brother.
And she isn't right now.
I'm not a politician. I'm not a diplomat.
I will believe it when I see them
walk out to be driven out.
And they are free.",20231121

PwBJ_cG83ew,Ret. US general talks about the potential military impact of a four-day pause,data/en_CNN\Ret. US general talks about the potential military impact of a four-day pause.jpg,"Tonight's hostage
deal, which
Israel's cabinet
just approved a few minutes
ago, calls
for a four day pause
in Israeli military operations in Gaza.
Now, before the break,
Barack Ravid told us that his sources
say that military engagement
will not stop
until the first child hostage
crosses the border from Gaza into Israel.
CNN's Jeremy
Diamond is in southern Israel
at a vantage point
right near the Gaza border
and can see into Gaza
and has been watching much
of the fighting
over the last several days and weeks.
Jeremy, what are you hearing tonight?
Well, just as you were coming to me,
John, we heard the sound of outgoing
artillery and moments
after this deal was approved
by the Israeli government.
We heard several barrages
of outgoing artillery
in the direction of the Gaza Strip,
an indication that the military activity
by the Israeli
military will indeed continue
until this pause goes into effect
until those hostages
are released from Gaza.
So and also one clear point
that the Israeli prime
minister made this evening
was that even as he was
urging his cabinet to approve this deal,
he was also making clear
that the war will continue
after this pause ends.
We also need to be clear that
if you look at the past of this
Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
typically before
there is a cease fire, before
there is any kind of pause in fighting,
there is an uptick in military activity.
So we're very much here waiting
and watching for that possibility.
But, John,
I do also want to tell you
about a conversation
I just had with Gal Hirsch,
who is
the Israeli prime minister's
special coordinator for hostages.
You just told me moments ago about this
deal, about the discussions
in the cabinet meeting where he said that
only one,
only two ministers voted against
this proposed deal.
He said that
the finance minister, Smotrich,
who appeared
to be indicating his objections
to this deal,
actually ended up voting in favor of it.
And he also told me
that he delivered a message
just about a half hour ago
to the families
of some of these hostages, telling them
that the state of Israel
will do everything
to bring all of the hostages back home.
And he really did want to emphasize
that this deal
for 50 hostages in exchange
for a four day pause
in fighting,
as well as three Palestinian prisoners
for every civilian hostage
release from Gaza,
that this deal is only the first
phase of these negotiations.
He really wanted to emphasize
that the Israeli government's position
is that they want to get
all of the hostages back
and that this military campaign,
that these negotiations
will not end until that happens.
Jeremy, I am curious, you said the
the official with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said that they had
he had spoken
to the families of the hostages.
We had the granddaughter of one hostage
on about 20 minutes ago
and she said she's had no communication
whatsoever
from the prime minister's office.
So how is the prime minister, insofar
as we know, reaching out
Yes.
So this is Gal Hirsch.
He is the special coordinator
for hostages for the prime minister.
He didn't say exactly how,
but he said
he delivered a message
to the families of these hostages.
And what's also clear
is that,
you know,
they don't know yet exactly
which families of hostages
are going to see their loved ones
released. He would not get into that.
But I also think it was interesting
that when he was talking
about the 50 individuals
who will get out,
he said children and their mothers.
We have been reporting
that it would be children and women.
But I think it was really interesting
that he was specifying
that it would be children
and their mothers.
We know, of course, of multiple cases
of children
who are being held hostage in Gaza
and who were taken hostage
with their mothers as well.
And so that may give us
some indication of the families
that are most likely
to get out in this first round.
Of of hostage releases
over these four days
for those 50 different individuals.
That is perhaps an indication there.
All right.
Jeremy Diamond right on the border
between Israel and Gaza,
where artillery fire has continued
even after the deal has been reached.
Jeremy, thank you very much
for your reporting.
With me now
is Rami
Igarashi, former
chief of the Hostages
in MIA Unit of the Mossad
and retired U.S.
Army Major General James Spider
Marks, a CNN military analyst.
Rami, let me start with you.
You've been skeptical
of the possibility of this deal
as it was being negotiated
now that they have reached a deal.
What are your opinions on it?
This deal is
has been that has been negotiated
on the basis
that the Hamas wants a cease fire.
Hamas wants to be to be
saved from the Israeli military.
On the other hand,
the Israeli Israeli
military is determined
to eradicate the Hamas.
It is not something that we want to do
is something that we have to do.
There is no way that Israel can continue
living in any form with Hamas
over the border.
Now, this deal was reached
because of the Israeli
public opinion and the
the belief
that the moral duty
that the government has
is such that it is
it overrides
the main objective of this war.
And the main
objective of this war
is to eradicate the Hamas
It is a very, very bad deal
for Israel in many, many ways.
First of all, militarily,
it is not an easy deal.
How are they going
to restart the war in four or five days?
Secondly, we know that the Hamas is going
to play all kinds of tricks on the way,
trying to
to release this prison, less
kidnap personnel that
it has.
And and on the second hand,
it is not an easy deal
on the Israeli internal front.
Remember, there are families
that their loved ones
are not going to be released
and there are families
that have soldiers in the Gaza Strip
and they know of fighting in the Gaza
Strip in four days
time or in five days time.
Is going to be
a lot more difficult than it is
right now.
General Marks, we've talked about this.
What is the military impact
of a multiday pause
The primary impact
is that the IDF loses
targetable intelligence.
It starts to atrophy
the intelligence
that they've gathered
over the course of days
in Gaza begins to crumble around them
because over
this pause,
Hamas will resupply reposition,
do everything in their power
to increase their security.
And let there be no doubt
this is not being done by Hamas
for any humanitarian reasons.
This is a transaction to them.
And I think we're at the point
where the military
has got a very,
very tough decision to make.
You're in Gaza.
Excuse me. You're in Gaza.
You're exposed.
You've got Hamas all around.
You still active in the tunnel
network system.
It's not been completely taken over
by the Israelis. By any means.
And so these Israeli
soldiers are targets.
That's the challenge.
And then at the end
of a certain amount of time,
as has been described
that four days could turn into five or
six days.
If they continue to
to move hostages back across into Israel,
that becomes a very,
very tough military task.
The Israelis at that point
are going to have to transition
into a defensive posture, pause.
There's not a military term.
You attack or you defend.
They're going to have to start to defend.
That changes the mission set entirely.
This becomes a very,
very difficult
test for military commanders to execute.
Romney,
is there anything
that the Israeli military
or Israeli government can do?
What can they do
to make sure that Hamas lives
up to its side of the deal?
Hamas is not trustworthy.
As you can understand.
It's a terror group run by a psychopath,
and they're going to do anything
in their power
to kill Israeli soldiers and to continue
to continue
regrouping
and strengthening themselves as they can
But the Israeli army has already said
that if any breach of the agreement,
even the smallest breach.
It will go back into fighting full force,
saying that
I don't see
the Israeli military doing that.
If there's any more hostages to be had
and and and this is where we are.
We are at a very
we're a very difficult situation
where this deal is a bad deal.
But we have to
to go through it
in order to release our people.
And this is our moral obligation.
But I mean, don't forget,
I think at the end of the day,
difficult days
it might be at the end of the day,
the Israeli army will go back to fighting
and Israel
must achieve its goal
of eradicating Hamas.
Rami, Retired General James Spider Marks,
thank you both for being with us
very, very much.",20231122

h70bJk13-KE,Israel hostage release deal delayed until Friday,data/en_CNN\Israel hostage release deal delayed until Friday.jpg,"Tonight, explosions
continue to rock Gaza.
The pause in fighting is now delayed
24 hours
ahead of the expected
release of women and children
being held hostage by Hamas terrorists.
And even after this hostage release,
the fate of the vast
majority of those
still being held captive remains
very much in question.
The White House
saying today
that President Biden
has been, quote, personally engaged
in negotiations.
Alex Marquardt is OUTFRONT
in Washington for us.
Alex,
what are you learning about
the status of negotiations
for the rest of the hostages
held by Hamas?
Well, Kate, we've heard repeatedly
from U.S.
officials that they say
they will not rest
until the rest of the American hostages
come out, aside
from these women and children
that the U.S.
will stay very much engaged
for all of these hostages.
But those conversations
really have not begun in earnest yet.
The main focus really has been on
getting these women
and children out,
making sure that this mechanism works.
It is believed
that the easiest negotiations with Hamas
were to get these women and children out.
And that's assuming, of course,
that this all goes
according to plan, that these 50 or more
actually come out in the coming days.
I was speaking with an official
who is
involved in these conversations,
briefed on the ongoing negotiations,
who told me that this first swap of 50
people is the most crucial
to make sure
that this mechanism is working
as was agreed.
So assuming this goes smoothly,
you then have, as you say, the vast
majority of the hostages who remain
and they really do fall into three
distinct buckets.
You have
men who are both elderly
and non-Israeli nationals.
Then you have Israeli soldiers,
both men and women.
And then you have bodies,
people who were killed
either on October 7th or since then.
And U.S.
and Israeli officials agree
that the most difficult
negotiations are going to be around
the Israeli soldiers,
both the men and the women.
No one in Israel
certainly has forgotten
the exchange
of Gilad Shalit back in 11 2011.
He was held for years by Hamas.
And when he was exchanged,
Hamas was able to get more than 1000
prisoners out of Israeli prisons.
So it is possible that the conversations
about the rest of the hostages
begin soon,
but it could be quite some time
before the rest of those hostages
come home Kate. Yeah. For weeks. Months.
How is described to me
by a couple of people just today.
It's good to see you, Alex.
Thank you so much.
OUTFRONT with me now, Jonathan Dekel.
Chen, his son
Siggy is is among
those kidnaped by Hamas now
nearly seven weeks ago,
still captive in Gaza.
Jonathan,
thank you for coming on tonight.
Given what we know about this agreement,
it does seem unlikely
that Siggy will be among
those released in this
and in this in this moment.
What what then does
this moment feel like for you?
Well, I think it's two poles.
The first pole is assuming that
that Hamas can deliver
on its promise here
that these 50 women and children
will be released. I'm overjoyed for them.
And keep in mind
that from my kibbutz
alone, for my one community alone,
there are still 75 hostages
being held by Hamas
since October
7th of the list that's been published.
And there are multiple,
multiple children and women
and moms,
including Leah, at the facility
who you spoke with her
dad a few minutes ago.
These are all my neighbors,
my friends,
my kids friends, my
my grandchildren's friends.
So I couldn't be more pleased for
those families
because it's like my extended family
coming home, on the other hand.
And again,
it it it's very difficult to say
in terms of Siggy and the other
109, the hostages, again, 190 hostages
who weren't referred to at all
in this stage of the agreement.
It's almost impossible to
say, given Hamas as a
sort of a barbarian terrorist
organization with no regard
for human
life, Israeli
or Palestinian, for that matter.
What this first stage might say
about the coming stages.
Do you allow yourself
to think about
that moment when you're when you will see
Siggy again?
It seems just like
I keep thinking of this, Jonathan,
because it's like this
suspend this moment of like his
being in suspended nightmare.
I almost envision
it feels like being just seven
weeks, nearly
seven weeks now
since that horrible, horrible day.
And I just wonder if
if you allow yourself
to think about that moment.
Well, there's not a waking
or even a sleeping moment
that I'm not thinking about, Siggy,
in some measure.
And I can certainly visualize
and love visualizing
his two little girls, running into
leaping into his arms when he comes home
and in a hope in hopes that he comes
home quickly.
But if not, then meeting his third
little girl who set to be born
in a couple of weeks.
So I absolutely have that in mind
as something
that I'm working for and or towards
together with the release
of of all of the hostages
to his poor wife
and what she's going through
and about to bring
another beautiful child
into the world in the midst of this.
Just unbelievable.
How is she doing?
How's the rest of the family handling
handling this
and handling this news right now of
of this deal?
Well, you know,
we're doing the best we can.
It's a it's a multi level
crisis, really,
because
not just Sergei's
family wife and two two young daughters,
but I have another daughter
who lives on the kibbutz
with her young family.
So there are four little kids
between the age of two and six
who were utterly traumatized by this
hell on earth
that befell the kibbutz on October 7th.
So, you know, missing our loved ones,
those that were murdered.
All of my grandkids,
again, from age 2 to 6,
have close friends
who are no longer alive,
who were murdered in their beds
on October 7th.
So we have to deal with that.
And we also have to deal
with the fact that our community
as a whole, our cooperative farm,
like many others around the Gaza Strip
and not just were massacred,
but rather also had
all of their property stolen by hundreds,
thousands of looters actually from Gaza.
And then whatever could not be looted
was burned to the ground.
So there's no going home
for any of these kids or the adults.
Our home as we knew it no longer exists.
It's a series of tragedies
for us,
Israeli civilians
and honestly,
for the Palestinian civilians as well.
And who find themselves
in this horrible situation
not of their making,
but by Hamas is making.
We keep ourselves busy.
I mean, in thinking about what the future
will bring for us.
For me personally, working with the press
and with governments
in Israel and abroad, and keeping laser
attention
focused on this humanitarian universal
issue and challenge of our hostages
in the hands of Hamas
and taking care of the little ones
the best we can,
and trying to help them
make sense of shattered life
and make sense of
what is impossible to make sense of.
Jonathan, thank you so much.",20231123
cnzeS6Nb8z0,Qatar announces when Israel-Hamas truce will begin,data/en_CNN\Qatar announces when Israel-Hamas truce will begin.jpg,"The beginning of the pause will be 7 a.m.
Friday, the 24th of November,
and it will last of course,
as agreed for four days.
And the first batch of civilians
to be released from
Gaza will be around 4 p.m.
of the same day.
They will be 13
and no all the women and children
and those hostages from the same family
will be
put together within the same patch.
CNN's Becky Anderson,
who is in that press
conference, asked multiple
great questions.
Becky,
I think
one of the key ones that you asked was
what happens
if one side breaches of this agreement
what is the result of that?
What stood out to you about the answer
from from the Qatari official
It was an interesting answer, wasn't it?
He said this has to be a cessation
of hostilities completely on both sides.
On the ground and for periods of time
in the air.
And he made it very clear
when asked about drones
in the air,
surveillance drones in the air,
he said specifically
during the period of the hostages
being released,
there would be no surveillance
drones flown.
And we know
because we've had to what we
might call proof of concept
episodes where
we've seen two sets of hostages released.
Of course, the American mother
and her 17 year
old daughter some weeks ago
and then two elderly Israeli citizens.
We know that they were drones in the air
at the time.
And what he suggested is
that can be very confusing.
It can make people feel that
there may be some hostile
activity in the air.
So certainly during the periods of time
when the hostages are being released,
the air the skies will be clear.
The air space over
those hostages will be clear.
Let's just be very specific,
I think, about what we learned today.
This truce starts at 7 a.m.
local Gaza time.
That is 12 a or midnight Eastern time.
And at some point after 4:00
in the afternoon, so 9 a.m.
Eastern Time,
we will see the first 13 hostages.
The names of those 13 hostages
have now been shared with both the
with the Mossad on the Israeli side
and the reciprocal arrangement,
as it were.
The release of Palestinian prisoners
into the Palestinians
hands will happen around the same time,
although
most Italians
are the spokesperson
for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
I couldn't say
exactly how many hostages
would be exchanged.
And then after that, every day
there will be a list
and shared with both sides on those
who will be released
every day at around the same time.
So let's assume for it to be around
4:00 in the afternoon Gaza and time
for four days,
that would take us up to effectively
50 hostages, women and children.
After that,
much of our sorry
reminded us that the proposal the
the deal includes a an opportunity
for Hamas to come good on its agreement.
And for every ten extra hostages release
and the understanding
is that they are holding
as many as 70 to 80.
There will be an extra day of this pause
this cessation
of hostilities
for this brief period of time.
So you know lots of good detail
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
here today
an important detail
because although we knew
that this deal had been agreed to
there were lots
and lots of things that were that
that was still unclear until we heard
from Majid
al-Ansari at this press conference today.
Kaitlin
Yeah, that was key there, Becky.
A sense of optimism that
from the Qataris at least,
that this could potentially go on
for longer than the planned four days.
We'll see.
Of course,
there is a good reason to be skeptical
here.
We'll see what this looks like
once it's actually put into effect.
Thank you, Becky Anderson.
And Kate,
obviously,
this is the news
that so many of these families
have been waiting for that
at midnight Eastern tonight,
this temporary truce
is going to go into place.
And that based on what we just heard,
if everything goes according to plan.
24 hours from now,
we will see
13 women and civilian hostages
released by Hamas in Gaza Kate.
Caitlin, thank you so much.
And to remind everyone,
of the breaking news,
which is this is a big moment
that we're looking at right now
as as of midnight, the news is midnight
tonight, Eastern Time, 7 p.m.
local the truce sets in. 4 p.m.
local 9 a.m.
eastern around.
The hostages
will be begin to be released.
And is
Israel has confirmed
and then that they have a list
in hand
of the 13 hostages to be first released.
13 women
and children are now just hours away
hopefully
from ending a weeks long nightmare.
Joining us now on this news.
Finally some more detail
that we have gotten about
what this exchange will look like
is for me.
The former deputy
director of national intelligence,
Beth Sanner.
CNN global affairs analyst Kim Dozier.
And retired Army Brigadier General
Mark Kimmitt.
Thank you guys for being here.
Beth, what's your reaction
to all of what
we just heard laid out
by Qatari officials
of what this process
is going to look like now?
Well, I guess
we'll skip ahead a little bit,
because I think that, you know,
tomorrow looks very good, but as each day
progresses, it gets harder
and more challenging.
And it's clear from the way
the Qataris laid out this plan
that their goal is very, very divergent
from where the Israeli goal
is in the end.
The Qataris want to extend this
indefinitely and lead
this lead to a peace agreement
or full cease fire.
And Israel
is absolutely in a different place.
And so I think that,
you know, this does
become much, much more complicated
as it goes by.
And it's an excellent point,
because we just heard
from the prime
minister himself
definitively saying the war continues
last night,
the mission remains to demolish Hamas.
And general
in terms
of what this truce means
and how it holds.
So midnight tonight,
Eastern is when the truce is to set in.
And our Becky Anderson, our colleague
over there, she asked Qatar officials
what would constitute
a breach of this agreement,
a break in that truce by either side.
And the visual
definitely did not answer the question.
What do you think would.
Is it clear
what would constitute a breach?
And what happens if if they do
Well, I think
what would
happen is
there would be some undisciplined
fire from
perhaps a individual Hamas soldier
that may or may not agree with
what is what what is going on.
He may be trying to lure
the IDF into firing back.
That happens
so often
in these tentative
cease fires around the world.
I think that that would not return
the situation to a full combat operation.
But as they said in the press conference,
they would do everything
they could to contain
that type of violation.
I think at this point,
both sides want this
this pause to stay in place
during the duration
of the hostage exchange
and what the pause does.
But does it
pause B, get
a pause is kind of a question,
Kim, because
a former head of Mossad told me
last night that it will be for the IDF
much harder
to start the fighting
in the military operation
back up once this truce sets in for one,
because he believed
the mounting international pressure
that would start building
to at least bring about a slowdown.
The IDF and the prime minister
have assured, though,
that they are going to return
to operations.
The mission continues
What do you think of these
Well, Israel has said that
this agreement expires after ten days.
And the White House really
hoping that if the first four days
go well,
each of those additional days could
lead to more hostage
exchanges, possibly up to ten days.
But turning the war back on
is going to be really hard
for the Israeli government
because there will be pressure
from the hostage families
to keep this going
to keep the exchanges going,
because the Hamas militants,
they're not going anywhere.
They're stuck inside Gaza.
So what's the difference
between waiting
another ten
or 20 days to prosecute the war
versus earlier
And Beth Netanyahu,
the role of the Red Cross was brought up
in this press conference
with Qatari officials and
and he essentially said
that the Red Cross has a role in
accepting the hostages
and kind of facilitating that.
But there is also
then Netanyahu saying yesterday
that the Red Cross,
he said
the expectation is
will be allowed to visit
the hostages
who remain behind, remain in Gaza
and even offer
medical support to those hostages.
But the Red Cross,
you know, the confusion sets in
because the Red Cross says this morning
they aren't aware
of that agreement
at all, though, ready to help in any way.
Do you see Hamas
letting the Red Cross in?
What do you see as the role here?
Well,
Hamas will do what
it sees in its interests and how it views
that in terms of its broader
interests of extending the cease
fire indefinitely,
giving itself time to regroup,
trying to present itself as the
the good guys here, you know,
which is very hard for us to see. Right.
But I think when you are looking at it
from the Arab world, it looks different.
So, yeah,
I can see it
actually happening in a way
that Hamas tries
to twist it
into something positive for them
in the end.
You know,
getting in
there is absolutely the right thing
and the good thing to do. So we'll see.
Have to see how this goes.",20231123
EKCtoGV4SmU,John Bolton: Truce is a bad deal for Israel,data/en_CNN\John Bolton Truce is a bad deal for Israel.jpg,"We are now just
hours away from
what is supposed to be the start
of this
temporary truce in this war
between Israel and Hamas.
This deal
does not come without criticism
even here in Israel.
There have been questions
about making this deal.
The former Trump
national security adviser,
John Bolton says is that
it is a badly flawed agreement
and he joins us now.
Thank you so much,
Ambassador, for being here.
You have been critical
because essentially,
if I believe this right,
and tell me if I'm wrong,
you think that Hamas gains more from this
than Israel does.
What exactly about this deal
do you think is so bad
Well, there are many specific provisions
that I think are badly misguided.
But but fundamentally,
what's going on here is that
Hamas is playing
a game
of psychological warfare
against the people of Israel
and the people of the United States
as well,
trying to distract
Israel
from its strategic mission
of eliminating Hamas and trying to focus
on the question of the hostages,
the question
of the condition of civilians in Gaza.
Obviously,
this is a heart wrenching situation
and you can feel nothing
but compassion
for the families of the hostages.
But in cold fact, Israel
strategic mission here
is much more important.
But if the
if the Hamas effort can help break
the morale, can help break the resolve
of the Israeli forces,
what they really want to do,
and this is the real play,
is to turn this four day pause
into a permanent cease fire.
Now, I don't think they're going
to achieve that at the first iteration,
but they're trying to put the onus
on the Israeli forces
if and when they begin hostilities again.
They are playing, I think, a
and surprisingly sophisticated
psychological game here.
I don't think this one event
is necessarily
going to be the Alpha and omega.
But if this sets a precedent
that undermines Israeli resolve
to achieve
what they're
legitimately entitled
to achieve, the elimination of Hamas
as a threat.
It'll be a huge
victory for the terrorists.
So the flip side of that argument
and something that I was reading today
from having read
to Gerhard Dryer
here for the Times of Israel in Tel Aviv,
he basically believes
that Hamas agreed
to this deal out of desperation.
Why do you think Hamas agreed to this
with Israel?
Well, I think on balance,
in a military sense,
Hamas is the beneficiary
more than the Israeli side.
Certainly, as you heard from your
your previous guest,
the Israelis are going to move
people around.
They're going to change troops,
that they're going
to do a number of things.
They will take advantage of
of the pause as well.
But it's Hamas
that's getting pounded here.
I don't think we know the full amount of
devastation that the Israeli forces
have wrought.
But it's Hamas that needs the break.
And the longer they can make that break,
the better off they'll be.
I don't think
people should forget that
at the beginning of this war,
the Biden administration
sent military advisers
to Israel
that said, look,
learn from our experiences in Iraq
and Afghanistan.
Don't rush in, pal mail.
Take your time this is very complicated
using the examples, particularly
of Fallujah and Mosul in Iraq,
which took nine
to 12 months for American
and Iraqi forces to secure.
We're seven weeks into this.
There's a long way to go.
But if Israel's resolve can be weakened
and broken,
they'll never get to the amount of time
they really need to accomplish the stated
objective of eliminating Hamas
That is, I mean, quite an objective.
They're not just saying
they want to demean or diminish Hamas.
They have used
words like eliminate and eradicate Hamas.
We heard from the defense
minister earlier
saying that after this pause, he believes
it will take two more months of fighting.
Do you realistically think
that Israel
can achieve that goal within two months?
Well, you know,
I read that comment as well.
I understood that to be
saying to the Israeli forces, we've
got two months of intense struggle
ahead of us.
I didn't see it
as limiting it to two months.
But part of the psychological campaign,
part of the propaganda effort here
is to undercut
Israel's ability
to get to that stated objective.
For example,
the Russian prime minister,
Medvedev, said a couple of weeks ago
that Israel, as an occupying power
which it's not, by the way,
in the Gaza Strip,
but as an occupying power,
did not have a legitimate
right of self-defense,
meaning implicitly that everything
Israel has done since October
the seventh
has been illegitimate,
since it doesn't have the right
to self-defense.
A senior U.N., quote unquote,
human rights official
who said the same thing about a week ago,
that that's going to be
part of the argument here,
to say you've gone far enough,
you don't have to eliminate it,
just sit down and negotiate with them.
You can see it coming.
And what I worry about is the pause,
if it begins in a few hours,
is just the opening wedge to
achieve that objective.
So you think that that
once Israel
has agreed to this
this pause, once it starts
just literally in a matter of hours
from now,
the basically the international criticism
of Israel
restarting its military campaign
will be so high
that they may not actually do it
Well, I think I think the Israelis
are pretty immune
to a lot of blabbering internationally.
What I worry about
is that the White House
is losing its resolve.
There's no secret
if you if you read an American papers,
you can see many of the pro-Palestinian
elements of the Democratic Party
are saying
they want the pause
to be transformed into a truce
or into a cease fire.
A lot of these words become
interchangeable after a while.
And that's the objective.
And I think Biden recognizes
he's got
a severe problem
because of the schism
within the Democratic Party.
So domestic U.S.
politics are going to play a role here.
And if if the
if the mood can be shifted
Talking about
the anguish of the hostages.
Nobody
nobody really talks
about the 190 hostages
who are not going to be released
in the next four days.
You know,
this can have a significant impact.
I think
really the questioning that Medvedev
has started off
of, the legitimacy of
what Israel is doing
is just going to be amplified
what the Israelis need to do and frankly,
what the United States needs to do
is reinforce
the legitimacy
of self-defense,
permitting Israel in this situation
not to minimize the threat,
but to eliminate the threat.
And the threat really is not just Hamas.
Ultimately,
think of Hezbollah in the north
for almost the entire seven weeks
since October the seventh,
they've been shelling
targets in northern Israel.
All of this
under the watchful eyes
of the mullahs in Tehran.
This is a much bigger conflict than just
in the Gaza Strip.
Yeah.
And Hezbollah is not party
to this temporary truce.
Of course, Ambassador
John Bolton, as always,
thank you for your time.
Thanks for joining us
tonight on Thanksgiving.

y5VpAKb0t1E,Hear what a retired US colonel thinks Hamas will do during truce,data/en_CNN\Hear what a retired US colonel thinks Hamas will do during truce.jpg,"&gt;&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW I WANT TO BRING IN
RETIRED AIR FORCE COLONEL CEDRIC
LEIGHTON.
COLONEL, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT HAMAS TO DO
DURING THIS BRIEF PAUSE IN
FIGHTING?
&gt;&gt; WOLF, I THINK WHAT THEY'RE
GOING TO DO IS THEY'RE GOING TO
MOVE THEIR FORCES AROUND.
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO AVOID
DETECTION BY THE ISRAELIS AND
THAT SPEAKS TO THE CESSATION OF
DRONE FLIGHTS.
HAMAS IS GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE
SURVEILLANCE PICTURE -- THAT
PART OF THE SURVEILLANCE PICTURE
WILL BE LACKING FOR THE
ISRAELIS.
SO HAMAS IS GOING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THAT.
THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO DEPLOY
THEIR FORCES IN A WAY THAT WILL
ALLOW THEM TO POTENTIALLY AMBUSH
ISRAELI FORCES.
NOW, THERE WERE SOME SERIOUS
CHALLENGES ON THE HAMAS SIDE.
BECAUSE ISRAEL IS SENDING A LOT
OF AIR STRIKES THEIR WAY AND A
LOT OF ARTILLERY STRIKES AS
WELL, AND WHAT THAT'S DOING IS
IT'S FORCING HAMAS BACK FROM THE
NORTHERN AREA OF GAZA.
WITH ALL OF THAT IN MIND, WHAT
YOU'RE SEEING IS A CONSOLIDATION
OF FORCES ON BOTH SIDES WITH THE
PREPONDERANCE OF ISRAELI FORCE
CONCENTRATED IN THE NORTH OF
GAZA AND THEN POTENTIALLY MOVING
INTO THE CENTRAL PART FOR A PUSH
ONCE MORE INTO GAZA CITY.
HAMAS IS GOING TO TRY TO KEEP AS
MUCH OF GAZA CITY AS THEY CAN
AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO KEEP
THEIR TUNNELS ACTIVE AS WELL.
&gt;&gt; COLONEL, ISRAEL'S DEFENSE
MINISTER SAYS HE EXPECTS THE
FIGHTING AGAINST HAMAS TO
LAST -- IN HIS WORDS, AT LEAST
ANOTHER TWO MONTHS.
DO YOU SEE THAT AS BEING ENOUGH
TIME FOR ISRAEL TO ACCOMPLISH
ITS OBJECTIVE OF COMPLETELY
DESTROYING HAMAS?
&gt;&gt; NOT REALLY.
BECAUSE DESTROYING HAMAS WOULD
REQUIRE NOT ONLY A MILITARY
VICTORY, BUT ALSO A
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL
VICTORY.
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T
SEE HAPPENING BECAUSE AT THIS .
POINT IN TIME, YOU HAVE TWO VERY
HOSTILE POPULATIONS PITTED
AGAINST EACH OTHER AND HAMAS IS
VERY DETERMINED TO KEEP ITS
POWER BASE IN GAZA AS LONG AS IT
CAN.
AND THE ISRAELIS, OF COURSE, ARE
DETERMINED TO UPROOT THEM.
BUT HAMAS HAS THE UPPER HAND
WHEN IT COMES TO THE HEARTS AND
MINDS OF THE GAZAEN PEOPLE.
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE HAD BASICALLY
LESS THAN MAJORITY SUPPORT,
RIGHT NOW I THINK THEIR SUPPORT
HAS INCREASED AND THAT IS GOING
TO ALSO IMPACT THE WAY IN WHICH
ISRAEL HAS TO CONDUCT THIS WAR.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN TWO
MONTHS IF THEY WANT TO COMPLETE
THAT GOAL OF DESTROYING HAMAS.
&gt;&gt; RETIRED COLONEL CEDRIC
LAYTON, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
&gt;&gt;&gt; IN JUST A FEW HOURS FROM
NOW, THE FIRST HOSTAGES BEING
HELD BY HAMAS COULD BE ON THEIR
WAY HOME.
SO, WHAT WILL THAT TRANSFER
PROCESS ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE?
OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE
COMPLICATED.
BUT WHERE DO THESE WOMEN AND
CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPECTED TO BE
THE FIRST ONES OUT OF GAZA, OUT
OF HAMAS' CAPTIVITY, WHERE DO
THEY GO?
JOINING ME NOW IS THE FORMER FBI
AGENT, ROBERT DeMECO, WHO HAS
WORKED ON HOSTAGE CASES OVERSEAS
IN HIS CAREER.
ROB, LET'S JUST START WITH HOW
MUCH OF A TEST DO YOU THINK THAT
THE FIRST DAY HERE IS GOING TO
BE FOR FUTURE SWAPS?
&gt;&gt; OH, IT'S HUGE.
AS THIS -- I CALL THIS A MOMENT
OF TRUST.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE TRUST ON
EITHER SIDE OF IT.
BUT DURING THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE,
YOU HAVE TO TRUST EACH OTHER
QUITE A BIT.
IT'S COMPLEX.
THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT
COULD GO WRONG.
EVEN WITHOUT ANY ILL EFFECT ON
EITHER SIDE, IF YOU HAVE A
FACTION NOT WANTING TO HAPPEN.
WE TRIED TO DO HOSTAGE EXCHANGES
AND EVEN COULDN'T FIND THEM WITH
THE HELICOPTER AND TRYING TO
NARROW IT DOWN BEFORE WEATHER
CAME IN.
BUT THIS ONE'S GOING TO TAKE A
LOT OF TRUST TO MOVE THAT MANY
PEOPLE THROUGH AN AREA THAT'S,
YOU KNOW, A PART OF WAR.
HAMAS ISN'T GOING TO WANT THEM
TO BE TRACKED WHERE THEY CAME
FROM.
I'M SURE THEY'LL COME TO A
CENTRAL POINT WHERE THEY'VE
GATHERED THEM AND MOVE THEM TO A
POINT AGREED ON.
SAME THING WITH THE ISRAELI
PRISONERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE
COMING OUT.
IT IS A TREMENDOUS TASK, AND THE
FIRST ONE IS GOING TO BE
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.
A LOT OF HEIGHTENED TENSION ON
EITHER SIDE.
IT WILL GO DOWN A BIT WITH EACH
ONE.
BUT EVEN AS SMALL AS AIR BETWEEN
THEM CAN HAVE THAT SPIN OUT OF
CONTROL AS FAR AS LOSING TRUST.
&gt;&gt; HOW MUCH DOES IT HURT IT THAT
IT'S NOT A DIRECT LINE OF
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND
HAMAS?
I MEAN, THIS IS ALL BEING
MEDIATED THROUGH THE QATARIS.
&gt;&gt; SO, I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF
THESE.
ONE ACTUALLY, I ENDED UP
HAVING -- I WAS GOING THROUGH A
SENIOR QATARI THAT WE WERE
MOVING MILITARY FOLKS TO RECOVER
A PRISONER HELD BY THE TALIBAN.
AND IT GOT SO COMPLICATED THAT
THE QATARI HAD TO FLIP HIS CELL
PHONE SO I WAS TALKING STRAIGHT
TO THE COMMANDER BECAUSE WE
COULDN'T FIND HIM.
WE HAD TO LOWER THE PREDATOR TO
LOOK FOR THEM, AND THEY THOUGHT
WE WERE GOING TO SHOOT THEM.
THEY HAD MACHINE GUNS, SO THEY
GOODNESS WE HAD SOME
COMMUNICATION TO TALK EACH OTHER
DOWN.
THE SECOND ONE, ALMOST FOUR
YEARS AGO TODAY, NOVEMBER 2019,
WE EXCHANGED PROFESSOR KING AND
WEEKS, TWO PROFESSORS KIDNAPPED
IN KABUL FOR THE -- THREE.
THAT WAS A BIT DIFFERENT.
WE HAD TO GIVE OUR SIDE UP, T
THEIR THREE FIRST, BEFORE THEY
RELEASED THEIRS.
WE HAD TO PULL THEM BACK AT THE
LAST SECOND BECAUSE SOMETHING
FELL THROUGH.
IT DIDN'T HURT.
WE DID IT THE NEXT DAY, BUT IT
WAS STILL A COMPLEX SCENARIO.
THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED
TO GET WORD BACK AND FORTH.
BUT THAT WAS THROUGH THE QATARIS
TOO.
SO, AGAIN, THE TRUST FACTOR,
QATARIS TALKING TO HAMAS, US
TALKING TO QATARIS, SINCE WE'VE
DONE IT WITH THEM BEFORE, I
THINK THAT HELPS A BIT.
&gt;&gt; SO, WHAT IS -- IF YOU'RE A
HOSTAGE AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE
FIRST ONES WHO'S BEING RELEASED,
WHAT DOES THAT REINTEGRATION
PERIOD LOOK LIKE?
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO NEED
MEDICAL EXAMS.
THEY WANT TO BE REUNITED WITH
THEIR FAMILIES.
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
DEEPLY TRAUMATIZED FOR 47 DAYS
NOW.
WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE?
&gt;&gt; SO, IT'S -- THE
REINTEGRATION, WE CALL IT
BRINGING THEM BACK IN.
THE FIRST THING IS MEDICAL.
I'M SURE WITH THIS MANY AT THIS
ONE TIME THAT THEY'RE GOING TO
HAVE SOMETHING SET UP WHERE THEY
COME IN AND THERE'S GOING TO BE
A MEDICAL TEAM FOR EACH PERSON.
I THINK THE FIRST ARE GOING TO
BE 13 PEOPLE.
DON'T KNOW WHO, DON'T KNOW AGES
AND STUFF.
BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE A
MEDICAL TEAM PROBABLY FOR EACH
PE
PERSON.
ALONG WITH THAT MEDICAL TEAM IS
GOING TO BE HOPEFULLY A
PSYCHOLOGIST.
THE FBI HAS A PSYCHOLOGIST UNDER
THE VICTIMS ASSISTANCE FOLKS
THAT USUALLY COMES FORWARD AT
LEAST TO A MIDDLE GROUND.
WELD USUALLY MOVE THEM TO
GERMANY, WHERE THERE'S A WHOLE
TEAM SET UP AT THE MILITARY BASE
THERE, IN ORDER TO REINTEGRATE
THEM.
AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST STARTS
ACTUALLY DICTATING WHAT'S
ALLOWED.
WE'D EVEN HAVE AGENTS WHO ARE
INTEL FOLKS TALKING TO THEM
WITHOUT THE PSYCHOLOGIST THERE
BECAUSE OF ALL THE STRESS THAT
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH.
WE WANT TO GET INFORMATION FROM
THEM TO HELP WITH OTHER HOSTAGES
AND OTHER THINGS, BUT THEIR
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IS
MORE IMPORTANT.
AND THAT PSYCHOLOGIST THAT'S
ASSIGNED TO THEM IS THE ONE
REALLY DICTATING.
I'VE SEEN SOME PRISONERS -- I
DEBRIEFED -- HE WAS ACTUALLY
PAKISTANI.
AND HE HAD BEEN HELD FIVE YEARS
BY THE TALIBAN.
I DEBRIEFED HIM FOR ABOUT FIVE
HOURS BEFORE WE SENT HIM BACK,
AND HE HAD ME LAUGHING.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH
SENSE OF HUMOR HE REMAINED AFTER
FIVE YEARS.
HE HAD A GREAT OUTLOOK.
&gt;&gt; WOW.
&gt;&gt; HE WAS MAKING JOKES AND
REALLY COMING AROUND.
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.
&gt;&gt; THAT IS REMARKABLE.
I MEAN, YOUR INSIGHT ON THIS IS
SO FASCINATING.
AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE THINKING OF
ALL OF THESE WHO ARE GOING TO BE
RELEASED.
ROBERT D'AMICO, THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US.
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.",20231124

WHEN WILL THIS WAR END?
WHO WILL REMAIN TO TELL PEOPLE
WHAT HAPPENED TO US?
WHAT WE LIVED THROUGH, WHAT WE
WITNESSED.
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: JOMANA KARADSHEH,
CNN, LONDON.
&gt;&gt;&gt; HAPPENING NOW, THE TRUCE
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS APPEARS
TO BE HOLDING.
MEANING OTHER PIECES OF THE DEAL
ARE KICKING INTO GEAR.
CONVOY OF UNITED NATIONS TRUCKS
PACKED WITH TONS OF HUMANITARIAN
AID NOW MOVING IN TO GAZA VIA
THE RAFAH CROSSING.
LET'S SPEAK TO ELENI GIOKOS WHO
IS LIVE FOR US IN CAIRO.
SO PLAYING OUT AS YOU EXPECTED.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF
AID.
NOT QUITE ENOUGH, NOT NEARLY
ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM
THERE, BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT
THAT THOSE TRUCKS ARE GOING IN.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IT IS SIGNIFICANT.
AND IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY WAY MORE
THAN WE'VE SEEN SINCE OCTOBER 7.
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT
BEFORE THE WAR BEGAN, THERE WERE
OVER 445 TRUCKS GOING INTO GAZA
ON A DAILY BASIS ON A GOOD DAY.
SO THIS WAS A POPULATION THAT
ALREADY HEAVILY RELIED ON AID.
AND THEN YOU SEE THE WAR
BREAKING OUT AND NOW WE ARE
HEARING THAT JUST ABSOLUTE
CATASTROPHIC SCENARIOS ON THE
GROUND AND REI WILL RATED BY THE
INTERNATIONAL AID ORGANIZATIONS.
BUT I WANT TO TAKE YOU THROUGH
WHAT WE'VE SEEN TODAY.
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT HOW MANY TRUCKS HAVE BEEN
GATHERING AT THE BORDER OVER THE
LAST FEW DAYS IN ANTICIPATION
FOR THIS TRUCE TO KICK IN.
BECAUSE THERE IS AN
UNDERSTANDING OF JUST HOW MANY
DELAYS OCCUR BECAUSE OF THE
CHECKPOINTS, BECAUSE THEY NEED
TO FIGURE OUT THE LOGISTICS.
NOT ONLY ON THE EGYPTIAN SIDE,
BUT ALSO ONCE THEY CROSS OVER
INTO GAZA.
90 AID TRUCKS HAVE NOW GONE INTO
THE GAZA SIDE OF THE BORDER,
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT.
SO THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH THE
INITIAL CHECKPOINTS, THEY THEN
GET CHECKED ON THE ISRAELI SIDE
AS WELL.
AND THEN OFFLOADED AND MOVED
STRAIGHT INTO GAZA.
SEVEN FUEL TRUCKS AS WELL GOING
IN.
IDF SAY THAT THE GAS QUOTA THAT
HAS GONE IN ALREADY TODAY IS
SPECIFICALLY FOR COOKING
PURPOSES FOR HUMANITARIAN NEEDS
AND HUMANITARIAN INFRASTRUCTURE.
THEY HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR TO SAY
THAT THIS WAS PART OF THE DEAL.
OVERALL OVER FOUR DAYS, 200 AID
TRUCKS ARE EXPECTED GO IN,
130,000 LITERS OF DIESEL FUEL
TOGETHER WITH OTHER GAS TRUCKS
AS WELL EXPECTED TO GO IN.
YOU'VE REITERATED THE POINT IT
IS A FRACTION OF THE NEEDS EVEN
QATARIS SAY THAT YESTERDAY, YOU
KNOW, THE TESTIMONIES WE'VE
HEARD FROM PEOPLE INSIDE OF
GAZA, THAT THEY WERE SCRAMBLING
FOR JUST PIECES OF BREAD,
RUNNING OUT OF WATER, DRINKING
DIRTY WATER AND OF COURSE
DISEASES PLAYING OUT RIGHT NOW
WHICH HAS CREATED ANOTHER LAYER
OF THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.
WE ALSO HAVE HEARD
EGYPTIANS THAT PALESTINIANS
STRANDED IN EGYPT, IF THEY WISH
TO RETURN TO GAZA, THEY ARE ABLE
TO DO SO THROUGH RAFAH.
THAT IS QUITE IMPORTANT TO
REMEMBER.
WE'VE HEARD SOME MOVEMENT ON
THAT THAT IT COULD BE OCCURRING
TODAY.
INJURED PALESTINIANS ARE COMING
THROUGH THE RAFAH BORDER, SO TOO
ARE FOREIGN NATIONALS AND DUAL
PASSPORT HOLDERS.
JUST TODAY SEEING SOME OF THE
IMAGES GOING THROUGH, THERE WERE
ACTUALLY BANNERS ON SOME OF
THESE TRUCKS THAT READ TOGETHER
FOR HUMANITY AND THEN ALSO FOR
OUR BROTHERS IN GAZA.
SO EVERYONE TRYING TO TAKE AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WINDOW THAT
HAS OPENED UP, BUT THE
LOGISTICAL SIDE WE SHOULD NOT
FORGET WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE
AID DISTRIBUTED IN THE SOUTH OF
GAZA IN THE VERY LEAST.
&gt;&gt; AND SPEAKING TO OXFAM
EARLIER, THEY WERE DESCRIBING
HOW THEY HAVE THIS HUGE
CHALLENGE BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT
OF AID AGENCIES THAT WERE USING
CROSSINGS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND
GAZA IN THE PAST, AND THEY HAVE
HAD TO MOVE ALL OF THEIR
LOGISTICS, ALL OF THEIR
OPERATIONS INTO EGYPT, WHICH HAS
BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE.
SO THIS HASN'T BEEN EASY GETTING
THOSE TRUCKS THERE FOR A START.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: YEAH, EXACTLY.
AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IS
JUST CAN WE GET MORE AID INTO
GAZA.
BUT IT IS THE WAREHOUSING AND
LOGISTICAL SIDE OF  CHAINS THAT
THINK OF.
AND THEY HAVE TO BE OFFLOADED
INTO TRUCKS BY THE RED CRESCENT.
SO THERE IS SO MANY ELEMENTS TO
THIS AND IT IS ALSO THE
CHECKPOINTS THAT REALLY SLOW
THINGS DOWN.
U.N. FAR IT INMARTIN GRIFFITH S
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN A PART OF
THE DEAL IN TERMS OF THE FUEL
QUESTION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STICKING POINT
BECAUSE IT COULD END UP IN THE
HANDS OF HAMAS.
&gt;&gt; ELENI GIOKOS, THANK YOU.
WE'LL BE WITH YOU WITHOUT THE
DAY AS THE AID TRICKLES IN.",20231124
IX2lBOesLO4,Cheers erupt as Red Cross convoy passes through Rafah crossing,data/en_CNN\Cheers erupt as Red Cross convoy passes through Rafah crossing.jpg,"Just to
speak to the significance
of what it means here in Israel.
Everywhere you go,
you see the fliers of these hostages,
the ones that you see in the U.S.
and London and other countries.
And you can see there,
that is the convoy.
We don't know who's inside this convoy,
but you can see, John, that convoy
making its way
through the Rafah
crossing
that is a crossing between Gaza and Egypt
right now.
You can hear cheers
and horns honking
on
again.
We're looking at pictures
right now
from the Rafah crossing of a convoy
moving through with beeping
and honking at the Red Cross convoy.
We cannot know for certain
who is part of that convoy right now,
if the hostages are part of it.
But you did hear some honking,
some celebration there.
Unclear to me
exactly where that celebration
would be coming from
if it was
the Red Cross
convoy carrying those hostages.
But we are seeing that activity at Rafah
right here, which will be a key
transit point, Katelyn,
for these hostages as they move through.
And you brought up another point here.
One of the things, the developments
the twists
today is not
only has the number of hostages
been turned over
from Hamas
to the Red
Cross, believed to be Israeli hostages,
but several
Thai hostages, people
from Thailand who had been held.
We understand
they've been turned over as well.
And it's not completely clear
if those two groups are traveling
together or separate
at this point, Kaitlin?
Yeah, that is still something
that we're trying to figure out.
And this is a really fast moving process.
I mean, it's taking time for them
to get from place to place.
But there are several different layers
of government
involved here, different governments
that are involved in this process.
This had been something
that as we were hearing,
as Israel and Hamas
were getting closer to this deal,
which was being negotiated by Qatar,
that there were also questions
of other governments
also negotiating
for their foreign nationals
who were being held by Hamas in Gaza
to also be released.
You know, a lot of these
that we had heard of
that had been taken into into Gaza.
The point of this
and what we were hearing
as we were talking about this
from the ideological perspective is
a lot of these were laborers
who were at the kibbutz.
And that is something that we heard,
you know, when I went to kibbutz
is a theme.
They talked about the laborers
who had just been been working there
at that
that particular kibbutz
and the fact that they had
also been taken hostage.
Some of these are people who
they're not Jewish they're not Israeli.
Yet they were also taken by Hamas
into Gaza.
And so that is something
we're watching with the numbers here,
because that has been
another critical part of this
is that ultimately
we're told
it's 50 hostages that are being released.
We got this additional information
just a short time ago
ago from Egyptian officials
that these Thai nationals
are also part of this.
It is still a question
of whether or not
they are moving in this group together,
whether all of them were in that convoy
that we saw just passed
through the Rafah crossing.
Those are things
that we'll have better clarity on
once they've made it through.
We do know
Israel expects
to publish a list of
who has made it into Israel.
Once those hostages have made it here.
They said they will not do so beforehand.
And so that is something
that we're watching very closely.
I know
CNN's international anchor Becky Anderson
also tracking this closely.
And Becky,
you've been checking in
with sources
about the Thai nationals
who are also being released
by Hamas today.
What else are you hearing about?
Not just that,
but also what we just saw happen,
that convoy
the Red Cross convoy passing
through the Rafah crossing.
That's right.
They just left Gaza through that crossing
and they will be making their way
through that crossing on a few.
If you were doing
that as a normal individual,
it would take some time
to get through that crossing.
But clearly,
that Red Cross convoy
will move very quickly
through that crossing and into Egypt.
As we understand it,
this group of Israeli
hostages are traveling in the same convoy
as these Thai nationals,
Thai nationals
and their release was a separate
and unconditional deal and struck.
And separately from the hostage deal,
Hamas, Israel,
that was baked into this wider
humanitarian pause.
I did put this question
about whether there was
any separate tracks being negotiated
by the
country mediators
to the spokesman
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Just yesterday,
and he described this
without answering the question
specifically.
He described this
as a humanitarian effort.
So I think what we can understand
from that
is that the Thai minister
who was here in Doha a week or so ago,
had successfully worked with the country
mediation team with support
from the Egyptians and others,
including the United States.
Of course, he's been
very, very, very involved
in what has been going on between
Israel and Hamas.
The Thais have been able to to pull off
a separate and unconditional deal
to ensure
that some of those Thai nationals
who got caught up in this workers
at these
at these kibbutzim
have also been released.
Now, I think we have to be very clear
that we are not absolutely sure
of the numbers as we understood it.
We were looking at 12
Thai nationals to be released
into ICR hands, ICRC hands today.
And of course as we understood it,
there will be 13
Israeli hostages released by Hamas
as part of the main deal
to be released
into the hands of the ICRC.
I think what we need to do now
is just wait to see
who is in those convoys
as they leave Egypt
and then make their way into Israel
if indeed that is
what the ties are doing.
One probably make a
sort of a loose assumption
that everybody
will be traveling
together now into Israel,
into the hands of the IDF.
And we've been reporting
all morning, haven't we, about the
the sensitivities
with which
the IDF
will be dealing
with those Israeli hostages
and specifically the
and we have to assume that they've got
we know that they got
specific instructions
about how to deal with the
with the kids who've been,
you know, through this traumatic ordeal.
One can I mean, one
can't even imagine it.
I mean, I'm a mom,
but you don't have to be a mom to
to to try and imagine
what it is that everybody's been through,
not least these little kids.
And we don't know who's being released,
specifically the Thai authorities do know
and who is released today in that group.
But what we do know
is that they are all traveling together
in that convoy
you've just seen
go through the Rafah crossing
from the Gaza side, traveling
into the Egypt side
and then into into Israel
as assets things stand at the moment.
Again, we've been saying this
all morning.
We're nearly 2 hours
after
what was the scheduled
release of these hostages.
This has happened
a lot quicker,
I think, than perhaps
many people had anticipated.
And, you know, that's a good thing.
And obviously,
now we just have to
wait to see what happens
when when when we get
some sort of iSight on on these hostages
as they are as they are
delivered to the IDF and then obviously
into the
care of psychologists, hospital
workers, medics,
some are going to need treatment.
We don't know whom
we don't know how they are at this stage.
But this is
at least
just seeing those scenes of that
Red Cross convoy to cheers going through
that border crossing
it just suggests where we are at.
This is the biggest
diplomatic breakthrough
since this conflict began.
Let's remember
just a couple of weeks ago,
the UN Security Council
finally got a resolution through asking
pushing for
not just one,
but multiple humanitarian pauses
at this stage.
We have this one.
It's four days plus an extension
if Hamas are prepared
to release more hostages.
But let's just
see how this goes today,
whether all 25 hostages are indeed
in that convoy, whether those numbers
are sufficient
to suggest that
Hamas has fulfilled its obligations.
We don't know that
because we can't see who's
in those convoys.
But we do know that it was expected
that there would be 13 Israeli
hostages and 12 ties
At this point, it is not clear
how many people are in those calls.",20231124
zvYqPJeFUV8,Young girl exits ambulance at Rafah crossing amid hostage release,data/en_CNN\Young girl exits ambulance at Rafah crossing amid hostage release.jpg,"The number of ambulances there shows you.
Obviously, the concern for the well-being
of each of these individual hostages
being released right now There's Rafa.
Hang on.
There's a little girl
These are live pictures.
This is the first time
we're seeing that right now.
And for the first time,
we just saw a little girl
getting out of one of those ambulances
and walking into a building.
There
could have been that
that was one of the Israeli
hostages, the young children released
not long ago as part of this deal.
Yeah, John,
as we're
watching all of this play out
and waiting
for the identities of these hostages
to be confirmed by Israel,
which they says.
They say that they'll do
once they're safely back in Israel,
though,
we're watching several of them
get out of these emergency vehicles.
We're also learning
more about who they are.
And I'm told by an Israeli source
that most of these hostages,
not all of them,
we don't know that exactly,
but a majority of the hostages
that have been released
just now by Hamas
from Gaza are from Kibbutz near Oz.
And on October 7th,
that was a kibbutz
that saw a lot of devastation
in the October 7th attack.
I believe it was estimated that a quarter
of the population
of the several hundred people who lived
there were either murdered
or kidnaped into Gaza.
And they saw I mean,
it was the kibbutz
where they burned
basically the kindergarten to the ground.
They went into homes.
You heard the testimony from the people
who did survived that attack.
About just how devastating
it was that day
and how it's all some of the worst
violence on October 7th.
John, we're
now seeing, as
we're hearing that they are from Kibbutz
near Oz.
The majority of these hostages right now.
We are watching a line of people
now boarding.
They'd gone inside after getting out, now
getting onto a bus.
You can see an elderly woman
she is stepping
into that white bus
with assistance right here.
And you see a line of people behind her,
some men.
Another woman
we believe we saw a child
at the beginning of the line.
It's unclear
if it was the same child
that we saw earlier.
We know that we
have heard from Egyptian sources
that several of
the hostages
who are being released today,
not just those 13 Israeli
hostages also several
Thai nationals as well,
who were kidnaped by Hamas on that day.
And they appear to be boarding this bus
right in front of us John.
Yeah.
So again,
the question is, what's next is.
Yes.
13 Israeli
hostages, ten
Thai hostages, one Filipino hostage.
We saw a number of them,
but by no means
all boarding that bus right there.
Presumably, some are also receiving
medical care,
might be in the ambulances there.
We are told that the young girl
that we had seen
earlier was at the front of the line.
We're going to try to get a look
at that again.
But boarding that bus, we did clearly see
one child, some older women
and and then men.
Okay.
Let's see if we can see those
pictures again.
Let's take a look at
those pictures again.
At the front of the line there,
you saw a younger girl, an older woman.
Here's a different vantage point there.
A couple older women there
and now what appear to be
a number of the Thai hostages there.
Ten Thai hostages and one Filipino
hostage, perhaps boarding this bus.
That is the Rafah crossing.
We can't be sure where that bus will go,
but it's possible it will head not far.
You're talking about a mere number
of a small handful of kilometers
south to the Kerem Shalom crossing.
And from there,
it would enter Israel here in Egypt
right now.
This group of hostages there,
apparently the Thai men
and also perhaps
one Filipino hostage boarding that bus.
Caitlin, were earlier
we did see the first person to get on
was that girl, that young girl
that we saw.
Now free after 48 days
in captivity, what's next for this bus?
We are not sure.
But within the next several hours,
all of those
people, we
presume will be back inside Israel
Yeah, we believe the next stop for
that bus is going to be here in Israel
where
there is a number of hospitals
that are preparing to receive them.
I mean, they are
this reintegration process
that these hostages
are going to have to go through
isn't just
about their physical well-being,
these medical checkups,
but also
a meeting with a therapist and officials
here to
to talk
about what
they've seen, what they've experienced
in these 48 days
that they have been held.
These people have not known freedom
since October the seventh,
since they were kidnaped
by Hamas into Gaza, where we know from
at least two of the hostages
who were previously released.
They were in a complex
tunnel system underground.
And they had been underground for so long
that when they were released, John,
Light, natural light
sunlight shocked them because they just
hadn't seen it in so long.
And so that's the kind of mindset
that so many of these
these people that you're seeing now
have gone through where
I mean, there are major questions
about what else
those conditions looked like.
But we do know what we've heard
from other hostages
who have been released.
One thing that we were told is as soon as
these hostages, the Israeli hostages
at least made it to the border,
they were going to try to facilitate
a phone call with their family members.
They weren't able to immediately
be reunited with them,
but they at least wanted them
to have that moment,
to have that first conversation
with a loved one
that they have not been able
to have for so long.
And it just
a huge sigh of relief
for so many
of these families
to see this actually unfolding
and obviously still
waiting for them
to actually get here into Israel.
One of the places that we do
expect the hostages to go soon.
And that's the
that's a Reem Airbase
you can see inside Israel.
So Rafah here
and then presumably
they'll move somewhere back
into Israel,
either crossing here or here,
and then travel to the hot
Syrian air base.
That's where our Matthew Chance is
with the latest on what you're seeing.
Matthew,
That's right, John.
Here at
the Syrian air
base, preparations
have been underway for some time
to cater for this arrival,
this first stop in the arrival
of these 13 Israeli hostages,
perhaps the nationals
from Thailand,
in the Philippines as well,
although it's unclear
whether they will be coming
directly here as well.
We're trying to get clarification
on that.
But, yes, it's
going to be a sensitive operation.
You saw those people
heading towards
the bus in the
in the live video
that we've been watching.
And our understanding,
according to Israeli military officials
on the ground here at the airbase
that have been speaking to us,
saying that
the the plan at the moment
is for these hostages to be driven,
these freed hostages to be driven by road
in those both in busses to this airbase.
The reason they're doing that, they said,
is because
helicopter flights can be scary
and they don't want to further traumatize
anybody who hasn't been
on a helicopter before.
That's the reason
they said they're going to
drive them by road.
And so we'll see how that develops.
Obviously,
this is a fast changing
situation on the ground.
And that plan could change.
But whether they come here by bus
or whether they're flown here
in helicopters,
this is the place where we understand
they will be received by
you know, get initial checkups.
They'll be able to make phone calls
to their family members.
They'll be properly looked
at medically
and psychologically to assess
what their immediate needs are given food
and drinks,
a change of clothes,
if that's necessary as well.
It's not clear
whether they're
sitting in the same clothes,
for instance, that they were in
when they're abducted
so violently back on October the seventh.
So they're going to be looked at here.
There are also shower
facilities, things like that.
After that,
they're going to be loaded
onto helicopters and taken to various
hospitals around the country,
particularly close
to Tel Aviv,
depending on
what their exact medical needs
are now in terms of the timing on that.
Once the
the hostages,
if they come by road, once
they once
they get to the border of Israel,
it's going to take about an hour
because about 30 miles
away, a bit longer than that, perhaps
to the border,
getting a
where they come across to this base
and then they're going to be processed
for between half an hour and 2 hours
depending on their specific needs.
And so, you know where where they're
bracing ourselves for several hours now
before these people
sort of arrive here are processed,
and then
finally board
those helicopters
that are waiting for them here
and choppered to there
to the hospitals
elsewhere in the country.
But again,
a very sensitive, delicate and anxious
period underway right now.",20231124
1yhU4tihI44,Biden: Hostage release 'only a start',data/en_CNN\Biden Hostage release 'only a start'.jpg,"Yesterday, families all across America
gathered together their loved ones
and to to give thanks.
We must be thankful for an America
The food in our tables, the family
and loved ones in our homes.
And the many blessings
that come from living
in the greatest nation on earth.
Today,
we can also be thankful of families
being recruited
and reunited
with loved ones
who have been held hostage
for nearly 50 days.
Beginning this morning,
under a deal reached by extensive U.S.
diplomacy, including numerous calls
I've made from the Oval Office to leaders
across the region
fighting in Gaza will halt for four days.
There's still also a structure to allow
a pause
to continue
for more than 50 hostages to be released.
That's our goal this morning.
I've been engaged with my team
as we began
the first difficult days of implementing
this deal.
It's only a start
but so far it's gone well.
Early this morning, 13
Israeli hostages were released,
including an elderly woman,
her grandmother
and mothers with their young children.
Some under the age of six years old.
Separately, several
Thai nationals and Filipino nationals
were also kidnaped by Hamas
on the seventh.
They were released as well.
All of
these hostages have
been through a terrible ordeal.
And this is the beginning
of a long journey of healing for them.
The teddy bear is waiting to greet
those children at the hospital
are a stark reminder of the trauma
these children have been through
and at such a very young age.
Jill and I are Jill's with me here,
keeping them all in our prayers today.
Today
today has been a product,
a lot of hard work
and weeks of personal engagement.
From the moment
Hamas kidnaped these people,
I, along with my team,
have worked around the clock
to secure their release.
We saw the first results of this ever
with the release of two American hostages
in late October,
followed by the release of two
Israeli hostages.
I've consistently pressed for a pause
in the fighting
for two reasons
to accelerate
and expand humanitarian assistance
going into Gaza
and to to facilitate
the release of hostages.
And over the past several weeks,
I've spoken repeatedly
with the emir of Qatar,
the President Sisi of Egypt,
and Prime Minister
Netanyahu of Israel
to help secure this deal,
to nail it down.
And I want to thank all three leaders
for their personal partnership
to get this done.
I spoke with the emir and President
el-Sisi, the prime minister
Netanyahu again on Wednesday
to confirm
the elements of the engagement.
As I said,
today's release
are the start of a process.
We expect more hostages
to be released tomorrow
and more
the day after, more the day after that.
Over the next few days,
we expect
that dozens of hostages
will be returned to their families.
We also remember all those
who are still being held.
And renew our commitment to work
for their release as well.
Two American women and 14 year old child,
Abigail who remains among those missing.
We also will not stop
until we get these hostages brought home
in an answer to their whereabouts.
I remain in personal contact
with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt
and Israel
to make sure this stays on track
and every aspect
of the deal is implemented.
You know,
this extended pause
in the fighting
brings a critical opportunity to deliver
much needed food,
medicine, water
and fuel to the civilians in Gaza.
And we are not wasting one single minute
since my trip to Israel last month.
I've been focused
on accelerating
the delivery
of humanitarian assistance to Gaza
in coordination with the United Nations
and the Red Cross.
I just spoke with my special envoy
for the Middle East
humanitarian issues, David Satterfield,
for an update.
And I've asked him to monitor
our progress hour by hour
and keep me personally informed.
From the beginning.
We put in place mechanisms
to prevent Hamas
from diverting these supplies.
And we're continuing that effort
to make sure
aid gets to the people who need it.
More than 200
trucks arrived
at the crossing point
in Egypt into Gaza today.
These trucks carry food and medicine
as well as fuel, fuel and cooking gas.
The fuel will be used
not only to power the trucks
delivering this lifesaving supplies,
but for desalinization,
for water wells, for hospitals,
and for bakeries.
And hundreds
more trucks are getting them
positioned as well,
ready to enter Gaza
over the coming days to support
the innocent Palestinians
who are suffering greatly
because of this war
that Hamas has unleashed.
Hamas doesn't give a damn about them.
We also look to the future.
As we look to the future,
we have to end this cycle of violence
in the Middle East.
We need to renew our resolve
to pursue this two-State solution,
where Israelis and Palestinians
can one day
live side by side in a two-State solution
with equal measure of freedom and dignity
to states for two peoples.
And it's more important now than ever.
Hamas unleashed this terrorist attack
because they fear
nothing more than Israelis
and Palestinians
living side by side in peace
in order to continue down the path
of terror and violence and killing war.
Did you give Hamas what they seek?
We can't do that.
So today,
let's continue to be thankful
for all the families who are now
and those
who will soon be brought together again.
And I want to once again
thank the emir of Qatar.
President Sisi of Egypt
and Prime Minister Netanyahu
for their partnership
to make what we've done
so far and possible
and for their continued leadership
as we all keep working
to implement this deal.
And over the coming days,
I'll remain engaged with leaders
throughout the Middle East
as we all work together
to build a better future for the region.
A future where this kind of violence
is unthinkable,
a future for all children and region.
Every child,
Jewish, Muslim, Christian,
Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab.
Grow up knowing only peace.
That's what we do.
We're waiting now.
We have just a matter.
I thought maybe even as soon
as by the time I got here,
but in the next hour
or so, we'll know what
the second wave of releases are.
And I'm hopeful that is sensible
as we anticipate.
So thank you all for listening.
I'll take a few questions.
Mr.
President, when will that first
American hostages be released
and so were included today?
We don't know when that will occur,
but we're going to be expected to occur,
and we don't know what
the list of all the hostages are
and when they'll be released.
But we know the numbers.
They're going to be released.
So it's
my hope and expectation would be soon.
And other ten Americans either
unaccounted for
or do not all of our conditions.
Are they all alive?
We don't know all the conditions.
Mr.
President, how long expected
this war is going to take?
Have you heard
Prime Minister Netanyahu's
exact timeline to say
I have encouraged
the prime minister to
to focus on
trying to reduce the number of casualties
while he is attempting
to eliminate Hamas,
which is a legitimate objective.
Yes, that's a difficult task.
And I don't know how long it will take.
My expectation
and hope is that as we move forward,
the rest of the Arab world in the region
is also
putting pressure on all sides
to slow this down,
to bring this to an end
as quickly as we can.
Mr.
President,
what are the chances of a truce
could be extended by a few days?
Or more?
I think the chances are real.
Mr.
President,
there are members of your party
who would like to see
conditions placed on aid to Israel.
What is your view on that?
They would like to see
the adoption
Well, I think that works well for it.
But I don't think
if I started off with that,
we haven't gotten to where we are today.
We have to take this
a piece of the time Mr.
President, you trust Hamas, but
I don't trust Hamas to do anything right.
I only trust Hamas to respond to pressure
from the center,
hoping to get cooperation
from Arab leaders.
What are you hearing from them
when you talk to them?
What do you want to see?
I'm hearing a lot,
but I'm not going to speak to it
right now.
There's an overwhelming desire
on the part of the region
to let me back up.
I cannot prove what I'm about to say.
But I believe one of the reasons
why Hamas struck when they did
was they knew that
I was working
very closely with the Saudis
and others in the region.
To bring peace to the region
by having recognition of Israel
and Israel's right to exist.
You may recall
when we did the G-20
about a little while ago,
I was able to get a resolution.
I made a statement passed through there
saying we're going to build a railroad
from Riyadh
all the way
through the Middle East
into into Saudi Arabia, Israel, etc.,
and all the way up to Europe,
not the not the railroad,
but being an underground pipeline
and then railroad.
The whole idea
is there's overwhelming interest.
And I think most Arab nations know it
and coordinating with one another
to change the dynamic in their region
for a longer term peace.
And that is
what I'm going to continue to work on.
Thank you all very, very much.
I appreciate it. Thank you.
Happy Thanksgiving to all
I hope you enjoy.",20231124
HNPh803AUEA,Videos show civilian hostages released by Hamas,data/en_CNN\Videos show civilian hostages released by Hamas.jpg,"The breaking news
this hour,
an outpouring of emotion here in Israel
as Hamas releases
24 hostages kidnaped back on October 7th.
CNN's Matthew Chance has details,
including a closer
look at the video
Hamas released of the hostage handoff.
Inside Gaza.
They kidnaped and killed,
but now Hamas is showing its gunmen
releasing Israelis in Gaza.
For many, these are disturbing scenes.
Nine year old Ohad Munda
being embraced as he set free,
an old woman
being carried by a masked man.
His Palestine lions cheer
after
49 long days of captivity in Gaza.
Aid workers from the Red Cross
drive them through the border into Egypt
and to freedom.
Fiction television
shows a convoy of vehicles
heading to the crossing.
Then the hostages, including ten Thais,
a Filipino
and the 13 Israeli women and children
disembarking for checks.
Israeli military posted this
grainy video
of the moment
they all finally reentered the country.
A step says the Israeli prime
minister, towards
bringing all hostages home.
Islam, whatever the visual, we shall.
We have just completed the return
of the first of our hostages,
children, their mothers
and additional women.
Each one of them is a whole world.
But I emphasize to you, the families
and to you citizens of Israel,
we are committed to return
all our hostages.
Most of the hostages
released in this first group
under the temporary truce
were taken from near ORs,
one of the small Israeli
communities near Gaza
ravaged by Hamas on October the seventh.
At least 38 people there were killed
and more than 70 abducted that day.
People like Danielle Aloni
and her five year
old daughter Emilia,
both freed in this latest release.
But the relatives they were visiting
when Hamas attacked
remain unaccounted for as hostages.
Behind every release, a poignant
reminder of those left behind.
Like the family of Omri Almog,
his brother in law and niece
killed his sister
and her three children still hostages.
Yet Omri is now optimistic.
The best is in front of us.
It's going to come.
Whatever happened, we cannot change.
The dove is no longer with us.
The beautiful girl is.
Is not with us anymore.
But there's still a chance.
Still a chance. Your sister?
Yes. Yes.
We have to bring what's left
within to bring back
what's left from this family.
It's a broken family.
A broken family in a country
of shattered lives.
Matthew Chance is joining me
live here in Tel Aviv right now.
So, first of all, Matthew,
what do we know
about what is expected to happen
tomorrow?
Well, we think, Wolf,
that it's going to follow a similar kind
of course already.
The Israeli officials
that we spoken to said that Mossad
and the Israeli military
have received a list
of potential hostage
releases from Hamas via
the mediators in Qatar have told us
is on the list.
Of course,
we don't even know
how many names are on that list.
It's between ten and 13
like it was today.
But Israeli officials say
that they've already informed
the families involved
so they can be prepared
to, you know, welcome back
their loved ones.
I think you have to remember
that the events of today,
the pause in the fighting,
the releases of the of the hostages
and the prisoners from Israeli jails,
as well as the humanitarian relief
it went remarkably well.
And so I think the hope is that
that can be repeated again and again.
Let's hope it does get repeated
if these hostages are able to come home.
Matthew, thank you very much.
Matthew Chance reporting.
I want to go to CNN's Oren Liebermann
right now.
He's over at the Wolfson Medical Center
here in Tel Aviv.
Oren,
I know you're at this hospital
where hostages have arrived.
Update our viewers.
What did you actually see?
Well, Wolf, this is one
of several hospitals
that have taken in the freed hostages
over the course of the past
several hours.
At about 9:00 tonight,
two patients,
two of the first freed
hostages, arrived by ambulance
a couple of hours after that.
Take a look at this video.
This is three more elderly women
hostages being brought in on helicopter.
There actually is no helipad
here at the hospital itself.
So they landed
at a field nearby
and were brought in on ambulance.
Take a look at this
video of the hostages
being loaded onto the ambulances.
The cheers,
the unbridled joy,
the happiness
as they were loaded here in Israel
and brought to the
brought to the hospital for care.
It is that same joy
that played out in the hospital itself,
according to the staff
here, when they were brought in,
when they were welcomed
and when they began
to receive
the professional medical care of Wolfson
Medical Center. Listen to this.
I think that there was no one
in the room
that could hold these feelings
and stop crying
because it was a very emotional
and exciting event.
They met their families and they met
a very professional, a team here
that was very good, prepared to receive
those hostages.
Now, the hospital wouldn't say
all that much about their condition,
their well-being or their mental state.
They said they're going to respect
the privacy of the five hostages
that are here.
They have set up a special
wing of the hospital
just for them and their families
as they go through all of the checks,
all of the medical evaluations.
And it's not just a question
of their physical health.
It's also a question
of their mental health.
Right now,
psychologists brought in,
as well as other professionals,
to essentially give them any type of help
they might need.
The critical first step
was reuniting them with their family.
That happened here several hours ago.
And crucially,
it's not a one time deal here.
This isn't a process
that began and ended.
The hospital
well aware
that there might be more elderly
freed hostages coming out of Gaza
over the course of the next several days.
And they say they are very much ready
to receive them as well,
with the same sort of open arms
to begin that recovery process.
Oren Wolfson
is not the only Israeli hospital
where hostages were taken today.
How is that working?
You're absolutely right.
Wolfson will focus on the elderly.
The five freed hostages
who were brought here were elderly women.
But there are other hospitals
that will focus on different populations
or groups.
So Schneider Medical Center,
which is in Petah Tikva,
not all that far from us
that will focus on the children
who are freed.
And they have set up
essentially a special area
to try to make it
feel as little as possible,
like a hospital.
They want it to feel
almost like a luxury hotel
to make them as comfortable as possible.
Wolf, another example of software warfare
that is set up to receive
the foreign nationals,
and that's part of the system
here in place
for the freeing of the hostages.
Oren Liebermann reporting from Tel Aviv.
Oren, thank you very much.
President Biden says he hopes and expects
American hostages
will be freed very soon,
even though none were released on this
the first day of the truce.
CNN's Arlette Sines
is traveling with the president
in Nantucket,
Massachusetts, for us right now.
Arlette, how is the president
feeling about this deal so far?
Well, Wolf, President Biden welcomed
the initial release
that occurred of these hostages
being held by Hamas earlier today.
He said that this was
just a start
to the process,
but said that he believes
that this had unfolded Well,
but it does come as Americans
were not included
in that initial batch of hostages
that were released to
the president said that
it is his hope
and expectation
that there will be three Americans
coming out in the coming days.
That includes two women.
And also for your four year
old Abigail Oden.
It was her birthday on Friday.
Her parents were killed on the
in the October 7th attack by Hamas.
And she has been held
hostage over the course of the past
seven weeks.
But President Biden
had very few details to offer as
relating to his expectation
on what exactly
these Americans would be getting out.
Take a listen to what he had to tell
reporters earlier today.
We don't know when that
will occur,
but we're going to expect it to occur.
And we don't know what
the list of all the hostages are
and when they'll be released.
But we know the numbers.
They're going to be released
soon as my hope
and expectation will be soon.
And of the ten Americans
that are unaccounted for,
do you know all of their conditions?
Are they all alive?
We don't know all the conditions.
So still a number of unanswered questions
about the fate of these American hostages
being held by Hamas.
The President Biden today
also expressed
some optimism that this fight,
this pause in the fighting
that's currently slated for
for four days,
he believes that
that could possibly be extended
to get even more
than the 50 women and children
that had been initially negotiated
in this initial deal.
Now, President
Biden has been working the phones
throughout the week,
including the leaders of Egypt,
Qatar and Israel.
He said that he will remain in contact
with those leaders
and counterparts in the region
as they are trying to make sure
that this deal stays on track.

Sr_jubWhmZM,US has 'reason to believe' American will be released by Hamas during exchange,data/en_CNN\US has 'reason to believe' American will be released by Hamas during exchange.jpg,"Here with me
now is White House National Security
adviser Jake Sullivan.
Thank you so much for being here
this morning.
An Israeli official told CNN
that at least one
American citizen
is expected to be part of today's
release of hostages.
Can you confirm
how many Americans are on that list?
And do you know who they are yet?
Well, just taking a step back then,
the 50 hostages that were part of this
initial four day deal,
those were women and children.
And there are three Americans
who fall into that category,
two women and one child.
Now, we know those three were missing.
We cannot
say for certain
whether all three of them
are still alive.
But we do know this.
We have reason to believe that today
one American will be released.
And I say reason to believe
because I want to be cautious
about making any firm statements
until we actually see that individual
crossed the border to safety
and ultimately be reunited
with their family.
We're dealing with Hamas.
We are in a don't trust but verify
situation here.
And so we have reason to believe
that there will be
an American released today.
We have been in close touch
with the Israelis, with the Qataris,
with the Egyptians
over the last 24 hours.
President Biden
has been personally engaged
with the emir of Qatar on this issue.
And so today should be a good day,
a joyful day.
But until we actually see
it happen,
understanding to remain
really at the edge of our seats. Yeah.
And that's completely understandable.
Having said that,
do you have reason to believe
that the American you're talking about is
four year old Abigail Dunn?
Here's what I'll say.
We are now hopeful that Abigail
will be released,
reunited with her family.
She turned four just two days ago.
She has been through hell.
She had her
parents killed right in front of her
and has been held
hostage for the last several weeks.
We are hopeful that she will be released.
I'm not going to confirm that it's today,
but I am going to say
that we have
growing optimism about Abigail
and we will now
watch and see what happens.
Jake, later in the show, I'm
going to talk to the parents
of a 22 year old IDF soldier
who is an American citizen.
Do you have any information
on his condition
and that of other Americans
still in captivity?
And is there any progress
towards bringing them home?
Ten of which of the IDF soldiers?
Are you referring to his.
His name is Omar Neutra.
I actually had the opportunity
to meet his parents at the White House,
along with the family members
of other American hostages and I know
just listening to them
that they are going through incredible
pain and uncertainty and difficulty.
And I can't even imagine
what that could possibly feel like.
I told them directly
and and we've been candid
about what we know
and don't know that
we do not know
the specific whereabouts
or condition of Omar or other Americans,
because until the end of this deal,
until the end of tomorrow,
we will not have from the Red Cross
proof of life or other information
related to their ability
to visit hostages.
So as we learn that information,
we will absolutely
share it with the parents.
But no, I do not sitting here today.
I'm not in a position
to confirm the precise
condition or whereabouts of Omar
or other American hostages.
You said that
you hope that you will get information
from the Red Cross, though,
after this initial deal is complete.
Prime Minister Netanyahu said that
that also said
that the Red Cross
would be allowed to visit hostages
still being held by Hamas
to ascertain their status.
But Israeli officials
say it hasn't happened.
Did Hamas, in fact, agree to that?
And do you have confidence
that it will happen?
If so.
That is part of the deal.
We expect it will happen.
I'm not going to characterize myself
as confident in anything right now
because, again, we're in a don't trust
but verify circumstance.
But we do believe that Hamas is obliged
to maintain its part of the commitment
on Red Cross visitation of the hostages.
And we expect Qatar in Egypt
and other countries
to hold Hamas accountable
to fulfill that commitment
by the end of tomorrow.
Israeli officials are signaling
that they plan to resume their offensive,
the military offensive,
as soon as this pause expires.
The defense
minister, Yoav Gallant,
said yesterday, quote,
Any further negotiations will be
held under fire.
Is Israel rejecting calls from the U.S.
to hold off on its offensive
in order to try to continue negotiations?
Well, first, Stan,
just to
be clear about the terms of this deal,
Israel has already agreed
that it will continue
to pause fighting day by day
after the end of the four days
as long as Hamas
keeps releasing hostages.
So the ball is really in Hamas's court.
If Hamas wants to see in it
an extension of the pause in fighting,
it can continue to release hostages.
If it chooses not to release hostages,
then the end of the pause is
its responsibility,
not Israel's,
because it is holding these hostages
completely illegitimately
and against all bounds of human decency.
So just to be clear, though.
Really, we will see what Hamas ends up
choosing to do. Yeah.
So to be clear, if Hamas, after this
four day pause is over,
says, okay, here's
the next list of hostages
that we will release,
Israel will continue its military pause.
No question.
That is correct.
Ten hostages per day
for as many days as Hamas releases
ten hostages.
Israel will continue the pause
in the fighting.
That's part of the terms of the deal
that Israel agreed to.
That's a commitment Israel has made.
And now, as I said before,
the ball is in Hamas's court.
Have any of the hostages
who have been freed
provided any insight or intelligence
to Israel and U.S.
officials that could help locate
those still in Gaza?
We are just at the beginning
of learning
about the debriefings of those hostages.
So I will withhold comment until
there can be more time
for that to take place.
We're just talking about
the last couple of days
that hostages have been released
in the early hours
have really been much more
about caring for their trauma,
their pain, and also getting them
reunited with their families.
So it's going to take a little while
for us
to get that information,
for Israel to get that information.
But you can be sure that Israel
is focused on learning anything
it can about whereabouts,
locations and other information
based on conversations
they have with the released hostages
in the days ahead.
Another major
aspect of this deal
is that it is allowing
for significant amounts
of desperately needed
humanitarian aid,
fuel, medicine, water,
food to enter Gaza.
President Biden said
there are mechanisms in place
to ensure those supplies
go to civilians and not Hamas.
What are those
mechanisms and do you have any indication
that they have been in place
or has Hamas actually benefited
from this pause?
Well, first, Dan,
there's the inspection mechanism.
The Israelis at a
crossing called Nitzan to
check all of the trucks before they go
in through the Rafah crossing into Gaza.
And they checked to make sure that it is,
in fact, humanitarian supplies
and not goods that could help Hamas
in its military campaign.
Second, those trucks go to U.N.
depots
and to other humanitarian organizations
that are vetted and trusted partners.
And once they are in the hands
of the United Nations
and humanitarian organizations,
they are distributed
directly to the people.
And we have seen this work
over the course of the last
several weeks
as humanitarian assistance has ramped up.
We've seen it work
that it's actually getting to people
and that it's not being diverted
into the hands of Hamas.
But that's something
that we have to continue
to focus on, on an ongoing basis.
President Biden stays in close
touch with the Israeli
leadership on this, with the U.N.
leadership and with others
to make sure, in fact,
the aid is getting to where it belongs,
which is the innocent people
who are suffering.
I want to look ahead a little bit
and ask about Prime Minister Netanyahu,
because he is,
as you well know,
in a precarious domestic
political situation.
He knows that
as soon as this war
with Hamas is over, he's
going to face questions
that he's been putting off
about the failure to prevent
the October seven attacks.
Questions about his
tenure as prime minister.
Is there any concern
inside the Biden administration
that Netanyahu doesn't
necessarily
see it as being in his interest
to end this war as quickly as possible?
Look,
I'm not going to
speculate on Israeli politics.
What we're going to do
is just stay focused on
who's sitting in the chair
of Prime minister,
and that is Prime Minister
Netanyahu, and deal with him
straight up
on the issues
that we are confronting today.
And President Biden has been able,
through his direct diplomacy
with Prime Minister
Netanyahu, as well as his diplomacy
with Arab leaders
to generate the introduction
of humanitarian assistance,
the safe departure of foreign nationals,
including Americans from Gaza.
The first pause
in the fighting in 50 days
since this conflict began.
And hostage releases.
So President Biden
believes that his engagement
with Prime Minister
Netanyahu has paid dividends.
He's going to continue
to focus on that high level,
direct leader to leader diplomacy
and leave others to determine
the politics,
the political considerations.
We'll stay focused on the task at hand.",20231126
VCgcvGM2QUU,Why retired general thinks hostage exchange is a 'net loss' for Israel,data/en_CNN\Why retired general thinks hostage exchange is a 'net loss' for Israel.jpg,"Let's bring in now
this is General Wesley Clark,
former NATO's
NATO's supreme allied commander
and CNN military analyst.
General, good to have you.
I just want to first start
before I ask you a question.
We've just got an update from Israeli
officials on the number of hostages
they believe
are still being held by Hamas.
That number is 201.
They they know that this is inconsistent
with the number that has happened before.
But these numbers,
as you know,
and our viewers can understand, fluctuate
based on information coming in
so that Israel
now believes there are 201 hostages
taken October 7th who are still in Gaza.
Let me ask you about the strategy
moving forward
and what the military is gaining
and losing during this period.
The surveillance drones for a
period are not flying over Gaza.
They're not bombing the tunnels
as they have been for seven weeks.
At the end of this truce,
is it a net gain or loss
as it relates to that mission
of ending Hamas?
They'll lose potentially
some intelligence
but gain some from the hostages.
What do you see
we get at the end of this?
From the Israeli perspective.
I think from the military perspective
in Israel, it's a it's a net loss.
And military in Israel
is going to look at this
as first Hamas is has been
dedicated to the destruction of Israel.
They proved
they're willing to go very far along,
which they are considered
an existential threat.
And if Israeli military
looked to the north
and they see Hezbollah
and they ask themselves
if Hamas gets away with this and survives
this, what will that say to Hezbollah?
And what can Hezbollah do on the north,
to Israel
if they decide
to follow the same tactics?
And so there's a lot riding on this.
But the Israeli military
has got to listen to political authority.
There's a lot of political pressure
coming from Washington
and also from the Israeli public.
Get those hostages free.
Then we'll worry about what happens next.
Hamas knows this.
Hamas is playing it like a fiddle.
They release hostages.
They're prepared to squeeze
if they don't get exactly what they want.
They want more food. They want more fuel.
They ultimately want global opinion, too,
and an Israeli opinion
to hold the Israeli military operations.
Hamas then emerges victorious.
There are heroes in the Islamic world,
or at least in the Palestinian view.
And this then gives them a major victory.
Israel maybe gets its people back.
Maybe not all of them.
And Israel shudders.
Israeli military shudders, thinking
what's going to happen next,
especially if Iran gets a nuclear weapon.
So if you think this truce is a net loss
for the IDF,
let me ask you plainly,
do you think the President Biden is wrong
in his suggestion that
this truce should be extended
at the end of the four days?
I think President Biden is
walking a narrow line.
On the one hand, our military
and the Israeli military know
what needs to be done with Hamas.
But it is ugly.
It's causing civilian casualties.
There is no way to go after a mosque
without inflicting a certain amount
of casualties
on civilians who are not Hamas.
And so this puts a lot of pressure
on the United States.
We've got other global objectives.
We're not solely dedicated to Israel.
We've got to worry about our relations
with allies, relationships in the region.
And our longer
objective, longer
term was to get the Saudis,
the Kuwaitis and others
in the region
aligned with Israel
so that we could end this issue.
So we've got the longer term
to think about.
It's a tough position for the president.
Got to get the American hostages out,
try to prevail on the Israelis
to limit the damage to civilians.
Ultimately, the Israelis have to decide,
are they going
after the destruction of Hamas
at all costs
or do they have to balance this
with their relationship with the West
and especially with the United States?
And is the destruction of Hamas
even an achievable goal?
The the political and military
angle of it may end, but the ideology,
could it come back?
Will it come back in some other name
or form? General Wesley Clark.
Thank you so much for being with us.",20231126
kBLvPKT3R6k,Biden confirms 4-year-old Abigail Edan among hostages released,data/en_CNN\Biden confirms 4-year-old Abigail Edan among hostages released.jpg,"A little girl named Abigail
turned four years old.
She spent her birthday that birthday,
at least 50 days
before that held hostage by Hamas.
Today, she's free.
And Jill
and I, together,
as so many Americans, are praying for
the fact that she is going to be
all right.
You know, she's free
and she's in Israel now.
And so those who are now wrapping Abigail
in loving care,
the supportive services she needs.
She's been through a terrible trauma.
You know,
her mom was killed in front of her
when it
when a kibbutz
was attacked by Hamas terrorists
on October 7th.
Abigail ran to her dad there,
who then was gunned
down, gunned down as well,
while using his body
to shield little Abigail.
She then ran to a neighbor for help
where they were all taken hostage.
That entire house and neighbors
were taken hostage by Hamas
and held for 50 days.
What she endured is unthinkable.
Abigail was among 13 hostages
released today from Gaza.
Under that brokered and sustained,
though intensive U.S. diplomacy.
She's now safely in Israel
and we continue to press
and expect four additional Americans
will be released as well.
We will not stop working
until every hostage is returned
to their loved ones.
As I said
when I spoke about this deal on Friday,
this has been the product
of a lot of hard work
and weeks of personal engagement
for me and my team.
We have been in close contact
with the leaders of Qatar,
Egypt and Israel,
speaking with each one of them repeatedly
over the past few weeks
to help secure this deal.
We spoke again yesterday
with the emir of Qatar.
I owe special
thanks to in order to keep the hostages
release on track
and push for Abigail
to be part of this release.
And I'll be speaking again shortly
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
And we will continue
to remain personally engaged,
personally engaged to see that
this deal
is fully implemented
and work to extend the deal as well.
For weeks,
I've been advocating a pause
in the fighting
for two purposes
to increase
the assistance,
get into Gaza civilians who need help
and to facilitate release of hostages.
We know that innocent children
in Gaza are suffering greatly as well
because this war
that Hamas has unleashed
is so has such consequences.
Thousands have been killed
and from the earliest days
of this crisis.
I've worked closely
with President Sisi of Egypt,
the Israeli government,
and King Abdullah of Jordan, and leaders
throughout the region to expand
the delivery
of critical humanitarian assistance
to help innocent Palestinians in need.
We're not part of Hamas under this deal.
The fighting in Gaza
has now been paused for three days.
Over that time,
58 hostages have been released,
including two Thai,
Filipino and Russian nationals.
Dozens of families have been reunited.
And we worked urgently,
urgently to take advantage of the pause
to surge aid into Gaza.
We've moved
approximately 200
aid trucks into Gaza each day,
loaded with food,
water, medicine, fuel and cooking gas.
More is needed.
But this deal is delivering
life saving results.
Critically needed aid is going in
and hostages are coming out
and they're still structured
so that it can be extended
to keep building on these results.
That's my goal.
That's our goal to keep this pause
going beyond tomorrow
so that we can continue
to see more hostages
come out
and surge more humanitarian relief
into into those.
And who in need in Gaza.
We've seen
this is a day by day
approach, hour by hour process.
Nothing is guaranteed
and nothing is being taken for granted.
But the proof that this is working
and worth pursuing further
is in every smile
and every grateful tears
we see
on the faces of those families
who are finally getting
back together again.
The proof is little Abigail.
More than 20 other children, 18 years
and younger, have been released.
They've been released
through this deal as well.
They've endured a terrible ordeal.
They can now begin
the long journey toward healing.
I'm going to continue working
with the emir of Qatar,
President Sisi, Egypt,
Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel,
to do everything possible
to see the hostages are freed.
All the hostages.
I'm grateful for the personal partnership
as we pursued this deal
from each of those men I just mentioned.
As we work together to see the and see
all this implement
and now to try to extend it further.
I continue working with all our partners
to take the hard
but necessary steps
to build an integrated
and more prosperous
and more peaceful future in the region.
A two state solution is the only way
to guarantee
the long term security of both Israelis
and Palestinian people,
to make sure
Israel and Palestinians alike
live in equal measure
of freedom and dignity.
We will not give up on working
toward that goal.
Thank you very much.
Thank God she's home.
I just can't
imagine the enjoyment in it.
I just wish I were there to hold her.
Mr. President.
Do you have an update
on the other Americans
who are being held in any sense
as to when they would be released?
We are hopeful,
but I don't have anything firmly
to tell you at this moment.
So do you expect that
if you are able to use this momentum
to extend the pause,
have you extracted any guarantees
about proof of life for other hostages,
or do you have an expectation
of how much longer you can push this?
Well, look, you know, the deal calls for
for every
for every ten hostages
released to extend another day.
So I'm hopeful this is not the end
that's going to continue.
But we don't know. And
but I get a sense that
all the players in the region,
even the neighbors who aren't
and we have been directly involved
now are looking for a way to end this.
So the hostages are all released.
And Hamas is just completely,
how can I say
no longer in control
of any portion of Gaza?
Do they have control
of all of the hostages?
Are there
still other militant groups
that you have to deal with?
We think there are probably other
militant groups. We're not certain.
Mr. President, Mr.
President, how is Abigail doing?
What's her physical condition?
Well, I haven't gotten that information.
I just want to let you know immediately
they were going to cross into Egypt.
As you recall,
that was a group
about an older, non-American,
elderly, elderly woman is very sick
who was in need of immediate
medical help.
So they arranged to cross
directly into Israel
to be able to take her to a hospital.
All I know is that she was being held.
I don't know.
I haven't seen a photograph.
I've just been
in communication with my team.
But she is safely ensconced in Israel.
But there's a lot more work to be done.
How many days would you like
to see the hospital on board?
I would like to see
us move to a point where we were able to.
Well, let me put it this way.
I'd like to see the pause go on.
As long as prisoners kept coming out.
All right.
Thank you all so very much.
I know.
You know, we have to call you.
I know
you say why
she called me
with only 10 minutes or so and
I said, that's No.
Two sided because we didn't know.
I didn't want to be having
this press conference
if they weren't physically
even when they were
in the Red Cross ambulance.
I didn't want to do it
because they were not out there.
They were still in Gaza.
So I don't thank you enough
and thanks for your patience.
And I know we're here.
All right.
So I was doing okay.
Happy hour as you guys.",20231126
EBoxkeoi6IQ,Israel's president: Hamas' 'passive-aggressive' approach is an attempt to drive Israel 'crazy',data/en_CNN\Israel's president Hamas' 'passive-aggressive' approach is an attempt to drive Israel 'crazy'.jpg,"This is a really
precarious moment
in Israel's history right now,
as I'm sure you and I agree.
Israel's been at war now
for more than 50 days against Hamas.
Given what happened back on October 7th,
three days
into this temporary truce right now,
how meaningful is it, Mr.
President, right now
for Israelis to see
at least some good news,
some of the hostages
being reunited with their families?
It is extremely important because we see
we see human beings who are in the abyss
and without knowing their whereabouts
and their fate,
as well as the fact that they themselves
are totally secluded
and disconnected
from the rest of the world.
The fact that you see young girls,
a young boy
or a grandmother is walking soul
and going to Israeli hospitals
and coming back and meeting
their families is a huge emotional storm.
And something that gives us a happiness.
But of course, happiness
with a lot of sorrow it
because there are at least 200
hostages still held out there in Hamas
under Hamas duress,
somewhere in in bunkers somewhere.
And without knowing what they are,
what the how they live
and what their whereabouts.
Some family torn apart.
Most of the hostages that were released
have still family members left behind,
meaning tearing their families apart.
And as you can see
throughout the last few days,
Hamas is threatening on now psychology
with a kind of a
passive aggressive approach
which wants to drive us as a nation crazy
because of the emotions failed
and because of the extreme pain
and worry of so many relatives
to their friends
and family who are out there in Gaza.
As you
know, Israel's
defense minister, Yoav Gallant,
said yesterday, and I'm quoting him now,
any further negotiations
will be held under fire, end quote.
Is he effectively closing the door
to extending the truce?
So we have to remember that
there are a few more days
of release of the hostages
while Israel is releasing terrorists
who are charged
and present
for telling activities, including
and taking
and lives of people
or threatening to take lives of people.
And this is a very gruesome process.
So I don't want to speak
about the next step,
but it is clear to us
that if we want to prevent
further turmoil against Israel from Gaza
and change the future of the Middle East
and the way the Palestinians
have some hope,
the only way to do it in a humane way
in order to
to protect the human values in the region
is by uprooting Hamas.
And that will
lead to the fact
that we have to take further action
and undermine Hamas's
military capabilities.
I'm anxious to get your thought.
If Hamas agrees to another day,
another few days of this truce
in order to release
more Israeli hostages,
should Israel accept that?
So that is already being negotiated.
First of all,
it was agreed in the original agreement,
which has been violated
constantly by Hamas,
but still implemented piecemeal,
that if they bring
another ten prisoners on. So
the exact number and forces
in the agreement itself,
there will be an extension
of another day of humanitarian pause.
So that is already agreed.
They can definitely
bring many more hostages
and release them.
They they kind of said
that they don't know
where they on the whereabouts are.
That looks to us totally false
because they've been controlling Gaza
to the last iota
for the last 20 odd years
in a very cruel regime
that didn't let anybody move
without their permission.
So that is why I truly hope
that in this instance,
they will release more and more
and they will get more
and more humanitarian pauses
as to what happens afterwards,
it is clear that we intend
to complete the task,
meaning undermine
the military capabilities of Hamas
as an entity and enable
a different future
for those who live near the border,
for Israelis
and Palestinians,
for the ability
to undermine this empire of evil
which operates from Tehran
and of course, impacts the entire region.
So I just want to be precise, Mr.
President,
in order to get more
Israeli hostages released,
do you think Israel should agree
to extend the truce?
So it depends.
So far, the agreement speaks about.
The agreement was for four.
Days,
but it says specifically
that any additional ten
or so hostages released,
there would be another day
of humanitarian pause.
And that is what is being
implemented as to what happens next.
There is a Qatari delegation
in Israel today
and I think they are talking
to the relevant authorities
in the
Israeli government as to the next phase.
So you are open to extending the truce.
So, again,
the way you interpret and interpret
the word truce is complicated.
We've already agreed
we made it public
that if
and above that for the initial four days,
there's not
a release of further prisoners
ten per day or something of 1011.
I don't have the exact numbers.
We will extend the humanitarian pause
and meaning the truce.
That's the way you call it. A pause.
Yes. Yeah.
And but our clear intention is to go in
and complete the job
because we must not enable this
base of terror on this
platform of terror,
which was taken over by a cruel code,
a time 2007 by Hamas to continue.
And how would you expect
anybody who went through these
horrific torments and the horrific scene
and this barbaric attack on October 7th
with rape and torture
and beheading and shopping and
and mutilating bodies
and abducting hostages,
how do you expect
anybody to go back there
if there's no complete
and to this threat?
So let's talk a little bit
about looking down the road
after this war with Hamas.
You have said Israel and I'm
quoting now,
can't leave a vacuum in Gaza.
So will Gaza be governed by a revitalized
Palestinian Authority
as President Biden has proposed?
So this is something really important
to go into and discuss
because people have to be serious
if we want to prevent
a recurrence of further terrible
if we want to go into a stable horizon
in the region,
we have to be lucid about it.
Is there any force
in the world, in the region,
which is willing to take over
and run the place
in terms of the security
and preventing further whores,
sadistic and barbaric jihadist activity?
Somebody has to say who it's going to be
when there are nations
who say we won't have boots on the ground
when there are nations and say,
of course not.
We leave the dirty job to you guys.
So when Israel says right
now, the security
and well-being of this place
in terms of this security element,
meaning fighting terror
and forcing law and order adjudicating
and so forth,
will stay in Israeli hands
until there is an agreement.
One has to build the alternative.
The alternative
needs to be discussed in there in various
key places
and see what's next in the interim,
there has to be a major humanitarian aid
and a major humanitarian effort
in this respect.
For example, I commend the hospital,
which is being built now
in Rafah by the United Arab Emirates.
There are other countries
who are making similar efforts
and we commend them as well.
But the most advanced projects so far,
for example,
for another
new hospital in the Gaza
Strip is done by United Arab Emirates.
And yesterday
the trucks came in in order
to build this hospital in Rafah.
So there should be an overall effort
to make something that makes sense for
the future
on the well-being
of Israelis and Palestinians.
What should the governing authority
of Gaza be after after this Israel
Hamas war
if it's not the Palestinian Authority?
I've been saying it long,
many, many times.
And I'll say it again
this is not only a war between
Israel and Hamas.
This is actually a war that defends
the real values of liberal
and democratic countries,
all countries who believe
in the rules
of the family of nations,
as opposed to an empire of evil,
which is an empire of jihadis
which believe only in eradicating
all of us out of here,
not only Jews, but also Christians.
And the next will be Europe
and the United States.
So that is what the war is all about.
And therefore,
how you come out of the war, meaning
how do you make sure
that what will come out of the war
will promise
regional security
and stability, will promise peace
or, let's say, seizing of fire and tell
this is the key
and this has to be analyzed
clearly and in a very punctual way,
not slogans.
I heard President Biden's
speech on Friday, and from his vacation,
and I.
I truly welcome these words.
I mean, these were important words
as he spoke
about the fact
that there is an empire of evil,
which wants to undermine
all the peace processes in the region.
It is clear
that what Hamas did under
the instructions of Iran,
is to undermine the ability
of further peace agreements
following the Abraham
Accords, also peace agreement
with Saudi Arabia, and also
and offering a huge, huge connection
between Europe all the
way down to Australia.",20231126

the details as you understand it,
inside the Israeli government
of this extended truce?
So I think we we
we have to say the following.
Before we talk about extending the deal,
we have to implement the current deal.
And we're waiting for the last batch
of hostages of women and children
who are supposed
to be released this evening.
And until they are safely on Israeli
soil,
we can say that the four day agreement
for the 50 hostages has been implemented.
Having said that,
my prime minister
spoke publicly last night and he was
His remarks were reported on CNN.
He said that we are open to the extension
of this humanitarian pause
and for as your reporter
said quite correctly,
for every ten hostages
released,
we are willing
to give an extension of another day.
And if Hamas will release
Israeli hostages as agreed,
we will extend.
That's that's the bottom line.
So that means if it's going
to be extended for two more days
and I understand
what you're saying
about what's going to happen today,
and I'll get to that in a minute.
But just staying on this deal
that was just announced inside

House, is also confirming
if it is
one day, one more day of a truce
for every ten hostages, if it's two days.
Presumably that means Hamas has agreed
to 20 additional hostages after today.
That's correct.
Once again, the parameters were set
and these were negotiated
with the help of President Biden.
And we thank him for being
putting his effort
and his office
behind behind these arrangements.
We wouldn't have
I don't think we would have
reached the deal without his input.
And yes, it was agreed.
Every extra day
we get ten hostages
and we will stand by that.
Were they so far?
They have only been women and children.
And that was the.
And those are
the parameters of this initial deal.
What about the extension?
Will men be included there?
My understanding is that there's still
enough women and children in Gaza held
by Hamas
that can fill that for the next 20 years.
Hamas is responsible
for all the hostages.
They are, unfortunately,
but they are the government
there in Gaza.
They control the situation on the ground.
The cessation of fighting
has given them the opportunity
to to get defined every last hostage.
And we're expecting tonight
to see the final group
of women and children.
And hopefully in the coming days,
we'll see more
Can you just expand on what you just said
and how you started
in this interview
talking about the current situation?
What is the holdup?
You said that there is a holdup.
What is the sticking point
when it comes to the group of women
and children expected to be
released today?
As you know, this is the fourth
and final
release
in the framework of the four days.
But as you know,
I think it was only last night
that they actually got out on time
on the first day
and the second day, there were delays,
there were last minute crises.
There were all sorts of problems.
And the truth is,
we have to remember
who we're dealing with.
We're dealing with a ruthless,
fanatical terrorist organization, Hamas.
And it's always like pulling teeth.
I mean, it's difficult It's never easy.
And that's why I urge let's
wait to see what happens tonight
that we see our people,
the released hostages
safely on Israeli soil.
I mean, last night
we had 13 Israeli
women and children released.
The youngest was that four year old
American Israeli Abigail Dunn.
Right.
She was kidnaped when she was three.
So you have to ask,
what sort of people kidnap 33 year olds?
Right.
And I think that tells you everything
you need to know about Hamas and explains
why it's so difficult.
These people are ruthless.
And if they think there's an advantage
in them
for for perpetuating
the suffering of these innocent civilians
and their families in Israel,
they will do
so if they think it's in their interest.
Well, she was three
and her parents were also according
to President Biden,
murdered brutally right in front of movie
on October 7th.
So I completely take your point.
Having said that, the
they are the organization
that you have to deal with
because they are the ones
who have these women and children.
So given that reality by that unfortunate
reality that you are dealing with,
what is the status as far as you know,
of those
who are supposed to come out today?
So, once again, we have received
some some good signals,
but until they are on Israeli soil,
it's not done
We can't celebrate.
And it's the same for the families
who've been waiting for these people
for over 50 days now.
And once again,
once they are on Israeli soil,
we can say it has been done.
But we're all
we've got to be cautious with Hamas.
You've got to be cautious.
You need
nerves of steel
when you're dealing
with these sort of people.
Marc,
I want to ask about
one of the sticking points
over the weekend, which was that
there was a child released without
her mother, the Rotem family,
HeLa was
released, and her mother was not Raya.
What is your understanding at this point
of why that is, particularly now,
since you have been able
to officials in your government
have been able to speak
with the daughter
about the last time she saw her mother?
Can you give any more information
about that?
I can only say the following, Donna.
And to release a young child
without a parent,
that is the most inhumane thing
to release a daughter
and for the mother to stay in captivity.
Once again,
that is a nother manifestation of what
we're dealing with,
that these people
are heartless, these people are depraved.
These people lack any sense
of common decency.
And that is our enemy.
And when the fight against
Hamas is resumed,
I want people to remember
that Israel is fighting a ruthless
and despicable terrorist organization.
And when we defeat them, as we will,
that won't just be good for Israel.
Our people deserve to live in safety.
And in security.
And it's not to fear of
terrorists crossing the border
in the middle of the night
and butchering their children.
But the people of Gaza
also deserve better.
Hamas has been ruling Gaza for six years.
And what have they brought?
The people of Gaza
just suffering and pain and poverty.
And everyone in this region
will be better off without Hamas
Just, if I may.
You described the
the unfortunate human situation here.
Terrible human, barbaric human situation.
But what about the
why are you concerned that her mother
and others
have been separated from Hamas
and are now in captivity by other groups
inside Gaza?
Look, from Israel's perspective,
Hamas can't subcontract out
any responsibility.
They are responsible.
And the reason for the pause
was not to give any excuses because,
you know, if they were
if Israel continued attacking,
they could say, well, we couldn't
get out of our bunker
to find the hostages.
They've had now four days of pause.
They're the guys that control the Gaza
Strip.
Unfortunately, I wish it wasn't the case.
It soon won't be the case.
But at the moment, they're in charge
and they are responsible
for all the hostages.
Mark Regev, thank you for your time.
Appreciate it.
Thanks for having me.
And, Wolf,
I want to bring you back in now.
Your reaction
knowing not only Mark Regev,
but knowing the situation
as well as you do to the news there.
I mean, I will say, obviously,
he confirmed this deal,
but at the end,
he talked about
when the military operation resumes,
not if when
Well, the Israeli Defense Ministry,
the Israeli the IDF,
the Israeli political leadership,
the war cabinet,
they are all basically on the same page
saying that
after they obviously
want to get all the Israeli hostages,
all the hostages
out of Gaza and back to Israel, that's
obviously a top priority,
if not the top priority.
But they're also saying that
even after that,
they're going to continue
their struggle against Hamas.
They don't want Hamas to be in charge
of Gaza
because they fear that
what happened on October 7th
could happen again.
So they're going to continue
to go after Hamas and resume
their military activity
whether air strikes or ground assault.
They're making it abundantly clear
that is not going to stop
it stopping
as long as this temporary truce
and they call it a truce a pause.
They're not calling it a cease fire
as long as this is going on.
They're going to pause
in the Israeli
military action against Hamas.
But they are making it abundantly clear
that is not going to pause forever.
They're going to go after Hamas.
And that's going to be very significant.",20231127
k808GLtoVck,Father of 9-year-old hostage reveals what daughter told him after her release,data/en_CNN\Father of 9-year-old hostage reveals what daughter told him after her release.jpg,"Nearly two months after
being ripped from their homes
and torn apart from their families,
freed hostages are returning
to completely different lives in Israel.
Some of them are waiting
for other family members to be released.
Others are just learning
for the first time
that their loved ones
were killed by Hamas.
Clarissa Ward
spoke with one father, Thomas hand.
You might remember him.
He initially thought
that his daughter had been killed.
He was actually grateful for it because
of what he imagined Hamas might do to her.
Then he found out that she was alive.
And now nine year old Emily is home safe
and she is slowly sharing the details
of what happened to her after
she was kidnaped by Hamas on October 7th.
So the jets should be here
in a couple of minutes like, oh,
family and
all of a sudden the door opened up
and just ran.
It was beautiful.
Just like in
just like I had imagined it,
you know, running together.
I squeezed the probably squeezed too hard.
It was a moment
Thomas had thought would never come.
Told his nine year old daughter
Emily had been killed in the October
7th attacks, then that she was believed
to be held hostage in Gaza,
finally reunited with her family
after 50 days in captivity free,
but visibly haunted by her ordeal.
The most
shocking, disturbing
part of the meeting was
she was trying to bring
I had to put my ear on her lips
like this, closed
and say, what did you say?
I thought you said
I thought you were kidnaped.
She thought I was in
captivity.
And what has she told you?
About what she's gone through?
I thought she was in the tunnels,
but she wasn't in the tunnels.
They were actually
fleeing from house to house.
She didn't like it.
People prefer referred to as Gaza.
She says the cuffs, that the box.
So you have to say, like,
how long were you in the box?
The coop?
She said, a year.
And apart from the whispering,
that was like
a punch in the gut.
There's that one photograph
right after your reunion
and you're holding her. And
there is this sort of seriousness
to her facial expression.
Yeah, she's.
She's almost staring, isn't she?
She a disconnect with everything
going on around her.
Has she cried? I
said last night
she cried
until her face was red and blotchy.
She couldn't stop. She.
She didn't want any comfort.
I think.
I guess
she's forgotten how to be comforted.
I just had to wait
until she came out of it by herself.
And she knows how to do that.
She's a very determined little girl,
very strong.
I knew that her spirit
would get her through it.
There have been glimpses of the old Emily
happily walking the family dog, Jauncey,
but many moments of pain,
like when Thomas was forced to break
the news to her
that his ex-wife Naki, had been killed.
Does Emily understand
what happened on October 7th?
Yeah.
Yeah, unfortunately she does.
And how do you tell her?
You know,
your second numbers dead, killed, shot.
When we got back to the hospital
after psychiatrist.
You know what? Weather.
What should I do? What should I do?
She said you've just got to tell her
straight.
The best way.
Okay?
Yeah, that was.
That was very hard,
because we told her and,
you know, her little eyes closed up
and she just went
to the shop shopping and take a breath.
Terrible thing to tell, child.
And as they recommend
that, you have to close the book.
It sounds cruel,
but you have to stop that hope.
So you you you've got to stop that.
It has to be. I know.
Oh, kisses.
That.
And so.
What is the next step now?
How long do you stay here?
How do you start a new life?
The future is obviously
to get Emily back to health.
And we will do that along the way.
But the next thing is, along the way
is that we have to get all the children.
Obviously,
all the women, all the men,
all the hostages have to come back.
They have to be brought back.
Now, Jake, you heard Thomas talking about
getting Emily back to health.
Now, she is in good physical condition.
There's no indication
that she was physically abused in any way.
She lost a lot of weight.
She was very, very pale.
She said that they didn't
have enough to eat.
But obviously
there is the psychological component here.
The very fact
that she was only able to whisper because
she's so frightened of raising her voice,
he said that the only word
she appeared to learn in Arabic
was the word for be Quiet,
which gives you an indication of the fear
that she was living through.
He also talked about how she has very bad
head lice,
but all things considered, she is in
reasonably good health physically.
And one other important thing,
when he talks
about bringing the hostages
back, he's very focused at the moment
on the mother of Emily's
very good friend, Kayla.
This is the girl
he had gone to the play date with.
She had gone to the playdate was spend
the night with was kidnaped
with, was held with along with Heller's
mother, Reya Rotem,
who acted like a second mother to her
and then inexplicably at the last minute,
two days before they were
due to be released,
Raya was separated from Emily and Kayla.
You can imagine
Kayla was released with Emily
and the anguish that she is going through
now, being separated from her mother.
And and this is a very important point
for Tom.
As he says,
going forward, we need to keep fighting
for all the hostages, but particularly
for Ryan,
and try to get to the bottom of why it was
that she was separated from her daughter
just ahead of their release.",20231128

of good will, it is merely a problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;
a matter of concern. After October 7th, jewish&nbsp;

isolated. In many ways, we feel alone.

really take up the mantle to speak for Jews&nbsp;

beach when bullets and missiles began to rain
down around them.
He and his friends did manage to escape and
get to an army base and they weren't safe
at all when they got there.
He decided to leave and make a run for his
car, eventually having to abandon it even
after he was shot.
He wrote this harrowing story of survival
and he joins us now to remind people of what
happened on October 7th and to remember his
friend who was killed.
First and foremost, how are you doing?
How is your injury, but more importantly because
I see you standing here before us mentally.
[11:46:14 AM]
mentally.
How are you doing?
&gt;&gt; I'm fine.
I'm really excited to be here.
To give me an opportunity and it's part of
my healing process to talk about it and it's
really helpful.
You know, I need some time.
I think about it a lot.
It's -- it's tough, but I'm fine.
Like, generally fine.
Most of the time I'm sad because I just heard
about the bibas family, it's the first time
I hear about it and it's -- it's break moi
heart.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But I'm fine.
I'm okay.

You're here.
You're breathing.
You're alive and that's really the most important
thing.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; This is a lot to go through.
I read your -- I thought it was a journal
entry, but it just came out of you.
You wrote it first in hebrew and then it was
translated and I want to read a bit of that
because it really struck me this morning and
had me at that point where I was choking up
and I could feel the fear in your
[11:47:14 AM]
could feel the fear in your words.
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; You say in a bit here.
You had gotten to this military installation.
You left because you could see that they were
going to be overwhelmed and the fighting was
coming and you say this, I hear the most dreadful
boom as you're running away, pinging, echoing
against the metal of the vehicle that you
had gotten into be followed by successive
gunshots and popping sounds of death.
Even before I started driving I thought I
had brought extinction to all of us.
Here we are being slaughtered in an intimate,
personal manner, more intimate than sex.
Whoever is shooting at us, knows us and wants
to kill us one by one.
We are a target.
A prize.
They're shooting at us with lust.
I know they wouldn't let go.
This is a new feeling.
The feeling of ending.
We have no chance and here you are.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I'm a very lucky guy.
&gt;&gt; How did you get through it?
&gt;&gt; It was a miracle, to be honest.
It was a miracle, and I didn't think I could
get out, not
[11:48:16 AM]
think I could get out, not alive, not in one
piece, but I'm here and I am stand on both
feet.
I feel really luck, and I still -- like, I
am overwholewomaned.
Still overwhelmed.
&gt;&gt; There's a sense that it's too much to go
through.
&gt;&gt; It was too much.
&gt;&gt; It's too much.
Speaking of too much, you and some of your
friends did survive, you had someone driving
and screaming at him and then you run into
the gunmen who are shooting at you and turn
around, jump out of the car and it catches
fire.
It's something out of a horror movie, really,
but one of your friends did not survive.
Can you tell us about her?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Her name is molgava.
I missed her a lot.
She was walking with me.
She was a cook like I did.

GXU2TMpuluA,Hear what families of Hamas' remaining hostages said about Palestinian civilian deaths,data/en_CNN\Hear what families of Hamas' remaining hostages said about Palestinian civilian deaths.jpg,"For those who still have
family members being held hostage
by Hamas,
the stakes could not be any higher.
And just few minutes ago,
I sat down with five of those families,
five American families with an exclusive,
exclusive interview.
They were gathered in D.C.
to push lawmakers here
and the White House
to do everything
they can
to try to help bring back these Americans
to their homes.
One of the first things
I just want to say is because you are
Americans is
we were
honoring Rosalynn Carter yesterday
and we were talking
about the hostage crisis
because of Jimmy Carter.
And that was the hostage crisis
that we had
where Americans were taking hostage.
And we have another hostage
crisis right now.
And we have Americans in this country
who are actually rooting
for the hostage takers. And
it's
absolutely mind blowing to me.
And as people who have loved ones
who have been taken hostage,
I can't imagine what it's like for you.
And I'm just wondering
what you think
and what you feel when you see people.
I'm not talking about people
marching for Palestinian rights.
That's a separate issue.
But specifically marching
in support of Hamas,
as we know,
those are two different issues.
What is that like?
This shouldn't be a political issue.
This is a strictly humanitarian issue.
You have 240 abducted right now, 160.
This should be,
you know, any person just looking at
this issue should should sympathize.
Think about it.
Could have been your son.
It could have been your daughter,
your mother.
People taken from their beds,
people taken from their houses.
It's it's not the same.
I think it's a lack of education,
whatever it's going on protest wise.
And
to see the Hamas as a freedom
fighter, it's it's fundamentally wrong.
That's what I think.
It's not a Islam issue.
Islam,
if you talk to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
I'm sure he will tell you
Islam is not about raping women,
beheading kids, burning people alive.
So I think people
should understand the facts.
To me, it's just sad and scary, really,
that people
choose to take side or not even look at
what the issue really is
or see our children, our wives,
fathers, you know, as people
for what they are.
They don't even bother
looking at the story.
They just make a judgment
based on lack of facts
and lack of education.
It's just scary to me.
And fortunately,
we've moved to a place
where people want a simple,
evil and good,
and then they make their decision
based upon that.
It's a complicated issue,
and yeah,
you need to spend time to understand it
before formulating an opinion.
Another round of hostages
are going to be released today.
And we're family.
We're told
the families have been notified
and sadly, none of you were notified.
Another another day gone by.
And no, no word of your loved ones.
And I'm just wondering,
I know you're happy
for those who have had loved
ones released.
And but for those of you
who are waiting for word of Omer,
it's really tough.
It's really tough.
I mean,
we're happy to see anyone being released.
But for me personally,
O'Mara is is a man.
He's my son, 22 years old.
He's not in the conversation yet.
And it's it's really bad.
Maybe, Jake, a way to visualize.
Yeah, No time.
Tick tock. Tick tock.
What is that?
Why is there no time?
What what do you
what does that symbolize to you?
Symbolizes after 54 days.
We have no idea on the physical condition
as well. A sign of life.
This is against any international law,
even in times of conflict.
The people walking this planet,
that is basic principles
that are agreed upon.
And in this case, the Hamas
terrorist organization has decided
not to abide by those principles.
We have the International Red
Cross, Doctors Without Borders wanting to
go in and are not allowed in.
Question is why
you guys met with the Red Cross.
What did you have to say to them?
First thing we said was
we want to have signs of life.
We also want to know if
people who are in Gaza
who were hostages
are healthy, what their condition is.
They are the first people that see
these hostages.
We have hostages who are coming back
emaciated.
They've lost lots of weight.
They're dirty.
They have no light in them.
They've been in the dark in so many ways.
They're not healthy.
Yeah.
And the Red Cross is
their responsibility is to transfer them.
But their responsibility also
is to be the voice
and to tell us what is happening.
So while we understand
their fragile position
where they need to be on the ground
and we want them there and they do
good work,
we also want them to advocate
for the folks that are still in Gaza.
So on my show yesterday, we talked about
accounts that we have heard
from loved
ones of hostages who have been released,
a little boy
kept in solitary confinement.
We saw a little girl,
that little Irish Israeli girl.
Clearly,
the light has gone out in her eyes,
talked about being kept in the box.
She thought she was
kept away from her family for a year.
She thought it had been a year.
Another child
shown videos from October 7th.
These are just a handful of accounts.
This is how the kids were
kept.
Also heard about
women being kept in cages.
It's it's just it's awful.
On one hand, it's sick, devastating.
You know, I think the it's depraved.
I mean, it's
it's barbaric,
inhumane, inhumane, inhuman.
Yeah,
I used the word holocaust.
I know I come from
and my family is a Holocaust survivor.
You know,
we feel like it's all over
the Holocaust again, happening to us.
the Israeli military is assessing claims
made by Hamas
that the youngest hostage,
ten month old care givers and his mom
were killed.
Hamas is claiming
that they were killed
by an Israeli air strike.
Obviously, whoever kidnaps
a baby and a mom, they're responsible
for what happens to them
regardless of how they were killed.
I'm wondering
if any of you want to
comment on this awful news.
Again, we don't know if it's even true.
Right.
I think the family came out
with a statement
saying that they are looking at the facts
and hoping for good news.
But that's part
of the psychological warfare
that Hamas is doing.
And going back to Liz's comment
about the International Red Cross.
They need to be the witness.
They are the conscience
of the international community
and need to speak up
and be vocal about what they are saying
and calling them out
for these types of acts
that they are doing.
The whole world needs to speak up.
We don't feel that the
international community is appalled
the way they should be.
It's humanitarian crisis
at the highest level and there don't seem
to be enough outrage out there.
Now, over 30 different nationalities
being held hostage today.
And I think,
you know, we've seen the success
with the release
of some hostages
over the past several days.
And the US government, Israel, Egypt,
Qatar are working together
and I'm really grateful for that.
That's how
my aunt Aviva,
how Abigail have been released.
But there's so many other hostages
who have not yet been released
and time is of the essence.
Do any of you think that
President Biden is not doing enough,
that he needs to be doing more?
It's okay if you feel that way.
If I had a
loved one in captivity,
I probably would think that
nobody's doing enough.
We have heard
President Biden expressing
the hostages is top priority,
but we're still sitting here
54 days later
with eight of us, eight families
still waiting for their loved ones.
Think Biden administration, they do
more than enough since the first day.
But the math shouldn't fool us,
which means
if every day ten people being released,
it doesn't mean necessarily
that the two weeks from now
their remaining 140
something hostages will be out.
So that's the main concern.
You talked about
how you don't think that you're
getting enough support from the world.
And I'm sure you know
that one of the reasons that is
and there are probably many reasons,
but one of the reasons
that is, is because
many people in the world
think that the IDF's response
has killed too many
innocent Palestinians.
The IDF says
they're going
after Hamas and Hamas embeds
with the population
and they're not trying to kill civilians.
But Hamas goes where the population is.
That's the reason.
Do you think that the IDF
should be focusing more,
not just the IDF, that Netanyahu
should be focusing
more on the hostages, getting them out,
saving them,
and the time for going after Hamas
should come later
at the beginning of the conflict.
I think the Israeli government
was more focused on going after Hamas.
I think the fact that the families
have come together,
we each feel collectively
that we have 240 new family members.
And I think the success of the families
being together and being able to unite
around the hostage issue and getting the
people of
Israel behind us
has changed the perception
of the government of Israel.
The hostages have been 54 days.
Somewhere in the dark in Gaza,
it is
an immediate need,
the immediacy
of getting these hostages out.
A young man like Hirsch,
who had his arm blown off,
he doesn't have days to wait.
And so
little people,
big people, mothers, brothers,
young women
who we know are not being treated
well in Gaza.
They need to get out.
And so when we talk about it,
none of us are talking about
this politically.
We're talking about it as a human crisis.
And so for me,
the issue of how do we finish
with the work of Hamas
and getting rid of them,
let's put it aside for a second
and let's just focus on
getting these 150 folks,
people, our family, our relatives out
and getting them safe.
That should be everyone's priority
right now.
All I can say is
I hope that your loved ones
get home soon.
And I know for the ones of you that have
men being held hostage
who are not top priority
because women and children
and older people are being
prioritized, and people in the IDF,
they will be last on the list.
And I'm so sorry for that.
It's time to change this equation.
Right? Who said that?
You know, we where is it coming from?
We believe collectively
that anybody from any group
should be released.
Should be a mixed group from now on.
Yes.
We 100% agree that children being
the sensitive souls that they are,
should have been released first.
But from now on, they should be
a consideration of men and women.
Old and young
soldiers and civilians
still should come out.
They're all the same.
There should be representation
of each and every group coming out.
What do you want anybody watching
right now to know about your loved one?
What should
somebody who's watched this
and is sitting at home afterwards?
What should they know about him?
He don is American kid.
He graduated last year
from Tenafly High School.
He love parties.
He's got tons of friends.
He's a professional swimmer.
He loved the good Life is a real foodie.
Like he knows all the restaurants.
Like we've been in concert everywhere.
Like
he doesn't belong there.
Like dance with a family.
As simple as that.
Yeah. Tell us about that.
What do you want
people to know about Homer Omar
As a kind person?
But when it comes to the room,
he just captured everybody's attention
just because of his
sheer size and kindness.
And. And
he loves
playing basketball and admires
the NBA and the NFL.
Just the American kid.
He belongs at home.
What about Ed?
What do you want us to know about other?
He's a very talented kid.
He sings. He dances.
So he's typically the life of the party.
He has been in the Boy Scouts
until the age of 18.
So he mentors young kids.
And maybe the most important part of his,
he and his older brother play NBA, too.
Okay, so
I get my ass whipped by my eldest son,
so he needs his youngest
younger brother to come back
so he could go back and play with them.
NBA, too.
Emily, tell us about your Uncle Keith.
What do you want us to know about him?
My Uncle Keith is a really gentle,
kind father and grandfather.
He grew up in North Carolina.
That's where I'm from.
And family is just everything to him.
And he needs to be returned
to be with his grandchildren
and his wife and his children.
I want them all home. So.
Thank you for talking to us.",20231129
mAfHpIIPCCM,Retired colonel on what we can expect Israelis to do if truce ends,data/en_CNN\Retired colonel on what we can expect Israelis to do if truce ends.jpg,"Israel has freed 180 Palestinians
from prison over
the first four days of the truce,
mainly women and minors.
Many of them were detained
but never charged.
Prison service officials
say that 30 were released yesterday.
CNN's Ben
Wedeman is live for us in Jerusalem.
Ben, walk us through
the diplomatic efforts
to release more Palestinian prisoners
and detainees.
Where is that conversation now?
Well, that's part
and parcel of the negotiations
over the Israeli hostages as well.
And, of course, tonight
is the last day of the two day extension
that was agreed upon.
And the diplomats are doing their best
to try to work out a formula
to extend it.
We heard Majid Ansari,
the spokesman
for the Qatari foreign minister,
the Qataris,
of course, the linchpin
in these
negotiations,
saying that they are optimistic
that a more an agreement will be reached
to extend it at least for two days.
And, of course, they are now looking
beyond the next two days because
officials negotiators say that
the number of women and children
currently being held in Gaza
will be exhausted after two days.
And then it's going to be a question of
how do you deal with the civilian men
and the Israeli soldiers who are in Gaza?
And our understanding from the
foreign ministry spokesman
is that the next phase
is looking at civilian Israelis
being held inside Gaza.
And we've seen, for instance, yesterday
William Burns, the head of the CIA,
was meeting
with Qatari, Egyptian
and Israeli officials in Doha.
Clearly, they're looking beyond
this phase
where the focus is on releasing
women and children in Gaza.
And, of course,
the similar release of detainees
and prisoners held in Israeli jails.
But at the moment,
there's still is no agreement
for an extension.
So there always is that risk
if no agreement is reached.
If fighting
could begin again, of course.
Ben Wedeman,
thank you so much for that update.
And right now, negotiators are racing
to try to extend the truce
between Israel and Hamas.
The current deal expiring
just hours from now.
This is more hostages arrive in Israel
after being released by Hamas.
Two sources telling CNN that at least one
American hostage is expected
to be handed over in the exchange today.
Let's get more now with CNN's M.J. Lee.
She's live for us at the White House.
M.J., tell us what you're hearing
from the Biden administration.
Well, Brianna,
the White House
is certainly not commenting right now
on CNN's earlier reporting
that an American is expected
to be one of the hostages freed today.
We are, of course,
still waiting for that day.
Six group of hostages to be released.
If that were to happen,
it would mark the second time
that an American citizen is released
during the course of this truce.
But just to remind you
what the White House
had initially said,
they were hoping for and expecting
was for three Americans to be released
as part of the initial group
of 50 women and children.
Of course,
we saw Abigail
adorn the four year old Israeli
American release on Sunday,
but no word whatsoever
from the White House
so far on the two other women
that were supposed to be released
as a part of that initial 50.
So we are still waiting
for those hostages to be released.
And we will learn
whether one American woman
ends up being a part of that release.
But again, no comment on that
right now from the White House.
Part of this agreement, M.J.,
is that the International Red Cross
is supposed to get access
to to check on the hostages
that are still in Gaza,
and that has not happened.
Hamas has not allowed that.
How is the U.S. responding?
Yeah, Brianna, a
part of the deal
really was that the red Cross officials
would be able to go in
and check on the hostages
that are still being held in Gaza,
get a sense of how they're doing
and really be able
to report back on the status
of some of these hostages.
And that has not happened yet.
And we know that U.S.
officials are among
those that are pushing for this to happen
because it was a part of the agreement.
Of course, a lot of people are keen
to get a better sense
of how these hostages are doing,
their conditions, their whereabouts.
Really, we have so little information
to work with right now.
Our understanding
and our reporting is that
even though that does mark
a violation in the agreement,
that it's not at the point
where that is about to derail
this deal,
that it is still going to go on
as long as hostages
continue to be released.
But we saw a statement from the Red Cross
president
saying that they are ready to go in,
but that they can't
really forcibly do that
unless they get permission to do so.
Basically,
they were saying
if they sort of force their force,
their way in
to try to check on these hostages, that
that could end up
actually endangering them.
So that's just one more reminder
of the sort of dangerous
and tenuous circumstances
that we're talking about here.
Yeah, certainly alarming.
And obviously,
officials want to get some information
about those who are still in Gaza.
M.J. Lee live for us at the White House.
Thank you for us.
Meantime,
according to senior administration
officials, the U.S.
has urged Israel
to be more precise
in targeting Hamas in Gaza,
especially in the south,
where many civilians
were told to flee for safety.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health
in the West Bank
says that nearly 15,000 people
have been killed since October 7th.
Tens of thousands more have been injured.
Let's bring in
CNN military analyst, retired
Air Force Colonel Cedric
Leighton to discuss.
Colonel, if Israel agrees to this U.S.
suggestion of a more targeted approach,
what does that actually look like?
So, Boris,
there are a lot of different aspects
to this.
And precision is kind of
in the eye of the beholder.
What you're talking about here
is when you look at the Israeli forces,
the light blue is
where their clearing operations
have taken place.
They're looking
at the northern part of Gaza
and the central part of Gaza,
kind of all around Gaza City.
The dark blue shows that the furthest
this is the furthest point of advancement
for the Israeli forces.
Now, when you talk
about precision strikes, let's do it.
Let's take a quick
look at this video right here, because
this is something that is not precise.
What you're dealing with here is
there are certain aspects of this
where you can see
where they struck certain areas.
But all of this has been obliterated.
That is an example of
not really a precision strike.
This is more of a deliberate strike
that goes across a wide area.
The areas that you're talking about here
are ones that,
you know,
clearly have civilian applications.
You see a washing machine right there.
You see a hole
right here
where a bomb crater
dragged through this particular building.
That's the kind of thing
that if you targeted directly,
that is a precision strike.
But all this rest of this destruction
is not emblematic of a precision strike.
So precision
being in the eye of the beholder.
It appears that there's a difference
between the US definition
of a precision strike and Israeli.
Is that a fair assessment?
That is a fair assessment
because when the Israelis
are looking at this,
they really have certain
they're constrained by
some of the weapons that they have,
but they are also constrained, by the way
in which they employ those weapons.
And one of the key
things that they're doing
is they believe that
they need to take out
a wide swath of this,
these areas,
because, for example,
if you go into the map of Gaza itself,
all of this area right
here was ordered to be evacuated.
And the reason for that
is because of the strikes that we saw
in the example of the video
in Khan Yunis.
The rest of Gaza is also
subject to these kinds of strikes,
and that can really result
in a lot of civilian casualties,
even more than the 15,000
or so that may have been killed
during this period.
Colonel, let's go back to that
initial map,
because we're a few hours
away from this sort of temporary truce
potentially expiring there.
Officials that are working to extend it
right now.
But if it does wind up
expiring and hostilities resume,
where do you see that playing out?
So let's take a look right here at
these areas right here,
of course,
where the Israelis have a presence
right now.
We can expect them to do
is move into these areas
right here, into Gaza City,
basically taking out every single thing
that they can find in in these areas.
They can do that potentially.
They can also come in this way
and cut off the
any retreat by Hamas
from here into the south.
The southern area is one
in which they are hoping
the Israelis
are hoping
to have kind of an area
where they can put
a lot of the civilian population.
They've actually offered an area
up as kind of a safe haven.
But that is something that is very small,
very small area near Khan Yunis.
And it is an area
that is really not conducive
to keeping people there for a long time.
And it's also not conducive
to allowing
for further military operations
in this area,
because you could find
a lot of Hamas fighters in an area
like this, as well as who is
Israel
has kind of double challenges
in this in this particular situation
when it comes to humanitarian aid.
I want to go back
to the video of Khan Younis,
because this, I think, underscores
the point that there is immense
need among the civilian population
in different parts of Gaza.
Obviously, this is just one example.
What happens to the flow
of humanitarian aid
and the aid that's already in Gaza once
hostilities resumed?
So the aid that already is
has been sent into
Gaza is at risk of being destroyed
and stockpiles that they have anything
that could be used, food stuffs,
you know, clothing
during the cold months of the year,
all of these kinds of things.
Shelter obviously,
with this kind of stuff you see.
But that could all be eliminated.
And Khan
Yunis was an area
that was not specifically set aside
for military operations.
It was supposed to be
in a safer part of Gaza.
And you see what's
happened to that already.
Now, Colonel Cedric Clinton, always
appreciate the perspective again.
Right now,
the temporary truce
set to expire in a matter of hours.
Officials are working to extend
that as we speak.
Thanks so much for the perspective,
as always. You bet.",20231129
RT9w72pUJS0,Their loved ones are still held hostage by Hamas. Hear their message to Biden,data/en_CNN\Their loved ones are still held hostage by Hamas. Hear their message to Biden.jpg,"The Israeli military is assessing claims
made by Hamas
that the youngest hostage,
ten month old care givers and his mom
were killed.
Hamas is claiming
that they were killed
by an Israeli air strike.
Obviously, whoever kidnaps
a baby and a mom, they're responsible
for what happens to them
regardless of how they were killed.
I'm wondering
if any of you want to
comment on this awful news.
Again, we don't know if it's even true.
Right.
I think the family came out
with a statement
saying that they are looking at the facts
and hoping for good news.
But that's part
of the psychological warfare
that Hamas is doing.
And going back to Liz's comment
about the International Red Cross.
They need to be the witness.
They are the conscience
of the international community
and need to speak up
and be vocal about what they are saying
and calling them out
for these types of acts
that they are doing.
The whole world needs to speak up.
We don't feel that the
international community is appalled
the way they should be.
It's humanitarian crisis
at the highest level and there don't seem
to be enough outrage out there.
Now, over 30 different nationalities
being held hostage today.
And I think,
you know, we've seen the success
with the release
of some hostages
over the past several days.
And the US government, Israel, Egypt,
Qatar are working together
and I'm really grateful for that.
That's how
my aunt Aviva,
how Abigail have been released.
But there's so many other hostages
who have not yet been released
and time is of the essence.
Do any of you think that
President Biden is not doing enough,
that he needs to be doing more?
It's okay if you feel that way.
If I had a
loved one in captivity,
I probably would think that
nobody's doing enough.
We have heard
President Biden expressing
the hostages is top priority,
but we're still sitting here
54 days later
with eight of us, eight families
still waiting for their loved ones.
Think Biden administration, they do
more than enough since the first day.
But the math shouldn't fool us,
which means
if every day ten people being released,
it doesn't mean necessarily
that the two weeks from now
their remaining 140
something hostages will be out.
So that's the main concern.
You talked about
how you don't think that you're
getting enough support from the world.
And I'm sure you know
that one of the reasons that is
and there are probably many reasons,
but one of the reasons
that is, is because
many people in the world
think that the IDF's response
has killed too many
innocent Palestinians.
The IDF says
they're going
after Hamas and Hamas embeds
with the population
and they're not trying to kill civilians.
But Hamas goes where the population is.
That's the reason.
Do you think that the IDF
should be focusing more,
not just the IDF, that Netanyahu
should be focusing
more on the hostages, getting them out,
saving them,
and the time for going after Hamas
should come later
at the beginning of the conflict.
I think the Israeli government
was more focused on going after Hamas.
I think the fact that the families
have come together,
we each feel collectively
that we have 240 new family members.
And I think the success of the families
being together and being able to unite
around the hostage issue and getting the
people of
Israel behind us
has changed the perception
of the government of Israel.
The hostages have been 54 days.
Somewhere in the dark in Gaza,
it is

A young man like Hirsch,
who had his arm blown off,
he doesn't have days to wait.

They need to get out.

none of us are talking about

the issue of how do we finish

I mean, it really

you've seen this great upsurge.
Now, of course,

we've heard from the IDF
in the last few moments
saying they're preparing ourselv

If that continues, what
what could change in the West Ba
Well, I think
that if
the fighting resumes in Gaza
and we see the kind of bloodshed
the sort of mass
killing of civilians in Gaza,
the situation could become
even more unstable.
Keep in mind
that it's not the Palestinian Au
backed by the United States
and the European Union
and led by Mahmoud Abbas
that's winning the freedom
of these Palestinian prisoners
and the detainees.
It's Hamas
and by and large,
the Palestinian Authority is loo
by most Palestinians in the West
as corrupt and incapable
and powerless when it comes to d
with the Israelis.
That's why, for instance, Jenin,
which technically is under Pales
Authority, control
the Israelis
every time they go into that cit
they drive right in.
The Palestinian police,
who I saw yesterday
when I went to Jenin, disappear.
They put up no resistance.
So the
the structure, the political str
that was established
by the Oslo Accords, sponsored
by the United States,
establishing the Palestinian Aut
that's eroding
as the war in Gaza continues.
If it continues,
and it probably will continue
in the coming days.
So politically, the head
at the top
of the Palestinian Authority is
not particularly stable.",20231130

vu4Txxw9bOo,NYT reporter says Israel knew Hamas's attack plan over a year ago,data/en_CNN\NYT reporter says Israel knew Hamas's attack plan over a year ago.jpg,"Talk about what your team
learned about this blueprint
and the length of time that Israel
had to review these plans and why
it wasn't listened to.
So somewhere around along
2022, Israeli
intelligence was able to get
the plan for the Hamas attack.
It codenamed it was coordinated
by Israeli intelligence,
the wall of Jericho, the Jericho Wall.
Any details?
Many, many,
many different
details of how
the attack is going to take place
exactly as it took place
more than a year after?
This could be an intelligence
victory for for Israel.
But Israeli analysts,
some of the
senior of Israeli intelligence,
saw the plan as more of the goal,
as a compass
for the building of the forces
where Hamas wants to be,
but not with Hamas.
So while having that plan, they saw this
as something that Hamas is far from
being capable of doing.
They believe that Hamas has
doesn't have the ability
to conduct such a massive operation.
We are talking about,
according to that plan,
to break the fence
between Gaza and Israel
in 60 different places.
Israel believed they could do that
maybe in two places.
They called for the bombing
and destruction of the cameras
instantly the same simultaneously,
the beginning of the attack
of the cameras, the automatic guns,
the communication centers,
and then the ramping of the division
headquarters, the Gaza
division headquarters
that is in charge
of protecting the front,
the main in July of this year.
So a year after
an analyst that was reviewing
intercepts about Hamas military exercises
wrote a letter,
an e-mail,
an exchange of email, encrypted e-mail.
She comes from a 200, the Israeli NSA,
the equivalent to the American embassy.
And she described the drill
and she said that
she believes
that Hamas is narrowing the gap between
the wall of Jericho player
and Israel capabilities.
And there was a pushback from
senior most senior
intelligence officer said that told her
this is an imaginary plan.
They cannot do that.
And so here is the tragedy for Israeli
intelligence, for Israeli public,
instead of positioning.
It's not just an intelligence debate.
If Israel
if the Israeli Defense Forces
would adopt this plan,
something that Hamas can do
even without any connection
to the intention of the US
decision to execute,
this is something that the analyst
could say
she did not push back
on the Israeli wisdom
that time,
that time leading three four months ago
that Hamas doesn't want to go to war.
But if the Israeli defense establishment
had the knowledge
that Hamas is capable
of launching such an attack,
that would put a totally different size
of forces on the border.
The outcome could be very different.
Also, according to your
reporting, this analyst,
this woman analyst, we saw
an exercise that Hamas
undertook a trial run
and raised red flags, again, saying
this looks
very much like the Wall of Jericho plan
that we discussed before
and again,
which seem to have been dismissed,
not just that she even has,
she says here's an interesting
bit of information,
the same quote from the Koran
serial murder
that begins with which the
this detailed plan for action,
the still plan for attack
starts with it's call for this.
This is something about Moses,
but it is
it's about this surprise
entry through a gate.
I think it's not the case
that Hamas picked this up.
The people participating,
the Hamas gunmen
participating in that drill
were using the same quote, the same quote
is now part of the emblem of Hamas
used in all Hamas publications
in the statement incidents
since the since the attack.
As you know, the Israeli government
posted online on X last month,
quote, Contrary to the false
claims, under no circumstances
and at no stage was Prime Minister
Netanyahu warned of Hamas's
war intentions.
They went on to say at
no point was a warning given
to Prime Minister Netanyahu
on Hamas's intention to start a war.
On the contrary,
all the defense officials,
including the heads
of the intelligence directorate
and the Shin Bet, assess
that Hamas was deterred.
Do you know if the prime minister
was in fact informed?
Because it sounds like
from your reporting
that this document
was was widely
disseminated in intelligence
in military circles?
Yes.
So we don't
know if Prime Minister Netanyahu got the
was presented with this document.
We do know
and we this comes from previous reporting
that he was warned against again
and again and again.
And it details
at least
four different letters
throughout the last year that the members
of the so-called
axis of resistance, Iran, Hamas,
Hezbollah,
see Israeli weakness
and they might decide to use
what they believe
a window of opportunity to attack.
Yeah, this document was sent to many
and I think this is a good point
for further reporting about who saw
and who decided
to continue
with this so-called conception,
this the
the ability to believe
this Hamas is good thing.
Ronen Bergman, it's incredible reporting.
Thank you.
More now on the forces at play tonight.
Joining us is Alex Marquardt
and Oren Liebermann,
also Axios reporter
and CNN political
and foreign policy analyst.
Barak revealed.
And CNN
military analyst, retired Army
Lieutenant General Mark Hertling.
Brock, first of all,
how damning is this report
for the Israeli government?
Well, I think
this this is part of a series of stories
that appeared in the Israeli
press over the last week or two weeks
that what happens behind them is a fight
between the Israeli
intelligence community or parts of it,
especially the military intelligence
and the political echelon with each side
leaking stuff
that are more comfortable to him
when it comes to everything
that's happened in the year
before the war.
And, you know, a lot of people in Israel
think that the reason that now
we hear about those documents
is because it's
very comfortable for Benjamin
Netanyahu and his people.
And they're trying
to put those things out
in order to build a case
for the inquiry committee
that most likely is going to be formed
on the day after the war. I mean,
as you know,
intelligence officials,
military officials
have accepted responsibility.
Benjamin Netanyahu has not in any form
accepted any responsibility
for the attack on on October 7th.
He had very early on,
right before the the
the operation in Gaza.
He had tweeted out a criticism
of the heads of the military
and intelligence and then quickly
withdrew that tweet
and apologized for for that.
But it certainly seems like
this is something
he wants out there.
No doubt.
By the way,
there was a huge intelligence failure.
It's not that it's not true.
There was a huge intelligence failure.
I just
you know, in one of the emails,
this analyst from Israel
Signals Intelligence Agency,
a 201
of the headlines of one of her emails
that was warning from
this plan
was the headline was
Death in the Kibbutz.
Okay.
How symbolic is that?
Several months ago, death
in the kibbutz, you wrote.
So there was a huge intelligence failure,
not the third level,
but the higher level of the people
who were actually making the decisions.
And that their job is to actually warn
that political echelon
of what was going on.
But at the same time, Netanyahu did
get a lot of other warnings
that had to do also with,
you know, the general situation
where Israel's enemies were planning to
gang up on it
because of the domestic crisis over
Netanyahu's
judicial overhaul in the months
before the war.
Alex, what do you make of this report?
How are U.S. officials likely to react?
Well, Anderson,
I really do
think it goes to this theme
that we've been reporting on
for quite some time
of the underestimation
of what Hamas was capable of doing
and certainly what they intended to do.
You and I have talked
about intelligence
reports and assessments
both on the Israeli
and the American side
in the days
leading up to October 7th
that indicated that Hamas
might do something.
Now, what
that something was expected
to be was what we had seen
before in previous rounds of fighting
that were frankly rather
inconsequential for Israel.
And that would have been
rockets being fired across the border,
which then likely
would have been intercepted
by the Iron Dome,
which is exactly what we're seeing
on our screen right there.
But there was no sense
that Hamas would be able to break
through the friends
fence and carry out
the types of massacres that they did.
There is
acknowledgment
and public
acknowledgment here in the U.S.
from intelligence officials
and Biden administration officials
that this was
purely an Israeli intelligence failure.
American intelligence officials
are not taking any responsibility
for this.
They are laying it
at the feet of the intelligence
apparatus and security apparatus
in Israel.
Essentially, the U.S.
has been so focused on China
and on Russia and Ukraine
that they just don't spend a lot of time
thinking about Hamas
and other Palestinian militant groups.
Now, will that change going forward?
That remains to be seen.
We've certainly seen U.S.
intelligence playing a much bigger role
during this conflict with drones
and other kinds of signals
intelligence gathering.
But in their minds,
this is an Israeli intelligence failure.
I think most will tell you
that Netanyahu
is not expected to survive this.
But there's also an expectation that
the heads of the intelligence agencies,
there's going to be a reckoning.",20231201

MINUTES AFTER THE SEVEN-DAY
TRUCE EXPIRED AT MIDNIGHT
EASTERN TIME.
ISRAEL ACCUSED HAMAS OF BREAKING
THE DEAL BY FIRING A ROCKET.
THE HAMAS-CONTROLLED MINISTRY OF

QATAR'S MINISTRY OF FOREIGN
AFFAIRS, THE KEY INTERMEDIARY
SAYS NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDER WAY
TO PAUSE THE FIGHTING AGAIN.
THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER?
ISRAEL SAYS 137 HOSTAGES ARE

A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS
BEFORE THE TRUCE FELL APART IN
THE FINAL HOURS LAST NIGHT,
HAMAS IS CLAIMING IT DID NOT
HAVE ANY MORE WOMEN OR CHILDREN
HOSTAGES TO EXCHANGE.
ISRAEL SAYS THAT IS NOT TRUE AT
ALL.
THE SAME OFFICIAL TELLS ME HAMAS
DID NOT EVEN SUBMIT A LIST OF
POTENTIAL HOSTAGES FOR RELEASE
LAST NIGHT.

RIGHT NOW?

HAMAS INDICATED THEY WERE READY
TO RESTART FIGHTING IF
NEGOTIATIONS FELL APART.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AROUND 7:00
THIS MORNING.
WE HAVE SEEN THE SKYLINE OF
GAZA, WE HAVE HEARD THE STRIKES
THE IDF IS CARRYING OUT IN GAZA.
THE WAR IS BACK ON AS ISRAEL AND
HAMAS PROMISED.
WE HAVE SEEN ISRAEL CARRYING OUT
STRIKES IN SOUTHERN GAZA, WHERE
THEY SAID THEY WOULD FOCUS THE
SECOND PHASE OF THEIR OPERATION.
ACCORDING TO HEALTH OFFICIALS IN
GAZA, 32 PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN
KILLED IN GAZA IN THE FIRST
HOURS OF THE RESUMPTION OF
FIGHTING.
ISRAEL HAS DROPPED LEAFLETS IN
PARTS OF SOUTHERN GAZA.
INTERESTINGLY, THEY HAVE A QR
CODE THAT BRINGS YOU TO A MAP
WITH GAZA BROKEN UP INTO VERY
TINY PARCELS.
IT SEEMS AS IF ISRAEL IS TRYING
TO EVACUATE THESE PARTS IN AN
ATTEMPT TO AVOID CIVILIAN
CASUALTIES AS THE FIGHTING
RESUMES AT PACE.
SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN WAS
JUST HERE.
HE SAID ISRAEL HAD TO HAVE A
CONCRETE PLAN TO PROTECT
CIVILIANS BEFORE THEY LAUNCHED
THE SECOND PHASE OF THEIR
OPERATION.
THAT IS NOW HERE.
HE ALSO SAID ISRAEL NEEDED A
PLAN FOR MORE HUMANITARIAN
ASSISTANCE AND AID TRUCKS
OUTSIDE OF GAZA, WHICH HAVE
ALREADY BEEN INSPECTED BY
ISRAEL, HAVE NOT GONE IN SINCE
THIS MORNING.
PHIL, IT IS VERY MUCH A QUESTION
OF WHETHER THAT HUMANITARIAN AID
HAS BEEN CUT OFF WITH THE
FIGHTING RESUMED.

THEY ONGOING AT THE PACE THEY
WERE TO EXTEND THIS FROM FOUR
DAYS TO SEVEN DAYS OR HAVE THEY
STOPPED AS WELL?

ARE ONGOING, ACCORDING TO QATARI
AND U.S. OFFICIALS.
THE EFFORT IS VERY MUCH THERE.
IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING WE GOT TO
THE TRUCE THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS
DURING FIGHTING.
WHY DID THEY BREAK DOWN?
ISRAEL BELIEVES THERE ARE ENOUGH
WOMEN AND CHILDREN HELD BY HAMAS
IN GAZA TO CONTINUE FOR AT LEAST
A DAY LONGER.
HAMAS NOT CLEAR THEY AGREE WITH
THAT SENTIMENT.
THEY BLAMED ISRAEL FOR A
BREAKDOWN IN NEGOTIATIONS SAYING
THEY WERE READY TO BEGIN TALKS
ON THE OTHER GROUPS, ELDERLY
WOMEN AND SOLDIERS, WOMEN AND
MEN, TO CONTINUE THE TRUCE AND
RELEASE MORE OF THE HOSTAGES.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A BIGGER

ABOUT TO DO?
&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, POPPY.
WHAT WE'RE SEEING ARE MOVEMENTS
DOWN TO THE SOUTH.
KHAN YUNIS IS RIGHT DOWN HERE.
WHAT THAT DOES IS IT SHOWS THEY
ARE TRYING TO MOVE EVERYBODY
INTO THIS AREA.
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS MAP RIGHT
HERE, THIS IS THE DAMAGE MAP
THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE
PREVIOUS STRIKES, RIGHT IN THIS
AREA.
THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE DAMAGE
HAS OCCURRED IN THE NORTHERN
PART OF GAZA.
THERE IS SOME DAMAGE IN THE
CENTRAL PART.
BUT KHAN YUNIS AND THE AREA
AROUND RAFAH, THEY'VE HAD
MINIMAL DAMAGE.
THEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE EVERYBODY
INTO THE SOUTHERN AREAS.
SO, ALONG THIS -- THESE
EVACUATION ROUTES RIGHT HERE,
THE COASTAL ROAD RIGHT HERE,

WADI GAZA IS THE DIVIDING LINE.
NOW THEY'RE MOVING INTO THE
SOUTHERN PART.
WE BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO TRY
TO HAVE SOME AREAS RIGHT IN HERE
THAT ARE AREAS WHERE THEY'RE
GOING TO BRING THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION INTO THEM.
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, THEY ARE
ALSO GOING TO BE MOVING THEIR
MILITARY FORCES IN THIS AREA.

THE SOUTH, PHIL, IS THAT RIGHT
IN THIS AREA THEY BELIEVE THAT
ALL OF THE HAMAS FIGHTERS RZ
BASICALLY MOVING IN HERE.
THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL STAY IN
THE NORTH, ALTHOUGH IT'S
EXTREMELY DAMAGED.
IN THE SOUTH THEY'RE EXPECTING
THEM TO BE THERE.

IS BASICALLY CALLED SHAPING
OPERATIONS.
THESE SHAPING OPERATIONS ARE
DESIGNED TO MOVE PEOPLE IN
CERTAIN DIRECTIONS.
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE
THE ISRAELIS ARE WORRIED ABOUT
HERE.
THE REFUGEES, THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION, BUT FOR THEM, MORE
IMPORTANTLY FROM A MILITARY
PERSPECTIVE, THE HAMAS FIGHTERS.

WILL BE MOVING IN THESE AREAS AS
WELL, TO BLEND INTO THE CIVILIAN

4l556W2LMzE,Burnett confronts top Israeli official about October 7 intelligence failure,data/en_CNN\Burnett confronts top Israeli official about October 7 intelligence failure.jpg,"According to
The New York Times, Israel
obtained Hamas's battle
plan for October 7th,
more than a year in advance.
And I've seen
some of the documents myself,
ones I saw were dated October 20, 22.
The Times points out
that Hamas documents
that they saw
are shockingly close to reality.
They called for a barrage of rockets
at the outset of the attack.
Hamas did that.
They called
for breaking through the wall.
Hamas did that.
They called for entering via
a paraglider. Hamas did that.
They called for entering via motorcycle.
Hamas did that.
Mark,
to know why this document was dismissed?
Well, it's clear
there was an amazing mishap, a failure.
There's no excuses for it.
And we have to look into this.
We paid for our mistakes
on October
7th in blood
in the blood of
over 1200
Israelis who were who were murdered
and another 240 that were kidnaped
and taken to Gaza.
So we have to take this very seriously.
And we can't accept such a failure.
We pride ourselves as Israelis
for having excellent
intelligence services.
And in this case,
maybe the information there,
it wasn't understood.
It didn't go
up the chain like it should have.
We have to investigate that.
We have to find out
exactly what happened.
You know, 50 years ago, Erin, there was a
a similar colossal intelligence failure
when we were attacked in 1973 on the
Yom Kippur War
from the south by Egypt,
from the north, by Syria.
And we were then taken by surprise.
And we had after that,
we had a commission of inquiry
and lessons were learned
and it was important process for Israel
and we will probably do the same thing
now, I'm sure, when this war is over.
We have to look very carefully
at what happened.
Where was the information?
Why wasn't it understood?
Who is responsible?
Well, so in July, a veteran intelligence
veteran I'm sorry, Israeli
intelligence analyst said
that Hamas had conducted an intense day
long training exercise.
And the analysts said
this appears similar to
what was outlined in the blueprint.
Now, the analyst,
we understand, works for Unit 8200,
which is Israel saying
signals intelligence
agency went ahead and warned higher ups.
And according to encrypted emails
reviewed by The New York Times,
two things then happened.
One, Mark,
is that a colonel in the Gaza
division brushed off the concerns.
And two
is that veteran analysts commented,
and I quote,
I utterly refute that
the scenario is imaginary.
You can almost hear the frustration
in the words
that that analysts chose to use.
Mark, I'm curious
as to what you think as to
why there was such disbelief
when Israel at that point
had the battle plans
and then visual proof of the plans
being practiced.
Why was there still such disbelief?
So all these questions need
to be looked at seriously
and professionally and objectively
and will do this.
It's our obligation.
I mean, ultimately,
Israel will continue to live in a in a
in a challenging neighborhood
and some other
some would even say
a dangerous neighborhood.
And therefore, it's
our obligation
that our intelligence services
have to be good.
And if there are failures,
we have to understand
where the failures happened
and why they happened.
So was the Prime Minister
Netanyahu aware of the Hamas document?
I'm not aware that he was.
I don't know that he was aware he would.
He's said, like everyone else,
that when when the
in their investigations
after this war exactly what happened,
he will, of course,
be there to answer questions
and tell exactly what he was given
and what he wasn't given.
But at this point, you
and he haven't even had a conversation
as to
whether he was aware of these documents.
The New York Times reporting about.
No, not this specific document.
But we have
we have had conversations
on this general level.
But once again, these discussions
we need to discuss
at the right
time in the right time
will be after this war at the moment.
I think all of Israel is focused
on winning this war.
We have to win this war against Hamas
so that October 7th
can never happen again.",20231202
8NklBbp7BMI,Should Congress set conditions on Israel aid? Hear what this representative thinks,data/en_CNN\Should Congress set conditions on Israel aid Hear what this representative thinks.jpg,"Well, the truth is over.
The fighting between Israel
and Hamas is back,
and so is the nightmare
for innocent civilians.
Israel says that it's using.
Q R codes now
and interactive maps
to tell Gazans where to go.
Remember, self-service
and electricity are sparse there.
National Security Council spokesperson
John Kirby was asked on Friday
about the number of civilians
who have already died
since bombing resumed in Gaza,
and he would not say
if the Biden administration
has seen more deliberately
targeting from Israel.
Secretary of State
Antony Blinken had said that
he wanted to see Israeli plans
to protect civilians
before fighting resumed.
This is his latest comment.
I have seen that information
start to get out.
I saw the plans that Israel has in
a multiplicity of ways
to do everything possible
to protect civilians, including
making sure
that they have the information they need
and that there are ways
to accommodate them.
And this is going to be very important
going forward.
And it's something
we're going to be
looking at very closely.
All right.
Now the US is watching,
but is there anything more
that the US could be doing?
One option is adding conditions
to any aid in that
the US provides to Israel.
Some Democratic senators support it.
House Republicans do not.
Now plenty of House Democrats
oppose it, too,
including Congresswoman Debbie
Wasserman Schultz of Florida.
She is on the House
Appropriations Committee
and she joins me now.
It's been a while since we have talked,
so it's good to have you on
the show, Congresswoman.
Thank you very.
Much. Want to join you.
Thank you.
So let's start with why you oppose
putting some conditions
on the multi-billion dollar package
that Israel will most certainly get.
Well,
I think it's important
that we understand here that we are
this is
this is not a situation
where we don't have the ability
to communicate with Israel.
They are a close ally among our closest.
Our intelligence and military
leadership are sitting together
with Israel side by side every day.
That communication
is ongoing at the highest levels,
all the way up to President Biden.
And we are working with them
to make sure,
as they are already
prioritizing, minimizing
civilian casualties.
It's Hamas
that is putting civilians in harm's way,
embedding themselves
and their headquarters underneath
hospitals and U.N.
facilities.
And I mean, that's
where the accountability should lie
and making sure that Israel
can bring their hostages home.
And Hamas released them
and make sure that they can eradicate
the terrorists.
That is what the priority is.
Conditioning aid is not something you do
in an emergency situation with an ally.
So you are right that the
the civilians in Gaza
would not be in this position.
The estimated more than 14,000
who have been killed since October 7th
would not be dead
if not for the October 7th attack.
But if the point that you're making
is that the U.S.
has been sitting side by side with Israel
since the start of this
well, since October 7th,
I understand that.
But since the start of this,
there have been those 14,000 plus killed.
There have been,
according to UNICEF,
5300 children killed.
So if it did not inflow,
which their decision of targeting
before the truce.
Why are you confident
that there will be
anything different now
as they move into the south.
That there is real?
First of all, Israel
is held to a much, much higher standard
when when at war
than any other country on earth.
And they have specifically,
nearly exclusively in a war time,
made sure to notify and communicate
in advance with civilians,
particularly in this
very urbanized environment
that they should get out of harm's way.
Hamas, the terrorist organization
that puts them in harm's way,
prevents them from getting to safety.
And this is a very dense, urbanized area
in which Hamas is not actually
spent the funds that they have
to protect their civilians.
They have said publicly in interviews
that they spend their money
on their tunnel systems
so they can protect themselves.
So Hamas is to blame
for the harm
that is coming to their civilians.
But go where
when you say that the IDF is warning
the civilians to get out of the way.
And I should say that
the leaflets have been dropped
over the cities in southern Gaza
that they are focusing on now,
but they're using QR codes.
We have reported that
how unreliable cell phone
services, the electricity,
the Internet as well.
So I don't know what a QR code does.
Anybody who doesn't have
cell phone service
and doesn't have access to the Internet.
But if the IDF has
told them to move south,
where are they supposed to go now?
What should happen here
is that Hamas should release
the hostages.
They should cease their attacks.
A cease fire that they yet again broke
just yesterday, even before
it was determined
that the truce was not going to continue.
This is on Hamas.
That's where this conflict was started.
They have killed 1400
civilians in
an unprecedented attack in Israel.
It took 248
women, children
and elderly people hostage,
most of whom
they are still holding on to.
Where are the.
Victor,
I wish you were asking me questions
about how Hamas is being held to account.
That is,
Gaza needs to be freed from Hamas
and we already have the ability,
thanks to President Biden.
We are already communicating.
We've gotten dozens and dozens,
actually hundreds
of aid trucks into Israel, into Gaza.
And Hamas
skims off the top
to make sure that they
can reach, fortify,
be struck.
Those trucks are getting in.
Those trucks are getting in
after a nearly month
long blockade on food and fuel and water
and the fuel
obviously
challenging the desalination plant.
But let me ask you about
you say that this is on Hamas.
Yes.
Humanitarian aid for themselves.
I understand.
That. And again.
But here's the question.
You say this is Hamas.
I understand that the
the Israeli government has said
that ending Hamas is the goal.
I think most states across the world,
most countries, can understand that
after what happened on October 7th,
that is is the goal.
But if the goal is to go after Hamas
and there are innocent
civilians between them,
what pressure do you think,
if at all, is required
or is appropriate on on Israel
to prevent the numbers
that we saw in the first
45 days of this war?
We are
with with Israel
effectively communicating that
it is essential that they minimize
civilian casualties,
the Palestinian civilians
that have been killed
as a result of Hamas's brutality
it has is devastating
and it shouldn't be done.
If they don't, then
if there's no consequence
and Congress
is not going to put
any conditions on the aid.
And this is not advocacy,
I'm just saying.
What then is the consequence for Israel?
What do you mean by if they don't?
I mean, we're already in a situation
where worldwide, including the U.N.,
U.N.
women and others,
have not even condemned Hamas
for their attacks,
and they haven't condemned them
for the brutal sexual violence.
I mean,
Israel is under a situation
where it's me, too, unless you're a Jew.
And the higher standard
that Israel is held to in wartime
when they have suffered
a incredibly brutal attack, is
why are they inappropriate
in an emergency
And this disproportionate accountability
that is that Israel is being held
to when Hamas completely controls
the ability to cease
to cease the war
and releasing the hostages
and ending their commitment
to eradicating Israel and killing Jews.
All right, Congresswoman Debbie, what.
In their report?
Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz,
thank you so much for being with me.
Good to see you again. Thanks.",20231202
1-CC53G5asI,Hear Jayapal's response after Bash says some have been silent about Hamas' use of sexual violence,data/en_CNN\Hear Jayapal's response after Bash says some have been silent about Hamas' use of sexual violence.jpg,"With the
collapse of the temporary truce
between Israel and Hamas
here in the US,
democratic divisions
over the direction of the war
and Biden's support for Israel
are once again on full display.
Here with me
now is House Progressive Caucus
Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal.
Thank you for coming.
It's nice to see you in person.
Let's start with where we are right now
with with the war.
The White House says very clearly
that Hamas is to blame for the collapse
of this temporary truce
for a few reasons.
One is that they refuse
to release the remaining women,
some of whom
sounds like
most of whom are 20 to 30 year old women
there hostage inside Gaza.
They also renewed the military attacks
against Israel.
You have repeatedly called
for Israel to implement
an indefinite cease fire.
But given what we have
just seen with what I just described.
Is that realistic?
Well, it's
what has to happen
and I do think it's realistic.
I think what we saw is after
you know, many weeks
of saying we couldn't
get to a cease fire,
that was not going to happen.
We did have a temporary cease fire.
And what happened,
we were able to see
a significant number of hostages
released.
We were able to get
humanitarian aid into Gaza.
And I think the long term plan for
what happens is incredibly important.
Now, you've seen Vice President
Harris made a very strong
statement yesterday.
Secretary Defense Secretary
Lloyd Austin also was very clear
that if you engage in urban warfare
in the way that Israel did
in northern Gaza,
what you will do is perhaps win
a temporary victory
or a reprieve
but you're not going to win the long term
strategic war.
So the only way, Dana, to get through
this is to make sure that we,
first of all,
do not have the kinds of casualties
that we saw in northern Gaza.
There's no way to do that
with the kind of war that Israel
is waging right now on Gaza.
A couple of things.
One is you said it worked. Yes.
There were hostages who were released,
but it wasn't even an actual hard
cease fire.
They were just trying to get another day
and Hamas wouldn't comply.
So what makes you think that
Hamas would comply with a longer term
cease fire?
Well,
I think this is all about negotiation.
Qatar has been incredibly helpful here.
It's not clear to me from the reporting
who is to blame for
you don't believe
the US,
the Biden administration, that Hamas
Well, I just think it's very complex,
young women.
I think it's very, very complicated.
It's it's not
we don't have all the information
in front of us.
We obviously can,
you know, can rely on some statements
that are made.
But I think that in these negotiations,
everybody wants something.
And I think Qatar has said
that Hamas is still at the table
Israel should still be at the table.
In fact,
some of the hostages are the Israeli
hostages are saying
that Israel should still be at the table
because this is complex.
Negotiation, and it doesn't happen
unless both sides are willing to come
to some kind of an agreement.
That's how we got the first seven days.
That's
that's a really important point
about both sides
being willing to come to an agreement,
because regardless of what has happened
the last week
and let's just say
there is a more permanent cease fire,
you are hearing from Hamas leaders
over and over again
that the brutal massacre of the 1200
Israeli civilians was just the beginning,
just a rehearsal
and that they want to continue to do it
over and over again.
So a cease fire would keep
that brutal
terrorist regime in place and in Gaza.
I don't think that's true.
I think that what is true
is that Hamas needs to be taken out.
It is a terrorist. I want to do that.
But I think the way to do that,
as many terrorism experts have said,
is to create a durable
and strong coalition of allies
within the Middle East.
With the United States,
with Israel,
to make sure that we have a long
term political solution,
that there is an alternative to Hamas
to lead
in Gaza
and to establish
a state for Palestinians.
This is I mean, we cannot
we have to condemn
what Hamas did on October 7th.
We cannot allow now
for 15,000 Palestinians to date
to have been killed,
three quarters of whom
are women and children,
and say that that is going to help us.
And we can't listen
morally, Donna, morally,
but also strategically for Israel.
The only way through
this is to create a situation
where there is a political solution
that involves a Palestinian state
and an Israeli.
I think ideally what you're talking about
could make sense.
It's just unclear
how you get from here to there.
Who's going to get rid of Hamas?
If, if, if, if
if there's no continued war?
And I think what you're relying on is
the pressure from Arab states
and they haven't been willing.
It's not just that.
Well, part of the reason
they haven't been willing to do that
is because we have been allowing Israel
to literally indiscriminately bomb
hospitals, violate
international humanitarian law.
And so we are creating an October,
even pre October 7th.
Can I just ask you
one more thing about that?
You have seen the information,
intelligence that Hamas
has used, its own civilians,
the death of civilians.
Ah, it's horrendous.
But Hamas has used its own civilians
as human shields.
Those hospitals
and so forth are places where Hamas keeps
weapons and keeps its
civilians.
It's Hamas leadership
that they had their headquarters there.
Diana, international humanitarian law
says that you cannot attack a hospital
unless there is
there are some circumstances
if if rockets are fired
from that hospital, that is one thing.
But hospitals are protected.
We have had refugee camps that are bombed
right now.
There are
even the only pediatric
hospital in Gaza is not operating.
If we want to defeat terrorists,
we have to
abide by international humanitarian law.
That is just my fundamental beliefs
and that at the end of the day,
what we need is a lasting coalition
that is not going to be formed
if Israel continues
to do what they are doing
and the United States
cannot be back out of this
kind of indiscriminate bombing.
And that is my firm belief.
We should have conditions on military aid
in the same way that we do
to for every other country.
To ask you about sexual violence and
the it's kind
of remarkable that this issue hasn't
gotten enough attention globally.
Widespread use of rape,
brutal rape,
sexual violence
against Israeli women by Hamas.
I've seen a lot of progressive women,
generally speaking, there,
quick to defend women's rights
and speak out against using rape as a
as a weapon of war,
but downright silent on what we saw
on October 7th
and what might be happening inside Gaza.
Right now to these hostages. Why is that?
I mean, I don't
I don't know that that's true.
I think we always talk about
the impact of war on women in particular.
Fact, I remember 20 years ago,
I did a petition around the war in Iraq.
You said saying they talked about it.
Oh, absolutely.
And I've condemned what Hamas has done.
I've condemned severely
all of the actions.
Absolutely.
The rape, the of course.
But I think we have to remember that
Israel is a democracy
that is why they are a strong
ally of ours.
And if they do not comply
with international humanitarian law,
they are bringing themselves to a place
that makes it much more difficult
strategically for them
to be able to build the kinds of allies
to keep public opinion with them.
And frankly,
morally, I think we cannot say that one
war crime deserves another.
That is not
what international humanitarian law says.
With respect,
I was just asking about the the women
and you turned it back to Israel
I'm asking you about Hamas, in fact.
I already answered your question, Dan.
I said it's horrific.
And I think that rape is horrific.
Sexual assault is horrific.
I think that it happens
in war situations.
Terrorist organizations like Hamas
obviously are using these as tools.
However,
I think we have to be balanced about
bringing in the outrages
against Palestinians.
15,000 Palestinians have been killed
in Israeli airstrikes
three quarters of whom are women.
And it's horrible.
But you don't see Israeli
soldiers raping.
Well, Danny,
I think
we're not we're not
I don't want this to be
the hierarchy of oppression.
I think.
15,000 shouldn't have been killed.
Should. Which is horrible.
2.2 million Palestinians live in 140
square mile area,
which is about the size of Las Vegas,
with a population that is four times
that of Las Vegas.
And and 1.8 million Palestinians
right now are displaced.
They are living in shelters.
They are being told to move
to south Gaza.
Then south Gaza is being bombed.
They're being told to move to north Gaza.
There are no homes left.
The vast majority of infrastructure
has been destroyed.
This is not the way
that we are going to beat terrorism.
Whether it's Hamas or some,
I'm not sure iteration of Hamas.
On that note,
I want to talk about
what this means domestically
for President Biden.
You've warned
that the way
that the
Biden administration,
the president himself
is handling this war jeopardizes
his support among progressives
and Muslim American voters
and that they could actually stay home.
Do you think that that is how.
How big of a threat, political threat
is that to President Biden
in particular,
when it's possible
at this point, probable
that Donald Trump would be his opponent
and he's not exactly
warm when it comes to Muslims?
Yeah, that's an understatement.
Look, I am a supporter
of President Biden.
I have been out there for the president
and I will continue to be,
even though I think that the way
that this
the handling of this war started was
unfortunately such that it has alienated
huge communities.
We have to be realistic about that.
And we have to do work right now
to address that.
Not just with outreach here,
but actually looking at the situation
in the Middle East
and recognizing that Palestinians
deserve the same respect.
Innocent Palestinians
deserve the same respect
as innocent Israelis.",20231203

LGYbyvZdLVw,Israel expands ground operations to all of Gaza as fears of wider conflict grow,data/en_CNN\Israel expands ground operations to all of Gaza as fears of wider conflict grow.jpg,"This morning, we're watching growing threats
of the israel/hamas war spreading to a much
wider conflict, new overnight, Israeli military
ramping up air strikes after announcing it
was expanding the ground assault to the entire
gaza strip including in south, where so many
civilians have fled, the idf say the strikes
destroyed 20 on hamas targets.
&gt;&gt; The U.S. Navy destroyer came to the rescue
of three commercial ships that were attacked
by iran-backed houthi rebels.
We're also keeping a close eye on Israel's
northern border with Lebanon, where they've
been exchanging fire with Hezbollah.
Three israelsosoldiers were hurt by mortar
shells fired from Lebanon.
We have team coverage.
Let's start with CNN's Ben wedeman in Jerusalem.
Expanding it to the entire gaza
[6:01:42 AM]
Expanding it to the entire gaza strip over
the weekend, where the civilians who have
moeftd to the south supposed to go?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: That I think is a question that
many people in gaza are asking, we know that
more than 80% of the population of gaza is
already displaced, many have gone to the south,
now the Israelis over social media have put
out a map showing hundreds of individual blocs
that are numbered and on theory people can
go to that map there's a qr code, and nowhere
is safe and where is not the problem is most
people in gaza don't have electricity to charge
their phones.
Don't have an internet connection.
Therefore, they're very much really left to
their own devices and of course another problem
is, already the shelters, the schools that
have been converted into shelters in gaza
are already crammed with people, as many as
400 to 500 people per toilet, if there's even
a
[6:02:45 AM]
toilet, if there's even a toilet.
Phil, poppy.
&gt;&gt;&gt; We saw on Saturday, fighting in the north
of Israel across the border with Lebanon,
Hezbollah, saying one of their fighters was
killed.
What does that indicate to you, does that
indicate the beginning of a broader, expansion
of this to the north and more broadly between
not just Israel and hamas but Israel and Hezbollah?
&gt;&gt; Reporter: Well, starting on the 8th of
October, Hezbollah basically entered into
this fight with limited strikes on Israeli
poxes in some communities on the other side
of the border, but it's worth noting that
during the seven-day truce, they also observed
the truce, they didn't open fire, but what
we have seen since the
[6:03:47 AM]
but what we have seen since the truce broke
down on Friday morning there's been a real
intensification of the back and forth fire
between Hezbollah and the Israelis.
I've been in touch with our correspondent
in Lebanon, he said there's hourly shelling
back and forth.
Poppy.
&gt;&gt; Quite telling.
Ben reporting for us in Jerusalem, thank you
very much.
Phil.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Exchanges in the north just the latest
example that every hour the threat that America
could get dragged directly into the war seems
to grow.
U.S. Military said a U.S. Navy destroyer and
three commercial ships were attacked in an
hours-long assault in the red sea.
Launched ballistic missiles and drones.
The U.S. Blaming the attack on
[6:04:48 AM]
The U.S. Blaming the attack on rebels backed
on Iran.
It's stoking fears of a wider conflict.
Natasha joins us live from the Pentagon.
To give an example for people on the map where
this is all happening, Israel up here, Ben
talking about Lebanon, we're talking specifically
in this area here, the red sea, down in Yemen,
proxy organizations tied to Iran, have been
a significant player on attacks on U.S. Ships
and other commercial ships, I think the big
question right now, particularly in the wake
of those hostage negotiations breaking down,
is this a sign that an escalation is coming
or just a return to what we saw the six, seven
weeks before that pause?
&gt;&gt; This was a particularly active day in the
red sea.
Iran-backed houthi rebels.
[6:05:53 AM]
Iran-backed houthi rebels.
This was a number of attacks, four attacks
on three separate commercial vessels in the
southern red sea including one attack in which
the houthis used a ballistic missile.
The uss carney responded to each of these
attacks which occurred on Sunday at several
different times throughout the day and many
of them resulted in damage to these commercial

Now says that this is really, really dangerous,
obviously, not only did the uss carney respond
to these attacks but they also shot down a
number of drones that were launched from these
houthi-controlled territories in Yemen.
Clearly they're taking advantage right now
of the tumult in the region of the U.S. Presence
in the region to try to attack these ships
and the houthi-run Yemeni run forces they'll
continue to wage these attacks
[6:06:54 AM]
continue to wage these attacks against these,
quote, Israeli ships and those aligned with
Israel, standing in solidarity with Palestinians.
The U.S. Central command said that these attacks
pose a quote
a direct threat.
Importantly they say that have every reason
to believe that these attacks are fully enabled
by Iran, now the big question is how the U.S.
Is going to respond, of course we've seen
the U.S. Military strike these iran-backed
groups in Iraq and Syria.
But Yemen whether they're going to go after

STATES HAVE AS ISRAEL SEEKS TO
AVENGE THE SLAUGHTER OF 1200
PEOPLE ON OCTOBER 7TH, AND TO
REMOVE HAMAS FROM POWER IN
GAZA.
OUR FIRST GUEST TONIGHT, JOSH
BALL, RESIGN FROM THE STATE
DEPARTMENT SOON AFTER OCTOBER
7TH, IN PROTEST OF WHAT HE SAID
WERE AN SCRUTINIZED U.S. ARMS
TRANSFERS TO ISRAEL.
IN HIS RESIGNATION LETTER, HE
SAID THE ISRAELI RESPONSE AND
AMERICAN SUPPORT QUOTE, WILL
ONLY LEAD TO MORE WAR AND
DEEPER SUFFERING AND FOR BOTH
THE ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE, AND IS NOT IN THE LONG
TERM AMERICAN INTEREST.
JOSH PAUL IS JOINING ME NOW,
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
HAVING ME.
&gt;&gt; I WAS STRUCK BY WHAT THE
U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY SAID.
THIS IS A VERY BOLD, MILITARY
ASSESSMENT, THAT THIS AMOUNT OF
CIVILIAN KILLING IS GOING TO
LEAD NOT ONLY TO THIS TRAGEDY
THAT THE WORLD IS WITNESSING,
BUT A STRATEGIC HE, USE THE
WORD, DEFEAT.
SO TELL ME, HOW DO YOU ASSESS
WHAT HE SAID?
&gt;&gt; I THINK HE'S RIGHT, AND I
THINK WHAT YOU SEE IS A TENSION
BETWEEN THOSE OF US WHO HAVE
WORKED IN POLITICAL AND
MILITARY FIELDS ON THE GROUND,
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND IN THE
DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT IN THE
UNIFORM SERVICES, WHO
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT
GOING TO WORK.
THIS IS NOT GOING TO LEAD TO
THE RESULT THAT ISRAEL WANTS,
IT IS JUST GOING TO PROLONG THE
SUFFERING OF BOTH THE ISRAELI
--
FOR ANOTHER GENERATION.
AS OPPOSED TO A VERY POLITICAL,
IDEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, THAT
IS COMING FROM THE POLITICAL
LEVEL IN THE U.S. AND IN ISRAEL,
AND IN THE UK.
THAT THINKS THERE IS A WAY TO
MAKE THIS WORK.
THERE IS NOT, AND THE SUFFERING
WE HAVE SEEN ON THE GROUND
REALLY REFLECTS THAT.
I CAN'T RECALL A TIME IN MY
EXPERIENCE, WE HAVE SEEN SUCH A
DISCONNECT BETWEEN OUR VALUES
AND OUR ACTIONS, OR BETWEEN THE
PERSPECTIVES OF POLITICAL
LEADERSHIP, AT THE REALITIES ON
THE GROUND.
&gt;&gt; CAN I ASK YOU WHERE AND HOW
YOU DRAW THAT LINE AND MAKE
THAT --
ISRAEL HAS GONE TO WAR AGAINST
HAMAS AND GAZA, AND IT'S NOT
THE FIRST TIME THAT THERE IS
BEEN BACKLASH AROUND THE WORLD.
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT THIS IS
SO DIFFERENT TO HAVE CAUSED YOU
TO RESIGN.
&gt;&gt; A NUMBER OF FACTORS.
THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THE SCOPE
AND THE SCALE.
HERE WE ARE, TWO MONTHS INTO
THIS CONFLICT, AND WE HAVE SEEN
THREE TIMES MORE CHILDREN DIE,
6000 IN GAZA, THEN IN TWO YEARS
OF RUSSIA'S WAR AGAINST
UKRAINE.
WE HAVE SEEN OVER 50 JOURNALIST
KILLED.
OVER 100 YUAN AID WORKERS, OVER
200 MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO BE
A DOCTOR IN GAZA?
&gt;&gt; WE'VE INTERVIEWED A LOT OF
THEM, AND IT'S A TERRIBLE
SITUATION.
&gt;&gt; THE SCALE OF THE LOSS HAS
BEEN ASTOUNDING, AND OF COURSE
MY ROLE IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT
INVOLVES IMPROVING --
GOING TO ISRAEL RIGHT NOW.
THEY ARE ENABLING THIS KILLING.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS AMERICAN POLICY,
IT'S NOT LIKE THESE ARE ROGUE
TRANSFERS.
THIS IS AMERICAN POLICY,
BIPARTISAN, DECADES LONG.
ISRAEL IS AMERICA'S STRONGEST
ALLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND
AMERICA PROVIDES THE MOST AID
IN THE WORLD TO ISRAEL, AND
OBVIOUSLY TO EGYPT AS WELL, BUT
IN GENERAL TO ISRAEL.
AGAIN, WHAT IS SO ON
SCRUTINIZED ABOUT THIS.
WHAT WAS SO DIFFERENT THAT MADE
YOU RESIGN PUBLICLY?
&gt;&gt; IN ALL THE ARMS TRANSFERS
I'VE BEEN PART OF DISCUSSING
BEFORE, INCLUDING TO ISRAEL,
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN SPACE FOR
DISCUSSION AND DEBATE.
YOU CAN RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT
HOW THESE ARMS ARE GOING TO BE
USED.
DO WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE
LAWS OF WAR, LOTS OF
PROPORTIONALITY, ARE GOING TO
BE RESPECTED.
DO WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SOME
OF THE UNITS THAT THESE ARMS
MAY BE GOING TO?
AND THEIR TRACK RECORDS?
WHAT WAS DIFFERENT HERE WAS
THAT THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION,
THERE IS NO SPACE FOR THAT
DISCUSSION, THERE WAS SIMPLY AN
APPROACH CENTRALLY THE BARN
DOORS ARE OPEN, AND THAT
REMAINS THE CASE.
THE WALL STARTED --
IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS THAT
THE AMERICA HAS TRANSFERRED --
GUIDANCE KITS, AND 45,000
ARTILLERY SHELLS.
THE BUNDLES REMAIN OPEN, AND
WELL I'M CERTAINLY ENCOURAGED
TO HEAR WHAT VICE PRESIDENT
HARRIS SAID, WHAT SECRETARY
AUSTIN HAS SAID, FOR AS LONG AS
THOSE BARN DOORS ARE OPEN, I
CAN'T REALLY KNOW WHY THOSE
ISRAEL WOULD TAKE THOSE
WARNINGS SERIOUSLY.
&gt;&gt; CAN I READ THE STATE
DEPARTMENT RESPONSE YOUR
RESIGNATION?
BASICALLY HE'S SAYING THAT HE
--
IS DIFFERENT BELIEFS, AND OF
COURSE ONE THING THAT IS
INTERESTING FOR ALL OF US, IS
TO KNOW THAT THERE IS A DISSENT,
THERE IS AN OFFICIAL DISTANT
CHANNEL IN THE THE STATE
DEPARTMENT TO THAT ALLOWS
PEOPLE TO AIR THEIR CONCERNS.
THAT WAS HISTORY, FROM THE
VIETNAM WAR.
THIS IS WHAT THE STATE
DEPARTMENT SAYS ABOUT YOU, WITH
RESPECT TO THIS SPECIFIC
CRITICISM THAT HAS BEEN AIRED,
WE'VE MADE VERY CLEAR THAT WE
STRONGLY SUPPORT ISRAEL'S RIGHT
TO DEFEND ITSELF.
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE
PROVIDING THE SECURITY
ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED TO
DEFEND THEMSELVES.
BUT THE PRESIDENT AND THE
SECRETARY OF STATE HAS STATE
SPOKEN TO THIS VERY CLEARLY
THAT WE EXPECT ISRAEL TO ABIDE
BY ALL INTERNATIONAL LAW, AS
THEY DEFEND THEMSELVES.
ISRAEL SAYS IT'S DOING THAT TO
THE BEST OF ITS ABILITY.
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE HAVE A
RESPONSIBILITY AS THE LARGER,
MORE POWERFUL PARTNER IN THIS
RELATIONSHIP, TO GIVE ADVICE.
TO GIVE GUIDANCE.
TO STEP IN WHEN THINGS ARE NOT
GOING RIGHT.
WHEN WE SAY THAT WE HAVE THE
RESPONSIBILITY TO, FOR THEIR
COMMITMENT, TO DEFEND ISRAEL,
TO SUPPORT ISRAELI SECURITY,
AND THEN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE
SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND SAY,
IS THAT WHAT'S ACTUALLY
HAPPENING?
IS ISRAEL MORE SECURE, AS A
RESULT OF OUR ASSISTANCE?
OR HAS OUR MILITARY ASSISTANCE
ENABLED ISRAEL TO MOVE AHEAD
WITH THE EXPANSION OF
SETTLEMENTS IN THE WEST BANK?
TO CONTINUE THE SIEGE OF GAZA?
AND TO TAKE STEPS THAT
ULTIMATELY UNDERMINE ITS OWN
SECURITY, RATHER THAN LEADING
TO A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE?
&gt;&gt; AS YOU KNOW, THE U.S.
ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES, AND
WHETHER IT SAYS IT PUBLICLY OR
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, THAT THE
ONLY WAY TO GET --
FOR INSTANCE, ISN'T THERE IS NO
SECRET THAT THERE IS NO LOVE
LOST BETWEEN BIDEN AND
NETANYAHU BEFORE THIS.
OVER THE ATTEMPTED, ESSENTIALLY,
THESE ARE MY WORDS, OF THE
OVERTHROW OF THE DEMOCRATIC
SYSTEM, IN THE JUDICIAL REFORM.
BIDEN DIDN'T EVEN INVITE HIM TO
THE WHITE HOUSE.
IT'S A TOTAL RARITY.
HOWEVER, THEY BELIEVE THAT IN
ORDER TO AFFECT ISRAELI
POLICIES, THE LIKE OF WHICH
WE'RE TALKING, TO AFFECT THE
POLICY AND MAKE IT MORE TOWARDS
THE PEACE PROCESS, THEY HAVE TO
EMBRACE ISRAEL, DEFEND ISRAEL,
SUPPORT ISRAEL.
IN ORDER TO GET THE TRUST OF
THE ISRAELI PEOPLE.
SO THE THEY CAN THEN SPEAK
CLEARLY TO THE ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT.
AND YOU SAW UNDER THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION, THE PEOPLE OF
ADMINISTER ISRAEL DIDN'T
SUPPORT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION, THEY THOUGHT
OBAMA DIDN'T SUPPORT THEM.
&gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL I WOULD ASK FOR
THAT EMBRACE GETS THE UNITED
STATES.
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S UNFOLDING
RIGHT NOW, IT'S ALL NOT ONLY A
DISASTER IN GAZA, BUT IT'S A
FOREIGN POLICY DISASTER FOR THE
UNITED STATES, ACROSS THE ARAB
WORLD, AND THANK FRANKLY ACROSS
THE GLOBAL SOUTH.
I THINK WE SEEM LIKE HYPOCRITES
WHEN WE CRITICIZE RUSSIA FOR
HUMAN RIGHTS EXCUSES, BUT
FAILED TO DO IT WITH ISRAEL.
I THINK OUR EMBRACE, WE HAVE TO
BE CAREFUL WITH THAT EMBRACE,
BECAUSE IT DRAWS US IN AS WELL.
SECONDLY, OF COURSE, THE ANSWER
IS THAT WE DO HAVE LEVERAGE
THAT WE CAN USE WITHIN THAT
EMBRACE.
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT AMERICA
SHOULD NOT REMAIN CLOSE WITH
ISRAEL.
I'M SUGGESTING SIMPLY THAT, AS
WE ARE THE PROVIDER OF ARMS, AS
WE ARE THE PROVIDER OF BILLIONS
OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER FUNDED
ASSISTANCE EVERY YEAR, TO WHAT
IS ACTUALLY A WEALTHY COUNTRY,
WE DO HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF
LEVERAGE, AND OF COURSE WE
PROVIDE ISRAEL WITH THE
SECURITY AND DIPLOMATIC BACK UP
ACROSS THE REGION THAT HAS
ENABLED ITS INTEGRATION.
WE HAVE A LOT OF LEVERAGE HERE,
TO SET ISRAEL ON A BETTER PATH,
AND TO END THIS SENSELESS
KILLING GAZA.
WE ARE NOT USING IT.
&gt;&gt; HOW DOES WHAT HAPPENED ON
OCTOBER 7TH AND ISRAEL, WAS
BARBARIC.
IT WAS SAVAGE.
WE'VE HEARD THE STORIES OF IN
GANG, OF CHILDREN BEING SHOT TO
DEATH IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS,
WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH
MORE THAN 250 PEOPLE WHO HAVE
BEEN TAKEN HOSTAGE, INCLUDING
BABIES.
HOW DOES A NATION GET --
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE
RIGHT WHERE IT IS.
BEYOND IT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT
WORD IS.
HOW DOES IT GET TO FEEL THAT
IT'S BEING SUPPORTED, AND THEN
IT THEN DOESN'T HAVE TO DO
WHAT'S --
GAZA, GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
THE ELDERS, WHICH IS A GROUP OF
FORMER PRESIDENTS, PRIME
MINISTERS, AND EVEN OFFICIALS,
HAVE ALSO QUESTIONED NOW, THEY
JUST PUT OUT A STATEMENT
QUESTIONING ARMS TRANSFERS, AND
TALKING ABOUT THE INHUMANITY
THAT HAPPENED IN GAZA, THAT IS
RISING TO AN INTOLERABLE LEVEL.
&gt;&gt; I THINK WHAT HAPPENED ON
OCTOBER 7TH WAS AN ABSOLUTE
ATROCITY, IT WAS 1000
ATROCITIES.
I THINK AT THE SAME TIME, WE
CONDEMN THOSE ATROCITIES, WE
HAVE TO CONDEMN THE ATROCITIES
THAT HAPPENED EVERY DAY TO
PALESTINIANS IN THE WEST BANK.
YOU MENTIONED SEXUAL VIOLENCE.
I WAS PART OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS
VETTING PROCESS FOR ARMS GOING
TO ISRAEL, AND A CHARITY CALLED
DEFENSIVE CHILDREN
INTERNATIONAL PALESTINE TO OUR
ATTENTION AT THE STATE
DEPARTMENT TO THE SEXUAL
ASSAULT, THE OF A 13 YEAR OLD
BOY THAT OCCURRED IN AN ISRAELI
PRISON, IN JERUSALEM.
WE EXAMINED THESE ALLEGATIONS,
WE BELIEVE THEY WERE CREDIBLE,
WE PUT THEM TO THE GOVERNMENT
OF ISRAEL, AND YOU DON'T HAPPEN
THE NEXT DAY?
THE IDF WENT INTO THE D.C. IP
OFFICES, AND REMOVED ALL THEIR
COMPUTERS, AND DECLARED THEM A
TERRORIST ENTITY.
I THINK IT'S VITAL THAT
ATROCITIES NOT HAPPEN TO ANYONE,
NOT SEXUAL ATROCITIES,
VIOLATIONS, NOT ANY KIND OF
GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN
RIGHTS.
WE ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION
WHERE THERE IS SO MUCH
DEHUMANIZATION, WHERE PEOPLE
ARE NOT SEEN FOR THE VALUE THAT
THEY HAVE.
AND I THINK THAT'S TRUE WHETHER
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE WHO
ATTACKED ON THEIR KIBBUTZ, AND
THOSE WHO ARE ATTACKED IN THEIR
HOMES IN GAZA.
, OR IN THE WEST BANK.
WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS TO
CENTER THE HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE
AT THE CORE, AND WHO ARE
SUFFERING SO MUCH IN THIS
COMPLEX.
&gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE THAT, IN
ORDER TO HAVE SOME KIND OF
PEACEFUL RESOLUTION, SO THIS
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN, THAT HAMAS
HAS TO BE REMOVED FROM POWER?
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU NEUTRALIZE HAMAS?
THE ANSWER IS, THROUGH A
LASTING POLITICAL SETTLEMENT
THAT PROVIDES A PALESTINIAN
STATE.
NOT A PROCESS THAT PROMISES ONE,
HOLDS THE PROMISE, AND NEVER
GETS TO IT.
YOU NEUTRALIZE HAMAS BY SHOWING
THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE THAT IF
THEY WANT TO SUCCEED, IF THEY
WANT TO SUCCEED THE ROUTE IS
THERE FOR THEM TO DO SO THROUGH
A POLITICAL PROCESS, RATHER
THAN THROUGH VIOLENT
RESISTANCE.
UNTIL WE HAVE THAT PROCESS IN
PLACE, YOU CANNOT DEFEAT THE
PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE.",20231204

why we made that

dire conditions in
Gaza, babies born prematurely
and their mothers
are facing huge challenges
as they try to find adequate care.
CNN's Larry Meadows
takes us inside one hospital.
Every breath is a miracle
for these babies born
prematurely during the war
in the Gaza Strip.
They're here
because Israeli forces
ordered the al-Shifa hospital
in the north evacuated,
claiming
Hamas terrorists operated from there.
Baby formula is the only source
of nutrition here.
Many of the mothers
have not been found yet.
Nobody knows if they're alive or dead.
Saima Abu had just arrived
and is meeting her daughter
for the first time
since she was born 38 days ago.
And you can
you can tell me,
your father says to tell you
that he loves you.
She tells Bibi Kanda, her voice breaking.
This is the closest
she can get to her own child.
She was intubated as
soon as she was born.
And has that impression that.
We were under siege in the north.
I didn't know anything about my daughter.
We had no connectivity.
When the truce came,
I found out that she was in Egypt.
Kanda and 11 other preterm
babies from al-Shifa
came to the new Capital
Administrative Hospital in Cairo
over two weeks ago.
Nine more have arrived from across
Gaza since.
How relieved
are you to be able to see your baby
finally didn't come? Camden.
I'm very happy, thank God.
Today I felt like a mother
because I've never seen her before.
I just want to hold her and touch her.
The Muslim
doctors say
she'll be able to hold her daughter soon.
All the babies in this neonatal intensive
care unit
are under six weeks old,
and yet they have already been through
so much in their short lives.
A war
and a risky journey across the border
from the Gaza Strip to here
in the Egyptian capital.
SASSON Abu
Hamza gave birth to twin girls
two months early,
just six days
after the Israel-Hamas
war started in the north.
Behind the Gaza.
There were airstrikes
and heavy bombardment,
the dead everywhere.
It all weighed down on me.
So I had labor pains and cramps.
They took me to Shifa Hospital.
And I spent a week in the ICU
before then.
One of the girls
has been discharged from the night cue
and she can breastfeed her
in the nursery.
But the twin sister
remains in an incubator.
Their mother
never thought she would see them again.
Not in my heart.
Shifa was under siege.
Out of despair, I lost hope.
And I left.
I wanted to take my girls with me.
But the doctors said if I did,
they would die.
They said to leave them
and God would protect them.
Doctors say all the
babies are doing better
than when they arrived in Cairo.
But most of cases are growing
and will increasingly end
with the general condition.
Political feeding.
Some problems and some vision.
Not too much.
In fact, eight
have made it out of the night cue
into this nursery.
But reuniting them with their parents
might be harder than saving their lives.
We not only is a name.
For the mother,
but we don't know
where is the mother is now.

ggKyOAypMdc,Israeli military searches for Hamas leader after surrounding Gaza home,data/en_CNN\Israeli military searches for Hamas leader after surrounding Gaza home.jpg,"Finally tonight, one of the
Israeli military's
biggest targets is a top
Hamas leader in Gaza
who's accused of being a mastermind
behind the October 7th assault.
Brian Todd takes a closer
look at his background.
I look around to
see who will get him out.
One of Israel's top targets,
the man they called the face of evil.
Yahya Sinwar,
Hamas's highest ranking
leader inside Gaza.
Top Israeli officials
have sounded very confident
in recent days
that they'll kill him,
saying their forces
have encircled his house
in southern Gaza.
According to Catherine,
his house is not his fortress
and he can escape.
But it's only a matter of time
until we get him.
Without elaborating,
Israeli officials
say they believe Sinwar is underground.
Such as the existence of the 61 year old
who's imprinted his hatred of Israel
into the identity of Hamas.
Analysts say as one of Hamas's
top masterminds
of the October 7th attacks.
Yes.
In order to Israel is what bin
is to the United States.
And like Americans went after bin
Laden and eventually got him.
I think the Israelis will do the same
and this war will not end
until they get sinwar.
Sinwar joined Hamas in his toes,
arrested by the Israelis
for the murders of two Israeli
soldiers and four Palestinians.
He spent 23 years in an Israeli prison.
Learned Hebrew.
And it was during that period
that the Israelis
actually saved his life.
A tumor was discovered in his head.
Israeli doctors operated on him,
took the tumor out, and he survived, said
Michael Kuby,
a former officer of Israel's Shin
Bet Security
Agency says
he interrogated Yahya Sinwar
for a total of about 180 hours.
Cube says he knows Sinwar
better than Sinwar,
his own mother,
and describes him
as the cruelest man he ever met.
Known to use a machete
to kill Palestinians
who were suspected of collaborating
with Israeli intelligence.
I asked him, You are now 2829
and how come he is not married?
How come he doesn't want a family?
So he told me the Hamas is my wife.
The Hamas is much child.
The Hamas for me is everything.
Sinwar was among more than a
thousand Palestinian prisoners
released in 2011
in exchange for captured Israeli soldier
Gilad Shalit.
Just last year,
he seemed to warn Israel what was coming.
We will come to you, God willing,
in a roaring flood.
We will come to you
with an endless number of rockets.
We will come to you
in a flood of soldiers without limit.
We will come to you
with millions of our nation.
Analysts say the man who survived
an Israeli assassination attempt
in 2021
won't be easy to kill this time either.
If there's someone who's
passing on information to the Israelis,
he knows who they are
and he takes them out
before the Israelis get to him.
Analyst Hussein Abdul Hussein says if
and when the Israelis eliminate
Yahya Sinwar,
it's unlikely
that whoever might try to fill
those shoes will be as brutal as Sinwar.
But even if it's someone more moderate,
he says, it really won't matter.
Given how determined that Israel
is to take out all of Hamas's leadership.",20231208
CTg_4VZpNTc,Blinken on why international community slow to address sexual violence committed by Hamas,data/en_CNN\Blinken on why international community slow to address sexual violence committed by Hamas.jpg,"Joining me now is Secretary of State
Antony Blinken.
Mr. Secretary, thanks for joining us.
So the U.S.
stood alone at the U.N.
Security Council on Friday
to block the cease fire
and the administration
is sidestepping Congress
to rush more weapons to Israel.
You said this week
that there is, quote, a gap
between the intent
to protect Palestinian civilians
and the actual results
that we're seeing on the ground in Gaza.
Can you describe that gap?
What is Israel doing right now
that you think does not
demonstrate enough care or protection
of Palestinian civilians?
Jake, we think there needs to be
a premium put on protecting civilians
and making sure
that humanitarian assistance
can get to everyone who needs it.
And as I said,
I think the intent is there,
but the results are not always
manifesting themselves.
And we see that both
in terms of civilian protection
and humanitarian assistance,
we want to make sure that is
Israel continues
this this campaign, because, remember,
they are dealing with
a terrorist organization
that engaged
in the most vicious possible
brutality on October 7th
and has made clear
that it would do it again
and again and again
if given the opportunity.
So Israel needs to be able to deal
with this to protect itself,
to prevent October 7th
from happening again.
But as it does that, it's imperative
that civilians be protected.
And here,
the critical thing
is to make sure
that the military operations
are designed around civilian protection
and to focus on that
when it comes to humanitarian assistance
that we, as you know,
made the
argument many weeks ago
to get humanitarian assistance in.
It started to flow.
We got a doubled during
the humanitarian pause
for the hostage releases
that we helped to negotiate.
But now what's critical is this.
Even as Israel has taken
additional steps, for example,
to designate safe areas in the south
to focus on neighborhoods,
not entire cities,
in terms of evacuating them.
What we're not seeing sufficiently
is a couple of things.
One, making sure that
the humanitarian operators
who are there, starting
with the United Nations,
performing heroically,
that there are deconfliction
times, places and routes
so that the humanitarians can bring
the assistance is getting into Gaza
to the people who need it.
Similarly,
we need to see
the same kind of deconfliction time
pauses, designated routes, plural.
Not not not just one
and and clarity of communication
so that people know when it is safe
and where it is
safe to move to get out of harm's way
before they go back home.
These are the kinds of things
we're working on every single day, again,
to make sure that that gap between intent
and result is as narrow as possible.
The IDF told CNN,
I believe Alex Marquardt earlier today
that they estimate
they've killed about 7000 Hamas fighters.
When do you anticipate
this phase of Israel's
military campaign is going to end?
Obviously,
they can't kill every member of Hamas.
And even if they did, 150,000
new ones would show up the next day.
Are the Israelis telling you anything
about when this phase
is going to ramp up?
Because obviously the civilian death toll
is mounting. It's unimaginable.
Secretary Austin suggested
that Israel
might ultimately be facing
a strategic defeat
by chasing so many Palestinians
into the arms of Hamas.
Jake,
we have these discussions with Israel,
including about the duration,
as well as how it's prosecuting
this campaign against Hamas.
These are decisions for Israel to make,
but Hamas has decisions to make, too.
It could get out from hiding
behind civilians tomorrow.
It could put down its arms tomorrow.
It could surrender tomorrow.
And this would be over.
Right? Obviously.
But will the U.S.
continue to back Israel
the way it's backing Israel right now
if this continues for months and months
as opposed to days or weeks?
Again, Israel has to
make these decisions.
Of course, everyone wants to see this
campaign come to a close
as quickly as possible.
But any country faced
with what Israel is facing,
a terrorist organization that attacked it
in the most horrific way
possible on October 7th, and as I said,
has said
repeatedly that it would do it again.
And again and again.
It has to get to the point where it is
confident that that can't be repeated.
But you make another point
that's very important.
When the major
military operation is over,
this is not over
because we
have to have a durable, sustainable peace
and we have to make sure
that we're on the path to a durable
and sustainable peace.
From our perspective,
I think from the perspective of
many around the world,
that has to lead to a Palestinian state.
This is we're not going to have
durable peace.
We're not going to have durable security
for Israel
unless and until Palestinian
political aspirations are met.
And of course, what happens
the day after in Gaza itself,
once a military operations
major military operation is over,
that's also usually important and urgent
to make sure that governance, security,
reconstruction, all of that is in place
so that there's no vacuum.
The Committee to Protect Journalists
says at least 63
journalists and members of the news
media have been killed,
56 of them Palestinian, in this war,
presumably mostly,
if not entirely by IDF strikes.
Is that acceptable to you?
You've made of press freedom
a hallmark of your of your term.
How do you explain all these
deaths of journalists?
How do the Israelis explain it?
Jake, as I see
journalists, including
some of your colleagues,
but also from many other news
organizations,
putting their lives on the line to
just bring the news,
bring the facts, bring information
to the world.
I have
extraordinary admiration
for what they do,
for the courage that they show
and for the vital
importance of their mission.
And we want to make sure
that just as every civilian
is protected
to the greatest extent possible.
Of course, journalists are, too,
and they're when it comes to instances
where journalists have been killed,
we want to make sure that
that's investigated
and we understand what's happened.
And there's accountability.
Congress is scrambling
to reach a deal to pass
foreign aid for Ukraine and Israel.
Republicans are insisting
on more border funding
and new asylum restrictions
that that be added to the to the bill.
What would it mean for Ukraine and Israel
if Congress does not pass
any additional support
by the end of the year?
And why not agree
to tougher border protections,
which is an issue
of national security as well?
Well, Jake, the
the border
piece, as you know, is out of my
is out of my purview. But I can say this.
I know
on day one of this administration,
or at least day two,
the president put before Congress,
I think the first bill
on immigration reform.
Unfortunately, Congress
hasn't acted on that.
In this request for additional funds,
there are $6 billion to enhance border
security,
including having more people, more agents
on the border.
So I know that's very much
part of the discussion
and something
the president's fully prepared to
to engage on.
But in terms of what it would mean
for Ukraine,
what it would mean for Israel,
what it would mean for our efforts
to be competitive in the Indo-Pacific.
I think the only people
who would be happy
if this supplemental budget request
is not voted on
and approved by Congress
are sitting in Moscow,
sitting in Tehran, sitting in Beijing.
For Ukraine, this is absolutely vital.
They've made remarkable progress
over the last year in pushing back
Russian aggression,
taking back
more than 50% of the territory
that was seized since February of 2022.
But they're in a ferocious battle
now in the south, in the east.
We are running out of funding for them,
by the way.
90% of the assistance,
the security assistance that we provided,
Ukraine is actually invested
right here in the United States
to our companies, to our manufacturers.
Similarly,
we've had extraordinary burden
sharing with our allies and partners.
We provided
very significant assistance,
about $70 billion
over the last two years.
Our European friends
and partners beyond Europe,
more than $110 Billion for Ukraine.
So we have the
burden sharing that we need.
This is a time to
really step up
because if we don't,
we know what happens.
Putin will be able to move forward
with impunity.
And we we know he won't stop in Ukraine
and he may well end up going
after a narrow country
that would bring us in,
given our obligations to our NATO allies.
So here an ounce of prevention
is really worth £10 of cure.
Anthony, as you know,
CNN has has led the coverage
when it comes to the evidence
mounting in Israel of rapes
and sex crimes
committed by Hamas
against women and girls.
Maybe even against men on October 7th.
Why do you think the United Nations
and the international community
has been so slow
to condemn these atrocities?
I can't think of a real reason.
Well, let me just put it this way.
I've heard anti-Semitism hypothesized
as a reason why the U.N.
and the international community
might be so slow to acknowledge this.
What do you think,
Jake?
First, I really
applaud these ordinary work of CNN
in bringing this to light
and bringing this before the world.
You've performed a remarkable service
in doing that.
As to your question,
I don't have an answer.
I don't know why
countries, leaders,
international organizations
were so slow to focus on this,
to bring it to people's attention.
I'm glad it's finally happened.
The atrocities that we saw on October 7th
are almost beyond human description
or beyond our capacity to digest.
And we've talked about them before.
But the sexual violence
that we saw on October 7th
is beyond anything that
that I've seen either.
So thank you for doing that.
And look,
I don't have a good answer
to that question.
I think it's a question
that these organizations,
these countries need to ask themselves.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken,
thanks for joining us today.
Appreciate it.
Thanks, Jake.
Good to be with you.",20231210

During a campus rally for gaza.
We call on usc to terminate this

The college paper claimed

Is that really what he meant or

Strauss, who is jewish and
pro-Israel appeared on the

processor who was put on leave.
&gt;&gt; I started getting emails,
very, very nasty emails, things
from, I hope you die you fascist
pig, to, palestine forever.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: While an actual war
rages thousands of miles away,
this video and its fallout tip
identified the conflicts on so
many American college campuses.
&gt;&gt; We have an atmosphere that's
hostile to free speech is the
key problem.
The people who are going to
college are adults, but a lot of
them are acting like children.
They want to see people punished
for their speech.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: So, what actually
happened that day here in L.A.?
Well, here is a longer version
of that video, 21 seconds, not
5.
&gt;&gt; People are ignorant.
&gt;&gt; Professor Strauss, I believe.
&gt;&gt; Everyone should be killed.
&gt;&gt; And that they should all die,
everyone one of them, referred,
of course, to hamas.
&gt;&gt; The longer video of professor
Strauss was shot and posted by
this student, founder of trojans
for palestine.
She asked that we obscure her
identity for fear of reprisals.
Your identity is hidden, but you
exposed the identity of
professor Strauss.
How do you reconcile that?
&gt;&gt; Professor Strauss, first of
all, like, he is, a grown man,
tenured faculty who harassed
students.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: He said Strauss
stepped on the names of the
dead.
He said that must have been an
accident, emotions, she said,
were high.
&gt;&gt; They were filming the names
and laughing at them.
&gt;&gt; Reporter: We spoke to a
jewish student who was there,
remembering their own dead.
He did film the names, and he
was disrespectful.
He apologizes for any offense
caused but told CNN he does not
know for sure that all those
names are innocent dead
Palestinians because the source
is the gaza health ministry,
controlled by hamas.
And that's a basic problem on
these campuses.
The two sides barely agree even
on any basic facts.

Why did you feel moved to create

&gt;&gt; We have a very large jewish
population on campus.
We have obviously the --
foundation.

misinformation being spread.

cannot even agree on the meaning
of what actually comes out of
mouths at the many
pro-palestinian rallies.

pro-palestinians say it's just a
call for freedom.
Many Jews say it's a call for
genocide, for the destruction of
Israel, which right now lies
between the river and the sea.
&gt;&gt; Is there a way back from
where we are right now, where
both sides feel similar things
in terms of their voices being
suppressed?
&gt;&gt; On a personal level, no.

What they're saying basically
gives us the other slice of the

administrators across this
country are struggling to deal
with this.
They're trying to not offend,
and they're making mistakes in
the process, as we've seen on
capitol hill.
Here at usc, they say Strauss
was never placed on
administrative leave.
He says he was, on November
10th.
So, I kept on pushing.
Eventually they told me, our
statement discusses his status
since November 13th.
Not exactly clear and candid.
They now say that -- they have
said all along that they are
shocked by the comments attached
to those videos.
And they now say all
restrictions are lifted.
He's allowed back on campus.
Also worth noting classes for
the semester have finished.
They also say he has not been

he's still under investigation

vLs3miDGwKE,Biden warns that Netanyahu needs to change his government,data/en_CNN\Biden warns that Netanyahu needs to change his government.jpg,"This just in a new candid message
from President Biden on Israel.
At a fund raiser in Washington
just a short while ago,
Biden told donors
that Israel is losing support
around the world.
And Prime Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu needs to change his hard
line government.
CNN's Arlette Signs
joins us from the White House.
Wow.
These are pretty
stark words from a president who has been
in a robust way, supportive
of what
the Israeli government has been doing.
Yeah, that's right, Dana.
These are very candid comments.
Perhaps President Biden's
most candid comments
about the conflict
between Israel and Hamas.
The president
made these comments at an off
camera closed door fundraiser.
So we have a pool report
that's offering some quotes from that.
And it said that President Biden
had warned
that Israel was beginning to lose support
amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza.
And the president suggested
that it may be time for Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to change his government.
The quotes say that
Netanyahu has a tough decision
to make and quote,
this is the most conservative government
in Israel's
history, Biden
said, adding that the government doesn't
want a two-State solution.
The president added
that Israel was beginning
to lose support around the world.
And said
Netanyahu, quote, has to strengthen
and change the Israeli government.
But it does come,
as you have seen President Biden
very publicly stand
shoulder to shoulder with Netanyahu.
But there have been some warnings
specifically about the campaign in Gaza
and the mounting civilian casualties.
There's been
widespread criticism about that.
And President Biden
has warned
Israel to take more caution
to protect civilian life.
But these are certainly
some of the president's
most candid comments
as he is warning
that Netanyahu
is losing support around the world.
Thank you so much for that.
Our Latin reporters are back here.
Jeff Mason,
to me,
obviously,
what Arlette was just reporting
is, is kind of the headline that he said.
He warned that Israel is losing support.
But also this, the second quote
which explains may be the first quote.
This is the most conservative government
in Israel's history,
adding that the Israeli government
doesn't want to a state solution.
Am I reading too much into this
to say that?
Never mind the war,
that the administration
and the president himself
is starting to see a finish line
for Prime Minister Netanyahu and
kind of saying the quiet part out loud
that maybe it's time
for that government
to change
which people in Israel
expect to happen
after the war is over anyway?
I absolutely do.
And I don't think you're reading
too much into it.
I think the Biden administration
is focused
on what happens when the war is over.
And you've heard the president
and others
in his administration
talk about a two state solution
a lot in the last few weeks.
They want to be sure
that there is somebody in place
that actually supports that
and this government does it.
I think it's also telling that he said
Israel is doing indiscriminate
bombing over Gaza.
And it comes after last night he was
he had a reception
at the White House for Hanukkah.
And he gave an anecdote
about having a picture
taken with Bibi Netanyahu
decades ago
when they first met each other.
And he said
on the back of that picture,
I wrote an inscription saying,
I love you,
but I don't agree with anything you say.
And he followed up by that
and followed up with that
last night saying.
And that pretty much applies today, too.
So there's a shift.
And today, the fundraiser comment
and his comment last night
as a signal of that And Paul Cain,
you spend all your time on Capitol Hill
where there
certainly is a lot of support
for Israel, bipartisan support.
But there is
a rift among the president's own party.
Yeah, look, the
Israel for Democrats is
I'm not comparing the
how the wars
are being conducted in the players,
but in terms of the politics.
Israel for Democrats
in some ways
is becoming like Ukraine for Republicans.
They their base
the Democratic base is not happy
with how Israel is conducting this war.
And they are
they're showing up at senators' offices
here in Washington. And back home.
They are showing up everywhere
and protesting.
And so they're right now,
they are
the loudest voices on this issue
in the Democratic coalition.
And Democratic
lawmakers are reflecting that.
And yet
and yet
you have
the Secretary
of State, Antony Blinken,
as soon as as recently as Sunday
on with Jake Tapper, who has said
for some time
that Israel needs to be more careful
when it comes to civilians and killing
civilians as they try to root out Hamas.
But also said, again,
he understands and the U.S.
government understands
that Israel
is doing its best to root out Hamas
and that Hamas is using its own civilians
as human shields. Right.
They've been saying both things
all along,
which is they
aren't going to tell Israel
how to conduct this war,
but then also saying
that they need to make sure
that they minimize
civilian casualties, abide
by the laws of war.
And they've stressed
that over and over again.
And you can see that the president,
as well as his White House,
their patience is wearing thin
because they feel as though
they've been saying that
privately, publicly, in the conversations
that the president has with Netanyahu,
he has said this.
And yet it appears as though
Israel is not really listening
to the White House.
Yeah,
the president
is clearly looking for a finish line.
And that finish line
the White House does not believe includes
Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
on the top of the Israeli government.
Really, really interesting development.
The U.N. is again
debating whether to demand
a cease fire on Gaza.
CNN's
Nic Robertson is tracking that story
for us. Nic, so the U.N.
General Assembly
appears set to demand a vote
for an immediate cease
fire, this days
after the Security Council
failed to agree on a similar call
because of a U.S. veto.
Walk us through what this vote may mean.
Yeah, immediate ceasefire and immediate
unconditional humanitarian access
into Gaza as well.
Those will be the same two demands
expected as were pushed on Friday,
rejected by that veto
by the United States.
The Security Council.
So this is the General Assembly.
193 nations able to vote.
And I think a lot of people
will be watching to see
how the needle has shifted
in opinion about Israel,
because this is a non-binding vote.
It needs a two thirds majority to pass
And it may well pass,
but it doesn't mean it's
going to come into effect.
There's no enforcement.
So this really becomes a measure
of trying to the U.N.
General Assembly,
if you will,
trying to send an even stronger message
to Israel.
Back in October,
there was a vote
along along
broadly similar terms, but 121 voted
for 14 against 44 abstentions.
So if the number of votes
for this immediate cease fire
and immediate humanitarian access
goes up,
then that shows that the dial is shifting
and pressure on Israel.
Will it make a difference to to Israel?
Potentially not.
But there's a real desperate
effort underway
to try to find ways
internationally now
to signal to Israel that
that this cannot continue in Gaza.
The high civilian casualty
toll the
the desperate
and worsening humanitarian situation
cannot continue,
and that that is, in essence,
what this vote will be about,
because it cannot enforce anything.
And that's expected to begin
in the next couple of hours.
The US once again expected to veto.
But as our reporting suggests,
the US
has behind closed
doors told the Israelis
that they have weeks left
to continue the operation at the pace
and magnitude
at which it's being conducted now
in Gaza.

zvhhevXbrZc,Netanyahu's spokesperson says Israel is defining 'gold standard of urban warfare' in Gaza,data/en_CNN\Netanyahu's spokesperson says Israel is defining 'gold standard of urban warfare' in Gaza.jpg,"Tal Heinrich.
She is
spokesperson for the Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
And Tal, it's
great to be with you,
of course, here in New York.
So,
you know, just to start with the
the limited flooding of the tunnels
that we understand the IDF is doing.
Israel says it's
doing on a limited basis in tunnels
where they do not believe
hostages are being held prisoner.
Biden says that is an assertion
that he cannot confirm it.
How do you know for sure
that there are no hostages
in the tunnels being flooded?
First, Erin,
regarding the tunnels,
I cannot comment
on operational military activity
happening on the ground or anything
strategic moving ahead.
This is a question
that you will have to refer to the IDF.
What I can say
is that we said in the past,
the IDF spokesperson has said
that we're looking at various ways
to eliminate these tunnels.
We have eliminated
much of the tunnel infrastructure,
but there are still many of them,
as you heard from
from your reporter
also in the area of Khan Yunis,
where our forces are now operating.
And obviously, when we work on the ground
to eliminate the Hamas
service regime in Gaza,
the hostages
situation is the top of mind.
Yes.
I'm curious, though, and I understand
they're saying where they don't believe
the hostages are.
But a question to you
just on an intelligence basis,
if Israel knows where they are not,
how do you know where they are?
Well, again,
this is a question for the IDF.
What we know
is that Hamas
in the response to pressure.
We have seen the release of hostages
so far
based on the outline that we agreed upon,
because thanks to the military pressure
and we continue to hit them hard
because we want to reach
the twofold goal,
the mission
that we have defined for this war.
So President Biden has warned
Israel it's losing support. Right.
He said to the Prime minister, Netanyahu,
you need to change your tactics and
and likely your government.
Is there a response
from the prime minister?
Well, first,
Israel is a democratic states.
They're the ones who
choose the government,
as you know, or the people of Israel.
And right now,
my country is not dealing with politics.
Aaron.
From left to right,
there's a public consensus.
We're all united right now
around the goal.
And the goal is to defeat Hamas.
You know,
the terrorists targeted us
on October 7th.
They didn't ask
who voted for who, for which party.
They didn't care.
And, you know,
some of these hardest hit communities
and I know that you've been
you've been to the southern areas
are honestly the people
who are most strong
supporters of the Palestinian cause
in certain areas.
And they of them were in those kibbutzim.
Yes. Right. So
in terms of the civilians,
General Clark
was talking about how when you fled,
there's unknown consequences
at this point.
Could involve, say,
buildings coming down. Right.
Obviously unknown at this point
as he lays it out.
A lot of civilians have died.
We know that.
Israel says
the IDF says they've killed at least 7000
Hamas members.
Obviously,
we can't independently confirm that.
But I did recently speak to Jonathan
Conricus, IDF spokesperson,
and I asked him about a report
that said that senior
Israeli military officials
said that they were basically killing
two civilians for every Hamas member,
and he called that
a, quote, tremendously positive ratio.
That if it was two civilians
for every one Hamas,
that's tremendously positive.
How do you see it?
Well, it depends what you compare
Israel to.
If you compare Israel to perfection.
Of course, nobody's nobody's perfect.
We don't want to see
any civilian casualty.
We want to
ease the civilian suffering in Gaza.
The IDF is going to such extent that
no other Western military,
no other military has has done before
to safeguard the civilian population
in an enemy war zone.
And I think that Israel
is really defining
the gold standard here of urban warfare.
And if you compare the campaigns in Iraq
and Afghanistan, the civilian to combat
casualty ratio, that then Israel, once
the dust would settle,
you will see that
Israel compares favorably.
And I understand that.
I understand that sort academically.
If those numbers are put out there
when you talk about the gold standard.
But yet what we are confronted with
every day
is a horrific loss of Palestinian life
and a lot of anguish and anguish.
It is hard to hear
that being the gold standard.
Every civilian casualty
is a huge tragedy.
There hasn't been a
war in human history,
even the most justified ones
that haven't seen a certain
extent of collateral damage.
But again,
what we are doing on the ground,
the fact that we are
telling the civilian population
where our soldiers are, are entering
and when this is unprecedented,
and I'm sure that some,
you know,
family and friends of us
armed forces, service members
watching us right now would wonder
who does that.
Who announces where the troops
are exactly going
to operate to the civilians
And the terrorists would know
this is what the IDF is doing
because we're a moral military I country.
I want to give you a chance to respond
to another report
that aired on CNN last night.
My colleague
Nima Elbagir was reporting
on some of the money
that has gone to Hamas.
Obviously, a lot of money in recent years
and questions
about whether Netanyahu's policies
actually aided and abetted that
by allowing hundreds
of millions of dollars
in actual cash to go into Gaza.
That from from Hamas.
Despite concerns
from Netanyahu's own government,
some of which were raised by then
Education Minister Naftali Bennett,
who spoke to NEMA.
And here's what he said.
I stopped the cash
suitcases because I believe
that's a horrendous mistake to allow
Hamas to have all these suitcases
full of cash
that goes directly to rearming themselves
against the Israelis.
Why would we feed them
cash to kill us?
So when he says he stopped it,
he's referring to
when he became prime minister
by saying he stopped the Netanyahu policy
that he refers to as cash in suitcases.
Does Netanyahu believe
now that he made a mistake
by allowing cash to go in?
Well, again, this is a we allowed money
to go inside Gaza,
not for Hamas, obviously.
And it's not only a policy
that happened, by the way,
during this government,
the previous Israeli government,
because we wanted the money
to reach the Palestinian people,
to fix the water system that we saw Hamas
turn pipes, water pipes into missiles,
the sewage system and so forth.
We wanted to
you knew it
wasn't being used for those purposes
because you could see the system.
Well.
Well,
listen, it's a major problem every time.
And I think it's
a repeating pattern here in history.
Every time the state of Israel
has cut more slack
to the Palestinian people, it backfired.
It was answered with more bloodshed,
more murder.
And if you go back,
you know,
you go back to the 1947 partition plan
of the United Nations.
They we said yes.
They said no,
They started a war against us.
We retreated from Gaza.
We signed the Oslo Accords.
We got suicide bombings in our cities.
We in 2005, the disengagement from Gaza,
we got missiles
raining down on our communities.
And now we allowed in more, you know,
fake rehabilitation efforts.
And we cut more slack
to Palestinian workers
who wanted to work in Israel,
expanded the fishing zone.
What did we get?
The October 7th massacre.
It's a repeating pattern.
All right.
Well, I appreciate your time
and thank you very much.
It's good to see you in person.",20231213
SdIZmZr29L0,CNN visited a Gaza hospital. This is what we saw,data/en_CNN\CNN visited a Gaza hospital. This is what we saw.jpg,"We have been trying for many,
many weeks now to try to get into Gaza.
It has been impossible for us.
Up until Tuesday, we were able to travel
inside with some medical volunteers
who are working at a newly established,
newly built
field hospital that has been set up
by the United Arab Emirates
in the southern part of Gaza.
As you know,
the southern part of Gaza
is now very much
the focus of Israel's
military operations.
That is exacerbating
an already dire humanitarian catastrophe
and leading to record numbers
of civilian casualties.
As we saw for ourselves,
you don't have to search
for tragedy in Gaza.
It finds you on every street
strewn with trash
and stagnant water,
desolate and foreboding.
So we've just crossed the border
into southern Gaza.
This is the first time
we've actually been able to get to Gaza
since October 7th.
And we
are now driving to a field hospital
that has been set up by the U.S.
Up until now, Israel
and Egypt
have made access
for international journalists
next to impossible.
And you can see why.
Since October 7th,
the Israeli
military says that it has hit Gaza
with more than 22,000 strikes that
by far surpasses anything we've seen
in modern warfare
in terms of intensity and ferocity.
And we really,
honestly are just
getting a glimpse of it here.
Despite Israel's heavy bombardment,
there are people out on the streets.
A crowd outside a bakery.
Where else can they go?
Nowhere is safe in Gaza.
Used to be a stadium.
Arriving at the Emirati Field hospital,
we meet Dr. Abdullah al Naqvi.
No sooner does our tour
begin when our ambulances.
The battery life.
And this is what you hear
all the time now. Yes.
At least 20 times a day.
At least 20 times.
A day, maybe more.
Sometimes
I think we refuse to it.
One thing
none of the doctors here have got used to
is the number of children
they are treating.
The U.N.
estimates that
some two thirds of those killed
in this round of the conflict
have been women and children.
Eight year old Jinan was lucky enough
to survive a strike on her family home
that crushed her femur
but spared her immediate family.
She was shocked to hear no morphine.
She says she's not in pain.
So that's how I feel. That's what I.
Her mother, Hiba, was
out when it happened.
I went to the hospital,
she says, And I came here
and I found her here.
The doctors told me
what happened with her,
and I made sure that she's okay.
When she got,
I was sitting next to my grandfather,
and my grandfather held me,
and my uncle was fine.
So he is the one who took us out
that don't cry.
But Dr.
Ahmed al Mazrui says it is hard not to.
I work with all the people like I,
but the children.
Something that changed.
Touches your heart
and tests your faith in humanity.
As we leave Jinan, Dr.
Al Naqvi comes back
with the news of casualties
arriving from the strike
just 10 minutes earlier.
So just because they wouldn't send
snow to the that young
man from that.
Just from the
course of we just saw from the bomb,
we just heard. That is my understanding.
They will arrive to over two days to.
A man and a 13 year
old boy are wheeled in
both missing
limbs, both in a perilous state.
With much less imagination.
What's your name?
The doctor asks.
Next, the notes provided by
the paramedics are smeared with blood,
a tourniquet improvised with a bandage.
Since the field hospital opened
less than two weeks ago,
but has been inundated with patients,
130 of their 100
beds are already full.
So let me understand this.
You are now
basically the only hospital around
that still has some beds.
I guess. Yes.
Or maybe I'm very short of that
because they are telling me
one of the hospitals
with a capacity of 200
and they are accommodating
1000 right now.
And the next door
hospital, I'm not very sure.
They say like 50 to 200000,
maybe 400 to 500 patients.
So when he called me,
he said they have
the three patients in each bid.
Please take any of them.
Send as many as you can.
I mean, we've been here 15 minutes.
And this. Is already worse.
This is what you hear.
You see.
In every bed another gut punch.
Less than two years old,
Amir still doesn't know
that his parents and siblings were killed
in the strike that disfigured him
and embarrassed of mother.
Yesterday, he saw a nurse
that looked like his father.
His aunt, Inaaya tells us
he kept screaming.
Dad, Dad! Dad.
Amir is still too young
to comprehend the horror all around him.
But 20 year
old Lama understands it all too well.
Ten weeks ago,
she was studying
engineering at university
and helping to plan her sister's wedding.
Today,
she is recovering
from the amputation of her right leg.
Her family followed Israeli
military orders
and fled from the north to the south.
But the house where they were seeking
shelter was hit in a strike
by the Muslim and National.
The world isn't listening to us,
she says.
Nobody cares about us.
We have been dying for over 60 days,
dying from the bombing,
and nobody did anything.
Words of condemnation
delivered in a thin grass
today.
But does anyone here.
Even tell us?
Like Grozny, Aleppo and Mariupol.
Gaza will go down
as one of the great horrors
of modern warfare.
It's getting dark.
Time for us to leave.
A privilege
the vast majority of Gazans do not have.
Our brief glimpse from a window
on to hell is ending as a new chapter
in this ugly conflict unfolds.
All the help is needed.
Now, the death toll in Gaza
as a result of Israel's
frenzied bombardment
currently hovers at roughly 18,000.
If you do the math, extrapolating
as the U.N.
says, that two thirds of the casualties
roughly, are civilians.
That is about 11,800
civilians who have been killed
in just over two months.
To give you a comparison.
In the first year of the US
invasion of Iraq in 2003,
according to an independent
research organization,
some 7700 civilians
were killed by US forces in 20 years
in Afghanistan,
according to independent research groups.
Some 12,000 civilians were killed.
So in just two months
you're now approaching 12,000 civilians.
And that's the same amount
who were killed in 20 years
during the US war in Afghanistan.
So this is truly staggering
and unprecedented.
PHIL Erica.
US It's an extraordinarily powerful piece
because you're
taking us one in
and two to the personal stories.
I think I've been just difficult
to some degree to come by
because of the conflict
and the type of conflict this has been.
Your reference
in the piece to Grozny, Aleppo, Mariupol.
You've covered so many conflict zones.
You've covered
some of the worst conflicts
that have happened
in the last several decades,
if not longer.
How would you compare this to us looking?
It's always difficult
to compare conflicts,
but I would just say it is so striking
that the people of Gaza have nowhere
they can go, have nowhere that is safe.
They are literally being told to move
from the north.
As the north gets bombed,
they move to the south
and the south gets bombed.
Now they're expected
to move to a different area
in central Gaza. And let's be very clear.
It is not easy to move around right now
in Gaza.
We saw almost no cars on the streets.
People do not have fuel.
People are afraid to try to make road
runs because of the risks
that that incurs.
And so,
of course,
you are seeing a horrific impact,
not just in terms
of the civilian casualties
that we talked about,
but in terms of the humanitarian crisis.
You're talking about malnutrition.
You're talking about
the spread of preventable diseases.
We talked to the doctors
who said that
they're treating cases of sepsis
and patients are nearly dying
where these should be
straightforward operations
that can't be performed.
They described one incident
where a man had worms
in a wound on his head
because there
is such a lack of a sanitary
and sanitary environment
in which to perform surgeries
or operations.
So this is a crisis of epic proportions.
And the fact that
humanitarian aid workers
do not have the access that they need
just makes it all the more staggering.
One extra point
that I really need to make here, Phil,
because I think it's important.
This was our first time
being able to gain access into Gaza,
but the journalists in Gaza
have been doing heroic
work.
They have paid such a high price for that
deadliest conflict for journalists
that we have seen in decades.
More than 60 journalists in Gaza alone
have been killed
in the last two and a half months.
That is according to the Committee
to Protect Journalists.
So you have a perfect storm here
with massive bombardment,
an inability to create safe
zones, an inability
to get humanitarian access
where it's needed,
and incredibly brave journalists
who are doing everything
they can
to tell the stories
and bring the reality to the world.
But the frustrating
of international journalists
who can't get in
to try to complement
and supplement their efforts.
It is it is remarkable and such an.
Important picture
that you paint of all of those challenges
in this moment.
I was struck by
in that field hospital,
so much of what we've talked about
has been
what is needed
in terms of medical supplies.
As you just pointed out,
and what that can mean,
but also the electricity.
And there was
much talk about fuel in the beginning
and fuel being needed
to run generators at hospitals.
How that field hospital that you were at,
how was it able to operate
and to run some of those machines?
And is it at risk?
So, Erica,
because that
field hospital is operated
by the Emirates
and because the Emirates
have a normalized relationship
with Israel,
they are able to get supplies
in, get fuel in in a way that the vast
majority of hospitals in Gaza are not.
And even they face very real challenges,
endless bureaucracy, onerous waits
at the border,
trying to get those supplies in.
But what the doctor said is
Gaza and hospitals are referring
their patients
to the Emirati field hospital.
They're coming in
in a very bad state of shape.
They don't have proper tourniquets even,
which are a crucial thing
in terms of stopping the bleeding.
They don't have proper painkillers.
The doctor told us
they're needing
to give vast doses
of painkillers
to people
who are in extraordinary
amounts of excruciating pain
because these hospitals have just
had to ration
whatever minimal supplies they have.
Also, this field
hospital is very close to that border
with Egypt.
And so
really, they are not a microcosm
and they should not give you
any reflection
or idea
of what those Gaza hospitals look like.
They are a sort of island,
and that is why they are getting
so many referrals
from these other hospitals
that are
teetering on the brink of collapse.
In fact,
many of them just had simply collapsed
and are therefore trying
to refer as many patients
to this field hospital
as perfect as possible to try to get them
some modicum of decent care.
I will continue to be struck by the line.
No one's listening.
It seems like every patient either
wanted to say or was saying to you.
Clarissa Ward It's remarkable work.
And to your point,
there are dozens of journalists
on the ground there
that have lost their lives covering this.
There are dozens
still there covering it
every day of lost family members
and your work coming in
and supplementing that
and adding to it is incredibly important.
We appreciate your time, as always.
Thank you.",20231214
v7xeZNcABHQ,"Nearly half of Israeli munitions dropped on Gaza are ‘dumb bombs,’ US intelligence finds","data/en_CNN\Nearly half of Israeli munitions dropped on Gaza are ‘dumb bombs,’ US intelligence finds.jpg","President Biden's national
security adviser is in Tel Aviv
right now
for discussions, meeting
with Israel's Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu,
its defense minister as well.
Other members of the war cabinet.
The White House
said a major directive for Jake
Sullivan is to pressure Israeli leaders
to be more surgical
and precise in their pursuit of Hamas
in order to reduce harm to civilians.
But CNN is learning
that thousands of the air to ground
military weapons
used in Gaza
since the Hamas terror attack
have been unguided.
CNN national security reporter
Natasha Bertrand is here
with the details.
This is illuminating reporting,
especially in the wake of President
Biden saying that Israel is engaged
in indiscriminate bombing.
What more are your U.S.
intelligence sources
telling you about this? Natasha?
Yeah, Pamela,
what we learned is that the U.S.
intelligence community assesses
that of the roughly 29,000
air to ground munitions
that Israel has dropped
on Gaza over the last two plus months.
About 40 to 45% of those munitions
have been unguided
and also known as dumb bombs.
Now, that stands in contrast,
of course, to precision guided munitions,
which are sometimes laser
guided, GPS guided,
typically are more accurate
and precise than on guided munitions,
which experts told us really pose
an elevated risk
to civilians and can be less precise.
And when you're talking
about such a densely
populated area like Gaza is,
you know, the difference
between a target
reaching a munition, reaching its target
within a few feet
can mean
a matter of life and death
in such a densely populated area.
And so the question is now,
why is Israel using these dumb bombs?
And we
really don't have a great explanation
at this point.
US.
The US has provided
Israel with the kinds of bomb kits
that they can use
to transform their munitions
that they have in their stockpile
into smart munitions,
smart bombs that are,
you know,
GPS or laser
guided or other forms
of precision guided munitions.
But the Israelis are still choosing
to use in a very large
proportion of the time
these unguided munitions.
And that really,
according to the experts
that we spoke
to, undercuts
the repeated Israeli argument
that they are doing everything
that they possibly can to minimize
civilian casualties.
Now, we did get a statement
after we published this story
from an IDF spokesperson
who said that
the type of munitions used in each
strike is determined
according to the characteristics
of the target.
And they said that they do take steps
to mitigate the harm to civilians.
But really,
the the sheer scale
of the use of these dumb bombs
has raised a lot of questions
among experts
about why Israel is using them,
whether it's necessary.
And, of course, if it's true, then why
they're saying that
they're taking all of these steps to
to mitigate harm to civilians
when these actually can pose
a greater threat to them in the long run.
Yeah.
And we should note, it's
not just Israeli officials
saying they're doing everything they can
to limit civilian
casualties, the US, too.
John Kirby,
a spokesperson for the National Security
Council, just said Wednesday
that Israel is doing
everything they can
to reduce civilian casualties.
And yet this reporting is coming out
really raising a lot of questions
about that.
Natasha Bertrand, thank you so much.
In a short time ago.
The White House
revealed more of what happened
during Jake Sullivan's
trip to Tel Aviv today.
Yeah.
National Security Council official
John Kirby
said that Sullivan
talked to Israeli leaders
about transitioning
from, quote,
high intensity operations
to lower intensity operations.
In the near future.
Let's take you now to Israel
with CNN correspondent
Jeremy Diamond,
who's live for us in Sderot.
Jeremy, what are you learning about
the meetings
between the national security adviser
and Israeli officials?
Well, these meetings
really come at a critical point
in Israel's
war effort against Hamas in Gaza.
It comes as not only
the civilian death toll is mounting,
but also as growing
international
pressure is also mounting on Israel
and being acknowledged
by the United States,
including by President Biden
just days ago,
talking about Israel's indiscriminate
bombing of Gaza.
And so enter
the picture,
Jake Sullivan
meeting with top Israeli officials,
including the Israeli prime minister,
to discuss
not only that mounting civilian death
toll, the ways
in which
the United States wants Israel
to be more targeted in its operations,
but also beginning to think
about a timetable
for transitioning
the high intensity
fighting and bombing of Gaza
that we are seeing from Israeli forces
right now to a lower intensity phase.
That's according to John Kirby,
the National Security Council spokesman
There is an acknowledgment
from the Israelis
that that is part of the discussion here.
But for now, the Israelis seem
committed to maintaining
this current
tempo of the war effort for weeks
if not months to come.
You have gallons.
The defense minister,
we're told,
told Jake Sullivan that this war
could last more than several months.
And the Israeli prime
minister for his part,
he said that the fighting will continue
until the complete destruction
of Hamas, until victory.
And so there is a question here about
whether the message
from American officials
is being received by the Israelis.
We know that another key question
that's being discussed
is also the fate of Gaza
after Hamas is destroyed.
If indeed that goal is achieved
But also at the moment
right now, the fate of those hostages,
including at least
eight Americans who are believed
to be held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
John Kirby also addressed that point.
Moments ago
we're still working by the hour
to try to get a pause back in place
so that hostages can get released.
I'll let the Israelis
speak to their negotiators
and where where they are
and what they're going to focus on.
I can tell you one of the things
Jake's doing in the region,
I mean, if you need proof
that we still want to see a pause,
just look at where
the national security adviser is today.
And we know
that there is an active effort by U.S.
officials to try and restart
those negotiations
between Israel and Hamas.
Mediated by the Kothari government.
For now,
those talks have really broken down
since that week
long truce
between Israel and Hamas ended.
And now there is an effort
by the United States
to discuss ideas with Israel,
to bring those to the Qataris,
to have them bring those ideas to Hamas.
But for now, it appears
that those negotiations
are really going nowhere.
The Israeli prime
minister, though, after his meeting
with Jake Sullivan,
he did say that a main goal of this war
effort is to secure the
return and the release of those hostages.
So we will see if there's any traction
after Jake Sullivan's visit
to the region.
Yeah, definitely
a thread to keep an eye on there.
Jeremy Diamond, thank you so much.",20231214

and president her sock and arrangement of&nbsp;
senior officials. We discuss the ongoing war,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the military operations and we discussed our&nbsp;
shared objective of ensuring the hamas will
[3:50:03 AM]
of ensuring the hamas will never again pose a&nbsp;
threat to the state of Israel. While minimizing&nbsp;&nbsp;
harm to civilians, while ensuring the increased&nbsp;
and sustained flow of humanitarian assistance into&nbsp;&nbsp;
gaza and while working day in and day out, hour by&nbsp;
hour to secure the release of all of the remaining&nbsp;&nbsp;
hostages so that they could return home to their&nbsp;
loved ones. We consulted on a joint efforts with&nbsp;&nbsp;
the united nations, with Egypt, and other regional&nbsp;
partners to deliver the humanitarian aid. We did&nbsp;&nbsp;
not do a great job of putting the podium sign on.&nbsp;
And I describe the U.S. Efforts in coordination&nbsp;&nbsp;
with allies and partners to deter attempts to disk&nbsp;
spend the conflict regionally including in the red&nbsp;&nbsp;
sea and expressed president Biden's commitment&nbsp;
to express income on the blue line through a&nbsp;&nbsp;
combination of deterrence and diplomacy. Later,&nbsp;
today in, fact I will visit from all of to be&nbsp;&nbsp;
with president abbas and discuss ongoing promotion&nbsp;
to stability he west bank. Including efforts to&nbsp;&nbsp;
confront terrorist attacks him to support&nbsp;
the Palestinian authority security forces
[3:51:04 AM]
authority security forces through the U.S.&nbsp;
Security cordon either through Israel and&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Palestinian authority. And their ongoing&nbsp;
efforts to revisit and revitalize the Palestinian&nbsp;&nbsp;
authority. And their initiatives to hold extremist&nbsp;
settlers against Palestinians. I have and will&nbsp;&nbsp;
continue to stay president Biden in the United&nbsp;
States commitment to preserving space for, peace&nbsp;&nbsp;
for a two-state solution where Israel security is&nbsp;
guaranteed. The Israeli people need and deserve to&nbsp;&nbsp;
live in peace and security with their neighbors in&nbsp;
the region that is integrated, dynamic and stable.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That is what we're working to court. That is what&nbsp;
I discussed with my counterpart here in Israel&nbsp;&nbsp;
Kim. This will be for the future, and will that&nbsp;
will be happy to take your questions. With that,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'll start with Alex on CNN.
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much Jake. The&nbsp;&nbsp;
administration has made it clear that you are&nbsp;
hoping that this vital transition at some point&nbsp;&nbsp;
from the science entity face to a lower&nbsp;
intensity face. What does this tell you in
[3:52:04 AM]
What does this tell you in terms of the conditions&nbsp;
that need to begin for that to happen? And how&nbsp;&nbsp;
does that sink up with your preferred timeline?&nbsp;
Tim the administration has insisted that they have&nbsp;&nbsp;
the attempt to keep the civilian safe. And, we&nbsp;
have CNN and others reporting that almost half of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the 30,000 bombs have been dropped on gaza, from&nbsp;
so-called gun bombs and precise and if there was&nbsp;&nbsp;
a real intent to protect civilians wouldn't they&nbsp;
be using much more precise smaller I munitions?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tim &gt;&gt; I really appreciate the questions&nbsp;
of the conflict, and I think that there's&nbsp;&nbsp;
been some misunderstanding in the reporting.&nbsp;
Not for me. But from others thin when Israel&nbsp;&nbsp;
launched this campaign to rule out the terrorist&nbsp;
threat that hamas poses to the state of Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it may clear from the beginning that this world&nbsp;
will proceed. We are now in the middle of a high&nbsp;&nbsp;
intensity phase with ongoing operations,&nbsp;
military operations and in the southern
[3:53:05 AM]
operations and in the southern half of gaza.&nbsp;
But there will be a transition to another face&nbsp;&nbsp;
in this world. One that is focused in more&nbsp;
precise ways on targeting the leadership,&nbsp;&nbsp;
an intelligence driven up that continues to deal&nbsp;
with the ongoing threat that hamas poses. Tim&nbsp;&nbsp;
so it was obviously a subject of conversation&nbsp;
that I had with the prime minister Netanyahu,&nbsp;&nbsp;
with the war cabinet and with the leadership&nbsp;
on the idf and the defense minister. Tim and&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's important that this conversation is, first&nbsp;
we're not here to tell anybody that you must&nbsp;&nbsp;
be, -- this is our perspective, our, partner as&nbsp;
your. From this is what we believe is the best&nbsp;&nbsp;
way to achieve both tactical and strategic goals.&nbsp;
And then second, it has to take place in private.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because we can't telegraph for the enemy what&nbsp;
the plan is. Tim so I have to speak to timelines,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have to speak to conditions here from&nbsp;
the podium. But we have very constructive
[3:54:05 AM]
But we have very constructive conversation&nbsp;
yesterday. About the transition about the high&nbsp;&nbsp;
intensity face forward. And I expected that would&nbsp;
occur, in the future. When exactly that happens an&nbsp;&nbsp;
exactly under what conditions, will be continuing&nbsp;
intensive discussion between the united States and&nbsp;&nbsp;
Israel. Tim I will make sure that conversation,&nbsp;
it least us far as I can do it is going to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;
and take place behind closed doors. Love when&nbsp;
it comes to the issues to the bombs, the type of&nbsp;&nbsp;
bombs that Israel was using what I would say is&nbsp;
that different types of ammunition, it requires&nbsp;&nbsp;
different types of military operations. Which&nbsp;
means the method by which the bombs delivered,&nbsp;&nbsp;
they don't have the tell kicks on it it's&nbsp;
different in terms of how the planes fly,&nbsp;&nbsp;
all the targets have selected. And&nbsp;
they all go through the same process.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A process by which it selects processes&nbsp;
and tried to distinguish targets that hit
[3:55:05 AM]
distinguish targets that hit hamas, that might&nbsp;
take the lives of innocent civilians. At the&nbsp;&nbsp;
end of the, day Israel has the intend that&nbsp;
it strong this distinctions clearly and in a&nbsp;&nbsp;
sustainable way. But we want to see the results&nbsp;
matchup to. That that's a conversation that I&nbsp;&nbsp;
had in full with them today and yesterday&nbsp;
as well. And we will continue to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Including on the type of ammunitions they&nbsp;
used and when they used a certain type of&nbsp;&nbsp;
those are delivered to ensure that from the&nbsp;
United States perspective they are fulfilling&nbsp;&nbsp;
their obligations, their responsibilities&nbsp;
as to international humanitarian law.",20231215
t_TG4x1SplA,Israeli military accidentally shoots and kills 3 Israelis held hostage in Gaza,data/en_CNN\Israeli military accidentally shoots and kills 3 Israelis held hostage in Gaza.jpg,"The IDF
saying that
it mistakenly killed three
Israeli hostages in Gaza.
An IDF
spokesman says
the victims were misidentified
as a threat and shot dead.
CNN's Jeremy
Diamond is in direct
Israel with more on
this tragic development.
Jeremy, what more is the IDF
saying about this
Yeah, it's very sad news.
And the Israeli
military is admitting
that soldiers
effectively mistakenly identified
these three Israeli hostages
as a threat
and shot
and killed them
during combat operations
being conducted in Israel,
which has been the scene of very heavy
fighting between Israel.
And Hamas
over the course of the last week
or two of the three hostages
have been identified.
One of the families of the hostage
of one of the deceased hostages
asked that
their name not be broadcast,
but the two who we can tell
you are Yotam Hayyim,
who was kidnaped
from Kibbutz Kfar AZA on October 7th.
And the second is Summer Talca
who was kidnaped from Kibbutz Nir,
also on October 7th.
The Israeli military
effectively recovered these bodies
in Gaza,
move them to Israel,
where they were taken to a
forensic center
and then subsequently
positively identified
as the bodies of three hostages
who have been
who were kidnaped by Hamas
on October 7th.
Now, we should note amid all of this,
that this comes
as the Israeli military
had loosened its rules of engagement
as it began
this war in Gaza
following those October 7th attacks,
allowing Israeli soldiers to fire upon
suspected terrorists with while
conducting fewer checks
than they normally would have.
The Israeli military, we're told,
is taking lessons from this incident
and transmitting them to soldiers
in the field.
They also say that they, quote,
expressed their deep remorse
over the tragic incident
and send the families
their heartfelt condolences.
This also comes as we know
that some of those former hostages
who were freed
as part of that weeklong
truce between Israel and Hamas,
they angrily confronted
the Israeli prime minister last week
with one of those former hostages
accusing the Israeli government
of having no information
and no intelligence
about the whereabouts
of these hostages,
noting that the location
where she was being kept
by Hamas was actually shelled
by the Israeli military.
And today,
we are learning of a far more tragic
and direct incident
where Israeli forces appear
to have fired upon
Israeli hostages in Gaza,
believing that they were a threat,
and then ultimately
realizing later
after the fact
that they were indeed hostages
forced them.
Jeremy
you mentioned the
loosened rules of engagement.
Obviously, U.S.
National Security Adviser Jake
Sullivan is in the Middle East right now.
He's expressed the Biden administration's
concern about the intensity
of the IDF offensive.
Of course,
President Biden's desire
for Israel to tone it down.
How do you think this news
is going to play into
the tone of these talks?
Well, we'll have to wait and see.
I mean, hostage negotiations
are one of the key elements
of Jake Sullivan's visit in meetings
with Israeli officials.
But as you noted,
one of the other focuses
is indeed the civilian casualty count.
I mean, we have watched
there's now nearly
19,000 Palestinians
have been killed in Gaza.
Some of those combatants,
many of those noncombatants, including
over 7000 children
who are believed to be among
those who have been killed in Gaza,
according to the Palestinian
Ministry of Health.
And Jake Sullivan said earlier today
that he believes
Israel intends
to distinguish
between Hamas targets and civilians,
but that that intention
does not always line up
with the reality on the ground.
And that reality,
that mismatch
has really up
until now mostly
applied to Palestine and civilians.
But in this case,
it appears
to also be matching up to a reality
that has now affected
and resulted
in the loss of life of three
Israeli civilians.
Who were held hostage by Hamas
and unfortunately today
killed by Israeli forces.
All right, Jeremy Diamond,
thank you so much.
And joining us now is IDF spokesperson,
Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus.
Jonathan, how did this happen?
What can you tell us
Yes, good evening.
It's ninth here
in Israel
and a very sad and tragic event,
one that the IDF, of course,
terribly regrets
and has told that to the families.
We are investigating how it happened.
One of the contributing
factors are obviously related to the fact
or can obviously be related
to the fact
that so far
what we have encountered
on the battlefield
are many Hamas
combatants that have been dressed
in civilian clothes.
And I'm quite sure
that that has been part of
the issue here.
But it's still very early to understand
and to say certain things.
And what we can say
and confirm is what we have issued.
Obviously, a very sad event.
Tragic event, of course, goes
against everything that
what we have been trying to do
for the last two months,
more than two months.
It's day 70 of the fighting.
But even sad events like this
will not shake our resolve.
And it will not divert us from the focus,
which is clear to dismantle families
and save lives.
Sir, you broke up there at the end.
But I'm curious
because you mentioned that
the IDF is still trying to get details
on exactly what transpired
in a statement from the IDF.
It says that immediate lessons
from the event have been learned,
which have been passed on
to all IDF troops in the field.
Can you share what those lessons were,
if there's going to be
a different approach by the IDF now
looking into how it happened,
how it came about,
that these hostages were out
and trying to understand
how that happened,
whether it was intentional or by Hamas
or whether it wasn't intentional.
And what we have told
our troops is to exercise caution
when being confronted with
people in civilian clothes.
Again,
part of the complexity here
is that
we're fighting in a civilian environment
where almost all of the RPG crews and the
groups that have
attacking our tanks
and our troops have been dressed
in civilian clothes.
And so it creates a very dynamic and
challenging combat environment.
And what we have told
our troops is to be extra vigilant
and do one more safety check before
dealing with kinetics with any threat
that they face on the battlefield.
But it is a very challenging environment
that our troops are.
Just a follow up on what you said.
You said these hostages were out.
Can you just expand on that a little bit?
What do you mean by that?
Just the circumstances around this.
And as we just heard
our Jeremy Diamond talk about the fact
that the rules of engagement
have been loosened
since the October 7th attack.
Do you think that could have played
a role
in the killings of these
three Israeli hostages?
I don't know what the
Jeremy base is that on.
And I am not aware of any different rules
of engagement.
Our rules of engagement
are those of a military
at war against the terrorist organization
that use the civilian infrastructure,
use the schools and hospitals
and mosques and ambulances
and all the things that we have seen
and you have reported
on during the last two months.
And so I am not aware
that we have changed
any of our rules of engagement.
There are according
to the laws of conflict
and according
to our standard practice in war.
And we will have to look into
and analyze exactly what happened
and what I can say so far
is that these the three Israelis,
former hostages, they were above ground
into the air
in close proximity to air
one of our units in the area
and then were misidentified
as posing a threat and therefore
Israeli troops followed the fortunate.",20231215

8cQ7zYQlPyg,'Mind-boggling': Retired general on Hamas tunnel in Gaza,data/en_CNN\'Mind-boggling' Retired general on Hamas tunnel in Gaza.jpg,"I guess, first of
all, I mean,
the images of this tunnel are just
kind of mind here.
What is your take on all this?
What was your reaction to that?
When you saw that?
Yeah, my my reaction is
this is what Israel
has been talking about
since the beginning of this conflict.
They knew that
these kind of tunnels existed.
I mean, we've been showing on
CNN the single file tunnels
that you almost have to squeeze through,
but you can't conduct an operation
of literally thousands of terrorist
when you're squeezing them all through.
So you're talking about a tunnel
in this case
that's 50 meters, about 200 feet
or so underground
that has the capability to hold weapons,
have large meeting spaces,
travel around and even bring vehicles in.
It's just
part of the network
that subterranean under the Gaza
Hamas has been
building for the last several
years, in fact, close to a decade.
And how they have been shifting
the money away
from the Palestinian citizens
to build these kind of things
to to
to construct their military apparatus.
And it's just it's just mind boggling.
It is.
But it also shows the difficulty
of fighting in this kind
of subterranean environment.
Yeah.
I mean, our Jeremy Diamond was saying
just a short while ago that,
I mean, this
this tunnel is almost big enough
or maybe big enough for vehicles
to move through.
I mean, that
that that is a different kind of tunnel.
There's no question about it.
And General, today
the IDF announced it's
taking control of parts of Khan
Younis in southern Gaza.
The Hamas
run health
ministry also reported
an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza.
What's your sense of things right now?
I mean,
President Biden has been concerned
about what
he's described
as indiscriminate bombing in Gaza,
but what's your sense of where things
stand right now tonight?
I don't I'm not in concurrence, Jim,
with the the the indiscriminate bombing.
It may be somewhat excessive
and we could talk about that.
But, you know,
from the very beginning of this conflict,
starting a weeks ago,
you and I were talking about
how they would start in northern Gaza,
in Gaza City,
and then go to potentially Haim Yunis,
then to Karbala,
where and then even down south
into Rafah.
The Israeli government has said
this operation
will take many more months,
whereas many of the United States
administration is saying
they'd like to see
it ended in terms
of the kinetic operation
by the end of December.
I've said from the beginning,
I don't think that's going to happen,
given the size
and strength of the Hamas
terrorist groups
that are in these subterranean tunnels.
And we're seeing in each section of Gaza
that there are more
and more underground headquarters.
And Hamas has been very diligent in terms
of setting traps for the Israeli forces
as they go through.
So anyone that says,
hey, we ought to shift from
using airpower
to ground
and special operations forces,
that's easy to say on the outside.
But truthfully,
with some of the constructs
that we've seen, Hamas using
these underground networks
and some of the
uses of civilian buildings
have to be struck.
I think it will continue on.
Secretary Austin is going to discuss that
with the Israeli government
over the next couple of days.
But I think we're going to see
a continuation
of these kind of strikes
until Israel determines
that Hamas is defeated.
And I did want to ask you
about the three
Israeli hostages who were
mistakenly killed by the IDF.
We've talked
to a variety of people this week.
And so I certainly want to get your
your take on all of this.
When I spoke with the IDF spokesman,
Jonathan Conricus, yesterday,
I mean, he really didn't
indicate that there's
going to be a major shift
in their tactics or rules of engagement.
They're going to remind their soldiers
that they may come across hostages
from time to time
who have escaped captivity
and they need to be able
to recognize that.
But, I mean, the three men came out
of a building shirtless,
waving a white flag.
They were shot anyway.
The IDF says those troops
were not following
the proper rules of engagement.
But Colonel Conricus was saying, look,
you know,
we have Hamas
fighters who are
pretending to be civilians,
who are doing things
to draw in IDF forces to
entrap them and kill them.
It is such a
messy, chaotic
battlefield I'm wondering, General,
what's your advice on all this?
Well,
I don't have any advice, Jim,
but truthfully,
what I would say is Hamas
and any terrorist
organization is going to use deception
and trickery.
And you add to that
the fact of the conditions
of the battlefield, as you just said.
And I would bet that the hostages,
as they came
out of the building,
probably did not look like the Clean-Cut
young men
we see in their photos
that have been appearing on air.
They've been in captivity for two months.
The soldiers,
the Israeli soldiers
who were
always anxious
in any kind of firefight
with adrenaline surgeon,
and especially depending
on what their level of training
experience is.
You know, truthfully, Jim, I had
a fratricide incident in a command
I was in in Iraq.
And it devastates the individuals
who shoot their fellow citizens.
And in this case, I'm
sure it's not only devastated
whoever engaged those three hostages but
I would believe that
this is rippled
through the Israeli Defense Forces.
And they are attempting
to conduct their operations
according to rules of engagement.
But truthfully, as you just said,
the conditions on this
battlefield are extremely complex
and complicated.
You don't know who the enemy is
When people hop out of buildings,
especially buildings,
as the Israelis have been showing,
contain
a vast amount of ammunition
and they contain ambush sites.
It's very difficult to differentiate.
But I believe that the
Israeli Defense Forces
will review their rules of engagement.
And I know their chief of staff
has addressed this issue
with all of their soldiers
in the fight right now.
But it's tough.
It's really heartbreaking. Yeah,
very heartbreaking.
General Hertling,
great to have you on as always.
Thanks so much.",20231218

Yo,
yo.
Nobody
wants to.
There are moments of you live
so close to this.
But were you prepared fully for what
you saw on October 7th?
The logic behind the work is.
Things like this you can't forget.
I'll never forget what I saw.
It's very.
Very tough.
Haunted by the horrors he saw.
Heartened by the lives he saved.
So many people were saved in this truck.
With Natalie, one of well
over 100 people.
He packed into his pickup
and drove to safety.
As a like this.
This truck saved so many lives.
And he just looks like an average truck,
like I said, right there in that corner.
If it wasn't for him,
I truly don't think
I would have been here today.
One bright chapter on a very dark day,
Natalie told us.
One reason
she's sharing her story is
she doesn't want people to forget
that there is a human face
to all of this.
These young people
who were killed on October 7th
have been politicized.
And Natalie herself
has been the target of pretty intense
online hate
as a result of sharing her story.
She wants people to remember that
civilians on both sides are dying
and they have families.
They have people who love them.
And she says they need to be remembered.

pl1Qj7ev3t0,Gunfire breaks out at key Gaza crossing for aid trucks,data/en_CNN\Gunfire breaks out at key Gaza crossing for aid trucks.jpg,"Well, this video is is hard to look at.
But what can you tell us about
I know there's
there's not a whole lot of information,
but it gets to the the desperation
that we're seeing out there.
Well, this location in southern Gaza,
the Rafah
crossing, is essentially
one of the only lifelines
for the
2.2 million people in Gaza,
because it's
where you can bring in supplies
from Egypt.
There's there's
always a long line of trucks
waiting to cross,
but they don't always get through.
Today,
we know that there were dozens of trucks
that did get through,
but there efforts to distribute aid
in Gaza were hampered
by these large, desperate crowds.
You're talking about hundreds of people.
At least that's what we can
ascertain from this footage.
Jumping on the trucks,
trying to break in and grab
whatever items they could.
It seemed as if it was really a mad dash.
And at some point, gunfire erupts.
So adding to the chaos
and the confusion
is the danger of bullets
whizzing through the air.
We don't know who was firing the shots.
We don't know how
it started or necessarily why.
But in a chaotic situation like that,
when people are so hungry
and so desperate
and so determined
to try to get what they can.
In many cases, just to support themselves
and their families.
But there could also be
potentially looting.
We saw that
there were tires that were set on fire.
And then you had the gunshots
ring out as well.
Listen, to what it sounded like
at the height of all of this.
It is Christmas Eve jam.
These people have lived through week
after week of airstrikes.
There's been ground combat
that's now expanding.
The IDF, the Israeli military
moving into central and southern Gaza.
Their operations.
There've been airstrikes
throughout all of these areas.
And now on top of that,
a brawl around the relief trucks
and gunfire.
People are living an absolute hellish
nightmare right now in Gaza.
And this video is all
you really need to look at to
just get a little bit of a glimpse
of what it's like for them.
And this is why.
The call for aid. The call for help.
The call to
to do
whatever the world can
to improve the situation
for more than 2 million people
living through
this is even more urgent
on this Christmas Eve than
it's ever been.
Yeah.
Well, I mean,
that video right
there just goes to the horror
of what life is like right now
in that part of the world.
And and we just don't know.
The gunfire is emanating in that video
Is that
is that something
we can ascertain from looking at it?
We just don't know.
Okay.
It is.
It's in the video,
but we don't know where
the shots are being fired from.
You don't see there's
no reports of anybody injured
that we know of.
But again,
information could be slow going.
A lot of times
people have to climb up on a roof
just to get an Internet signal
to feed back video like this.
Our journalists
on the ground
in Gaza worked so hard to record moments.
And sometimes it can take hours
and hours and hours
just to get the information back to us,
to get a phone signal,
to get the footage back.
And so we hope to learn
more about what exactly happened today
in southern Gaza at the Rafah crossing.
But you can see clearly in the pictures
it was a situation of people
who are driven
to the edge of desperation.
Yeah,
they are so desperate
and so
determined to try to get what they can,
grabbing
whatever they can,
running running for it,
and then having to essentially,
you know, hear
gunfire, wonder
if they're going to have to dodge bullets
after airstrikes
and everything else
that they've gone through.
And by the way, most of these people
on the on the verge of starvation,
extremely hungry
because they're so little food
and and water,
even even drinking water
available in Gaza right now.
Barack, I do want to ask you about this
drone attack
in just a few moments,
but I wanted to go back to that video
that Will Ripley was talking about
near the Rafah border crossing
where we saw gunfire breaking out.
People sort of almost running in a panic
with relief supplies that had come in,
I guess.
What's your sense
when you talk to your sources
about the level of desperation
inside Gaza and whether things could?
I mean, this just gives you a sense
that things could really spiral
out of control
in a significant way,
that it just might become difficult
for anybody to get a handle
or a lid on the situation.
What's your sense of it?
First, I agree with you, Jim,
that the situation is very, very serious
and it's getting worse by the day.
And I think what is most challenging
is that in a few weeks,
the Israeli military is going to
phase out this operation
and move from the high intensity
phase to the low intensity phase,
which means that most of the IDF
soldiers will go out
of the Palestinian cities.
And then you'll have a vacuum
all over the Gaza Strip.
And then either
Hamas will come back again
or we will see the same pictures
we saw in Rafah today.
We will see it all over the Gaza Strip.
And the number one
challenge now is to find a way
for somebody
to be in charge of law and order
in a few weeks in Gaza
so that all this
humanitarian aid is coming
in, won't be looted,
will reach the people who need it.
And unfortunately, at that moment,
there's nobody that can do it
right.
Because Barack,
one of
the conversations
that really hasn't been fully
dealt with is
who is going to be
the governing authority in Gaza,
you know, in the near future.
I can't
imagine Israel is going to want Hamas
to be that governing authority.
And when you see the chaos
break out that we saw today,
I mean,
that is going to be a major challenge
of course.
And if the if it's not Hamas
and if there's no other volunteer
and that can take
the Gaza Strip under its responsibility,
the Egyptians are not going to do it.
The Saudis are not going to do it.
The Democrats are not going to do it.
Then Israel can find itself again,
not next year and not
six months from now,
but a few weeks from now
in a situation where it will have to take
responsible
responsibility for 2 million
Palestinians in Gaza.
And this is the last thing Israel wants.
But if there's not going to be
any alternative governing body
and for now,
there is not,
you know, the responsibility will aid
Israel stable.
And Barack,
what do you make of the Pentagon
singling out Iran
for this latest drone attack
on this commercial ship?
It does sound as though that tensions
are really building
and it almost feels like a foreshadowing
of something to come
to send a message
to the Houthi rebels, to send a message
to the Iranians, potentially.
What can you tell us
I think what's
important and interesting
in this recent attack that generated
from Iran,
this drone attack against this ship
near the coast of India,
is that it's
the kind of attack that we haven't seen
for many, many months.
Something like a year ago,
we saw almost every week
an Iranian attack
on some sort of a vessel
that had either
a strong connection
or a weak connection to Israel.
And this was part of this shadow war
between Israel and Iran,
because the Israelis also attacked
Iranian vessels
and this war, this tit for tat.
But we haven't seen this for a long,
long time.
And the fact that the Iranians
decided to resume those attacks,
those direct attacks from Iran against
Israeli vessels or vessels
that are affiliated with
Israeli companies
I think it's a very worrisome sign
because it's
no doubt an escalation
after what
we've seen in the last few weeks.
And when we were talking
with Kevin Liptak earlier,
about this on this program,
I mean, there is a sense
in the Biden administration
that the Iranians
may be setting
something of a bit of a trap
and that they
they want to almost bait
the Israelis and the U.S.
to, I guess, muster
some kind of response
that would widen the conflict,
make things messier in the region.
And I suppose that there's
there's that side of it to that
that has to be dealt with. Yeah.
So senior
Israeli officials that I talked to are,
you know,
very aware that that's the case.
And this is why you did not see Israel
retaliating against the Houthis in Yemen,
because the Israelis say
this is exactly what the Iranians
and the Houthis want.
They want to distract us from Gaza.
They want to distract us
from trying to deter
Hezbollah in the north.
And we're not going to do it.
And therefore is
Israel
gives a chance
for this
international maritime
coalition in the Red Sea.
But on the other hand,
the Israelis do say that
they think that the U.S.
should do something about it
or about the Houthis
and you see that every day.
The Houthis are escalating
their attacks on U.S.
vessels in the Red Sea, U.S.
Navy vessels.
Just the other day, an attack on a U.S.
ship.
And when I speak to U.S.
officials in Washington,
they say and they you know,
they recognize that this is an option
that's on the table, U.S.
taking military action
against the Houthis.
It's being considered in the Pentagon.
It's being considered in the White House.
Secretary of Defense Austin,
when he was just here in Tel Aviv
a week ago,
he told the Israelis,
we are not taking a military action
off the table when it
comes to the Houthis.
All right.
Barack Ravid,
perhaps I'm
going to be watching
for over these holidays.
Thank you so much.
Appreciate the time today.
Thank you, Jim.
And I hope you all have a calm
holiday season. You as well.",20231224
PC6mg0R5fSY,Hamas-controlled health ministry says at least 250 killed in Gaza in 24 hours,data/en_CNN\Hamas-controlled health ministry says at least 250 killed in Gaza in 24 hours.jpg,"And a warning for you now.
Some disturbing video
we're going to show you
in the latest update
of the Israel-Hamas war.
These are some of the victims
after a deadly 24 hours in central Gaza,
the Hamas run health ministry
says at least
250 people were killed
from Israeli strikes.
70 of the victims
were at the Alma
Ghazi refugee camp Sunday.
Israel Defense Forces
told CNN, quote, in response to Hamas's
barbaric attacks,
the IDF is operating to dismantle
Hamas military
and administrative capabilities.
Also today,
Israeli's
Israel's Prime Minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, was in Gaza,
his second trip to the battlefield,
vowing to continue the, quote,
long fight.
A day
after promising to intensify
the campaign against Hamas,
the IDF says since Friday, at least
15 of its soldiers
have been killed in Gaza.
CNN senior
international correspondent
Will Ripley is in Tel Aviv.
Will, tell us more about what
the prime minister said to troops today
during that visit to Gaza.
Well, he's certainly there to
send them encouragement
to say that their sacrifice
this was one of the deadliest weekends
in this 80 day war
for the Israeli military.
Just like
it was one of the deadliest
24 hour periods
in Gaza
since this war began back on October 7th.
80 days
and you have more than 20,600 people
who have been killed on the
Palestinian side,
along with more than 53,000 injuries.
And even though Israel's death toll
is is much lower,
they do say that
they are adhering, Jessica,
to international law,
that they are not
indiscriminately targeting civilians,
but they're going
after specific military targets
based on intelligence.
They say they're targeting changes
as different intelligence comes in.
And they say the fact that Hamas
is choosing to position itself in areas
densely packed with civilians
who are sheltering, civilians
who are displaced.
That that makes Hamas
just as culpable for this
skyrocketing death toll.
This is the Israeli argument
as it does Israel itself.
So despite that, we had this U.N.
resolution last week
that, of course,
that was quite watered down
from the original draft
that the United States vetoed
and then there were several delays
as they were rewriting it.
Israel says they're not going to stop
until they obtain their objective,
which is to eliminate
the leadership of Hamas.
And they have not
been able to do that yet.
Netanyahu
in northern Gaza,
where they have essentially obtained
operational control,
meeting with the troops
and saying that this war will continue
President Biden in a phone
call with the prime minister
of Israel,
encouraging a more slower,
more focused, streamlined technique.
Not such a such a large scale
casualty type of situation.
President Biden,
speaking with Democratic donors,
did on one instance
use the word
indiscriminate bombing,
which would be a violation
of international law.
But then the Israelis really said that
that one reference
from the US
president is not reflective
of their reality on the ground.
And so the fighting
absolutely continues
and you have a Christmas Day
where we have now
just had some of the deadliest incidents
since this war began 80 days ago.
And well, before we let you go,
the IDF has also revealed
these new details
about the Hamas tunnel network
that they've been trying to destroy
and penetrate there.
What can you tell us about that? Yeah,
so this is a network of tunnels
underneath Gaza.
Hamas has
has publicly stated
in the past that they've built
hundreds of miles of tunnels under Gaza.
Although the exact number
of the tunnels is unknown
and impossible to independently verify.
But what Israel says
they discovered and uncovered
is a very elaborate tunnel system,
very high tech with capability to house
weapons facilities, bunkers,
command headquarters,
even living quarters, apartments
for the Hamas senior leadership.
And they also say that
they recovered the bodies
of five Israeli hostages,
three of them soldiers,
two of them civilians.
And once those five bodies were recovered
and repatriated back here to Israel,
that underground tunnel complex
that was housing the Hamas leadership
and a lot of the leadership
operations was destroyed
Of course,
the leadership has since moved on
to another location, Jessica.
Israel trying to track them down.
But this is a fight
that experts say is likely to continue
for many, many months to come
because Hamas
is actually getting more resources
funneled in
from their supporters,
among whom
they've actually gained credibility
since October 7th
for keeping this fight going.
And so they're going to get more money.
They're going to get more weapons.
And Israel says
they are going to have to keep fighting.
Will Ripley for us tonight in Tel Aviv,
thanks so much for that reporting.
Well, we appreciate it.
And joining us
now to talk
a little bit more about
this is retired Army Brigadier
General Mark Kimmitt.
Thanks so much for being here
on this Christmas Day.
We really do appreciate it.
I want to start first
with with some of Will's reporting there.
We know that Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has said
that Israeli forces are intensifying.
That's his word.
Operations inside the Gaza Strip.
What do you think an intensification
looks like at this point?
Well, I think it
means probably putting more ground troops
in to finish up the fight
inside of Gaza City, more ground troops
to finish the fight on units.
I think it also means
that they may step up
the amount of air attacks
that are going into both of those cities.
Because I think that they recognize
that international criticism
cannot continue at this level.
So the sooner they mop this up, sooner
they clean this up, the better.
And candidly,
that saves lives by speeding it up
simply because you won't be finding
as many days
when you hear a casualty tolls
of 250 plus.
And his statement,
Benjamin Netanyahu's
statement is coming
after the Secretary of State,
Antony Blinken, said last week
that this conflict, quote,
needs to move to a lower intensity phase.
So obviously opposite there.
You mentioned international support
and outside support for Israel.
What do you anticipate the U.S.
support for Israel
is going to look like as
we continue moving forward?
Well, look, these
types of operations,
consumers significant amount
of ammunition,
significant amount
of bombs, significant
amount of artillery rounds.
I think we will continue
to provide those assets,
which by the way, we are also
and need to continue to provide Ukraine.
I certainly hope
that part of those ammunition packages
include precision guided weapons
so that the Israelis
can be more precise in their attacks.
And let's talk more about the tunnels
that will also kind of
walk us through there
in his reporting before we came to you.
The IDF has this new disclosure
about what
the tunnel network looks like in Gaza,
kind of where they have been able to go.
And they also reported the bodies
that they found
of the five
Israeli hostages that had been recovered.
What are you taking away
from this information
about these tunnels?
And what the IDF is finding there?
Well, what
it indicates to me
is that for many, many years, money
that has been provided
by the United Nations
has been siphoned off
to buy the concrete, to buy the sand,
to buy the material
that is necessary
to build these 300 miles of tunnels
that had no other purpose
and to fight wars.
So I think it's
not only a criticism
of the barbarity of Hamas,
but it's an implicit criticism
of the U.N.
accounting for the money
that they've been providing
over the years.
Because you're you're saying that
that that has that's
where some of it has gone.
I don't know how else these tunnels
could have appeared
without the funding necessary.
And there's no other real source
of funding inside of
Gaza except the money provided
by the U.N.
and some money
that's been provided by Qatar.
And just quickly,
lastly, before I let you go, you know,
they talked about the five
bodies of the hostages
that were found there.
We're now closing in on three months
in this conflict, and
there are
still dozens,
over 100 hostages that remain in Gaza.
Where do you see this going?
Does that rely solely
on a diplomatic solution,
or is there
any sort of military intervention
that you see coming down the road at all?
I would be very surprised if even the
the highest
and military soldiers
inside the special operations
community in Israel
would be capable of bringing back
even a percentage of the hostages.
So it will depend on diplomacy.
But nonetheless, one of the messages
that Prime Minister
Netanyahu gave to his troops on
the ground is keep fighting
the soldiers
who need to focus on fighting
because they can't depend
on diplomacy to fix this.
And so they're going to keep fighting
until this war is over.
That seems to be certain.
All right.
Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt,
thanks so much again. We appreciate it.
And Merry Christmas to you
and you as well.",20231225

are growing this morning
after Israel has continued to pr
to continue its war against Hama
for many more months.
Recently surfaced video appears
to show Palestinian men
and at least two children
stripped down to their underwear
and detained by the IDF in Gaza.
CNN is unable to verify
when the video was shot, but
geo location data shows
it was filmed in a stadium of Ga
The IDF has not responded
to CNN's request
for comment on that video.
The incident, though, resembles
an account shared
by a Palestinian poet and writer
Moussa Abu Butt Abu toA.
In a new piece
published in The New Yorker,
which claims
he was forced to completely undr
at gunpoint
before being detained
and interrogated
by the IDF earlier this month,
he was trying to cross the Rafah
with his wife and three kids,
including his three year
old son, Mustafa, who is a U.S.
Abu Tor said he was terrorized
and beaten while being questione
about whether he had ties to Ham
Well-known poet
and writer has studied at Syracu
and Harvard and denies
repeatedly any ties
to Hamas or terrorism.
The IDF gave a statement to CNN
noting that it's a partial respo
and that they are still
looking into the allegations,
saying in part, during IDF opera
in the Gaza Strip,
a number of individuals
were detained
on the basis of intelligence

with what the IDF says

Take off the boxer shorts.
And then I looked at the other p

the Palestinian

who was also detained with me.
And we were surprised
that they are asking us to

So we had nothing to do

And then when I was naked
for the first time in my life
in front of strangers,
I was asked to turn around.
So I.
I did what they asked for.
And then I was handcuffed

who have been
unable to leave Gaza to study

Right.
And these people do not have the

tJe-YtQigkA,Israel's Supreme Court strikes down controversial change to judiciary,data/en_CNN\Israel's Supreme Court strikes down controversial change to judiciary.jpg,"Now to some breaking news from Israel.
The Supreme Court has struck down
a controversial change to the judiciary,
one that's ignited
deep divisions within the nation.
Let's get right to Elliott
Gotkine in Tel Aviv for us now.
Eliot, this refers specifically
to a proposed amendment
that would have stripped the Supreme Court
of its ability
to declare government decisions
as unreasonable.
It's a fascinating ruling, flies
in the face of efforts
by Prime Minister Netanyahu.
I think the big question here
is, will he stand by the Supreme
Court's ruling
Julia, that's an open question.
He has in the past,
including to our very own Wolf
Blitzer,
avoided directly answering that question.
But make no mistake,
this is an unprecedented decision
by the Supreme Court.
Never before has it struck down
a basic law or an amendment
to a basic law, which is the closest thing
that Israel has to a constitution.
And what Prime Minister Netanyahu's
government did is it came out with this
judicial overhaul, which, as you said,
caused months of very deep divisions.
Hundreds of thousands of people
on the streets protesting.
At one point,
he sacked his defense minister
for suggesting
that he pulls this legislation
and then quietly forgot
that he'd sacked him.
And, of course, Defense Minister
Yoav Gallant, somewhat busy right now
with the war with Hamas.
And so this is an incredibly
significant decision
it was a very narrow ruling, eight
to seven against the government.
And what Netanyahu wanted to do was
and what they did, in fact, do,
because it's a law
that's now been struck down,
it did come into effect for a few months
and it's now been struck down.
Netanyahu wanted to remove
the Supreme Court's ability
to strike down government decisions
on the grounds of reasonableness.
And I'll just give you one example
that was very relevant to the beginning
of this government's tenure,
which is its attempts
to appoint a minister called Aryeh Dairy,
who is from Netanyahu's ally.
If one of Netanyahu's allies, the Area
Dairies
Party Shas, is in the governing coalition.
Netanyahu wanted to make Aria Dairy
a minister,
but he's been convicted three times
most recently for tax fraud.
The Supreme Court said, no,
it's unreasonable to make him a decision
because of his convictions.
And as a result,
he wasn't made a minister.
So what this means in future now
is that the Supreme Court will continue
to have the power
to strike down decisions such as those on
the grounds of reasonableness.
It will be seen as a victory
for opponents of Netanyahu
and all those hundreds of thousands
of people who were out on the streets week
in, week out for months on end, protesting
against the government's plans to weaken
the Supreme Court.
It will, of course, also be seen as a loss
on the part of Netanyahu
government's supporters.
We're not seeing any signs of protest
right now.
Of course, Israel
is in the middle of that war with Hamas.
And indeed, those divisions
that this judicial overhaul created
seem to have been not forgotten.
But certainly shunted to the side.
Now, this decision
could potentially threaten to reopen them.
We've heard from the justice
minister, Yariv Levin.
He was the architect of this
judicial overhaul.
He's already assailed
the timing of this decision,
saying it's the opposite of the unity
that Israel needs right now.
But Julia, just one note on that.
The Supreme Court had no decision
but to issue its ruling right now
because two of the Supreme Court
justices have to step down this month.
Julia, it also could have profound
implications for the war, too, Eliot,
because doesn't it also pick
members of the current war cabinet
against each other to based on their views
on how they should have played
out or shouldn't play out
I think, Julia,
this war cabinet and we're in particular
talking about one of the opposition
leaders, Benny Gantz and his party,
which is now in the war cabinet,
The judicial overhaul is really not
something that they are there
to talk about or to discuss
It's not even really been it's
almost been forgotten very bizarrely.
It's almost been forgotten
as a result of this war and Hamas
terrorist attacks of October the seventh.
And so as a result,
I don't think it's going to necessarily
sew divisions in this war cabinet
the country has generally been united
in this war with Hamas in the wake
of those attacks of October the seventh.
And I think that the war cabinet
will remain very much focused
on the job at hand,
which is to destroy Hamas militarily
and to get the 100 plus hostages
still being held in captivity
by Hamas and other groups
inside the Gaza Strip
for some 80 days
now to get them all back home.
Yes, this is a controversial issue,
this judicial overhaul.
Yes. The Supreme Court
ruling is also controversial
but I think the war cabinet in particular
will remain very much focused
because this war, certainly from Israel's
perspective, is more important than this
judicial overhaul.
Julia Yes.
The message in there,
I think, for the prime minister to perhaps
now is not the time election.
Thank you for that report there.",20240101
vta0CkM8xW8,Iran deploys naval destroyer to Red Sea,data/en_CNN\Iran deploys naval destroyer to Red Sea.jpg,"As tensions soar in the Middle East,
the Iranian navy has deployed a warship
to the Red Sea.
This movement comes
just a few days after the US
military sank
three boats belonging to the Houthis.
The Houthis are an Iranian backed group
from Yemen
who have been targeting
commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
Let's bring in CNN's
Natasha Bertrand,
who was following all of this for us.
From the Pentagon.
So Natasha,
how is the Pentagon responding to this?
Well, Rachel,
a defense official tells us
that they are monitoring the situation
closely, of course, because it comes amid
all of the rising tensions
in the Red Sea with the Houthis,
which are an Iran backed group.
Iran does
provide support
and intelligence to the Houthis,
according to the White House.
And so the US is monitoring
this very closely.
However, it is important to note
that this is not the first time
that Iran has deployed
assets to the Red Sea.
They operate there pretty regularly.
But the US, of course, is eyeing this
because of the fact that they say that
Iran has been providing the Houthis
with the kind of maritime intelligence
that they need to select
targets in the Red Sea as they are hit
commercial vessels there.
There have been
over 100 attacks
by these Iran backed Houthi militants
on commercial vessels in the Red Sea
since really in the last month,
a month and a half.
And so
the uptick that we have seen
is really remarkable
and it has really ensnared
international shipping and commerce.
The fact that Iran is now there
just a day or two after the US shot down,
fired on small boats
that contained Houthi militants,
sinking them and killing
all of those Houthi
militants on board could be seen
as a sign
that Iran is trying to present
a show of force to the Americans.
Of course, who are operating in the area
because if you'll recall,
the US also set up
a multinational maritime
task force
to bolster security
in the Red Sea,
to try to prevent the Houthis
from launching these attacks
and to escort vessels
that are transiting the areas
that they feel safe are going up
and through the Suez Canal
so that international shipping
can kind of get back on track here.
So this is not right now
being seen by the Pentagon
as a direct threat to the US
or any of its allies.
Instead, they are watching it
very closely
they do not necessarily think
that Iran is going to conduct
any kind of provocations here,
but both sides
obviously trying to send a message
to the other there that they are
in the region.
They can respond
if and when they deem it is necessary
for help.
Now, with huge implications
that that region is
that channels an area
12% of global commerce
travel through
Israel has huge implications
Natasha Bertrand live for us there
at the Pentagon. Natasha, thank you.
All right.
Joining us now, CNN
military analyst,
former NATO supreme allied
commander General Wesley Clark.
General, this is the Iranian naval vessel
that is being deployed.
I can show you where it's going.
It's going in the Red Sea,
particularly down in this area right here
where there's been a lot of activity
the last several days.
What is the presence of this
Iranian vessel change?
Sure it is.
First of all, it's going to collect
intelligence on U.S.
activities in the area.
It's going to serve as a deterrent
or they believe it will deter U.S.
actions against the Houthis.
It will certainly inhibit us
in the sense of maneuvering.
It's one more factor
for us to consider it.
It raises tensions in the region.
It shows Iran's hegemonic
aspirations, demonstrates those.
And we'll just have to see where
this goes, John.
If the Houthis say okay,
we got the Iranians here
now, we're not going to interfere
with the shipping. Fine.
So who do you say now?
We got the Iranians here.
We can do more to interdict the shipping
Iran has got to get its destroyer
out of the way
as we protect the shipping.
If that destroyer gets in the way,
if it interferes with the shipping,
if it supports the Houthis,
then that is a challenge
that will have to be met
by the United States militarily.
Well,
if the watches develop
over the next several days,
let's talk
about what's happening in Ukraine,
because Russia has continued its air
assault on this nation,
including the capital of Kiev,
where we have seen
the destruction inside the capital city.
Now, it's
believed that these attacks carried out
with a number
of different types of weapons.
But one thing that the Russians are using
are these airborne hypersonic missiles,
which can deliver quite a blow
certainly to civilian areas here.
Talk to us about what
these weapons
in the fact that Russia is using them.
Well, first of all, these weapons can be
shot down by Patriot missiles,
but the Russians are using them
in combination with other
devices, with ballistic missiles,
with the Iranian supplied drones
and other things.
And they're coming at such a way
from such directions
as to basically overwhelm
the Ukrainians defense management system.
If you could get the Patriots
in the right position,
if you could
choose them at the right time,
they could stop these missiles.
But there aren't enough Patriots
to handle all of the requirements there.
So this is an ongoing struggle.
It's going to cause a lot of pain
and grief in Ukraine.
And the United States and the West
have got to provide
the assets, more assets to enable Ukraine
to handle this.
And that's very difficult
because we're not producing
and we don't have any excess
Patriot batteries right now
as long as we're talking about air power.
We've learned now
that since this latest
round of air attacks from Russia began,
the polls have said in Poland,
they've said that some of the missiles
have flown over Polish airspace
And now Poland says it's going to deploy
some of its warplanes over its country
in its own defense.
Is this posturing, General?
What's going on here?
I think it is posturing.
I think it's a political move
by the government in Warsaw.
I don't think that the Russians
intend to strike Poland,
as that's an entirely different scenario
if they're going to do that.
But on the other hand,
Poland is showing its concern
and assuring it to shore
not only its domestic population,
but to the other members of NATO
and particularly to Germany, France
and the United States.
It's part of Europe asking
the United States to lead.
Do more, get reinforcement equipment
to Ukraine to help Ukraine fight Russia
in Ukraine.
It's all part of the diplomatic
signaling going on right now.
General Wesley Clark, as always,
we appreciate your time.
Thank you so much for being with
us today. Happy New Year.",20240102
EOhZBj3Xidk,Senior Hamas leader killed in attack in Beirut,data/en_CNN\Senior Hamas leader killed in attack in Beirut.jpg,"Tonight, a senior Hamas leader is dead
amid serious concerns
the war in the Middle East
is about to get bigger.
Salah al-Hariri, a top official
in Hamas's military and political wings,
killed in Beirut.
Hamas says the leader was killed
by an Israeli airstrike.
Israel, however,
is not taking responsibility.
And this is all happening
as Iran has dispatched
a naval destroyer to the Red Sea.
Tensions there escalating
following a series of attacks
by the Iranian backed Houthi militia,
including against the United States.
And now the US Navy has killed Houthis
for the first time
since this conflict broke out,
sinking three
the boots at boats, rather,
after being attacked in the Red Sea
this weekend.
Oren Liebermann is OUTFRONT tonight.
At war in the U.S.
really getting drawn further
and further into this conflict.
Iranian involvement clearly evident.
What is the U.S. going to do next?
Eric, the
Biden administration's
position is
they don't
want to see a regional escalation.
They don't want to see
a widening of the war.
But clearly, it's not just up to the U.S.
to make a unilateral decision
in this case.
The events we've seen over
the course of the past couple of days
make a widening of the war,
an escalation, a growing possibility,
not only, as you pointed out
over the weekend,
the US military and U.S.
attack helicopters sinking
three fast attack boats
that were going
after a commercial vessel
and killing the cruise of those
for the first time
since the war,
but also
now the killing of such a brewery,
a senior Hamas militant in Beirut.
So the US has to watch all of this.
The U.S.
does have the backing
of an international coalition
in the Red Sea,
and that gives it essentially
some weight here in its actions. The U.S.
monitoring that Iranian Navy vessel
that's in the Red Sea from the U.S.
is a position.
It is an international waterway,
a critical one
that so they're allowed to be there.
But the U.S.
military will keep a very close
eye on them
as it watches where this all goes.
For the killing of Saleh
al-Hariri, who you saw there
with the Ayatollah, the leader of Iran.
We've seen promises
of revenge
and condemnation
from the Iranians, from Hamas,
Hezbollah and even some others.
The question
now, of course, what do they do?
And they have a number of options.
All of these Iranian proxies attack U.S.
forces in Iraq and Syria.
Go after U.S.
vessels in the Red Sea with the Houthis
there from Yemen, attack Israel.
Iran doesn't really see
much of a difference between the U.S.
and Israel.
So this is all possibilities
that we have to watch out for
and that the U.S. is watching out for.
Now, as you know,
Israel hasn't
officially taken responsibility
for the killing of Salah
al-Hariri in Beirut.
Israeli officials
have been a bit coy about this,
but it is worth pointing to this
tweet from Danny Danon,
a current member of Knesset
and the former Israeli
ambassador to the U.N..
He said on Twitter,
I congratulate
the IDF, the Shin Bet, the Mossad
and the security forces for killing
senior Hamas official Salah
al-Hariri in Beirut.
Anyone who was involved
in the October 7th
massacre should know
that we will reach them
and settle the account with them.
So Eric are pretty clear there.
It's also worth
remembering that Benjamin Netanyahu
promised Israel would go
after Hamas leaders wherever they are.
Yeah, that's for sure.
And appreciate the reporting as always.
Thank you.
OUTFRONT now, retired
Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling.
Good to see you tonight.
So let's pick up right there where
we're often left off.
The senior Hamas
leader, general,
who was killed by this strike
in southern Lebanon.
Also a long time
military political leader in Hamas.
How likely
do you think
some sort of retaliation
is in the next 24 to 48 hours?
This is what Oren's reporting.
First of all, Erica, is
it was phenomenal.
But this is the kind of thing
that the Biden administration
has been worried about.
They have been trying to repress
any kind of expansion of this conflict.
And this strike in Beirut against
the Hamas leader is
is not going to help that at all.
You also have to consider
that the Hezbollah leader,
Nasrallah, has said
that any strikes
inside of Lebanon by Israel,
especially in Beirut,
will cause serious
repercussions for the Israelis.
This is the Hezbollah leader.
What Israel has been trying to do
is not allow this
to come into a multi-front war
but we're already seeing that
they are fighting hard in Gaza.
They are
they have been fighting hard
in northern Israel against the Hezbollah
terrorists coming out of
southern Lebanon.
They've now struck in Beirut and Beirut.
They've had these
missile attacks from Yemen.
We've seen PMF forces in Iraq and Syria
continue to try and attempt
to influence this operation.
This is a
this is a tinderbox right now, Erica.
And as we look at this
tinderbox, too, as we
look at the broader
region here,
the Iranian naval destroyer
now heading to the Red Sea.
Days after the U.S.
sunk, three U.S.
ships killing all on board.
Can the U.S.
at this point
avoid getting drawn in deeper?
It's going to be challenging.
It's going to depend on what that Iranian
naval vessel does in the Red Sea.
Those are international waters.
There's a lot of transportation and
elements going through that
that are noncombatant
You know, the strike
against the three Houthi
rebel boats
that have tried to attack that attack
the Maersk
carrier the other day is an indicator
of what the Iranians are attempting
to do
by putting a naval destroyer
in this area, confronting an entire
carrier strike group
from the United States.
It's just it has the potential
for explosive activity
and it's going to be very dangerous.
The naval forces in that area
are going to have to watch their step
and be very careful about what they do.
I'd also like to get your take on
what we're seeing in Ukraine.
I mean, this really astounding
number of Russian missile
and drone attacks on Ukraine,
at least 500 over the past five days.
That's according to President Lenski.
We know at least five
people killed today, at least 53.
The number stands out
now killed from Friday's massive attacks.
We are nearly two years
now into this war.
How do you read the message
that Putin is sending to Ukraine?
Well,
first of all,
from the tactical perspective,
what Russia has been trying to do
is I use a basketball term,
flood the zone.
They are trying to put as many missiles
in the air as they can.
And there are all different types
coming from multiple directions
and multiple
platforms, air, sea and ground.
They are some of the types of missiles.
The hypersonic
missiles are very advanced.
But Ukraine has been very successful
in shooting most of them down.
Today's
activity, Ukraine was very successful.
But what I would say is two
things are happening.
First of all, Russia is continuing
their strategic approach
to try and affect
Ukrainian infrastructure to make it
a harsh winter for Ukrainian citizens
to continue to say,
even though the United States
and others may be balking,
we're still going to attack. Great.
And what's happening from
the Ukrainian side
is they just don't have
enough air defense to cover everything,
you know, air defense or points weapon
systems, Erica.
That means they have to be placed
in a location to guard a specific target.
So that means you can't
defend everywhere.
So the reason Russia is attacking
so many different targets
is they are trying to figure out where
Ukraine is soft
and where they have their defenses.
And I think that's going to continue
on for the next couple of days.
And it just shows the importance
of the United States
getting the Congress back and passing
this bill, which will give
more ammo and arms to Ukraine
during this period of time.
And this is a critical period.
Lieutenant General Mark Hertling,
always appreciate your insight.
Thank you.",20240103
NQ1mGV8r4FM,Freed Israeli mother asked what she feared most in captivity. Hear her reply,data/en_CNN\Freed Israeli mother asked what she feared most in captivity. Hear her reply.jpg,"They absolutely put on a show
to dress me up in nice clothes
and shoes before
I was released, when my girls and I
were barefoot for 50 days
and we were cold because we were wearing
short sleeves in November.
It's one big show journey
to share,
opening up and revealing
what really happened to her
and her two young daughters.
While held captive by Hamas
for nearly 50 days.
Once you got into Gaza,
what happened again?
But then we got into our hiding place,
an apartment that belonged to a family.
We were inside the room
without the ability to get out,
of course.
Closed door, closed window.
And after 16 days, they relocated us
to another place, a so-called hospital.
Did anyone tell you what was going
on, why you were there?
Were they members of Hamas?
They didn't give us a lot of information.
They mainly tried to say that
Hamas wants to release us.
But in Israel,
no one cares about us, which wasn't true.
We didn't believe most of the stuff
that they were saying.
And of course, it wasn't true.
Just over the border in Israel,
Darren's husband, Yoni,
never gave up hope.
Why is daddy not coming?
The stuff
that they've seen on October 7th,
I couldn't hide from them.
It's like we were in a war movie.
But after that,
it was very important to me
that they wouldn't feel a danger.
And I told them
there are no terrorists anymore
and we are
good people who are guarding us
until we can return home.
Were they good to you?
The people at our welcome,
they didn't physically harm me,
but there was
a lot of psychological warfare.
Like, what challenges are
that we want to return
to live in the kibbutz?
Because it's not our house.
It's not the place where we belong.
Did you know if they were Hamas or
just citizens in Gaza at a local level?
They didn't
give me a lot of info about them.
I don't even know their names.
I guess that the father is with Hamas,
but they didn't even give me much info.
I just know he worked
at Israel in the past,
and that's how he knows Hebrew
and that's how we communicated.
Were there other children there can?
Yes.
He had children and grandchildren,
and basically his children
were watching us. 24 seven.
I asked every day about my family
if they knew anything about Gary,
about my brother.
About my brother's baby girl.
They didn't give me any answers.
Why do you think they moved you after
16 days?
I think they tried to get our
hostages together
because the day that we arrived
to this so-called hospital,
other hostages arrived there as well.
And that was the first time
that I've met other hostages.
Why do you keep saying so-called hospital
hospital needs to treat sick people?
It doesn't hold hostages.
There were a few times
when the girls had high fever
and they were sick
and I had to take care of them
and I needed to get the medication.
So they brought someone who they said
that was a doctor
And the next day
I got medication from him for the girls.
But it wasn't enough.
I used to put a wave in the sink
with cold water
to bring down her temperature,
but she was screaming
and they would tell us to keep quiet.
And the girl had high fever,
but I had to take care of her somehow.
And were you worried that by mistake that
you and your girls would have
been in danger
as Israel was trying to retrieve you?
I heard the fighting.
And yes, we were scared.
The noises were very strong, very loud.
But at least that's how we knew
that something was going on
in order to get us back home
to put the pressure on Hamas
to release us.
What did you fear the most
when you were there?
surprisingly
it was the day that we were released
They were smuggling us
out of the hospital
and they got us on a Hamas vehicle
to get to a meeting point
with the Red Cross.
We waited a long time for the Red Cross,
and we were very scared
because we didn't know what was going on.
No one gave us any info.
Once the Red Cross
vehicles had arrived, thousands
of Gazans,
thousands children,
elderly everyone
came in
and started to climb on the cars
and bang on the cars.
I was holding
my girls and I was scared of a lynch mob.
And this was the first time
that Rose has said to me,
after a month
and a half of me
protecting her mommy, I'm scared.
Today, the girls are back in kindergarten
and with family therapy
for the most part, are readjusting well.
There was one day
that they saw a tractor here
and they asked if the evil men are here.
And I had to tell them, no,
the tractor does not belong
to the evil men.
The evil men are in jail.
And while they mourn their grandmother,
my mom,
Doron, says the healing
cannot really begin
until all of the remaining
129 hostages are released.
Including God, Moses, I.
The word has to understand
the reality that the hostages are in.
I don't want to think
about how they're treating men.
They're
how they're treating the young women
that are there.
People who kidnap children
and old people are not human.",20240105
PHTCH1nA-eQ,Mike Pence reacts to new polling about GOP views of Jan. 6,data/en_CNN\Mike Pence reacts to new polling about GOP views of Jan. 6.jpg,"You recently met with
families of hostages
still being held in Gaza.
More than 100 hostages
are believed to still be alive,
including six Americans.
A lot of the hostage families
with whom I've spoken
are pretty critical
of the Netanyahu government.
They say they don't think
Netanyahu is doing enough
to get their loved ones out,
that he's prioritized.
Military operations
instead of getting the hostages
back safely.
Is that what they told you?
Well, what I
what I heard from
not only families of hostages,
but as we walked
the streets of Kfar Rosa,
a kibbutz that was literally decimated
by the Hamas terrorists
invasion on October 7th, was a
was deep grief, but also a determination
to move their nation forward
and to restore their security.
I mean, you know,
it was remarkable to see the resilience
of the people
and the families that had lost loved
ones, the families of hostages.
And one understands their impatience.
And, you know,
I have three kids of my own,
two grandkids.
I can't even imagine the level of grief
that that
they're experiencing in the struggle.
But I must tell you
that I have never spent three days
on the road in any capacity
of whether it was on it
as vice president
or as a member of Congress, where
I have felt greater heartbreak
and greater inspiration.
And in combination,
when we went to the south
and we visited the kibbutz
where the Hamas terrorists
literally slaughtered families
in a merciless
and horrific way,
I and just never thought
I'd see the aftermath of war like that
and literally an unspeakable evil.
But to see the resilience
of the people of Israel,
to be among the troops
along the northern border with Lebanon
left me deeply inspired,
but more convinced than ever that
the United States of America must,
in this moment,
stand clearly shoulder to shoulder
with Israel
until they hunt down and destroy
the threat of Hamas once and for all.
So you have said that
Israel has the right to respond
to those horrific attacks
of October 7th
and the responsibility
to destroy Hamas as you just did.
But it does seem
that the IDF strikes have killed
more Palestinian civilians
and they have members of Hamas.
And there are Israelis
who are worried
about the high civilian death
toll in Gaza, including for the reason
that this high civilian death
toll might actually ultimately
make Israel less safe
by inspiring more future terrorists.
Do you share any of those concerns?
Well, first, Jake, look, I
grieve the loss
of any innocent civilian lives.
But one of the things I learned
as we visited
several
of where
the terrorist
literally took over the police station
and murdered people in the streets
is is that
this was not simply a terrorist attack,
but I believe
it was a terrorist invasion.
I mean, what I
what I learned
in our briefings in the South
was that that fence line separating
Israel from Gaza
was breached
in more than 90 different places
simultaneously, paving the way
for some 3000 terrorists heavily armed,
to move into Israel.
And in fact, the briefings I received
pointed out that actually the terrorists
had sufficient armaments and supplies
to literally march
all the way here to Tel Aviv,
all the way to Jerusalem.
But for the heroic efforts of police idea
forces and, frankly, courageous citizens,
they were stopped from doing that.
So I really believe that
what Israel is doing in Gaza
today is absolutely essential.
It is a response to an invasion
that was launched with the intention
of beginning the process of destroying
the Jewish state of Israel.
And I really do believe
that that this is a moment
where
where America needs
to speak with one voice,
that we will stand with Israel today
and tomorrow and every day
until they have won outright
this fight
and eliminated the threat of Hamas.
We learned late Friday night
that the secretary of defense, Lloyd
Austin, spent
multiple days
this past week in the hospital,
including time in the intensive
care unit for a medical issue
that is still undisclosed.
He did this
without the public, without Congress,
without the national Security Council
or even President Biden
being informed for several days.
The defense secretary temporarily assumed
some of the deputy defense secretary
temporarily assumed
some of the responsibilities
while she was on vacation in Puerto Rico.
As a former vice president,
you have
unique insight
as to what this actually means
for a secretary of defense
to be unavailable
and to not be transparent with his boss
about his health. What does it mean?
Well, first, I wish
I wish
the secretary of defense well,
and I'm pleased
he's making a full recovery.
But
this the handling of this
by the secretary of defense
is totally unacceptable.
And I believe the American people
have a right to know
about his medical condition,
about the reasons for it.
And he has he has a right to know
who was informed of his incapacity.
And I mean,
but but to think that at a time
when we have allies at war in Eastern
Europe and here in Israel,
that the leader of a
of America's military
at the Pentagon
would be out of commission
for a number of days.
And the president of the United States
didn't know about it.
I, I think I think it was
a dereliction of duty. And
and and
the secretary and the administration,
frankly, need to step forward
and give the American people the facts.
Yet we still don't even know what he was
hospitalized for.
Yesterday marked
the third anniversary
of the January six attack on the Capitol.
A Washington Post poll this week
found that a third of Republicans
believe the falsehood that it's probably
or definitely true
that the FBI instigated the attack
on the Capitol on January six.
President Trump
was spreading that lie
just this weekend, falsely
claiming the FBI was, quote,
leading the charge on January six.
That's not true.
Obviously, your life,
the lives of your family
members were threatened that day.
What do you say to those,
including your former running
running mate
who are actively spreading
this baseless lie
or maybe even more importantly,
to those who believe it?
Well, I would say
to every American, as I did during my
my presidential campaign,
that I know I did my duty, that day
to support and defend
the Constitution of the United States.
I kept my oath.
And and they also simply need to look
to the facts
that that the Capitol Hill police said
endured great hardship and great harm.
I think over 120 officers were injured.
I saw many of them
moving
through the garage where I was spirited
on the same day.
And, you know, the the truth is that
that this was a riot
that should never have happened.
That that as I've said many times
before, the former president's words
that day were reckless.
I believe all his history will judge
his role in that.
But at the end of the day,
where I live every day and
and frankly,
the words of encouragement
that I receive on a regular
basis is I know by God's grace
we did our duty that day three years ago.
But I will tell you, Jake, that
I actually I understand why
President Biden
wants to focus his campaign
on on three years ago,
the record of this administration
has weakened America at home and abroad.
And, you know,
I actually don't think
the election's going to be decided
on a tragic day three years ago.
I think it's going to be decided
on the failed policies
of the Biden administration
that embolden
the enemies of freedom around the world,
that launched the worst inflation,
that created the worst
crisis on our border in American history.
And it's one of the reasons
why I continue to hope
that with the Iowa caucuses
and New Hampshire
just around the corner,
that all the good Republican
voters in those states
will give our party a fresh start
and give us new leadership
to lead our party forward
in the election and beyond.
Is there somebody
other than Donald Trump that you want
the voters of Iowa to get behind?
Is there somebody you prefer,
whether it's Governor DeSantis
or Ambassador Haley?
You are somebody whose
endorsement could
actually make a difference
with any wavering Republicans
who want a fresh start.
As you note?
Well, I've been speaking
to several of my old competitors,
I think very highly
of Nikki Haley, of Ron DeSantis.
And frankly, Chris Christie
been a friend for many years.
And I don't put a lot of stock
in endorsements.
I'm not sure
whether I'm going to weigh in or if
and when I will.
But, you know, I ran for president
because I think different times
call for different leadership, Jake.
And and I'm hoping
that the good people of Iowa
that I got to know so
well in my campaign,
the good people of New Hampshire
and South Carolina will will look at this
moment and recognize
that elections are about the future.
And we need new leadership
in the Republican Party.
We certainly need new leadership
in the White House to move us forward.
And if I see an opportunity
to have an impact on achieving that,
I'll certainly do it.
And I'll keep you posted.
It's not just President Biden
who's focusing on January six.
Of course, you have Donald Trump
still talking about it.
Do you want to just like
take this opportunity
to clear up this lie
that the FBI was leading
the charge on January six?
It's obviously not true.
I'm sure you know it's not true.
Do you want to make make
that clear to the voters?
You know, I've seen the
director of the FBI
repeatedly assure
the American people
that the FBI were not the instigators
of the riot,
that occurred on January six.
And frankly, I'm very grateful
for the efforts of the FBI
to bring
nearly a thousand people to justice
who ransacked our Capitol
and did violence against police officers
that day.
But you're right,
We've been assured again and again
that it was not the case.
And I just must tell you,
having been there that day,
I mean, to see people literally
breaking windows, ransacking the Capitol,
it just infuriated me.
I remember thinking,
you know, not
this not here,
not at the United States Capitol.
And I believe everyone
that conducted that
that riot at the Capitol
needs to be held to the fullest
extent of the law
and pleased that many have.
But I have never been given
any information
of I've heard
the many repeated assurances
from the FBI that they were not involved,
and I take them at their word.",20240107

very clear here, is
sure to be a topic tonight
in the debate is Israel
how much support
the United States is willing
to give Israel specifically
and how conditional is that support?
So much of that war tonight
still being waged below ground.
And now
and it is important
right ahead of this debate,
CNN has gotten incredible access
for the first time
going deep inside captured Hamas tunnels.
In fact, the first Western television
crew allowed to go inside.
Khan Younis was our Nic Robertson,
and he got a rare
look at where
hostages were held underground.
And as part of this access,
which did come from the IDF,
it is important that, you know,
that CNN did agree to report
from Gaza under IDF escort at all times
as a condition for journalists
to join the embed with the IDF.
Media outlets
must submit footage
filmed in Gaza to the IDF
for Security Review.
Now, CNN did not submit its final report
to the IDF
and retained editorial control,
but we want to be very transparent
with you.
Nic Robertson is OUTFRONT
with this incredible report
that you will see. First, OUTFRONT,
Hanh Yunis, a gunner's view,
driving in,
scouring the landscape
for threats,
problem for these IDF troops.
Enemy is mostly hiding in tunnels.
They say
the biggest issue
is the fact
that we are actually maneuvering
above ground underground.
Golfers who commands Israel's biggest
military division ever is adapting.
So you use all your senses that you have.
You use your vision sensor,
you use your field sensor,
the smell sensor.
You know, he's invited
CNN to go deep into the tunnels.
We are told
this is the heart of Khan Younis,
and the hostages
are likely underground nearby
and that some were held here.
This tunnel we're going in here is one
where some of the hostages were held,
that first round of hostage releases.
Some of them came out from down here.
So how deep does this tunnel go?
Our first time to get up close to what?
Shaping this war.
We are moving underground.
We maneuver underground.
We get a reach
every each
and every militant
or each and every terrorist underground.
No modern army
has had to fight aboveground
an underground like this before.
How how is that to do it?
It's difficult
and it's just going to be a very, very
hard, long fight to see just how hard.
He takes us deeper.
So we came down a metal ladder.
We've come down one flight of stairs.
We're going down
a second flight of stairs here.
It's a double flight, it looks like.
And down here,
command and control
was running all the way down.
It's a deep, deep system.
How deep are we underground,
do you think, right now?
At the moment, we are more or less
between 10 to 15 meters underground.
10 to 15 meters.
And now we're going down another level,
down more steps
about to go down again.
Another level.
So my head keeps
banging off the roof.
What are we looking at here?
This is a small room, okay?
With some kind of air ventilation system
and ventilation system.
This goes up and boom,
metal frame around the door.
These metal frames,
this can be
as much as this is a small room.
This is how the different
cages that they put the kidnaped.
So they were held in cages.
In cages you
hidden and utterly cut off
and found here.
You really can't hear anything.
What's going on in the outside world
now?
We must be 20 or 30 meters down.
We're almost 20.
Almost 20.
So they have tunnels three times
as deep as this time.
What's clear here?
The money,
planning and preparation invested
for a long siege
with 20 meters
underground here, 20 meters.
And there's a fully flush toilet.
And it's even painted a nice place
for a light bulb.
And light switches the tiles.
The labyrinth keeps going.
Okay, now it's so low,
we're getting down on our knees
to get through.
All right. Yeah.
Gold for us.
Pauses,
lays out his path to victory underground.
It's Hamas,
and we have to reach
this Hamas core
to finish them off.
But those Palestinian people
aboveground are also dying.
So I understand that.
I understand.
That's why
we're trying to do it as fast as we can.
Yesterday,
there were mortars
and rockets fired from north of Gaza
to the southern state of Israel
into the civilian part of Israel.
So as long as those rockets
are coming out of northern Gaza,
the people of the south
who have moved to the south
can't go back to the north
as long as we haven't
carried out our mission
all the way,
as long as we haven't finished this
this mission,
I don't think we will leave here.
We had back half an hour underground.
We've seen only a fraction of this war
changing labyrinth gold versus challenge.
Find all the others.
All right,
Nic, 65 feet underground where you are,
it just even comprehend that your head
hitting the ceiling.
I mean, it's amazing
you were even able to withstand that,
to experience that yourself.
But when you're down there,
how is it that the IDF says or knows
that they're so close
to Hamas hostages in those tunnels
or in tunnels next to them
and yet isn't able to get them out?
And that's the
that's the difficult thing.
How do you fight the battle
when you're fighting
in several dimensions?
You know,
I said to him, normally in a battle
you would outflank your enemy.
You get around the side of them.
But down there,
he said, you know,
we don't even know
we can be standing on top of them.
They can be underneath us.
So we've got to try to fight
in all these different dimensions.
But they do have good intelligence
that's part of the picture.
And in that tunnel, at least,
they were able to extract DNA evidence,
blood
hair of the previous of the hostages
that actually been held down there.
So there's a lot of technical
equipment use as well.",20240111

DIRECTOR OF THE MIDDLE EAST
PROGRAM AT LONDON'S CHATHAM
HOUSE THINK TANK.
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.
DO YOU FEEL, LIKE APPARENTLY
THE SECRETARY OF STATE DOES,
THAT THINGS ARE REALLY
TEETERING ON THE EDGE RIGHT NOW
IN TERMS OF THE WAR EXPANDING
FROM GAZA AND ACROSS ISRAEL'S
NORTHERN BORDER INTO LEBANON?
&gt;&gt; THERE IS A DEEP CONCERN.
WHAT IT'S BECOME ALMOST
NORMALIZED, SIMMERING TENSIONS
COULD REALLY BOIL OVER.
THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE ARE.
WE'VE HAD ATTACKS COMING FROM
THE HOUTHIS IN YEMEN THAT HAVE
ATTACKED MARITIME SHIPPING.
WE HAVE SEEN BACK AND FORTH
BETWEEN HEZBOLLAH AND ISRAEL AT
A DANGEROUS LEVEL DESPITE THE
REGULAR MESSAGING FROM HASSAN
AS LAURA THAT THERE IS NO
INTENTION OF REGIONALIZE-ING
THIS WAR.
ATTACKS AND, SYRIA TAX AND IRAQ
AND THIS COULD WELL LEAD TO A
MISCALCULATION.
&gt;&gt; CAN I JUST POINTED EMPHASIZE
WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT NO
STRATA, --
WE READ-BASED JOURNALIST
TWEETED THAT HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN
HAVE SIGNALED REPEATEDLY THAT
THEY WANT TO VOID WAR --
AT SOME POINT THEY WILL
MISCALCULATE.
THIS WAS AFTER THE
ASSASSINATIONS WE'VE JUST BEEN
TALKING ABOUT.
YOU KNOW THE REGION.
EVERYBODY THINKS THEY HAVE --
THEY ARE PLAYING A VERY CLEVER
GAME, TARGETED JUST SO,
CALIBRATED JUST SO.
BUT IS MISCALCULATION SOMETHING
THAT COULD HAPPEN?
THE ISRAELIS ON THE LEBANESE
EVERY WENT HAPPENED ACROSS THAT
BORDER IN 2006, MOST NOTABLY.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE CLEAR RISK AND
THIS WAS PART OF ANTHONY
BLINKEN'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR
THIS TRIP.
TO MESSAGE THAT ESCALATION IS
NOT AN ANTIBODIES INTEREST.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY ARE
TWO DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND
TIMELINES UNDERWAY IN THE
REGION.
NO COUNTRY, NO STATE OR NON
STATE ACTOR UNDER REGION IS
REALLY PUSHING FOR ESCALATION.
WHEREAS THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT
IS TRYING TO RESET IT'S
DETERRENCE LEVELS SINCE OCTOBER
7TH AND THAT REQUIRES THEM NOT
ONLY TO TRY AND DECAPITATE
HAMAS LEADERSHIP, WHICH WE KNOW,
94 DAYS ON FROM OCTOBER 7TH,
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO.
BUT ALSO TO TRY TO PUSH BACK
HEZBOLLAH MADE CLEAR THAT
THEY'RE PORTERS ARE SAFE AND
THAT IS WHAT IS ONGOING RIGHT
NOW.
WHERE IS THE REST OF THE REGION,
UTERINE, YET HEZBOLLAH, BEAT
THE WIDER ARAB PARTNERS OF THE
UNITED STATES, HAVE NO INTEREST
IN SEEING THIS EXPLODE BECAUSE
IT COULD TAKE THINGS INTO A NEW
ORBIT.
&gt;&gt; REMIND EVERYBODY, I COVERED
THE 2006, WAR IT WAS NOT A
VICTORY BY ISRAEL OR HEZBOLLAH.
AT BEST IT WAS DETERMINED TO
HAVE BEEN FOUGHT TO A DRAW.
THERE WAS A U.N. RESOLUTION,
1701, THAT REQUIRED THEM TO
MOVE BACK FROM DEMARCATED
LANDS.
APPARENTLY NONE OF THEM KEPT TO
THAT COMMITMENT.
IS THERE A POLITICAL SOLUTION
THAT ACTUALLY CAN REINFORCE AND
DE-ESCALATE THE LEBANON OR
HEZBOLLAH ISRAEL TENSION RIGHT
NOW?
&gt;&gt; HAMAS HOCHSTEIN, ANOTHER
U.S., OFFICIAL WAS JUSTIN
LEBANON FOR THIS VERY ISSUE.
TRYING TO FIND A FACE SAVING
SOLUTION TO PUSH HEZBOLLAH
BACK.
ACCORDING TO U.N. RESOLUTION
1701, PASSED THE LAW TONY
RIVER.
AND ALSO FIND A FACE EVENING
WAY FOR HEZBOLLAH TO DO THAT.
THERE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTIONS
THAT HEZBOLLAH IS PULLING BACK,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU SEE
ISRAELIS KEEP PRESSING AND KEEP
STRIKING AT COMMANDERS IN
LEBANON.
THIS MIGHT BE LOW-LEVEL
ESCALATION, BUT THERE WILL BE,
ONE DAY WHERE THIS GOES TO.
FIRE THIS COULD BE A VERY
DIFFERENT MORE THAN 2006.
&gt;&gt; THEY SPOKE WHEN ALL OF THIS
FLARED UP TO THE LEBANESE
FOREIGN MINISTER WHO AT THE
TIME WAS IN WASHINGTON, GOING
TO VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE AND
TALK ABOUT THESE TENSIONS.
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID TO ME.
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT ANY ESCALATION
IN THE WAR.
WE DON'T WANT WHAT IS HAPPENING
IN THE SOUTH COULD BE SPREAD
OVER LEBANON.
WE DON'T LIKE A REGIONAL WAR,
BECAUSE IT IS DANGEROUS TO
EVERYONE.
DANGEROUS TO LEBANON, DANGEROUS
TO ISRAEL AND TO THE COUNTRIES
SURROUNDING ISRAEL.
&gt;&gt; HE HAS PRETTY MUCH LAID IT
OUT, BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT
FOR THE PRIME MINISTER OF THAT
COUNTRY, AN ALLY OF THE UNITED
STATES, TO BE SAYING THAT.
HOW DOES ISRAEL, IF IT DOES
BROADEN INTO A BIG, OR HOW DO
YOU SEPARATE A WAR AGAINST
HEZBOLLAH FROM A WAR AGAINST
LEBANON ITSELF AND THE
WESTERN-BACKED LEBANESE ARMED
FORCES WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN
TARGETED?
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK YOU CAN,
REALLY.
&gt;&gt; THE ISRAELIS SAY WE'RE NOT
STRIKING THE LEBANESE STATE.
&gt;&gt; THIS WILL BE SEEN AS A
BROADER WAR.
IT IS A WAR THAT WON'T JUST BE
ABOUT HEZBOLLAH.
THIS WILL INVOLVE THE WHOLE
SYSTEM, HEZBOLLAH ITSELF IS
EMBEDDED INTO THAT SYSTEM AND
IT IS PART OF THE GOVERNING
SYSTEM, WHETHER THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OR THE
LEBANESE LIKE IT OR NOT.
THAT IN ITSELF IS THE PROBLEM.
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE
OF QUESTIONS.
AND THE TIMES OF LONDON THE,
SUNDAY THE SUNDAY, TIMES YOU
MIGHT HAVE READ, IT THERE'S A
FRONT PAGE ARTICLE BY AN
ISRAELI JOURNALIST WHO TALKED
ABOUT THE STASH OF PAPERS AND
DOCUMENTS AND MAYBE OUR DRIVES
THAT SOME OF THE ISRAELI FORCES
HAD FOUND APPARENTLY IN HIYASSY
NOIR'S OFFICE.
IT TALKED ABOUT HOW, FROM A
COUPLE YEARS AGO, TALKED ABOUT
TRYING TO DISRUPT ANY
NORMALIZATION AT THE TIME
BETWEEN TURKEY AND ISRAEL.
AND IT TALKED ABOUT THEIR
STRATEGY.
BEFORE, THERE IS ALSO, I THINK
CHAD AMASSED EVEN PUT THIS OUT,
BROWN WHEN MATT EXCUSE TO BE A
JOURNALIST HAD INTERVIEWED,
YEARS AGO, THE HAMAS LEADER WHO
IS ASSASSINATED.
HE HAD SAID TO HER THAT OUR AIM
IS TO RADICALIZE, IN HER WORDS,
THE PALESTINIAN POPULATION.
SO THAT THEY DO NOT GO TOWARDS
PEACE.
HAMAS WANTS TO DELEGITIMIZED
THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AND
SORT OF DISABLE ANY SENTIMENT
TOWARDS PEACE.
DO YOU THINK THAT IS STILL WHAT
THEY THINK?
IN WHICH CASE, HOW DOES ONE GET
OVER THIS?
HOW DOES ONE GET TO A DAY AFTER?
&gt;&gt; CERTAINLY THERE ARE ELEMENTS
OF PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP,
HAMAS LEADERSHIP THAT HAVE MORE
RADICAL SENTIMENTS.
WHERE WE ARE TODAY,
NORMALIZATION HAS SLOWED IF NOT
STOPPED COMPLETELY.
IT WILL BE VERY FAR AND HARD TO
ACHIEVE WITHOUT A CEASE-FIRE
AND WITHOUT ATTENDING TO THE
HUMANITARIAN ISSUES ON THE
TABLE.
AS WELL AS WITHOUT A PLAN THAT
ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF
PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD THAT HAVE
BEEN COMPLETELY ABANDONED.
THAT'S, I THINK, A PRIMARY TASK
HERE.
BUT BEYOND, THAT WHAT IS
URGENTLY NEEDED IS A PATHWAY
THAT CREATES A PROCESS FOR
PALESTINIAN LEADERS TO WORK
TOGETHER FOR REFORM,
ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNANCE WITH
ELECTIONS AT THE END OF THIS
PROCESS.
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PALESTINIANS
THEMSELVES TO ELECT FUTURE
LEADERS SHOULD CERTAINLY BE AN
OPPORTUNITY GIVEN TO
PALESTINIANS, NOT ONE THAT
THEY'VE HAD FOR WELL OVER TWO
DECADES NOW.
&gt;&gt; THEY HAVEN'T GONE TO
ELECTIONS.
LAST QUESTION, YOU'RE AN EXPERT
AND A STUDENT OF THE IRAN PIECE
OF THIS WHOLE PICTURE.
IT ALSO SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO
BE STAYING OUT OF A DIRECT
CONFRONTATION.
HOW LONG CAN THAT LAST?
WHAT REALLY DOES IRAN WANT OUT
OF ALL OF THIS?
&gt;&gt; IRAN'S MOTIVATIONS ARE
MULTIPLE.
ULTIMATELY, THE ISLAMIC
REPUBLIC HAS ALWAYS BEEN DRIVEN
BY ITS OWN SENSE OF SURVIVAL
ABOVE ALL AND ITS SECURITY AND
STABILITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN
PARAMOUNT.
IT HAS RELIED ON THE ACCESS OF
RESISTANCE, THIS NETWORK IT IS
CULTIVATED AND CREATED OVER A
NUMBER OF DECADES.
AS ITS PRIMARY TOOL OF
DETERRENCE AGAINST ISRAEL AND
THE UNITED STATES.
TWO COUNTRIES THAT IT HAS
DEFINED AS ITS THREATS IN THE
REGION.
IT WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE
ACCESS OF RESISTANCE, BUT AT
THE SAME TIME, HERENDA SEE THE
U.S. AS A DECLINING INFLUENCE
IN THE REGION.
HATE DESTABILIZING REGIONAL
INFLUENCE ABOVE ALL.
AND IRAN HAS OVER THE YEARS
RESTORED TIES WITH THE GULF
ARAB COUNTRIES AND IS LOOKING
TO FORGE STRONGER ECONOMIC
LINKAGES AND BE PART OF AN
INTEGRATED MIDDLE EAST AS WELL
THAT, OF COURSE, IT'S HARD TO
ACHIEVE THIS OPPOSITIONAL
STANCE WITH THE UNITED STATES,
ACCELERATING NUCLEAR PROGRAM
AND, OF COURSE, THIS UNDERLYING
TENSION WITH ISRAEL THAT IS, I
THINK, TEHRAN'S CALCULATING IT
WILL INCREASE OVER THIS YEAR IN
PARTICULAR.
&gt;&gt; VERY BRIEFLY BEFORE I LET
YOU GO, DO YOU THINK THERE IS A
WAY TO PULL THINGS BACK?
THE ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER
TOLD THE U.S. FOREIGN MINISTER
TODAY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOME
KIND OF DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION.
&gt;&gt; YES, I THINK THERE IS, AND
IT BEGINS WITH THE CEASE-FIRE.
THAT CEASE-FIRE CAN SET THE
PATHWAY FORWARD TO RELEASE
HOSTAGES THAT HAVE BEEN
COMPLETELY NEGLECTED, AS GIDEON
LEVY BROUGHT UP IN YOUR
PREVIOUS INTERVIEW.
BEYOND THAT, OF COURSE, THE
ARAB STATES, PARTNERS OF THE
UNITED STATES, ARE GOING TO
NEED TO PLAY A REALLY IMPORTANT
AND INTEGRAL ROLE IN
GUARANTEEING PALESTINIAN
SECURITY, ISRAELI SECURITY,
PROVIDING A BRIDGE TO IRAN AND
MAKING SURE THEY ARE NOT A
SPOILER AND WHAT COMES NEXT.
THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG
PROCESS WAITING FOR THE DAY
AFTER TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS A
BIT TOO LATE TO.

r9c0117-HNc,Alleged leaked Netanyahu audio reveals he might be angry with the US,data/en_CNN\Alleged leaked Netanyahu audio reveals he might be angry with the US.jpg,"During a
testy meeting with
hostage families Monday,
Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
appears to have strained his one
regional relation
ship with Qatar that matters most
to those very families moving.
You don't hear me thinking Qatar,
because Qatar is essentially
no different from the U.N.
or the Red Cross.
And in some ways, even more problematic.
They have leverage
because they're financing them.
These comments caught off mic,
triggered a rapid and barb diplomatic
put down from Qatari officials
who helped negotiate
the release of almost 100
Israeli hostages in November,
saying in a tweet,
We are appalled by the alleged remarks
attributed to the Israeli prime minister.
If validated, are irresponsible
and destructive
to the efforts to save innocent lives,
but are not surprising.
Just days earlier,
Qatar had been talking up
relations with Israel
and the pretense
for Hamas to release more hostages.
We are engaging in serious discussions
with both sides.
We have presented ideas to both sides.
We are getting
a constant stream
of replies from both sides.
Qatar's
frustration now
seems personal, with Netanyahu.
Qatar concluding their criticism
with a view
increasingly suspected by some Israelis.
Netanyahu wants to keep the war going,
saying in a tweet,
The Israeli prime minister
would only be obstructing
and undermining the mediation process.
For reasons that appear to
serve his political career,
hostage, families who were
in the meeting with the prime minister
released a terse statement
appearing to blame
Netanyahu for the leak.
Although he denies it,
the fact that the censorship
was given permission
to publish this audio recording
is serious
and indicates a loss of judgment.
This leaked audio also suggests
he may be trying
to draw the White House
into confrontation.
I was very angry recently
and I didn't hide it from the Americans
that they renewed the contract
on the military base
they have with Qatar.
President Biden has an openly spoken
to the tensions.
But this week, Secretary of State
Antony Blinken criticizing Israel
for taking Gaza and territory
to create a security buffer.
We've been very clear about
maintaining, in effect, the
the territorial integrity.
And to that point,
has Qatar actually decided to possibly
pull out of the mediation talks?
There's absolutely no indication
that they're going to do that. Indeed.
CIA Chief Bill
Burns is on his way to meetings
with his Israeli counterpart,
Egyptian officials.
And, yes, Qatari officials as well.
And that is all about trying
to get those remaining hostages
released Jake.

yetveeYbHXc,Top UN court orders Israel to prevent genocide in Gaza,data/en_CNN\Top UN court orders Israel to prevent genocide in Gaza.jpg,"The International Court of
Justice has ordered Israel
to take all measures
to prevent
the commission of genocidal acts in Gaza
and to punish any public
incitement of genocide.
That provisional ruling
announced at The Hague.
A short time ago,
with the court
concluding that it has jurisdiction over
the case brought by South Africa
alleging Israel's actions in Gaza
could amount to genocide,
the court stopped short of calling
for an immediate cease fire in Israel's
war with Hamas.
It did order, however, Israel
to submit a report
within one month on what it is doing
to respond to the court's order
Israel must, in accordance
with its obligations
under the Genocide Convention
in relation to Palestinians in Gaza,
take all measures within its power
to prevent the Commission of all Acts
within the scope of Article
two of the convention, in particular, a
killing group's members of the group B
causing serious bodily or mental harm
to members of the group
Well, these provisional measures
come as the Hamas run
health ministry
in Gaza reports the death toll in Gaza
since the start of the war
has now passed
26,000 with 64,000 people injured.
It says at least 183 were killed
over the past day.
There is a lot to unpack here.
We've got Melissa Bell
connecting us from The Hague.
Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv
as well as David McKenzie
in Johannesburg.
All standing by for analysis.
Melissa, let's start off with you.
We've just heard from the ICJ that
of course,
ruling that just came through
Immediate measures
it says that Israel must adhere to.
Take a seat.
What you've heard
and maybe you can hear behind me lately,
some of the pro-Palestinian protesters
listening on a big screen
who've been cheering on
is every one of those counts.
And the ruling
came from the head
of the International Court
of Justice here in The Hague.
It was just short of a cease fire,
of course, that the ruling went.
And, yes,
significantly further towards it
than any of us had imagined
when these proceedings began.
We listened on the 10th
and 11th of January
to South Africa
and then Israel lay out their case.
And what we just heard today
was the head of the ICJ essentially
go extremely far
in the direction of South Africa,
conceding that it was because
of all the genocidal acts
were being committed,
urging Israel
to take image urgent measures
to ensure
that there are no further
killings of Palestinians in Gaza.
A group, by the way,
that the court recognizes
as a protected people
nor the further
causing of any mental or bodily
harm to them.
Now that is short of a cease fire,
but very close to it.
And I think this is a ruling
that Israel is now
going to have to respond to.
It had been said the fact
that it were chosen
to represent themselves
as robustly as they did,
an indication of how seriously they took
this court and its rulings and no doubt
what the wider world will consider
as it takes in these proceedings. So
an order that I think
will now see a great deal
of pressure on Israel,
certainly to allow more access to Gaza
and probably
to alter the way in which it is
perhaps
going about its military operation
or certainly the transparency
with which is going about in the wake
of this,
the UN's highest court, such
that it will be a very difficult
ruling for Israel to ignore
Melissa Bell there for us at The Hague.
And we can see those protesters as well.
We've also got Jeremy
Diamond standing by in Tel Aviv.
And in fact,
we've just heard from
Netanyahu, from Benjamin
Netanyahu, hailing
the ICJ ruling
as what he says a rejection
of discrimination against Israel
Yeah, the Israeli prime minister
in his comments
making clear that Israel's commitment
to international law, in
his words, is unwavering
and also making clear that Israel
is not going to stop its war in Gaza.
Talking about the fact
that Israel will continue
to defend itself against Hamas,
which he calls
a genocidal terror organization.
But what he is also distinguishing
in this video message
is that the war in Gaza is against Hamas
and not against Palestinian civilians.
And he is also making
note of the fact that Israel
will, quote, continue
to facilitate
humanitarian assistance
to Palestinian civilians
and continue its efforts to minimize harm
to Palestinian civilians
as it continues
its military operations in Gaza.
But we're getting some far stronger
reaction, perhaps from Israel's
defense minister,
who is making clear that
those who seek justice,
he says, will not find it
in the leather chairs
of the court chambers in The Hague,
slamming the Hague's decision
not to reject
South Africa's
petition outright
to allow this case to proceed.
I think
now one of the real questions is to
what extent is Israel going to actually
abide by the terms
of this provisional
reading ruling and to what extent
will they actually compiled this report
that the court has demanded of Israel
within the next month?
I think it's clear
that Israel
has decided
to kind of play along with this court
up until now, has chosen
to defend itself
quite arduously in these proceedings.
But now as it relates to specific actions
on the ground,
to what extent will
Israel actually move forward with those
to to another extent,
it's important
to note
that this ruling obviously didn't
go as far as South Africa
wanted, as far as Israel feared
it would in terms of calling
for an outright cease fire in this war.
That has not happened here.
And because of that, there's certainly
a significant sigh of relief
among senior Israeli officials
as they look at this ruling,
even though this court very much laid out
the disastrous humanitarian
conditions in Gaza, gave some
credence to
the claims of
South Africa,
while it made clear that it wasn't
ruling on the merits of the case.
It certainly can
continue to soil Israel's
international reputation,
but it doesn't go as far as calling
for an outright cessation of hostilities
which could have potentially
put Israel in the position
of defying a binding
ruling by this court.
All right.
We've got David McKenzie
in Johannesburg as well.
And David,
we also heard from
the minister of international relations
naledi, Pandor, outside
the court today and to Jeremy's points.
Yes, the
you know,
the wording in terms
of the ceasing of fire
off of the the military action
right now wasn't in this
ruling by the ICJ.
But what naledi pandor,
interestingly, said
that if Israel is going to abide by
what was put out in court today,
that a cessation would have to occur
Well, I think
what's important here to note
is that this is a matter that isn't over.
As Jeremy mentioned,
Israel was required
to give a report in about a month
about how it is going
towards meeting those requests,
those binding
requests of the court
to avoid what the court says
may at some point amount to genocide
as it does
its investigation
into the horrible circumstances in Gaza.
So from the South African perspective,
they will be hoping for the pressure
to be piled on
to try
and improve
the conditions of the people in Gaza.
It was very telling that
when someone asked
Naledi Pandor,
the Minister of International Relations
and cooperation
on the steps of the court, you know,
what does this say about South
Africa and Israel?
She said, well,
this is about the Palestinian people.
And as you know, Elena,
the ruling party here
has had a long affinity
to the Palestinian cause
all the way back to and before
Nelson Mandela.
This is a consistent
policy stance
by the South African government.
And they've put the money
where their mouth is, as it were.
She said they couldn't stand idly
by while these alleged
atrocities happened.
And now they are going to continue
this case in the months
and potentially years ahead.
I think an important thing
to note as well.
South
Africa says that it wants to pursue
this case also to try and
make a statement about
bodies like the U.N.
Security Council not being effective in
trying to push global cooperation.
They said
this venue may be a way to do it.
Take a listen.
The member states of the United Nations
must oversee the process and ensure
that we create a basis
for a global community
in which a resort to arms
is no longer easily a resort to abuse.
It's no longer easy and that more effort
is now
directed toward negotiation
and towards seeking peaceful means
of ending conflict.
She did allude to powerful
friends of Israel,
and you can read the US
and that to perhaps persuade
Israel
behind the scenes
to change how they are configured
pursuing this war
against Hamas
in the coming weeks
to avoid possible censure
in the coming months from this court.
Of course, Israel has repeatedly denied
that it is doing anything
in the theater of war.
In fact,
they've said that they have tried
to protect civilians
and provide humanitarian aid.
It will be
really important to see
whether the behavior of Israel
or the sense of how
they are
working towards these judgments
or at least rulings by the court
play out in the coming days.",20240126

near the border with Gaza,

more than two dozen men,
some of them kneeling,
some of them sitting on the grou

were Palestinians detained
by the Israeli military in Gaza
and brought to Israel
for further questioning.

not to be taking part
in terrorist activities

as soon as possible.
Now, they also addressed the con

talking about the fact
that they were wearing
these white coveralls
because they had been stripped,
their clothing
searched to ensure
that they were not carrying
weapons or explosives.
And they said that
they would be given clothing
once they arrived
at that detention facility.
They also said that
when we came across them
that they were about
to be put on a heated bus
in order to be taken
to that detention facility.
We weren't able to see

We also interviewed
ten Palestinian men and boys

That's according to intelligence
that Israel shared
not only with the United States,
but also with UNWRA directly.
And following that information,
UNWRA went on to fire
some of those staffers.
We don't know exactly how many,
they did say
that they fired
multiple staffers, in part
because they want to ensure
that humanitarian assistance

In Gaza,
the Palestine Red Crescent
Society is appealing for protect

The aid agency says

has endangered its medical staff

taking shelter there.

people were killed
and another 75 injured this week
when Israeli tank fire hit the U

hundreds of people.
That's according to the UN.

fled the area in southern Gaza
following the attack.

it is looking into the incident
and said it wasn't the result of

You know, increasingly,
Palestinians have been moved
into smaller and smaller spaces.
And for this to happen,
it's just another example
where there are very few places
physically to be.
And to see them
continually getting bombed.
It just escalates this feeling
that nowhere is safe
and the anxiety
of the hardship of living amidst
the worst situation.
After the attack,

So just to start with,
getting supplies in on a normal
Gaza was always dependent
on those crossings
for all of their commercial good
and everything else.
On a normal day,
500 trucks,
including like regular
grocery store
restocking, would go through the
to go into Gaza every day.
At this point, we're averaging
about 130 trucks a day, just of
not of any commercial things.
There are hundreds of trucks
lined up at the Egyptian border.
Some items have been
indiscriminately banned
from those trucks.
So sleeping
bags were rejected
for having metal zippers.
Tents were respected

So a truck gets the inspection s

where are we

to go to collect aid?
Earlier in this segment,
we talked about a U.N.
shelter getting bombed.
You have a hospital getting bomb
Where do we feel comfortable
telling people that they can go
and be safe to get these supplie
So people are so desperate,
they're even mobbing
the trucks that are coming in.
But we just have no visibility
to how we safely transport
because areas
that should have been deconflict
continue to be bombed.
And then what about
medical care?
So this is you know, at this poi
the U.N.
is warning that a warning
that a famine could be coming.
But at this point,
your people are so depleted
of food and resources
and no medical care
that they're you're starting
to see people dying
of secondary things
like diarrheal diseases, infecti
and and with the lack of medical
or medical supplies.
They are hopeless.
Very people are going to die
from very simple infections
that could have been handled
with antibiotics.
Terrible.
All right, Jim McKenna,
thank you so much.
And I know you
and so many
non-government agencies
are working so hard to try to re
whatever care
and assistance you can,
and it is an uphill battle.

34CxzZtVxnE,CNN goes into underground tunnel that IDF claims was under Gaza cemetery,data/en_CNN\CNN goes into underground tunnel that IDF claims was under Gaza cemetery.jpg,"This is no ordinary quarry.
It's where the living ones
bury their dead.
Gaza's Bani Suheila, a cemetery
hollowed out by Israeli excavators.
These were all graves.
This was a cemetery.
But the military says
that they were forced to come in here
because they discovered a Hamas
tunnel
running right underneath that cemetery.
But the Israeli military
failed to prove that
stunning claim
during a three hour tour of the area.
They invited us here a week
after we first uncovered
this graveyards,
partial destruction
using satellite imagery.
Part of a CNN investigation
that found 16 cemeteries
in Gaza
damaged or destroyed
by the Israeli military.
This whole area
here is a military compound.
From the mosque over there
underneath the graveyard.
All the way down north and south,
my forces are beginning to try to flank
this area, were fired from this area
again and again and again.
They couldn't understand why.
So that's how you determine
that there was a tunnel here
because you were being fired upon. Yes.
Our journey to investigate
the Israeli military's claims
begins in the rubble
of what they say
was a residential building.
You even just standing
at the mouth of this tunnel,
you can feel the humidity
just like emanating here.
And this is the way that we go in to
what they say
is an extensive tunnel system
in Bani Suhaila.
We descend into a dark, seemingly endless
labyrinth,
just as tight spaces like this
in certain parts of this tunnel.
But then you get here
and you have full head space pretty much
all throughout it, you can see that
there's electricity,
there's telecommunications.
The Israeli military says
that this tunnel system
actually leads to a Hamas command center,
which they say was used by Hamas fighters
to coordinate their attacks.
The Israeli
military says
this is that command center,
multiple rooms equipped
with plumbing and electricity.
Maps like this one lining the walls.
You can see a kitchen here
equipped with a sink,
running water
with the pipes
running through the tunnel wall.
You have a fan plates.
I mean,
you could imagine this being in a house,
but instead it's deep, deep underground.
Where are we right now?
I mean, what's above us?
So we're in the headquarters
of a Hamas commander.
Above us is a cemetery
that I showed you from the outside.
If you look at the satellite
imagery of this cemetery,
there is a wide area
that the military has cleared.
Why is that necessary?
In order to uncover these tunnels?
We have to reach the tunnels.
We have to reach the tunnels
and cover the tunnels.
We have to prevent
from the enemy to flank us.
But there's no way for us to verify
whether we are actually beneath
the graveyard.
General Goldfuss
takes us back out of the tunnel,
but not into the cemetery.
Instead, we leave the same way we came in
before walking back to the enormous hole
where the cemetery once stood.
He's.
Hold on.
Yeah.
We're asking the general
if we can actually see
the shaft to the tunnel,
but the answer is no.
So they go by the machinery,
which I don't want you to,
just to take pictures of
the security muscles.
But what about if we don't film it?
We just look with our eyes
as we might fall in,
the whole thing can collapse.
Well, you have to walk to the edge.
The edge is not secured.
Can collapse, collapses, machinery,
so on.
That's.
It's not something
I'm going to take a risk on. Sorry.
The Israeli military later
provided this drone footage
showing the tunnel shaft
we entered and another one nearby.
CNN geolocated the footage
using this satellite image.
This outline shows
where the cemetery once stood.
And these are the two tunnel entrances.
Clearly outside the graveyard.
As for the tunnel
they say
they found here
where the cemetery once stood.
The military never provided any evidence.",20240129

1D3uQbiE8No,Israeli soldier records himself blowing up a mosque,data/en_CNN\Israeli soldier records himself blowing up a mosque.jpg,"Inside Israel, people are
seeing a very different picture of the war
from the rest of the world and from from
what you've just heard with IDF soldiers
documenting their military offensive
in real time.
Correspondent Jeremy
Diamond reports on this trend unfolding
on social media.
This is a how to video
on how to blow up a mosque in Gaza.
Format is internet fluent.
The content is very real.
Filmed, edited and posted on Instagram
by an Israeli soldier
It's one of dozens reviewed by CNN.
For many in 2024, social media is everyday
life.
Israeli soldiers are no different,
except they're fighting
Israel's largest
and most brutal war in decades.
In video
after video
after video, U.S.
soldiers document the destruction of Gaza
and rejoice on this.
They filmed detonations
to use as wedding invitations
Among them are would be comedians
whose videos satirizing the war
show the devastation in Gaza.
Air you get to see the
satellite lands.
And now
up to five soldiers
have always documented themselves.
It could be in journals.
It could be with you taking pictures.
Avner Carvajal who served in the IDF
during the second intifada.
He leads the group Breaking the Silence,
which encourages
soldiers to speak out
about the realities of occupation.
Even if we do find,
you know, the why we went to this war
important, significant and a necessity,
we have to ask ourselves
how we're conducting ourselves in wartime.
The videos often
end up on the social media channels
of Right-Wing Political Commentators.
They boast to the Israeli public of
the tactics used to defend them by going
the IDF told CNN that it has acted
and continues to act to identify
unusual cases that deviate from
what is expected of IDF soldiers.
Those cases will be arbitrated
and significant command measures
will be taken against the soldiers
involved.
Images from Gaza of Israel's war injured
are rare on Israeli television,
but they're there on tick tock.
The overarching theme is that,
you know, we're here.
We're going to win. We're powerful enough.
And I think that what these soldiers
are doing with these these rips
that we see on social media
is part of an attempt
to regain a sense of agency,
regain sense of power, reclaim,
you know, the sense of positive self
image, the way we talk about ourselves
before October seven, 09.
At times, they openly defy their military'
in their own right
and film themselves, destroying
civilian shops
because Israel
is under increasing scrutiny
over the war in Gaza.
These videos may well be adding
fuel to that criticism.
Just in to CNN, the IDF says it's detained
more than 20 people suspected
of taking part in the October 7th attacks
as its raid of the largest
functioning hospital in Gaza continues.
The Israeli military also says
it found weapons inside the facility
but CNN hasn't been able
to independently verify that photograph.
The IDF, though, says the mission inside
the hospital is still ongoing.
I want to get to CNN's Nic Robertson
who is live in Tel Aviv for us.
So, Nic, what more are you learning
Well, there's a couple of things
about the hospital.
We're learning from.
The World Health Organization say
they are trying to work with the Israeli
authorities to get access to the hospital
and stabilize the situation there.
According to hospital
authorities, electricity
and the ICU unit and possibly oxygen,
oxygen supply there as well as well
are in critical condition.
And this could threaten
the lives of several patients and infants
that are within the
within the ICU, the critical care unit
at the hospital there.
But to the what the IDF is saying
that they have now rounded up 20 suspects
they say, who were involved
in the October 7th attacks.
They've released photographs
of a few of them
that we cannot independently verify
were involved in the October 7th attacks.
The IDF described one of them
as an ambulance driver.
Again, something we can't verify.
The IDF originally went into the hospital,
they said, because they had credible
intelligence that there were possibly
the bodies of hostages, that they had this
intelligence, they say, from their sources
and from other hostages.
The IDF point to the fact that hostages
have been held in hospitals before.
And according to hospital officials
at the National Hospital,
the IDF were digging up bodies and some of
the temporary graves that have been done
get inside the hospital
to check those bodies.
But later in the day yesterday, Thursday,
the IDF said
that they were becoming aware
that they could be terror operatives
hiding among the displaced people
within the hospital.
And they began to filter out
the displaced people from the hospital,
taking into custody those suspects.
And now they say.
20 suspects involved, October 7th,
have now been rounded up from that
hospital Yeah.
Nic Robertson
going to continue to follow those updates.
Thank you so much.",20240216
4bk68dV3rB8,Netanyahu unveils plan for Gaza’s future post-Hamas,data/en_CNN\Netanyahu unveils plan for Gaza’s future post-Hamas.jpg,"The Palestinian Authority
is lashing out
at Benjamin
Netanyahu's proposal for Gaza's
postwar future,
calling it a plan
for the reoccupation of Gaza.
This after the Israeli prime minister
unveiled a day after plan
to members of the security cabinet
Thursday night.
It includes the complete
demilitarization of the enclave
Closing off
Gaza's southern border with Egypt,
as well as the overhaul of Gaza's
civil administration
and education systems.
It comes as Israel joins talks in Paris
aimed at a ceasefire
in its war with Hamas
to the potential
release of hostages as well.
There's a growing sense of urgency
to find an agreement here.
After Israel
threatened to expand its assault
in Gaza's
southernmost city, Rafah,
if hostages are not released
by the start of Ramadan
in about two weeks from now.
CNN's Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv
for us with the latest.
So let's just talk about this plan.
Nic, demilitarization of Gaza,
indefinite military control
by the Israelis.
Also, Israel
would have basic control
of all sort of access points
to Gaza as well.
Just give us more detail
in terms
of what is in this plan
and how the US will likely respond
to certain parts of this
Yeah, we've actually already heard
from Secretary of State
Antony Blinken,
referring to a couple of parts of it.
He said he'd just seen reports about it
and had yet to get into the detail of it.
One of the things that stands out in this
proposal by Prime Minister Netanyahu is
the full control of Gaza,
all the borders,
which means taking control
of the southern border
along
what is now
the border between Gaza and Egypt.
And he says that is to stop
any smuggling
underground using tunnels or overground.
That would be a significant change
and could well be contested
and of course, that thing alone.
And there are other issues as well.
But that just that one point alone
brings into question
the idea of Palestinian statehood
if it can't control its borders.
But, of course,
another point
that Prime Minister
Netanyahu
put in his plan
is that there will be no independent
Israel will certainly not recognize
any independent recognition
of a Palestinian state.
And that's a message
to the United States.
One of the other points,
and this is one of the points that
Secretary Blinken picked up upon
is that in the plan, there is
there will be, according
to Prime Minister Netanyahu,
a border area inside Gaza giving security
for Israel outside of Gaza
for as long as is deemed necessary.
And that is something
that the United States
had previously opposed specifically.
So that
also seems to sort of fly in the face of
of what Israel's allies are saying.
Another point that's raised as well
is Israel
passing over
or giving some sort of civilian control
to unnamed,
unspecified civilian bodies or persons.
But also it talks about de radicalizing
inside schools, inside
and welfare institutions.
Again, that that does not really sound
like an independent Palestinian state,
in fact.
This is, I think, the point that that
the Palestinian Authority are making,
that this is really
a reoccupation by by Israel,
although Israel is saying
it will completely
it will completely demilitarize
the whole area.
But it clearly wants to be able to have
the operational ability
inside the freedom
of operational movement
for for security measures.
So this is what the Palestinian Authority
is talking about.
So this is,
it appears,
a very maximalist plan
that's been put forward
by the prime minister.
This is not set in stone.
It's something that will be discussed.
But I think it indicates
even to allies like the United States
that Israel's position is on on
Gaza is really as strong
and as hard as it has ever been.
Yeah.
I mean, a lot of people
will look at this plan
and see as a reoccupation of Gaza
or at the very least preventing
any kind of Palestinian sovereignty,
at least in the short term.
What sort of regional reaction
are we getting
so far?
We've yet to
hear from some of the regional partners,
in particular Qatar, that is,
that is the interlocutor at the moment
between Israel and Hamas
to get the hostages released.
And the language that's been put forward,
although it doesn't specify
Qatar by name,
but the language seems to imply that
Qatar would not be part of the plan
going forward for having an involvement
as it has had until now,
helping essentially helping
finance through Israel
in the United States.
The authorities inside inside Gaza,
that would appear to be ruled out.
Israel is saying that the
the Arab partners that it would have
to help administer and finance
what happens inside
Gaza would be of its choosing.
And the indication is that Qatar
not named but would not be one of them.
So how they'll respond is unclear.
Obviously, the plan
to control
the southern border is going to
affect Egypt.
We haven't heard them yet
reply specifically to this,
but it will have potentially
territorial implications for them
in other implications as well.
And we know that right now
the Egyptians are building a buffer zone,
an additional security zone
along that southern border,
potentially in preparation
for for those Palestinians
who are stuck in Rafah,
if they try to get over the fence
and escape out of Gaza,
if there's an Israeli ground incursion.
But this could also be
potentially because Israel is
going to it's going
to take control of that of that border.
Right.
Nic Robertson
live for us that thank you so much.
Israel is rejecting
disturbing allegations reported by UN
experts of its forces killing,
imprisoning and raping
Palestinian women and girls,
saying
the allegations are motivated
by hatred for Israel.
Earlier this week, UN experts
said they were distressed
by reports of multiple
forms of sexual assault
against Palestinian women
and girls in detention,
including being stripped naked
and searched by male Israeli
army officers.
As U.N.
experts are calling
for an independent investigation.
And the unique toll on women
in this conflict cannot be ignored.
Statistics from the UN show
that around
70% of those killed in Gaza
are estimated to be women and children
and that two mothers are killed
every hour.
Earlier, my colleague Becky
Anderson spoke to the UN
Special Rapporteur on violence
against Women and Girls
about these allegations.
Reem al-Salam said that
some of these allegations are not new.
I want you to listen to what was said.
We must remember that
these reports of sexual violence,
especially, I would say,
committed against
Palestinian women,
is one of many egregious human
rights and humanitarian law violations
that Palestinian women
are being subjected to,
including an unfolding genocide
occupation for decades,
arbitrary killing, forced starvation,
the use of reproductive violence
in particular
as a tool of war against them.
And I would say that
these allegations that we've heard
also are not new.
They've been pointed out
by human rights
organizations on the ground.
My colleague, the special rapporteur
on the occupied territories.
And our last report also pointed out
that there have been longstanding reports
of Ill-Treatment
and torture
that Palestinian women
and sexual assault
that they have faced
in Israeli detention.
So we are not talking about something
that has just emerged after October 7th.

Rapporteur on
Violence Against Women and girls, Reem
Musallam, speaking to CNN earlier.",20240223
8DadIzZa_M8,Palestinian prime minister and government resign,data/en_CNN\Palestinian prime minister and government resign.jpg,"Israeli military has
also presented
a plan for evacuating civilians
from the areas of fighting in Gaza.
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office
says the IDF presented
the war cabinet
with an upcoming operational plan,
but it doesn't specifically mention
the southern
Gaza city of Rafah,
where Israel is being planning
a potential ground offensive.
This comes as talks are expected
to resume in Qatar today
to try to secure the release
of more hostages in
Gaza in exchange for a pause
in the fighting.
Journalist Eliot Cohen joins us.
Let's start
with those hostage talks then,
because you're describing how that does
appear still to be some momentum
behind them.
That does,
we have these
talks in Paris on Friday and Saturday.
And we had Jake Sullivan
of the National Security Council
coming out after saying there's
an understanding on the contours
of a potential deal had been reached.
So now it seems that in Doha,
they're going to be trying to deal
with the thornier
issues to try to deal with those details
and come to some kind of compromise.
Now, up
until these talks, the sticking point,
at least so far as Israel was concerned,
was Hamas
demands that there be a complete
cessation of hostilities
and the release of thousands
of Palestinian
prisoners,
demands that Prime Minister
Netanyahu described as delusional.
So the hope now is that
perhaps they are inching towards
some kind of compromise,
which, as you say,
would lead to the freeing of some,
but probably not
all of those Israeli hostages.
More than just round about 100
believed to still be alive
and being held in captivity
in the Gaza Strip
after being kidnaped on October
the seventh
in exchange
for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners.
And, of course,
the all important humanity
and pause of around about six weeks.
And, of course, at the same time
is that a surge in humanitarian
aid to go where it's desperately needed
in terms of the Palestinian Authority
What's the latest situation there
in terms of leadership?
So we heard just this morning
that the prime
minister, Mohammed Shtayyeh,
submitted his resignation
along with that of his entire government
to Mahmoud
Abbas, the president
of the Palestinian Authority.
Now, he still needs to
offer his resignation in person.
That still needs to be accepted.
But this is seen to be
perhaps one
step towards the
revitalization, the reconstitution
of the Palestinian Authority,
to enable it
to be palatable to the Americans
and perhaps less
unpalatable to the Israelis
for taking control of the Gaza Strip
that they after this war.
Now, he will probably be asked to stay on
as a caretaker
prime minister
And there's no indication
that whoever replaces him
will be any different.
And, of course,
the real change
for the Palestinian Authority least,
it won't be seen as changing
to any serious degree
until such time as Mahmoud
Abbas is no longer president.
He, of course, is in now
the 19th year of a four year term.
He's widely reviled among Palestinians.
He's widely
seen as being corrupt as well.
So I think for the Palestinian Authority
to be seen to be really changing
that,
Mahmoud Abbas
would probably be expected to go as well.
Okay, Eliot, thank you so much.
The death
toll from
this conflict
is also rising outside of Gaza.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health
says more than 400 Palestinians
have now been killed
in the occupied West Bank
and East Jerusalem
since
October 7th, either
by Israeli forces or settlers.
That would include three Palestinians
killed in the Jenin refugee camp
this past week, which the IDF confirmed
as part
of what they described
as a counter terrorism raid.
Our Nic
Robertson met
with the father of slain
Palestinian-American teen Tawfiq Abdul
Jabbar, who was shot in the West Bank
last month.
His father says their family
is still struggling for answers
and trying to bring the person
responsible for his son's
killing to justice.
Yeah, so this dirt road,
you see it down here?
Yeah. This is where we are.
Tawfiq was shot at an American father,
Hafez Abdul Jabbar, showing us his family
land where he says his son was murdered.
By an Israeli settler in January.
He wasn't going to do anything wrong,
simply a barbecue
Friday prayer and come back home.
And he's not a terrorist.
He's a American.
Palestinian kid full of life
wanted to do so much in his life.
His son Tawfiq, was 17 years
old, studying towards his dream job.
Nasser engineer.
The family, left Louisiana last spring,
returning temporarily
to their roots in the occupied West Bank.
They visited their ancestral hilltop
village home most years.
All around the village,
there are murals of Cow Fig
remembered immortalized, and underneath
it says the smiling martyr.
Tough weeks trauma
increasingly common in the West Bank.
And this is getting worse
and worse in the worst since October.
That way, worse.
They're turning it more like into Gaza.
Exactly. They want to turn up to Gaza.
You see the bullet? Yes.
A month after Tawfik
death, Hafez is struggling
to get justice.
The single shot
that killed his son, an exploding bullet
entering the back of his head,
clear in the CT scan of his brain.
Photos of the crime scene
and an investigation
by the Palestinian Authority document.
Ten shots.
Video shows what Hafez says
is a soldier taking the final shot.
An eyewitness says
a settler took the first shot.
Israeli investigators say an off duty
police officer
and an off duty soldier were also present
at the time of 12 week's killing,
but have yet to charge any of them.
They say the investigation is ongoing.
That's the problem that I'm facing
right now that we all face in here.
That when they do such a thing
and they're not stopped
and they're not questioned, it's okay
for them to do it again
and again and again.
And that's what keeps happening here.
This is not the first kid
that got shot and killed in the same area
since October 7th.
Nearly 400
Palestinians have been killed
by Israeli soldiers and Israeli settlers.
There are currently 9000
Palestinians being held in Israeli
prisons and jails.
Sari Bashi is an Israeli
human rights expert
living in the West
Bank, has been tracking
Israeli security force
tactics there for more than a decade.
Hamas says brutal October 7th attacks.
She believes became a watershed
for unprecedented
Israeli violence in the West Bank.
We have seen things piloted
in Gaza
and later moved to the West Bank
in terms of the levels of violence.
The airstrikes, the drone strikes
in Gaza
are starting
to become much
more frequent in the West Bank.
And not just more aggressive
and more frequent,
but more audacious
to not to mention possibly illegal,
according to U.N.
experts
like this, covert Israeli
special forces up in a hospital
that killed three militants
believed to be planning an attack.
The hospital says the men were sleeping
when shot.
IDF diggers gouging out West
Bank streets,
rendering them unusable
akin to Gaza's battle torn thoroughfares.
Also deepens fears
the West Bank is worsening
the impact of Israel's actions
according to respected
Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki,
is enabling groups like Hamas.
The West Bank is becoming more
militant today
than Gaza was before the war or today
because of what the Israeli
government is doing here,
because of what
the Israeli government is doing,
what the army is doing,
and what the settlers are doing.
While we support in such a regime
like that, Hafez is angry.
President Joe
Biden isn't doing more to pressure Israel
to rein in radical settler leaders,
like Security Minister Ma Ben-gvir,
whose party has called
for the annexation of the West Bank.
The Israeli government
maintains
its military operations
only target terror suspects, but
settler violence
has spiraled in recent months.
These officials on TV
from the Israeli governments
making these comments and passing weapons
from being a four year
old to these settlers,
that's why they feel like
they can do anything
without being charged
or without being stopped.
Impunity
that is ripping
irreversibly through his family.
How can they forget their brother?
Can they ever forget their brother?
Can they ever forget
who shot their brother?
No.
Well, I told my wife
I want to have another Tawfik
and I want my older son to get married
and have another two feet
across the square from his family home.
That predates Israel's creation
by more than 70 years.
Is the town's cemetery to fix
where Tawfik is buried?
Feet from two of Hafez's uncles whom
he says were killed by settlers
36 years ago.
That's a message to them,
to the Israeli government.
We're not going nowhere.
Even if you put all of us right here,
generations will come.
And for to this country from you guys.
Defiance. Yes.
But beneath it a father struggling.
When do I see him again?
Want to see my 17 years old
again?
When?
When do I get to see him again?
That's.
That's the minute that I
right now I think about.
I don't think about money.
I don't think about business anymore.
I don't think about anything else
other than
when do I see my son again?

QT5-gNOUhCQ,Fareed's Take: The scope of the Israel-Hamas war is widening,data/en_CNN\Fareed's Take The scope of the Israel-Hamas war is widening.jpg,"Here's my take.
Looking at
the crises
proliferating around the world, it's
clear that we are
in an age
of geopolitical tension
that resembles the Cold War.
A time
of constant,
continual threats to international order.
But this time, the West
is treating each of these threats
as one offs to be dealt
with separately in the hope that soon
normalcy will return.
But conflict is the new normal.
Look around.
The war is going badly for Ukraine,
which is critically outgunned
and outmanned
by its much larger adversary.
Its key advantage
access to Western arms
and money is in peril.
The US Congress
seems unwilling to pass legislation
to send in more arms and money.
The European Union is stepping in
and selling parts of the gap.
But Europe does not have
the military industrial complex
to send Ukraine the level of armaments it
needs to fight Russia.
Ukraine
Zombie has held out
heroically against Russia's onslaught.
But as a senior European
diplomat said to me recently,
Ukrainians are brave and bold,
but they are not supermen.
They will not be able to hold on
if they don't have weapons and supplies.
Putin is making sure
that he can keep the war going.
Getting arms from North Korea
and recruiting men from as far as Cuba.
He continues to benefit from the fact
that many of the world's major economies,
from China
and India to Turkey
and the Gulf states
are trading freely with Russia.
If Russia's aggression works, it turns up
a norm that has largely stood for years.
No change of borders by force.
Meanwhile, in the Middle East,
many believed
when the Gaza war began
that it would be short
and that Prime Minister
Netanyahu's government would fall.
Neither is likely the Israeli Defense
Forces, humiliated
by the surprise attack of October 7th,
are determined
to completely eradicate Hamas from Gaza.
That means months
more bombing, fighting and bulldozing.
The tensions and internal debates
that Israel's actions
will produce in other countries
will only rise
Bibi Netanyahu is going nowhere.
Most Israelis may dislike him,
but they approve of his war policies.
This week,
in a pointed rebuke
to international calls
to pursue
a two-State solution,
including from the US
and Britain,
Israel's Knesset approved
a resolution
declaring that it was opposed
to any unilateral recognition
of a Palestinian state
with 99 out of 120 votes.
Bibi's coalition, remember,
has only 64 members.
So many opposition parliamentarians
joined in.
One less notice
today has been in the north.
Israel has been striking and killing
Hezbollah militants
to the point that by one account
they have killed over 200 of them.
This campaign will continue
and might even accelerate.
The IDF's goal is to weaken
Hezbollah to the point
that the roughly 80,000 Israelis
who fled their homes
in northern Israel can return.
But at some point, Hezbollah
might respond forcefully,
which could trigger
an Israeli incursion into Lebanon,
truly widening the war
And then we have the
Houthies who have managed
to assert themselves
through a series of pinprick strikes
that, according to one consulting firm,
have reduced the number
of container vessels
through the Suez Canal
by about 72%
since they began in December.
American efforts to organize
an effective coalition to keep trade
flowing through the Red Sea have failed.
Its efforts
to respond to Houthi
attacks have not stopped the Houthis.
This failure is a blow to the credibility
of the United States,
guaranteeing the freedom of the seas.
A key component of the open
global economy
that's been built over two centuries.
First to the British Navy
and then the American.
And more threats
to maritime
underpinnings of that order
are on the horizon.
Russia and China
have both been building up the capacity
to cut undersea cables,
which are now an integral part
of the cloud on which data is stored
across the globe.
If the US can't deter a substate actor
like the Houthis
from its disruptive behavior
in the Red Sea,
what chances that have against powers
like China and Russia?
There are ways to address all
these problems,
but it requires a paradigm
shift in the Western world.
We are now in a high security age.
That means governments have to spend
significantly more on defense
and spend more efficiently.
The US took on the role
as guarantor
of the Freedom of the Seas in 1945
and has been master of the seas
ever since.
In the 1980s it had almost 600 ships,
but today it has fewer than 300.
Europe has lost
its military industrial complex
which allowed it
to produce munitions
on a near-constant basis
in these new, dangerous times.
Congressional Republicans have decided
to return to isolationism,
hoping that they can bury
their heads in the sand
and the problems will somehow go away.
It should be noted that
contrary to popular belief,
ostriches do not bury
their heads in the sand
to escape threats.
In fact,
it would lead to their asphyxiation.
Maybe the birds understand something.

that separated Hillary Clinton from Donald
Trump when Donald Trump won Michigan, it was
150,000 votes that separated trump and Biden
when we in the 2020 when Biden won, there
are about 140,000 people who voted in that
election who say that they are muslims.
Now that's obviously not all air Americans
are Muslim.
Not all muslims are Arab American.
But this is a really significant community.
And to leave has been encouraging them to
vote as a book block.
How do you see that playing out?
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that's the point of primaries,
right?
It's, it's, you're moment as she says, to
have a bull horn and say this is the issue
that
[6:07:27 AM]
and say this is the issue that matters to
me.
I'd also like to broaden this out because
this is not necessarily an issue.
What's going on in gaza that is affecting
Arab Americans only generationally young people
but democratic party view this differently.
Michigan has a large student population.
Michigan has, as you said, a large arab-american
and even black Muslim population.
These are all people who find affinity with
what they see as oppression in the region
and one of the reasons why I think this is
an interesting test is having a test the coalition,
meaning you're white blue collar labor guys,
your various affinity groups, your students.
This is a different picture than South Carolina.
Don't you think where it was really more like,
hey, remember those folks who helped us last
time.
Are they coming back?
This is like, oh, well, what is the picture
of the group of voters?
To backup Biden and is this going to happen
&gt;&gt; I mean, is that
&gt;&gt; Too much?
And I think you get a little representative
in Michigan of each slice of his
[6:08:29 AM]
Michigan of each slice of his co yeah
&gt;&gt; They're saying, look, you walk the picket
lines for labor, like the mayor of Dearborn
was upset when they sent campaign people instead
of policy people to talk about that Middle
East, they're saying, take us seriously.
And I think that's maybe how we can think
of it instead of just sort of like which identity
group is complaining today
&gt;&gt; Fair enough.
Let's take a look.
John Stuart actually opened the Daily Show
with a monologue about gaza last night, I
want to watch a little bit that good could
you please be more careful with
&gt;&gt; Your bombing?
Go to but really good in the united States
have told Israel that when we gave him all
the ball bombs like you're coc, dealer coming
in with an eight ball and going don't stay
up all night
&gt;&gt; Jonah Goldberg, we've talked a lot about
where Democrats are on this and Ashley, you
know, weigh in too, but there's a reason why
the president has been worry is this entire
time on this issue, which is that still despite
the pressure from
[6:09:31 AM]
still despite the pressure from Progressives,
a lot of the countries with them on Israel,
yeah that's my problem with the way the media
generally talks about the Michigan issue at
all that is you know, there's nothing wrong
with the squeaky wheel getting attention.
That's how politics, that's up them awkward.
It rks people who organized and protest get
attention at the same time.
It's sort of assumed that if he would just
switch positions to what the sort of the receipt,
it's Williams won that would solve as political
problems and it would not David's right about
Michigan being on the teetering point for
Biden.
If he went whole hog the other way, he probably
lose Pennsylvania.
&gt;&gt; And he might
&gt;&gt; And it's not obvious to me when you look
at the numbers that that switching positions
would gain him more votes than would lose
them even in Michigan.
&gt;&gt; This all
&gt;&gt; Goes to the bit and I think this is part
of Audie's point, is like it's more of a generational
thing that is a real threat to Biden than
the Arab American and are Muslim vote and
Michigan and it just goes effect that his
coalition is much bigger than Donald
[6:10:31 AM]
is much bigger than Donald Trump's.
And therefore, you going to have people on
different sides of issues and the same coalition
fdr had straight up klansman and communists,
Jews, and blacks and his coalition and weird
things happen in making us back to that it
was a big tent party back then.
And so I think that he's just it's not bad
position where he is kind of a no-win political
situation no matter what.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
No the president and administrations and walk-ins
incredibly fine line for months now since
October, in fact.
But I think the announcement that we're close
to a ceasefire is a game changer, especially
going into Michigan tonight and expense especially
going into the state of union.
So I am hearing has from the administration
that they're sort of breathing a sigh of relief
to some degree that there could be some pressure
being led out the bow here and will.
But we'll see to everyone's point tonight
how this plays out.
But I don't think that there's any sort of
hair on fire concern because again, I think
they think that this whole thing will be wrapped
up and we still have eight more months.
[6:11:33 AM]
eight more months.
&gt;&gt; Very interesting, I will say max foster

TwTfedTjXOA,Video shows Palestinians fighting to get hold of ration packs,data/en_CNN\Video shows Palestinians fighting to get hold of ration packs.jpg,"The dwindling supply of
humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Jordan and France
carried out the largest aid drop
airdrop by air
over the besieged territory.
The armed forces say
they made four aerial aid drops on Monday
in collaboration
with the French,
sending relief and food items,
including ready to eat meals
of high nutritional value.
One journalist tells CNN
he saw four planes.
The first
the first airdrop went into the sea
while the remaining three were dropped
in southwestern areas of the territory.
More now from
CNN Jeremy
Diamond reporting in from Tel Aviv
today.
Gaza's humanitarian crisis
looks like this.
Palestinians desperate
for food, paddling
and swimming out to sea
after at least one plane
airdropping aid
appeared to miss its target,
sending pallets of food
crashing into the sea
in central and southern Gaza.
Hundreds crowding the beaches
to try and secure
their piece of the rations
But this is the other side
of desperation.
Groups of men wielding whips and bats,
steering crowds away
from their precious cargo.
Months of hunger and war, triggering
fights for survival
when there is not enough for everyone
This is what they are fighting over.
Ration packs
a lifeline for the lucky few.
In Omaha,
I was lucky and able to get
one of these aids.
But what about all those other people
who were not able to get this aid?
Look, this one didn't
get any in this way. Didn't get any.
But so much more is needed.
I'm asking from the Arab nations.
We are thankful for the aid,
for the parachutes.
But we need more.
And we need it
distributed in a better way.
This will not stop our hunger.
We don't need a capsule
because when we eat this, we will eat it.
And that's it. It's finished.
But nowhere are
people more
desperate for food
aid than in northern Gaza,
where women and children
wait in long lines
for what now passes for food.
A cloudy soup
mixture made with dirty water
and whatever grains can be found.
What am I used to?
There is no food or drinking water.
No flour or anything.
There was no cooking oil.
Not even drinking water.
Oh.
Death is better than this.
Humanitarian aid deliveries
this month dropped by half
compared to January,
according to a United Nations
relief agency
which blamed Israeli
military operations
and the collapse of civil order in Gaza.
In northern Gaza.
Aid groups
suspending aid
delivery amid looting
and attacks on aid trucks,
leaving many
with few options to stay alive.
I think we are aiding animal feed against
our will, but have to aid us
without food or clean water.
Their voices are all they have left.
The savage hit and run
and the suffering of Gaza
is extremely difficult.
Where are the authorities?
Where is the government
is rumored as hungry and a government
made is hungry and people are stealing.
Shame on you, Arabs.
Where are you?
But after nearly five months of war,
is the world listening?
Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.
Yoni Sciretta is the president
and CEO of Save the Children.
She is with us this hour from New York.
Thank you for taking the time
to speak with us. Appreciate it.
Thank you, John.
Okay, so here's what life is like
right now in Gaza.
We'll hear first from a mother
in Gaza City.
Her name is Umm Amir Jamal.
And then we'll hear from Jihad Al Danja
who is in northern Gaza.
Hey there,
If
there is no food to feed my children,
nor there is any bread.
We came to the point
where we are eating cheese.
We are eating the food of this donkey.
All of northern Gaza is starving.
There is no shelter, no drink, no food.
There is nothing
seems to be less than nothing.
According to the UN, $8 in February
a half of what
they were last month,
which was a fraction of what is needed.
So Palestinians,
especially in Gaza, are resilient people.
Kids are used to hardship,
but nothing like this.
And the fear is that now
could get a lot worse
as that Israeli
offensive on Rafah goes ahead.
Describe what worse looks like
Yeah, thanks.
And it's almost inconceivable.
Last month,
I didn't think
worse was actually possible,
but clearly it is.
You remember, there's now 1.4 million
people in Rafah,
which is what is a smallish city
housing 3000 people this fall.
Now there's three times as many.
There are essentially tents
and people
everywhere on every single street road.
There are people sheltering
under the tarp, in a tent, perhaps,
or in a makeshift whatever shelter.
So and there is a sense
that this is the last line in Rafah.
There is nowhere to go.
People can't leave.
People can't go back to the north.
There are still fighting there.
They're probably
allowed to cross the border
to Gaza in the middle.
And as we heard, there is no food.
No, not of anything anywhere in the north
anyway, aside
from a lot of unexploded ordnance.
So it is really, you know, quite
there's no
thinking what would happen
if there would be an incursion
now into Rafah,
where people are completely stuck,
essentially locked up with nowhere to go.
And because people are so close together,
it is inconceivable that you would
go in there with a lot of bombs
and shelling and and violence.
Those children will, you know, will
absolutely be there the brunt of that of
of that violence.
It is such a difficult situation
to even think of the words
to how to describe
what is possible there, because it
so much has already happened.
So, yeah, it is it is unthinkable.
This is from an opinion piece
by for CNN, rather,
by UNICEF CEO Katherine Russell.
At least 90% of Gaza's
children under the age of five
are affected by one
or more infectious diseases.
And that 70% have had diarrhea
in the past two weeks.
At least
17,000 children in Gaza
are now unaccompanied
or have become separated
from their families.
In other words, they are now orphans.
Their parents are dead
Now, this is the view from above.
Khan Yunis,
which is a little bit north of Rafah.
And as you can see, as a shot
slowly moves it
as it gets closer and closer and closer.
If you look at that,
you see
people are just going about their daily
lives, their living life.
And this is what life is now like.
For more than a million
and a half Palestinians,
this is reality that
they cramped into these
tent cities everywhere
and they are living in close quarters.
It's perfect for the spread of disease,
to say the least, in many ways.
Are you surprised that the disease
has not spread faster
and worse than it already has?
To some extent, yes.
I mean,
it's also fair to say
that it's hard to really get
a full picture of all the numbers
the diseases.
You know,
there is no opportunity
to test people necessarily for
for a lot of things.
But yes, and also, don't forget,
there is it's
very hard to get clean water in Gaza.
It was hard to get
the water situation
before the conflict wasn't great.
Since October 7th,
it's been completely dismal.
Water plans,
desalination plants are not working.
Water comes in literally drips and drabs
in bottled water.
And the trucks, if they come in,
which is
and there's not enough
of that happening either.
So no clean water,
I think
what is it, one shower
for every thousand people or so.
So people
There's no way to do proper hygiene.
So, yeah,
it is not surprising
that many, many children
present with diarrhea
and infectious infections
diseases will spread.
So in
terms of manmade disaster,
which this is, it could end tomorrow.
Either Hamas could stop
using the population
in Gaza as human shields
or the Israeli government
could decide to stop killing children.
Is there anything comparable
to what's happening in Gaza right now
and the outsize impact
it's having on children?
You're absolutely right.
And both things need to happen.
It can't happen soon enough.
No, I have never seen anything like this
manmade at this scale.
That has such an impact on children
and civilians writ large.
And neither has the many, many,
many Ontarians
who made this their life's work.
Either.
You don't see the precedent.
Yeah, it's tragic.
It's unprecedented,
and it defies words in so many ways.
Thank you for being with us.",20240227

ARE FOLLOWING SOME BREAKING
NEWS OUT OF GAZA. WE WANTED TO
BRING TO YOU I WITNESSES AND
THE HAMAS-RUN PALESTINIAN
MINISTRY OF HEALTH SAY THAT
MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE WERE
KILLED IN WHAT IS BEING
DESCRIBED AS A CHAOTIC
INCIDENT, AS IDF SOLDIERS
OPENED FIRE AS PEOPLE WERE
TRYING TO GET FOOD FROM AID
TRUCKS. CNN'S JEREMY DIAMOND IS
GATHERING NEW DETAILS. HE'S
BEEN PICKING UP SOME NEW
REPORTING. JEREMY, BRING US UP
TO SPEED HERE
&gt;&gt; WELL FIRST OF ALL, KATE, I
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE
THAT THE AID SITUATION, THE
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN
NORTHERN GAZA, IS JUST SO, SO
DESPERATE AND THAT SEEMS TO BE
PART OF WHAT LED TO THIS SCENE.
HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE SURROUNDING SOME OF
THESE AID TRUCKS THAT WERE ABLE
TO ENTER NORTHERN GAZA. SOME OF
THE VERY FEW AID TRUCKS THAT
HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE
IT IN THERE. AND YOU CAN SEE IN
THIS VIDEO BY THE ISRAELI, FROM
THE ISRAELI MILITARY, THE
CROWDS OF PEOPLE AROUND THESE
TRUCKS. BUT WHAT APPEARS TO
HAVE HAPPENED IS THAT THE
ISRAELI MILITARY OPEN FIRE ON
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE
SURROUNDING THESE TRUCKS AND
ISRAELI MILITARY OFFICIAL
TELLING US THAT THE CROWD
APPROACHED THE FORCES IN A
MANNER THAT POST WAS A THREAT
TO THE TROOPS. AND THEY SAY
THAT THOSE TROOPS THEN
RESPONDED WITH LIVE FIRE. NOW,
EYEWITNESSES ON THE SCENE HAVE
TOLD US THAT ISRAELI TANKS AS
WELL AS DRONES OPENED FIRE ON
THIS CROWD
&gt;&gt; AND THAT
&gt;&gt; FOLLOWING THAT, THERE WAS A
CHAOTIC SCENE. IT'S SOME OF
THE DRIVERS OF THESE AID TRUCKS
APPARENTLY TRIED TO GET AWAY
AMID THIS GUNFIRE AND KILLED
SEVERAL ADDITIONAL PEOPLE, WERE
TOLD THAT 104 PEOPLE WERE
KILLED IN THIS INCIDENT, 760
PEOPLE INJURED ACCORDING TO THE
PALESTINIAN MINISTRY OF HEALTH,
IT'S NOT CLEAR YET HOW MANY OF
THOSE WERE KILLED BY ISRAELI
GUNFIRE VERSUS BUY HE'S TRUCKS
AND THE ENSUING CHAOS BUT ARE
EYEWITNESSES ON THE GROUND
INDICATE THAT IT WAS THE
ISRAELI GUNFIRE THAT PROMPTED
SOME OF THOSE TRUCKS TO FLEE
THE SCENE. AND IN THE PROCESS,
RUN OVER SOME OF THESE
INDIVIDUALS. BUT WE ARE STILL
WORKING TOGETHER ADDITIONAL
DETAILS. THE ISRAELI MILITARY
SAYS FOR ITS PART THAT THE
INCIDENT IS UNDER REVIEW AND
THEY ARE ALSO SAYING IN A
STATEMENT THAT GAZAN RESIDENTS
SURROUNDED THE TRUCKS, LOADED
THE SUPPLIES BEING DELIVERED,
AND THAT DURING THE INCIDENT,
DOZENS OF GAZANS, THEY SAY WERE
INJURED AS A RESULT OF PUSHING
AND TRAMPLING. THIS WAS CLEARLY
MORE THAN JUST PUSHING AND
TRAMPLING. AND WE HAVE
EYEWITNESSES MAKING VERY CLEAR
THAT THE ISRAELI MILITARY DID
INDEED OPEN FIRE HAIR ON THESE
INDIVIDUALS AS WELL. NOW, WE
SHOULD NOTE THAT THIS IS ONLY
HAPPENING BECAUSE OF HOW
DESPERATE THE HUMANITARIAN
SITUATION IS IN NORTHERN GAZA.
VERY FEW AID TRUCKS HAVE
ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT
IN THERE. THE WORLD FOOD
PROGRAM RECENTLY SUSPENDED AID
DELIVERIES TO NORTHERN GAZA,
SAYING THAT IT WAS TOO UNSAFE.
PART OF THAT HAS TO DO DO WITH
A LACK OF COORDINATION WITH THE
ISRAELI MILITARY TO GET THOSE
TRUCKS INTO A WARZONE SAFELY IN
A WAY THAT THEY ARE NOT
TARGETED. AND IT ALSO HAS TO DO
WITH THE FACT THAT THE ISRAELI
MILITARY IN THE PAST HAS
TARGETED POLICE OFFICERS WHO
HAVE BEEN AROUND THOSE AID
CONVOYS. AND SO THERE'S VERY
LITTLE SECURITY FOR THESE. YOU
COMBINE THAT LACK OF SIX
PURITY. YOU COMBINE THAT WITH
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE ON THE
BRINK OF FAMINE IN NORTHERN",20240229

the occupied West Bank.
A flag
flies in the face of a
Palestinian village.
God is king, it says to young settlers.
Guard this illegal outpost.
Construction hasn't even begun.
But we are not welcome.
So they are asking us to leave.
They don't want to talk to us.
They said they've been here
for about nine months.
Dotted across the landscape,
more signs of the fight
to assert
Israeli control over Palestinian land.
The Arabic names on signs
post crudely erased.
Under international law,
the beating Douglas
settlement is illegal.
But last February,
the Israeli government
officially recognized it,
along with eight others, a move the U.S.
strongly opposed.
Come on.
We're here
because God promised us this land,
as real, Bekaa tells us.
Now, these
settlers have set
their sights on a new prize,
one that seemed utterly impossible
before October seven.
Returning to Gaza, they cheer.
That is the goal of Zionist
settler organization Nahla.
One of more than a dozen groups
now advocating
for the reestablishment
of Israeli settlements in Gaza.
A recent promotional video
even boasts
that Gaza will become the next Riviera.
Don't sit on it.
Not live here.
Daniella Weiss is the godmother
of the movement
and she's already started recruiting
from the 700,000 strong
settler community of Israel.
We're just arriving now at a settlement
in the occupied West Bank,
and we're heading to a talk
that Daniella
Weiss is giving to a group of people
who are potentially interested
in resettling Gaza.
And I know that it is.
We are for the land
of Israel and Ben-Gvir, she says.
About 20 people gather in the living room
of a family. Farm on Miriam.
Way snows that
for many in this community,
there is deep nostalgia for Gush Katif.
A block of 21 Israeli settlements
that were forcibly evacuated
by the IDF in 2005
when Israel left the Gaza Strip.
Then this is the vision of Gaza,
she says.
You see all the nucleus groups in Sheba.
A map has already been drawn up,
with six
groups laying claim
to different parts of the enclaves.
So they've just been handing out
these little booklets
that say people of Israel return home.
And then underneath.
A call to return
to the settlements of Gaza, to Florida.
One of the organizers tells the group
they have a representative
flying to Florida to raise money.
Nicola gets support
from a number of groups in the U.S.,
including AFC
Americans for a Safe Israel,
which cosponsored a recent webinar
on the return to Gush Katif.
Even as the Biden administration
has cracked down on settlements
in the West Bank, there is.
A very strong support
from very prominent from very, yeah,
I would say wealthy people.
Wealthy Jews in the US.
In the US.
Can you name any names?
No, I cannot. No.
Back at her
home in Cardamom settlement,
Weiss tells us she's already enrolled.
500 families.
I even
have on my on my cell phone
names of people who say to enlist
me, enroll me. I want to join.
I want to join the groups
that are going to settle Gaza.
I have to ask you, though,
because we're sitting here talking
and we're listening. I'm listening.
I hope you are listening to it.
Is a reminder,
I think, of
the people who live here,
but also the people who live in Gaza.
What happens to them
in this vision
of this new settlement with
Jewish settlers, even in Gaza City?
What I think about Gaza,
the Arabs of Gaza lost the right
to be in Gaza on the 7th of October.
Yes, I do hear the mosque.
I do hear the the the that the the prayer
things where different
until the 7th of October.
No Arabic
speaking about more than 2 million Arabs.
They will not stay there.
We Jews will be in Gaza.
That sounds like ethnic cleansing.
The Arabs want to annihilate the state
of Israel.
So you can call them monsters.
You can you can call their
call them cleansing of Jews.
We are not doing to them.
They are doing to us.
I couldn't
make it clearer when I said that myself
as a person
who is preoccupied
with settling the land
until the 7th of October.
I didn't have plans of returning to Gaza.
It's clear
I'm not interested in cleansing.
What is clear is that Weiss
has views traditionally
seen as extreme in Israel
have become more popular
since October 7th.
In late January, jubilant crowds
packed an auditorium
in Jerusalem for the victory
of Israel conference,
calling for the resettlement of Gaza.
A poll that month from the Jewish People
Policy Institute
found that
26% of Israeli eyes
advocate the reconstruction
of the Gush Katif settlements
after the war is over.
Among supporters of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's right
wing coalition
government, that number jumps to 51%.
Several ministers were present
at the conference,
including far right
Heritage minister and the High Eliyahu
in a rare interview with Western media.
He tells us
his political decisions
are guided by the Torah.
But is there.
Anything about Gush Katif in here?
Yes. Yes.
The because the Muslim.
And the settlements
in Gaza
are needed to prevent
another October seven.
A look at the language of the land
says that
wherever there is a Jewish settlements,
there will be more security.
Doesn't mean
there will be absolute security,
but there will be more security.
Why would you advocate for
something that many would say is illegal,
is immoral,
is not supported
by the majority of Israelis,
and is also very harmful to Israel
in terms of its international standing?
Lamont enclosed incredulously.
Why do you think it's immoral
to take land
from someone who wants to kill me?
Why is it immoral to take my land
which my ancestors live there,
which I've even given up
to someone
who slaughters, rapes and murders me?
What is more and more than that?
Netanyahu has
called resettling Gaza, quote,
an unrealistic goal.
And most Israelis.
But that hasn't stopped scores
and IDF soldiers
fighting there from posting videos
calling for a return to Gush Katif
perspective.
For many supporters
of the settler movement,
what was once
a distant fantasy is now a fervent dream.

official has
publicly quit their government
job over the Biden administration's
handling of the Israel-Hamas war
until yesterday.
Doctor
and now she line was a foreign affairs
officer at the State Department,
working in an office that promotes
human rights in the Middle East. Dr.
Shi Line details
the reasoning behind
her public resignation
in a CNN Opinion article,
and she joins us now.
Thanks so much for joining us.
Thank you for having me.
You write
regarding the forced
displacement of Gaza civilians,
the lack of aid, violence
by Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
You say, quote, These actions which
which experts on genocide
have testified meet
the crime of genocide,
are conducted
with the diplomatic and military
support of the US government.
And that's the basis of your resignation.
As you know,
genocide is a very specific
definition here.
How do you feel
Israel's behavior there
meets that definition?
I mean, I would
leave that to the experts.
As you said,
it is a very specific definition.
But I, I would argue that in general,
the actions that Israeli
military is taking
are are seeking
to wipe out the population of Gaza.
We've also heard
such statements
made by Israeli
officials, political officials
and military officials.
The
UN, unfortunately,
we're also hearing plans
being made now for people
to take over the territory
of the Gaza Strip.
We had Jared Kushner
come on and talk about
how he's going to build highrises
on this beautiful
beachfront properly property.
You know, as you said,
the crime of genocide
does not need to meet
a particular legal definition.
But
I would I would posit that there are
there are many experts
who are who are arguing that
that is what Israel is doing.
Well, intent is key,
of course,
because here let's be clear,
Hamas is a terrorist organization.
It deliberately killed civilians,
as it did
on October 7th,
and it deliberately hides behind
civilians in Gaza.
I understand
the argument
that there has been
insufficient attention
to protect civilian lives there. But.
But I wonder,
who do you hold responsible?
Who do you hold responsible for it?
Is it Israel alone?
Is it Israel and the US for its support?
But is Hamas?
Does Hamas
also bear responsibility
for the civilian losses?
Absolutely.
I mean, Hamas
is a terrorist organization.
I just think that the way Israel
and as well as the United States
have been involved
in conducting this war,
it could have been done
in a very different manner.
The the levels of the casualties
that we're seeing, the use of starvation
as a weapon of war,
the fact that the United States
isn't using its leverage
to insist that aid get in
and that a cease fire
be put in place, in particular,
we're seeing from the Israeli public
their frustration with the fact
that their own hostages
are not actually being prioritized.
Instead, we have the prime minister,
whose political future
depends on this war
going on for as long as possible.
He's he's talked about
going after Lebanon as well.
I know that the US government
is trying to do everything they can
to prevent that,
but thus far
I shouldn't say everything
they can there.
They're not doing everything
they can to prevent that.
I would argue
they need to use all the leverage
to make sure Israel
neither expands the war and
and agrees to a ceasefire,
an exchange of hostages from both sides
and to to bring in the necessary aid.
You told my colleague
Christiane Amanpour today
that you speak for,
quote, many people
when standing against the US government's
Gaza policy.
I wonder when you when you left,
when you made your resignation public,
when you wrote this opinion
piece for CNN,
did many people
that many of your colleagues
come to you and say, we're backing you?
They have.
I was not planning initially
to to go public.
I was only at the State
Department a brief time.
But when I started to tell people
that I was planning to resign
quietly, they said,
you know, please
reconsider, please,
please go public if you'd be willing to.
So I decided I would.
And since then,
I have had people reach out to me.
I think my my greatest concern
is that by going public,
I might somehow undermine
some of these efforts.
And the State Department
is doing very important work here.
But I do think that public pressure is
why we're starting
to see the administration shifting here.
And it is the administration
that is making these decisions.
It's the president
who is deciding
what our policy towards Israel and
regarding Gaza is going to be.
So even though
there are many people inside state
who disagree with this, it's
going to take the president
changing his mind
before we see a new policy.
Let me ask you this,
because as you as you say,
there has been both private
and public pressure
increasing from President Biden
and the White House
in recent days
and weeks on Israel, for instance,
not to go into Rafah in Gaza.
That's insufficient, in your view.
What would be sufficient, in your view,
from the U.S. side?
I think the U.S.
needs to uphold our own laws.
We have the Leahy laws
that would that stipulate that U.S.
foreign military assistance
cannot go to units of a foreign military
that that are engaged
in gross human rights violations.
Also a foreign government
that is preventing US humanitarian aid
is no longer eligible for for U.S.
military assistance.
We're not upholding those laws.
So I think we could start there,
just start upholding our own laws.
I think this is particularly crucial
not only for the people of Gaza,
but this administration
has tried to distinguish itself
from the previous administration
as one that not only
believes in the rule of law,
but that believes in America's
role in the world
and wanted to reestablish America
as a leader,
not only in terms of, you know,
I know you've done
work on great power competition,
but if America is
is not going to distinguish itself
from some of our adversaries
that engage in these sorts of human
rights violations,
why should the rest of the world
look to us as a leader?
You said the loss of soft power,
Doctor and she line.
Thanks so much for sharing
your point of view.
I appreciate having you on.",20240329
YRKIfnQnWto,See protests in Jerusalem calling for Netanyahu to resign,data/en_CNN\See protests in Jerusalem calling for Netanyahu to resign.jpg,"Well as Netanyahu was speaking on Sunday.
Thousands were again
taking to the streets of Jerusalem
and other Israeli cities
calling for his resignation
and the release of all hostages in Gaza.
Now, the protests are still ongoing.
The Israeli
prime minister met
with the family
of one of the hostages on Sunday.
The father of 19 year old Naama Levi
told Israel's Army radio that they
left the meeting, quote, disturbed
and with no good news.
Nadav Salsburg from the Change
Generation Movement
is leading the Tel Aviv protests.
And he told the UK's Telegraph newspaper
on Sunday
that the protests over the weekend
were, quote, an eruption of underground
currents
that have reached the boiling point.
And he joins us now live from Jerusalem.
Great to see you, Nadav.
Thank you so much
for taking the time today.
Look, over the weekend, we saw
an eruption of anti-government
protests across many parts of Israel.
But your specific movement
is calling for something very specific.
I want you to take me through
what you and your members want.
Thank you.
So, first of all,
I want to start
by mentioning the 134 hostages still held
captive in Gaza,
including women, elderly and children.
We are fighting and praying
for their immediate release.
We are a movement
called the Change during the Nation
after October 7th.
We realized
that Netanyahu and his coalition
have no intent of taking responsibility
over the worst disaster
in Israel's history.
So we have taken to the streets
and we formed
a young movement
comprised of young Israelis,
reservists and students
with the goal
of replacing the current government
with a responsible government.
One deserving of the Israeli people.
That is our goal.
So you're calling for elections
and a change in government, essentially?
Yes,
Yeah.
We're calling for
over and above, of course, importantly
and the release of hostages,
which is important.
But you've also said
something interesting
and just reading up
about what your movement is about that,
that Netanyahu hasn't
prioritized hostages.
So what do you think he has
prioritized instead?
I think that Netanyahu has prioritized
the survival,
his own
political survival
and the survival of his coalition.
I think that while many people, including
politicians, are doing their best
to try and bring back the hostages,
it simply isn't enough.
I think that we,
as the young generation who grew up
under Netanyahu,
have witnessed rotten leadership.
And it's time for us to step up
and demand better leadership
for all Israelis.
So Netanyahu has rejected calls
for elections, saying
that it's
going to dismantle the talks
that are currently underway,
specifically for hostage release.
We also know that Hamas has said that
all hostages will be released
if there's a sustained cease fire.
So so what are your views
on the current negotiations
and importantly on a cease fire?
We believe that the
war against Hamas is a just war.
We believe that
Hamas is a threat
not only to Israelis,
but also to Palestinians.
And that Israel must triumph over Hamas.
That is why we are not calling
for a cease fire.
We believe that the war needs to be
fought until the end, but we also believe
that we should prioritize
bringing back the hostages,
even if it means pausing.
The same way.
We paused
a couple of months ago
to bring back hostages.
And we also believe
that the clearing schedule for elections
a couple of months from now
will not hurt or damage neither
the war efforts or the efforts
to bring back the hostages,
but rather allow the current government
to act without being dependent
on the politics or its own survival.
Yeah,
I mean, and of course,
families of hostages.
We've heard just harrowing stories of,
you know,
the uncertainty that they're experiencing
I want to turn now
to the UN Security Council resolution
that within
it had said
that famine is setting in in Gaza
right now.
You know,
from what we've been seeing
and Netanyahu's policies essentially
of not
allowing enough
aid into
Gaza has gotten a lot of criticism
from aid organizations.
They're describing dire realities
From your perspective,
how are you viewing this?
And does this worry
you and your members importantly?
Again, I think we are worried
for our future in Israel,
for the future of the region.
I think that what we have seen yesterday
in Jerusalem
are hundreds of thousands of patriots
going to the streets
and demanding a better future.
I think we are done
waiting for politicians
to make things better.
I think that we need to make them better
and that we, the young people in Israel,
are the generation
that will bring change to the region
and to Israel. And
and I think that where
I don't think I know
that we plan on continuing our approach
All right.
Nadav Sulzberger, great to have you on.
Thank you for taking the time.
CNN is also learning that senior US
and Israeli
officials will meet virtually
today
to discuss Israel's proposed ground
offensive in Rafah.
A US official says the two
sides are still
working towards an in-person
meeting on the issue.
Face to face
talks were abruptly called off last week
by the Israeli prime minister
after Washington
refused to block
a UN resolution
calling for a cease fire in Gaza.
Benjamin Netanyahu says US
pressure will not stop
an Israeli ground operation in Rafah.
And I hope he can.
We will go into Rafah
and eliminate Hamas battalions
there for one simple reason.
There is no victory
without entering Rafah
and there is no victory
without eliminating Hamas battalions.
There
will talks back on then.
I want to head to Washington now
and bring in CNN's Natasha Bertrand.
Natasha, I want to get into
what the US has repeatedly said
and it's warned Israel
about a siege into Rafah
in this virtual meeting aimed
at this on Yahoo!
Do you think
he's going to be able
to convince the US
that they have a workable plan?
Can the US
be convinced of a Rafah operation
Well, the answer is that
it really depends
because as of right now
the US is extremely skeptical
and they have been urging Israeli
officials, including in talks
with the Israeli defense
minister last week,
to come up with an alternative plan, one
that is not
what the Israelis have been planning,
such as a Large-Scale
Ground operation into Rafah
that could endanger the over
1 million Palestinians
that have sought shelter there
over the last few months.
And what the Israelis are saying
is that, look,
we need a way
to eliminate these
remaining Hamas battalions
and the US is responding well.
You could go after them
with a more targeted approach,
something that
targets more senior figures in Hamas
rather than going in
and doing an all out assault.
And so I think what the US is
still waiting to see from
the Israelis is
a concrete plan to move those civilians
out of the area.
And that is something
that Israel has not been able
to provide them with yet.
And until they do,
until they provide
some kind of blueprint
for how they're going
to get those people out of that area,
perhaps allowing them to move back north,
then the US is really not
going to be on board with this.
Now among the proposals
the US has given to
the Israelis
is to ramp up talks with the Egyptians
to try to seal that border
so that Israel can conduct
these more precision
operations, targeting
these senior Hamas leaders
without the possibility
that they are just going to then escape,
of course, across the border into Egypt.
Of course,
another aspect of this is,
is that really targeted
operation that the US says
that the Israelis should try
and that's something
that they have been pushing them
to do for months and months.
Instead of doing
these large scale operations
that really do endanger
the civilians, there
But the Israelis are going to do
what they're going to do.
And that is the message that we got
last week in talks with Israeli
officials, is that they are going to do
what they believe is best for
eliminating the remaining
Hamas battalions in that area.
Now, whether there are any consequences
for the Israelis ignoring
the Americans
advice, that remains to be seen
because we have seen that
the US has continued to provide them
with weapons,
with intelligence
to help them prosecute
this war against Hamas.
And so the question now
is, are there any red lines here?
If the Israelis do move forward
with this operation in Rafah,
how is the US going to respond,
especially if it's in a way that the U.S.
has explicit advised against?
Well, Ivan, it's great to have you on.
Thank you.",20240401
UX-_To2fh50,Iran accuses Israel of killing top commander in airstrike,data/en_CNN\Iran accuses Israel of killing top commander in airstrike.jpg,"We are tracking
breaking news out of the Middle East.
An attack on Iran's consulate
building in Syria.
Iran's ambassador was not hurt,
but he told reporters in Damascus at least
five people were killed and blamed
Israeli warplanes for the strike.
Now, CNN cannot independently verify
those claims.
Our Nic Robertson, though, is here
and is following
all the breaking news story on this.
And Nic, this is a significant target.
What more
are you learning about this attack?
Well, the ambassador says
he was an eyewitness to it
because the embassy is right
next to the consular building,
the consulate building destroyed.
He says at least five people were killed.
One of them, according to Iranian state
media, was Brigadier General Mohammad
Reza Zaidi, who is a very, very senior
IRGC top military commander.
Has commanded the IRGC Army ground forces
before, the air forces before.
And it is believed at this time
that he is the most senior IRGC
figure to be killed since the Quds Force
commander, Kassam Suleimani, was killed
by the United States in a drone
strike early.
20. 20.
Take that with the fact that this was
a diplomatic building that was hit.
That hasn't happened before.
Now, the ambassador, Syrian media,
Iranian media are blaming Israel
typically in these situations
because there have been situations like
this before where Israel has been blamed
and has actually accepted responsibility
for some strikes against Iranian targets.
Inside of Syria.
Typically,
the Israeli government at the moment
is saying that we don't comment on
what foreign media is saying.
The Iranians and the Syrian media.
So this is a sort of a a statement
that we can expect Israel to give.
But the indications are this would be
a target of high value to Israel.
And the ambassador said that it was,
as you mentioned,
Israeli fighter jet, F-35,
that fired in six missiles.
I mean, broaden this out then.
If it is Israel and we we don't know
at this stage if it is Israel.
The implications here for a region
that already
is, you know, on the edge,
what will this mean?
How will Iran, you know,
how will Iran react to this,
to set the scene
from Israel side for a moment,
they've been talking
about the northern northern border,
their northern border,
the southern border of Lebanon.
As being a place
that needs a diplomatic solution.
And there are tensions with Hezbollah.
That's a proxy of Iran.
And they've been saying that window
opportunity has been closing
and they've been saying that the window of
opportunity is going to be closing soon.
And the discussion
has been about mid-April.
So Israel at the moment
is really on the front foot in terms of
wanting to have power strikes
against Hezbollah
if they are responsible for this strike
on such a significant Iranian target.
And the ambassador said that
that would be a decisive response.
The Iranian foreign ministry spokesman,
according to Iranian
media, is saying that they have a right
to take a response.
The Iranian foreign minister is saying
the international community
should do something.
This potentially stokes up the tensions
between Iran and Israel.
And in that context,
Israel would anticipate that
that response
could very likely come from Hezbollah.
And if it did, then that would give Israel
a rationale to strike Hezbollah harder.
And this is what the United States fears.
This is what European Union officials
fear.
This is why Secretary of State
Antony Blinken is meeting tomorrow
with with the French president in Paris.
And they will discuss this issue of
of Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Iran.
It's in
this context, the tensions on it
very, very high right now.
Yeah, the risk of escalation here
clearly, clearly very high.
And this is something like you
said, that Secretary Blinken
has been going to the region.
They're going to accept No. Five, six.
I can't remember
trying to keep a lid on this.
So we're looking I mean, what is the US
saying at this juncture?
That I haven't heard
what they've said so far?
And it's not clear
if Israel was to take
responsibility for it,
then I think we could expect to hear
something publicly from
from the United States.
If you go back to just after Christmas,
there was a senior IRGC figure,
not anywhere near as senior as this one,
an adviser to two Syrian forces
who was killed by a strike
around Damascus just just after Christmas.
Again, Israel at that time
said they weren't responsible.
But later on, Israeli officials
admitted that they were responsible
for that strike.
The United States is trying its best
to de-escalate those tensions.
It wants the cease fire.
And in Gaza,
meanwhile, Israel has got 100,000 people
who can't go home
along the northern border
because it's too dangerous
because of the escalation in tensions.
And there is some in the military
and political establishment
in Israel
who believe that this is a necessary time
to to take out to take out
Hezbollah's military capability.
So it's it's it's coming.
Is this a spark to set off the tinderbox
Everything we've seen so far,
Israel has calculated
and I was just looking at an interview
I did with a former head of Israeli
military intelligence a few months ago.
And he said so far everything
Israel has done has been within a red line
not to cause Iran to escalate
because Iran knows it has a lot at stake
at the moment.
Is this another calculation by Israel
taking it right?
So the one we don't know.
And what is Iran's response
How big response?
When Kassam Suleimani was dead.
Let's start with a conversation
about the breaking news.
We led the hour with the apparent strike
on the Iranian consulate
building in Damascus, Syria.
The Iranian ambassador
pointing the finger at Israel.
Israel says it doesn't comment
on foreign media reports.
What do you make of the attack
and the likelihood
that this was potentially the IDF?
Well, it seems that's
the highest likelihood that it was
the IDF.
Not a certainty.
It's a fascinating
and in some ways a risky move
You're going to now bet
about how the Iranians will respond.
The Israelis,
until now, have taken the position
that they will go after Iranian commanders
or anyone else who they believe
were masterminds
behind the attacks on Israelis
from Lebanon and all that.
But the problem is here that they are
still deeply engaged in Gaza.
And the whole effort has been to keep
this war from spreading to the north.
And this may well give the Iranians
an excuse to do that.
Until now, as you've heard from Natasha
Bertrand.
We've seen something of a calming down
and this could undo all of that
and inflame the situation pretty quickly.
David, put that into context for us
in the prism of where Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is right now,
because he is at a point of vulnerability
as we've watched these protests
escalate over recent days
and especially into the weekend, as we saw
with Melissa Bell, with tents being set up
outside the Israeli parliament.
What is the significance
of the timing here?
Well,
there are two possibilities
that come immediately to mind.
One is that the timing was merely
a military
moment of opportunity.
Where they knew
where these commanders were
and they had an open shot at them
and and one where
they thought they might be able
to minimize civilian casualties, although
right now we don't know what
those casualties may have been.
The other is that Prime Minister Netanyahu
sees the risk of an expanded war
as politically beneficial potentially
to him, that, you know, his entire reason
for staying in office
has been to defend Israel
in the wake of the October seven attacks.
And, of course,
the American concern is that
he has done this in the hardest
possible way,
in a way that has cost
at least 30,000 lives so far.
And those protests that you saw Mark,
sort of the end of that period of grace
that Netanyahu had, where the Israelis
sort of took the view that
even if he was not their preferred leader,
he was their wartime leader.
And you're now seeing that fracture.
He may see some benefit
in the war revving up.",20240401
fhzEDGmWJV4,Israeli teen opens up about choosing jail over military service,data/en_CNN\Israeli teen opens up about choosing jail over military service.jpg,"Across Israel, protesters are
growing louder.
Those frustrated by the war
are now grappling
with how to make their voices heard.
CNN's Melissa Bell has more
in Israel, too.
There are those who objected
to their government's handling of the war
in Gaza
Among them, Ben Arad, who has an 18 year
old, is due to enlist this week
for his mandatory
military service in Iceland.
Instead, he tells the crowd
he's choosing to go to jail
We caught up with him
in Tel Aviv
on his very last day of freedom.
I don't refuse because I'm afraid of
being hurt or or killed
in military accidents
have a very, very deep
disgust of the things that I'm seeing
happening things,
he says, that
Israeli media doesn't dwell on
or that he seeks out
on international networks and online.
I think something that
really broke my heart
was the flower massacre.
So seeing people
trample each other to to uh, to get food.
I mean, you just can't deny at that point
that there is a famine going on
and people are hungry.
So on Monday, Ben will hand himself
in becoming one of only
a handful of so-called refuseniks
to make their decisions public.
Since the war began,
In a country
where military service marks
the start of every Israeli's
grown up life.
Aside from those exempt
on religious grounds,
the war has made avoiding it
a political act.
I've been called a traitor.
Uh,
I've been told that I need to be deported
or I've been asked why I don't just move.
Uh, I mean, it's, uh,
not not such terrible stuff.
I haven't gotten that yet.
Like, I'll get that when I go to jail.
Yet Ben
says he's
determined to give up his freedom
in order to remain free of a war
that he simply doesn't believe in.
Now, it's difficult to overstate
what a remarkable decision
it is for an Israeli 18 year
old to decide not to serve,
given the place that military service has
in this country,
but especially at this time.
I think listening to the testimony
that you were just hearing there
beyond and voice
that you just heard from that Dr.
remember that international networks
like CNN can't get into Gaza,
but do what
they can
to try and show what's happening
to Palestinian civilians,
that he's had to seek out
that information to make his decision,
I think is interesting in itself.
One media analyst pointing out
that here in Israel,
the drums of war
have been beating so loudly
that it's been hard
for the Israeli public to get access
to its own media,
to much of what's happening
to Palestinian civilians.
So remarkable story at a remarkable time.
And bear in mind, that we are now
in the third day of four days of protest
against this war here in Jerusalem
and beyond.
There are really fascinating perspective
from that young man.
Melissa Bell live for us in Jerusalem.
Thank you so much.
All right.
In terms of what else is happening
on the ground in Gaza, what was once
the enclave's largest
hospital, really a place of hope
and healing is now permanent.
Leave out of service.
That's
according to the acting director
of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex.
The hospital has turned
into a makeshift
graveyard one day
after Israeli troops ended their two week
siege there.
The World Health
Organization says Al-Shifa is in ruins
and can no longer be able to function
in any way as a hospital.
Now, these before and after images
show the extent of the destruction.
A spokesperson
says that the loss of the hospital
will have devastating consequences
for the people of Gaza.
We've had contact with the staff.
The directors told us that
Al-Shifa hospital is gone.
Destroying Al-Shifa means ripping
the heart out of the health system.
It was the tertiary care center.
It was a huge hospital.
750 beds, 25 operating
theaters, 30 intensive care rooms.
You know, it was the
the place people
go to
for the kind of care
that a really good health system provides
that we in all our societies
expect to have.
Should we be in need?
Now, Israel has described
the 14 day raid
as an anti-terror mission
and a government
spokesperson is referring
to the operation
as the gold standard of urban warfare.
I believe that the terrorist
takeover of Shifa
and the subsequent
Special Forces operation
to clear the hospital of terrorists
will be studied
by future
generations of military strategists.
At West Points and Sandhurst
as the gold standard for urban warfare
But our
next guest says
the indiscriminate
bombing of Gaza
has killed more children,
more women, doctors, aid workers
and journalists
than any other war in our time
as secretary general
of the Norwegian Refugee Council.
He joins us live now from Oslo, Norway.
And I want to start obviously
by talking
about what happened with the World
Central Kitchen Aid workers,
seven of them,
seven of them rather tragically killed.
Clearly, it is part of the calculation
right of aid organizations
when you are entering into a war zone,
that there is some degree of risk.
But there are also certain things
that these organizations often
do to mitigate the risks
they coordinated with the IDF.
The IDF knew their coordinates.
They were in a vehicle
that was clearly marked
with World Central Kitchen's logo
a lot of people are asking themselves,
how on earth
could this have happened?
I mean, I'm not really sure what else
they could have done
to really mitigate the risks.
I did want to start
by getting your reaction
to what happened.
I think our colleagues in World
Central Kitchen
did everything that they could
to be safe in the war zone, something
so different than the women
and the innocent with food
and the Israelis
that deliberately targeted
these three vehicles. We do not know.
We do not believe that they wanted
to attack one central kitchen
with whom they had worked a lot
in previous operations
to reach people in Gaza.
But they deliberately
and repeatedly targeted
these three vehicles So it's very clear
that they are
again and again and again targeting
without knowing who inside and there.
Therefore, it's the worst casualty
of any
any war in recent memory.
In terms of women,
children, the innocent,
the aid workers, the
doctors, the nurses, the teachers,
any any group
that had protection
under international law.
And it's not the gold standard of
of of good where warfare
this is a race to the bottom.
And it's happening with American,
German and other Western
And in response to this tragic strike,
the Israeli defense minister said
that Israel
would open
a joint situation room
with international groups
to enable coordination
of aid distribution
in Gaza with the military.
Now, aside from a ceasefire, which,
of course, would require both sides
to agree
and for Hamas to also release hostages.
Do you think this is the right next step
in terms of rebuilding
trust and getting more aid,
much more needed aid into Gaza,
given the dire situation now
and you have the World Central Kitchen
understandably saying
they're going to suspend their work
there following this tragedy.
They will.
And other
groups, including my own,
have said
we will not send convoys north
at this time because they are so often
targeted by the Israeli war machine.
And if if they now will have
a deconfliction system
and notification system
with international staff embedded
in the Israeli
military command,
it would be this a step in the right
direction.
I've been an aid worker
in many war zones, and we had a system
in Afghanistan with the US military
in the air
when the US was there
in the Afghan military high command.
And that worked
pretty well We had even in the 2006 war
in Lebanon
between Israel and Hezbollah,
we had UN staff in the Israeli
high command.
We haven't had that in the Gaza War.
And partly
therefore, I think
there hasn't been a deconfliction system,
a notification system
that has perfected a yes.
However, we need
really more than anything as a cease fire
so that this senseless blood
should be stopped, stopped.
And the second thing we need
is all of the border crossings,
including those in the north,
that these red has shot down
so that we cannot reach civilians
in a safe way.
We need those border crossings to.",20240402
X-t8H8bu6zw,Biden and Netanyahu to speak for the first time since 7 aid workers killed in Gaza,data/en_CNN\Biden and Netanyahu to speak for the first time since 7 aid workers killed in Gaza.jpg,"Today, a phone call that
could alter the course of a war.
The planned phone call
between President
Biden and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
This will be the first call
between the two leaders
since that tragic incident
where seven aid workers were killed
in an Israeli strike in Gaza this week.
Top White House
officials are telling CNN
that Biden is both angry and outraged
about it.
This morning,
the founder of World Central Kitchen,
the aid workers work for chef Jose Andres
is accusing Israel of systematically
his word, targeting
the aid convoy car by car.
And he is calling
for an independent investigation into it.
This was not just
but like the situation where, oops,
we dropped the bomb in the wrong place or
or No,
but I know
is that we were targeted deliberately,
nonstop until everybody was
dead in this convoy.
CNN's Arlette
Sines is at the White House
with more for us and Arlette.
Democratic Senator
Chris Coons is very close to Joe Biden.
He was just on speaking to Sara
and he said this phone call he expects
is going to be very important
in the next step
in the US Israel relationship.
Yeah, Kate.
And President Biden
is expected
to convey his personal anger
and frustration directly to Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
as they speak in the coming hours.
The the Israeli strike that killed
these seven aid workers
with World Central Kitchen
really marks the latest flashpoint
in an increasingly tense
relationship between Biden and Netanyahu.
And many are questioning
whether this moment could serve
as a turning point in U.S.
support for Israel
as it conducts his campaign
to root out Hamas in Gaza.
Now, the president
has expressed his outrage
about the incident.
Frustration has been rising here
at the White House.
The president is expected
to focus on the death
of those aid workers,
while also broadening
out the conversation,
trying to discuss ways
to ensure that there are protections
for humanitarian aid workers.
We have sources have told us that U.S.
officials have already started
talking to the Israelis
about the need to change
the way that information is transmitted
when it comes to the locations
of aid workers.
We also anticipate the president
to talk about the ongoing
hostage and humanitarian
aid negotiations
to try to get a temporary cease fire,
as well as that operation
that Israel is expected to wage in Rafah.
Now, ahead of this call,
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin
spoke with his Israeli counterpart,
Yoav Gallant,
where a Pentagon spokesperson said
that he conveyed his outrage
while also saying that this incident
reinforces U.S.
concerns about needing
to protect civilians
in any type of operation
that Israel conducts in Rafah.
But even as we have seen
this heightened
rhetoric from the administration
expressing anger and outrage,
well, we have not seen yet
is any shift in policy
when it comes to the U.S.
approach to Israel,
especially when it comes to the U.S.
continuing to provide military support
to Israel without any conditions.
Officials here at the White House
said that they are not at that point
where there is a shift in policy,
though
a senior administration
official says that there has been a shift
in the frustrations from the president.
Now, this all comes as President
Biden is also facing
significant pressure
here at home
when it comes to his handling
of this conflict.
He heard that directly from Muslim
community leaders
here at the White House on Tuesday.
But many are questioning
whether this exact moment
could serve as any turning point
in the administration's strategy.
As of now,
it doesn't seem that they're changing
any pathway forward
in the imminent future.
Or plans at the White House.
Thank you so much, our lot, Sara.
All right. Thank you, Kate.
CNN chief
International anchor
Christiane Amanpour is joining us now.
Christiane,
we just heard from Senator Coons,
who says there is a line
and there should be conditions
and the president of the United States
has been very frustrated,
we know, with Netanyahu and Israel's
approach in Gaza at this point.
The pressure is really mounting
on Israel from other close allies.
What are you hearing?
Well, precisely that.
And really in the United States,
you'd have to go back
as far as the first George W. George H.W.
Bush administration
when they expressed
public frustration
and anger over different issues,
the increasing building of settlements.
And James Baker held out a phone number
for the State Department to say,
when you're serious, give us a call.
You have the number.
But what does this actually change,
this mounting pressure,
As you heard from all that,
it's unlikely
to change
any shift towards
sending military aid to Israel.
But that is precisely
what governments around the world,
Israel's allies,
are being asked to do,
including here in the U.K.
Defense minister, former
prime minister and Foreign Minister
David Cameron has said
that he has demanded
to his Israeli counterpart
an immediate investigation
into this
appalling attack on aid workers.
And he said, we want to see that happen
very, very soon.
The problem here
is that all the allies say
that Israel has a right to defend itself
after what happened on October seven,
but that it must act within the rules
of the international road
that are international laws
that include
not firing on civilian convoys.
And let's not forget
this one, like the others,
were heavily coordinated with Israel.
This is what the U.N.
humanitarian chief
told me about the World Central Kitchen
assassinations or attacks on Monday.
Yes, it's
a duty of care problem,
but it's also a legal problem.
A attacks on humanitarian institutions
and workers
is prohibited under international law.
So whether
it's intentional or not, it's a crime.
And we must be very conscious of this
as I say.
It's been happening,
as you know, Christiane,
to our colleagues from the outset.
And as you know, hundreds,
nearly 200 U.N.
and other aid workers
have been killed, the vast
majority of them Palestinians.
Sara.
You know,
it strikes me in your conversation
that he said
whether it's intentional or not,
it is still a crime.
What is the impression
that Netanyahu and his administration
is giving to those who are calling for
for better treatment of civilians?
What are you hearing?
Well, look, it's really, really difficult
to understand this.
Even former
President Trump has told
and you can see it on an Israeli
website, Israel Hayom,
it's a right wing website.
They interviewed him earlier
and even he said,
you've got to stop your war.
Yes, you could defend yourself,
but you've got to stop this.
You're losing your international
credibility and support.
And we cannot keep seeing these bodies
piling up in Gaza.
So this is really becoming a memory
Trump gave Netanyahu
everything he wanted,
moving the consulate
and the embassy to Jerusalem, giving them
sovereignty over the Golan
Heights, practically inviting them
to annex the West Bank.
He was very much in Netanyahu's camp.
But right now, as we as I've said,
there's an increasing number
of allied governments,
allies of Israel,
who are looking at
the very serious matter
of continuing to send the massive weapons
systems and the bombs, 2000 ton bombs
from the United States
that owe to time bombs
that are being sent.
And again, here is Jose Andres
on his conversation with President Biden.
I spoke to President Biden yesterday
and Biden made this statement,
which seems it's already a harder stand.
But
it's very complicated to understand
that we are going to be sending
America is going to be sending his Navy
on these military
to do humanitarian work,
when at the same time
weapons provided by America,
not not to defend Israel itself
from missile attacks, but used weapons
that are killing
civilians in this moment.
And as you can imagine,
if international aid organizations
like the UN, like Jose Andres, stop doing
their vital humanitarian work,
who is going to do it?
Is Israel going to do it?
That's all that's left.
And we saw the catastrophe
when they tried that,
you know, freelancing
a few weeks ago
and some 118
people were killed in shootings
and a stampede.
It's a very critical issue right now.
Christiane Amanpour,
thank you so much
for all of your reporting, as always.
John.
As we are standing by for that phone call
between the president
and prime minister,
there already has been one conversation
between us
and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin
and his Israeli counterpart.
So what took place there
seen as the torture portrait
at the Pentagon to torture?
What did they have to say?
Well, John, it was largely,
largely a mirror
image of the conversation
that President Biden had or that
the statement
that President Biden had issued earlier
this week that he was expressing outrage
over this W.K. strike.
Secretary Alston
apparently told the Israeli
defense minister
that he, too, was outraged
by this attack,
and he urged them to conduct
a swift, thorough
and independent investigation
into this attack.
And importantly,
something that we've heard
from other administration
officials as well,
they want the results
of this investigation to be made public
and they want someone
to be held accountable for this
tragic mistake,
which is what the Israelis
are characterizing it as.
But the administration is really,
at this point
kind of withholding judgment
about whether or not this was deliberate.
And for that reason,
they are not giving any sense
of whether or not
they're going to shift
their policy towards
Israeli defense and arms sales,
which have been ongoing,
as we reported earlier this week.
The administration is set to approve
an $18 billion F-15 sale to the Israelis,
where the jets won't
necessarily be delivered
for another 4 to 5 years.
There are questions
about why the administration,
while they're expressing
outrage over this strike,
while they're expressing outrage over
the fact that Israel does not appear
to be doing enough
to protect civilians,
is engaging in these arms sales
with the Israelis
and thereby kind of
affirming that they view them
as kind of a professional military
that is capable of
carrying out these operations
in a way that is consistent
with how the U.S.
would expect their allies to.
And so
Secretary Austin did reiterate
that he is angry about this strike.
It remains to be seen
whether anything
is actually going to change
when it comes to concrete.
U.S.
actions, because at this point,
it does not seem as though
the Israelis are necessarily
listening to what the U.S. is saying.
And we're seeing that
play out in real time,
of course,
with the operation that they're planning
in southern Gaza in Rafah.
Yes, indeed, Indeed, that is the case.
Obviously, a very important day
as we watch it unfold.
Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon,
thank you very much.",20240404
f7MB9VKx-ds,Biden to Netanyahu: Protect civilians or else,data/en_CNN\Biden to Netanyahu Protect civilians or else.jpg,"We need to go to
Secretary of State Blinken.
He is in Brussels.
Let's listen in
and we'll come back to that.
And I made clear then
the commitment of the United States
to Israel's security and to ensuring
that October 7th
could never happen again.
I also underscored Israel's moral,
strategic and legal requirements
to protect civilians and provide
humanitarian assistance
to those who needed it.
Now, of course,
what happened after October 7th
could have ended immediately
if Hamas had stopped hiding behind
civilians, released the hostages
and put down its weapons
But Israel is not Hamas.
Israel is a democracy.
Hamas, a terrorist organization,
and democracies
place the highest value on human life.
Every human life,
as has been said,
whoever saves the life,
saves the entire world.
That's our strength.
It's what distinguishes us
from terrorists.
Like Hamas.
If we lose that reverence for human life,
we risk becoming indistinguishable
from those we confront
Here's the current reality in Gaza.
Despite important steps
that Israel has taken
to allow assistance into Gaza.
The results on the ground
are woefully insufficient
and unacceptable.
100% of the population in Gaza
knows acute levels of food insecurity.
100% of the population
is in need of humanitarian assistance
and those working heroically
to provide that assistance are doing so
in great peril to their own lives.
This week's horrific attack
on the world's central kitchen
was not the first such incident.
It must be the last.
President Biden spoke a short
while ago with Prime Minister Netanyahu.
The leaders discussed
the situation in Gaza.
The president
emphasized that the strikes
on humanitarian workers
and the overall humanitarian situation
are unacceptable.
He made clear
the need for Israel to announce
a series of specific concrete
and measurable steps to address
civilian harm, humanitarian suffering
and the safety of aid workers.
He made clear that U.S.
policy with respect to Gaza
will be determined
by our assessment
of Israel's immediate action
on these steps.
He underscored as well
that an immediate cease fire is essential
to stabilize
and improve the humanitarian situation
and protect innocent civilians.
And he urged Prime Minister Netanyahu
to empower his negotiators
to conclude a deal
without delay to bring the hostages home.
The two leaders also discussed
public Iranian threats against Israel
and the Israeli people.
President Biden reaffirmed
the United States strong support
for Israel
in the face of these threats
and our commitment to Israel's security
Right now,
there is no higher priority in Gaza
than protecting civilians.
Surging humanitarian assistance
and ensuring the security
of those who provide it.
Israel must meet this moment.
We've been.
We discussed Secretary of State
Antony Blinken at NATO's
headquarters on the 75th
anniversary of the founding
of the organization.
He's live in Brussels, Belgium.
Some significant remarks
when it comes to the conflict in Gaza.
The secretary of state saying
that he has communicated
to Israeli officials not only the U.S.
his commitment
to Israel
and its war against Hamas,
but also the moral obligation that Israel
has to protect civilians
and aid workers in the Gaza Strip.
He specifically said,
and I quote,
If we lose reverence for human life,
we become indistinguishable
from them, from Hamas terrorists.
He described the efforts so far
by Israel since October seven to protect
civilians and humanitarian aid workers
as woefully inadequate.
And he laid out what we just got
a readout from the call
that President Biden
had with the prime minister
that the United States would consider
its approach to Israel
based on concrete steps to change
the way that Israelis handled civilians
and aid workers.
That's what
they're expecting data from Israel,
which is clear.
He said,
that they need to have concrete,
measurable steps to address harm
to civilians,
civilians suffering,
and also to aid workers.
And he said that US aid to Gaza
may be determined by those steps.
That's essentially what he said.
And this is really significant
because it comes on the heels
of a very close Biden ally.
Senator Coons,
talking this morning
about being open
to putting conditions on aid to Israel,
which is really
the first time that we have heard
the administration go so far.
And this is even as we're
hearing from a senior administration
official, that the policy hasn't changed.
The president is frustrated.
The policy hasn't changed.
This is signaling a potential
policy change.
So nonetheless, this is this is big.
Absolutely.
Notably, the timing of the the apparent
accidental strike coming
almost a day after the U.S.
announced this enormous deal.
$18 billion to sell F-15 fighter jets
to Israel.
The question now
being, is this rhetoric
that actually moves the needle or do
there have to be conditions on arms
in order
to get Prime Minister
Netanyahu and some of the other
Israeli officials
to carry out
significant change in the way
that they've been conducting the war?
We have with us
retired Colonel
Cedric Leighton
to give us some perspective.
Colonel Leighton,
from what you heard
from the secretary of state there,
it is a noticeable shift
saying that the policy toward
Israel will change, determined on
the way that
Israel conducts its operations in Gaza.
Absolutely.
And in essence,
what we're talking about,
Boris here is conditioning the aide
on Israeli conduct going forward.
I and I guess
in this case, you can kind of say
past is prolog
because the past conduct of Israeli
operations has not met U.S. standards.
And at this point in time,
it appears
as if it appears
as if the Department of Defense
and the administration
are looking
at changing the policy potentially
where they actually say, look,
you cannot use these weapons
against civilian targets,
you cannot use these weapons against
aid workers.
And that's the kind of thing
that I think might be happening here.
Whether or not it does, of course, is
is going to be borne out in the next
few days, probably.
But didn't
you mention the F-15 sale to Israel?
That's something
that's going to take place over
the next four or five years
in order
to actually get those weapons
to the Israelis.
But the other part of
this is they have already delivered,
Aaron, in the process
of delivering more £2,000 bombs
to Israel.
That's a much more immediate thing.
It's going to be interesting
to see
whether or not that delivery is stopped
before they actually are
put into Israeli airplanes
for potential use.
And that's
that's going to be a significant thing.
There are two things that the Israelis
that the U.S.
is worried about with Israel.
One of them is
the immediate conduct in Gaza.
The second thing is using Israel
as a buffer against Iran.
And that is going to be
kind of the balancing act
that the administration has to deal
with at this point.
Let's listen in to Admiral Kirby
and the overall humanitarian situation
in Gaza are unacceptable.
He made clear
the need
for Israel to announce
and to implement
a series of specific concrete
and measurable steps
to address civilian harm,
humanitarian suffering
and the safety of aid workers.
He made clear that U.S.
policy with respect to Gaza
will be determined by our assessment
of Israel's immediate action
on these steps.
He underscored that an immediate cease
fire is essential to stabilize
and improve the humanitarian situation
and to protect innocent civilians.
And he urged the prime minister
to empower his negotiators
to conclude a deal
without delay to bring the hostages home.
The two leaders also discussed
public Iranian threats against Israel
and the Israeli people.
President Biden made clear
that the United States
strongly supports Israel
in the face of those threats.
That's all I have.
Admiral,
you're not specifying what concrete steps
Israel must take.
Example, I.
I gave you some of a broad sense of it.
We want to see more crossings opened up.
We want to see more trucks getting
in, particularly from Jordan.
We want to see
tangible steps that the mitigation
of civilian harm,
particularly to humanitarian aid workers,
but obviously all civilians.
But we want to see that they have
that they have moved forward
on proper steps to de-conflict
with aid workers
as they move
around, that the information flow
is vital.
Their language we've heard for weeks
now, you're not talking about
sort of telling us
how exactly
you will measure those measurable steps
right.
What I said was
we're going to
examine our policy approaches
based on the our assessment of the way
the Israeli side
modifies their behavior,
modifies their policy and decision
making processes.
And so,
first of all, let's
see what they say they're going to do.
And then let's watch
and see
how they execute to what they say.
And I don't want to get ahead of them
on what they are
and what they
what they plan to say about the changes
they're going to make.
But we'll base
our policy decisions
based on an assessment
of how they execute
to their policy decisions.
You're not talking
about what
potential US
policy changes are on the table.
Can you say whether the president
share that with the Prime Minister
on this phone call?
The President made clear
that the that absent changes
in the protection
of civilians on the ground, absent
changes to the
volume of humanitarian assistance
getting in, absent
absent any movement on
a cease fire
that will allow hostages
to get out and more aid to get in.
Absent, you know, a calming down
that he will have
to reconsider his own policy
choices with respect to Gaza.",20240404
xhpWPuYaRTE,CNN correspondent breaks down new IDF report on WCK strike,data/en_CNN\CNN correspondent breaks down new IDF report on WCK strike.jpg,"We've just
received the IDF
initial findings on the Israeli
strike that killed
seven world
central kitchen workers in Gaza
on Monday.
The internal investigation
has found Israeli forces
believe they were targeting
Hamas, end quote,
mistakenly assumed to Hamas gunmen
were in the vehicles in the aid
convoy
Israel has now fired
two military commanders.
Let's get right to CNN's
Nic Robertson, who joins us now
live from Jerusalem.
Can you walk us through the findings?
It's a couple of pages.
And what do you see that might be missing
when you look
at some of the details of this
Yeah, sure.
This is a sequence of events
that the IDF has laid out
that they say led
to this misidentification
of misclassification
of the events on the ground. They say
the IDF
spotted a gunman getting on aid trucks.
We're talking about trucks here,
the big vehicles
that carry
the actual pallets
and containers of food
and other humanitarian supplies.
And then the IDF says they saw
another gunman. Again, a single.
So we're talking about two gunmen.
They're saying they see
get on the aid truck or aid trucks.
Then the convoy goes into the warehouse
and the IDF says
what happened
next is where the misidentification,
a missed clarification happens
that the IDF
then tracked the SUV as the vehicles
leaving the warehouse
after the aid trucks had been there.
The IDF says
they didn't realize these SUVs
worked for the world Central Kitchen,
despite the fact
these were
markings are clearly emblazoned
on those vehicles.
The IDF
then says that
those vehicles were engaged
because the IDF believed that the gunmen
were inside those SUVs now no longer
on the aid trucks
after they've been to the warehouse.
But inside the SUV.
Now, the IDF says
this should not have happened.
It was against their protocols
and against their rules of engagement.
And they have now dismissed a major
who was directly involved in the incident
and the brigade chief of staff,
a reserve
colonel and disciplined
the the brigade commander as well.
Now, the World
Central Kitchen say that it is good
that the IDF has acknowledged
and accepted responsibility
It's good
that they have taken disciplinary action.
However,
they're saying that
this is these outrageous killings
that what the IDF has said so far
on what they've done
is really of cold comfort.
They said that the IDF report shows
that the World Central Kitchen workers
were doing
everything
that they should have been doing.
But this, of course, leaves many,
many questions unanswered.
How could it be assumed
that the gunmen who been on
trucks were now inside?
We're talking about two gunmen
could be inside
three different vehicles
and so many more unanswered questions.
Yeah, that's true.
We will wait to see what happens.
I know the World Central Kitchen
founder has asked for
an independent investigation
that is not done by the IDF.
I do want to talk to you
about something that has just happened
after this conversation
between Netanyahu and President Biden.
The aid crossings into northern Gaza
are opening up and a dedicated port
Israel says will be available
for aid shipments.
What else are you learning there?
Yeah, I think
it's kind of
key to look at what
the White House is saying here.
U.S.
policy is going to be determined
on how Israel moves forward
from these statements.
And we heard the same from Secretary
Blinken today.
And it's what Palestinians
are telling us as well.
It's one thing
to hear it
from the Israeli government,
particularly when they're pushed
by the United States to do this.
But let's see the reality on the ground
and the context.
And that, of course,
is that back in January this year,
the Israeli government
said that
it was okay for food shipments
to come in
through the port of Ashdod,
which is 20 miles from the Erez crossing.
However, those food shipments
when they arrived
were then blocked by protesters
We already know that elements
with inside Netanyahu's
Prime Minister Netanyahu's
government, the right wing
elements, are saying
that they didn't agree with this move
by the Israeli government.
This set the scene
for, again,
potential protests
to potentially stop convoys.
It hasn't happened,
but this is why the White House
will look closely.
And another point of reference here
is that when he was here
in early
February, Secretary of State
Antony Blinken told the Israelis
that they should be opening the Erez
crossing in the north of Gaza
because that's
where the humanitarian situation
is most desperate.
That's where people are
literally dying of starvation.
We just got a figure from people
on the ground there today.
You know how much it is
for one kilo, £2.2 of potatoes today.
22 bucks.
22 bucks for £2 of potatoes.
That's the price of potatoes.
That's why people are starving.
And in the north of Gaza right now,
and that's why
there's going to be so much scrutiny
to see
if this actually happens, that the U.S.
has called so many times
for errors to be opened. Yes.
And the
UN agency
that's looking at
famine says famine is imminent.
They're a manmade famine.
Nic Robertson,
thank you so much for all your reporting.
Okay,
so this report also comes out
as Israel is now,
as you guys were just
discussing, opening,
planning to open another crossing
into Gaza
to allow more humanitarian
aid to flow in.
And this is after that phone call
between President Biden
and the Israeli prime minister,
where Biden issued an ultimatum
that Netanyahu
takes specific and concrete
and measurable steps
to protect aid workers
to or risk losing U.S. support.
CNN's Arlette
Science is at the White House
now with much more on on this.
Arlette,
what are you hearing this
morning from the White House about this
initial review,
this initial analysis,
this initial report
coming out about that strike?
Well, Kate, officials
here at the White House
were closely waiting
and watching for this initial report
from the Israelis
as they're trying
to get some further explanation
for what exactly led to that strike
on that world central kitchen convoy.
It comes on the heels
of a very blunt conversation
between President
Biden and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday,
where Biden warned
Israel would face consequences
if they do not do more
to protect civilians
and ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Now, in that phone
call, a senior administration
official tells CNN
that Netanyahu admitted
that the IDF was to blame
for the strike on this convoy.
And this morning,
we have some interesting new language
from Secretary of State
Antony Blinken,
who ahead of the Israelis report
being released
said that there must be a thorough,
independent investigation
and full of accountability
for what happened. Take a listen
It's also
critical that we see
an independent,
thorough
and fully publicized investigation
into the killing of the World
Central Kitchen
team
who were performing heroic work
under the most difficult circumstances
in trying to get assistance
to people who so desperately need it.
So we're looking to see
that investigation.
We're looking to see a public accounting
and we're looking to see accountability
in its wake.
You know, this all comes on
the heels of what was
could be
one of the most consequential phone calls
of this conflict.
Between President Biden and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in that phone call.
Netanyahu assured the president
that Israel would be trying
to take steps to prevent incidents
like this from happening again.
That's according to a senior
administration official.
One thing that the two men agreed on
was that more needed to be done
to be able
to track
where these humanitarian aid
workers are in Gaza.
There's also
was a discussion
about the need to get more humanitarian
aid in to the enclave,
and that was through the opening
of these access points.
As Nic was talking about earlier,
just in the hours after this call
between Biden and Netanyahu,
Israel approved the opening of that Erez
crossing in northern Gaza.
Now, one thing
that Secretary Blinken
and other officials
here at the White House have stressed
is that while they welcomed
the opening of this crossing,
while they open
welcome the ports,
they also want to see
the metrics of this,
see how many aid trucks
are actually getting in and see
how much assistance
is actually being distributed
to the American
to the Palestinian people.
But really,
this call between Biden
and Netanyahu will be closely watched
since it was one of the starkest warnings
that he's offered
that Biden has given to Netanyahu
about the way
that they're conducting their operations,
saying that things need to change
all the time at the White House for us.
Thank you so much live.",20240405
m9pFYovnPcs,Israeli journalist says Netanyahu is Israel’s worst prime minister,data/en_CNN\Israeli journalist says Netanyahu is Israel’s worst prime minister.jpg,"President Biden
is not alone
in expressing his frustration
over how Netanyahu is conducting
this war.
Many Israelis are also angry
and voicing their outrage,
holding nightly protests, demanding
not only that, the Netanyahu
government focus more on a deal
to bring home the remaining hostages,
but also many of them
calling for Israel's
longest serving prime minister in history
to resign.
My next guest
says, quote, Benjamin
Netanyahu is Israel's
worst prime minister ever
and that Netanyahu's obsession
with his own destiny
as Israel's protector
has caused his country grievous damage.
And Angela Pfeifer joins us
now from his ranch.
Thank you so much for joining us.
In your article,
you write that
Prime Minister
Netanyahu, had
he accepted defeat in 2021, perhaps today
he would have been remembered
as one of Israel's
most successful prime ministers.
Instead, you write, quote,
He has brought far right extremists
into the mainstream of government
and made himself and the country
beholden to them.
His corruption is flamboyant
and he has made terrible
security decisions
that brought existential danger
to the country
he pledged to lead and protect.
Above all,
his selfishness is without parallel.
He has put his own interests
ahead of Israel's at every turn, unquote.
Do you think that Netanyahu is
dragging this war on out
longer than it needs to be
for his own political survival?
I think that
it's very clear
by now that the way the war is going,
which on one side
it's now is talking about a total victory
and the need to press on
to do the operation in
the way that he's conditioning
a hostage agreement
or release agreement for it,
for a temporary ceasefire
with some kind of bigger military push.
Well, at the same time,
we're seeing on the ground
that the military isn't carrying out
that push and is scaling down
with Israeli forces.
It looks like a recipe
for a much longer war.
And the main reason for that happening
is that it's in the out
feels that as long as this war
is as long as this, we can say that
the war
it it'll be much more difficult
for his political opponents
to demand an early election
which will probably remove him.
So it's just a factual matter
that Netanyahu's survival as prime
minister depends on some anti-Arab
zealots in his cabinet,
Ben-Gvir and Smotrich.
Primarily,
he needs their support to stay in power.
If he alienates them,
they can leave
and he and there will be a new election.
He'll he'll not have support
to be prime minister.
How much do you think that's the reason
that not enough
humanitarian aid is getting into Gaza?
I don't think that's the main reason.
I think the reason that not enough
humanitarian aid got into
Gaza is a combination of reasons,
which partly it's
the trauma that Israelis
were feeling in the aftermath
of the of October seven.
Partly, it's
the way that the Israeli military
was focused
on them,
on the military campaign,
and didn't
think that the humanitarian side of
it was something that they,
as the army needed,
needed to to prioritize.
And yes,
the third element,
I think, is this political
paralysis at the heart
of Netanyahu's cabinet.
He can't make any major decision
because he's scared of
angering either the the far right
wing of his government, without whom
he doesn't have a majority
or the pragmatic wing.
And, of course, the Biden administration.
That leads to indecision.
And what we're seeing
now is that
there needed to be some kind of proactive
take on the humanitarian front
and that that has been absent
from Israel's decision making.
And that
and Netanyahu
is the man responsible for that.
So President
Biden had a tough conversation
with Netanyahu
in which he said
it was going to be tough
for the United States
to continue to support Israel
if Gaza keeps going the way it is.
The campaign. What do you think
Netanyahu is going to do?
Our friend Barak Ravid
is reporting that
Biden said out, out and out.
If he doesn't change it, it's
going to be tough to support you.
Well, that's also what
the White House readout said.
And we saw already
what Netanyahu did
immediately after his very tough
phone call with it,
with the president, that he rushed
to the Israeli cabinet
and immediately passed a decision
to open up the main routes through Israel
for supplies to Gaza.
This is something that for six months
the Israeli government
hasn't done is in the out,
did this literally within minutes
of speaking to Biden.
So we can see that this call
had a major effect on the.
But it's interesting that Netanyahu
rushed to vote at the beginning
of the cabinet meeting now.
Votes usually take place
after a debate is is held.
In this case.
The Senate was so scared
of one of his far
right ministers written by Ben-Gvir
who had been delayed and wasn't yet
at the cabinet meeting
that he rushed to have the vote
before Benjamin came.
So on the one hand, he could,
he hopes, appease Biden
by making those decisions
and the other hand avoid a confrontation
with one of his partners.
Fascinating.
Anshel Pfeffer, thank you so much.

M1xlEYfPiyk,"White House says it is watching Iranian threat ‘very, very closely’","data/en_CNN\White House says it is watching Iranian threat ‘very, very closely’.jpg","CNN has learned that
Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
is meeting with his war cabinet
just ahead of what
they anticipate
could be a potential attack from Iran.
It comes after an Israeli airstrike
hit the Iranian consulate
in Damascus, Syria,
last week,
killing a dozen
Iranian military officials.
The Pentagon says the top U.S.
general for the Middle
East is in Israel right
now, meeting with Israeli
military officials
about the security threats.
And the White House tells CNN
that officials
there are keeping a very close eye
on the situation
and are in constant communication
with Israel.
Let's get to the latest reporting
from our correspondents,
CNN international diplomatic editor
Nic Robertson
is joining us from Jerusalem.
And know
Toshiba Trend is over at the Pentagon.
Nic, first to you.
First of all,
what can you tell us
about this Israeli war cabinet meeting?
How concerned are Israelis right now
that Iran could launch an attack,
a retaliatory attack against Israel
There's a real concern, Wolf,
that Iran could do that in the coming
24 or 48 hours.
I've talked to various
intelligence sources in the region
at the moment.
They understand,
and this is what we're getting
from a lot of different sources,
that Iran is poised to respond.
Now, of course,
this could be Iran intentionally dis
informing,
putting disinformation out there
just to create that.
The sense of jitters
among the Israeli public here
among the leadership
in Israel
about precisely what they'll do,
and it's unclear what they'll do.
Will they respond
in straight back directly
to Israel themselves with the use proxies
to strike into Israel
with a strike,
Israeli interests
elsewhere in the region?
That's a question on people's
minds at the moment.
But that strength of an show of unity
and support between the United States
and Israel
is on display
today at a cancer airbase
in the south of Israel.
The CENTCOM commander,
General Eric Correll, up there
with your article
and the Israeli defense minister,
the deputy IDF chief of staff also there.
So this is very much a message of unity
and strength and preparedness
and this is what we heard from Rear
Admiral Daniel Hegarty,
the IDF spokesperson, just last night,
speaking about how prepared Israeli
is for whatever threat comes from Iran.
We're highly alert and prepared
for a wide range of scenarios
and are conducting
a situational assessment
We're ready in both defense and defense
with the various IDF
capabilities and strategic partners.
I'll take
you should give key
of Iran
a strike coming from Iranian territory
will clearly prove
that Iranian intentions
to escalate the situation
in the Middle East
and to stop hiding behind its proxies
And I think you get
a level of the understanding
of how this concern is shared
jointly between the United States
and Israel State Department
and the embassy here
warning staff
not to stray
beyond the sort of Tel Aviv area,
Jerusalem area, Sheva area,
stay in those areas.
The concern is it's just not clear
what Iran's move is going to be.
The sense that it could be soon, Wolf.
You know,
there's a lot of concern
in those embassy, the US embassy
and other embassies in Israel as well
are issuing warnings to their citizens
to stay put
basically
and worry
or start worrying about the potential.
Let's hope it doesn't happen
about the potential
of this war
escalating big time
between Israel and Iran.
Natasha, I want to go to the Pentagon
with you for a moment.
The top U.S.
military commander in the Middle East
the commander of the U.S.
military's Central Command is in Israel
right now.
We just heard Nick talk about that.
What do we know about his trip?
The coordination
that's going on between the United States
and Israel in anticipation
and fear of a formal a full scale Iranian
retaliatory response?
Well, Wolf, Eric
Parrilla the top general
for the Middle East,
he did say that the U.S.
and the Pentagon did say
also that the U.S.
stands with Israel
against any potential attack
that Iran might launch
against the Israelis.
And President Biden
made this very clear as well
that they are in constant coordination
with the Israelis
to prepare
for the possibility
that they do launch some kind of attack
directly on Israeli soil.
And according to a readout
from the Israeli side,
General Eric Carol,
he did meet with
you have got today
to discuss
readiness for an Iranian attack
against the state of Israel,
which may lead to regional escalation.
So clearly,
all sides here are bracing
for the possibility
that this escalates
into a full on conflict
between Iran and Israel.
However, U.S.
intelligence assessments,
as we reported
a little bit earlier in the week,
they assess that
this is more likely to be carried out
by Iranian proxy
forces in the region
rather than from Iran directly.
And that is for a number of reasons,
but most prominently
is because the Iranians don't
necessarily want to get involved
in a full blown war
with Israel,
that the US, as they have stated
publicly, would then come to Israel's
defense with.
So the Iranians trying to kind of temper
their response, according to our sources.
However, it is very possible
at this point,
according to intelligence assessments,
that these Iranian proxies
carry out attacks
against Israeli assets in the region.
And so all sides
kind of bracing for that and importantly,
how Israel is going to respond,
because that is also going to inform
just how much
this conflict escalates Wolf.
So, Natasha, just to be precise,
if Hezbollah,
an Iranian proxy in southern
Lebanon, starts
launching rockets and missiles, bombs
towards Haifa, Tel Aviv,
elsewhere in Israel,
the Israelis presumably
would respond big time against Hezbollah
in southern Lebanon
and try to destroy their capability,
but it wouldn't necessarily attack
directly Iranian targets in Iran.
Is that the U.S. understanding as well?
Well, it's
not clear just whether the U.S.
would characterize
an attack
by an Iranian proxy
against Israel as an attack
by Iran itself.
The U.S.
has made very clear,
of course, that the proxies
are only able to function
and really survive
because of Iranian support for them.
But at the same time,
it would definitely be a layer
removed from Iran itself.
If the proxies were the ones
carrying out these attacks.
However, Israel has said
that they are going to respond forcibly
to whatever kind of attack
they are faced with
by Iran or its proxies.
And so it just remains to be seen
how exactly this is going to play out
are very important, very,
very worrisome developments
unfolding right now. Natasha, thank you.
Nic, thanks to you as well.
I want to bring in CNN
military analyst, retired U.S.
Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling.
General, thanks so much for joining us.
As you know, officials are telling CNN
they expect
Iran will respond
imminently, key word imminently.
Do you think Iran is likely to strike
Israel directly
or could that happen through a proxy
like Hezbollah? For example, in Lebanon?
Everyone's asking that question, Wolf.
And what I'd say is General Chiarelli
is there because he's looking at
what is the most dangerous
course of action that Iran will take.
And what's the most likely?
The most dangerous is a strike
by Iran inside of Israel,
because that could certainly cause
an inflection point and expand this war.
The most likely is all of your reporters,
Natasha just said, is likely an attack by
any number of proxy groups,
whether it's Hezbollah
in Lebanon
or any of the PMF forces in Iraq or Syria
or in the area.
So that's what General Khairallah
and probably
he has some of his intelligence officers
with them
as well as some of his operators
so that they can react with naval
and air forces from the U.S.
in case
anything does happen,
because the key is deterring
any further expansion
of this regional conflict.
The Israeli strike
on that Iranian consulate
building in Damascus
was, what, about a week or so ago?
Why do you think Iran
has not waited this long to respond?
They immediately issued warnings
that they were going to
respond, but they haven't yet
Well,
part of it
is the messaging that Iran often uses
and they're concerned
about attacking inside of Israel
because truthfully,
Wolf, as you know,
Israel force is pretty extensive
and pretty confident
they can certainly go
after Iranian forces
if they do these kind of things.
So I think Iran
is trying to get their proxies
together to determine
what would be the best
and most effective attacks
by their proxies
and potentially themselves
without being
deterred or countered
by any Israeli forces.
So, again, that's
why everyone is on the edge to see
which kind of force
Iran will use and how they will use it.",20240412

and retired
four star General David Petraeus,
who also served as commander of U.S.
Central Command,
which includes part of the Middle East.
Director Petraeus, thanks for joining us.
What's your assessment of the attack
by Iran?
Was this a genuine attempt
to retaliate,
to overwhelm Israel's
defenses, to cause mass damage,
or was this a show of force or Iran
by indicating
that they don't want
actually to escalate further?
Well, I don't believe so.
I think it was probably
a bit more of the latter than the former.
Clearly, it was unprecedented.
There never has been an attack
that came from Iranian soil.
And, of course,
these attacks also included
some of the proxies
in Iraq and Syria and southern Lebanon.
There's never been something
like this in the past,
but it seemed a little bit
less than what they might have thrown
if they were really serious.
In fact, it was probably a good bit less
than if they really wanted
to cause massive damage.
It struck me as a little bit
like that attack
the Iranians did after the U.S.
killed cousin Soleimani in Baghdad.
That time,
they telegraphed it well in advance
and again, no casualties out of that one
in this case at most.
It appears that there was one
Arab-Israeli girl
who was seriously injured
and may have died.
So there's a tiny bit of this Goldilocks
aspect to this,
I think, although, again,
a very significant attack.
Iran and Israel
been fighting this shadow war
in the Middle East for decades now.
This is the first time
that Iran has directly attacked Israel
from inside
Iranian territory,
not using proxies like Hamas or Hezbollah
or the Houthis.
Just how significant
a moment is this for the Middle East?
Well, it is significant.
It's a very big deal.
And I think
Israel will have to
take some action in response.
I think it's very clear that the U.S.
would like
to see that be as limited
as this possible.
Keep in mind that the real issue here,
in addition to Israel's
security, of course,
which is first and foremost,
but it's also about freedom of navigation
from the Gulf
for the oil and gas
that come from the Gulf and fuel
much of the global economy.
That's the biggest issue here.
And Iran,
I don't think,
wants to have that disrupted either
because they export
about 1.6
or 1.7 million barrels a day themselves.
So keep your eye on that.
Brant crude is already
above $90 a barrel,
and it would really spike
if there was something that interfered
with freedom of navigation.
In fact,
we need to figure out what's going on.
Iran did take a ship the other day
that they claimed was in some way
dealing with Israel.
But this
is another step up
the rung of escalation.
I think it's in the interests
of everyone
to stop the increasing escalation.
But we'll have to see
what Israel decides to do in this case.
President Biden
told Prime Minister Netanyahu
that the United States
will not participate
in any offensive strikes
by Israel against Iran.
How would you advise Israel
to respond to this?
How worried are you
that any responsible
only throws fuel on the fire
Well, that has to be a concern,
and I'm sure
they're conscious of that, Jake.
There's a whole
menu of actions that they can take,
not all of which are necessarily overt.
They can pursue covert, they can pursue
asymmetric attacks,
cyberspace and so forth.
And keep in mind that, of course,
Washington is meeting
with the other G7 countries to determine
what kind of diplomatic
and economic responses
should follow in a coordinated effort
as well.
Can't really take your eye off
Gaza, though.
At the end of the day,
Got to get those hostages back.
And I believe
still do need to destroy Hamas.
You don't send the
the fire department to extinguish.
80% of the fire
They still have work to do there.
All right.
General Petraeus, always good to see you.
Thank you so much for your insights.
Joining us now,
the former
director of national intelligence
under President Obama, a retired General,
James Clapper.
So, first of all, just the size
and scope of this,
we've never seen anything quite like this
in terms of Iran directly
launching attack on Israel.
So it does seem to mark
a change, an inflection
point of some sort. Yes.
Oh, no question, Jake. That
a Rubicon was
has been crossed here with
Iran directly attacking from Iranian
Iran proper to Israel proper.
That said, though,
the size of the attack,
I think was very measured.
It did not.
I think
the Iranians had to know
that it would not overwhelm
the coalition air defense system.
And then at the end of it, they declared
it was done without having
accomplished much in the way of damage.
So I think there was a messaging here.
But I still believe despite this
very profound event, that the Iranians
don't want a wider war,
as strange as that may seem.
But so explain to people at home
who think General
or they're saying, General Clapper,
how can you say
they don't want a wider war?
They just fired 300 attack drones.
And missiles at Israel.
But you think that the way they did
it is significant?
Well, I do, because first
they telegraphed it.
They sent slow moving drones out first,
which you had hours to to prepare for.
And the Iranians have a lot of missiles,
ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.
So if they had wanted to,
I believe they could have overwhelmed
the Israeli air defense system
and out of the coalition,
which was very important
you know, I guess
20% or so of the projectiles were
neutralized by U.S.
or other coalition elements.
So the whole way they went about this,
I think, was very deliberate,
very measured.
I don't think
they want a wider war.
Of course, now
it's all up to the Israelis
So the United States
does not have an embassy in Iran.
Iran doesn't have an embassy
in the United States.
You think that this information
about a week ago
maybe or maybe a little bit less,
the Biden administration
started announcing
or leaking to newspapers.
There's intelligence
that Iran is going to attack Israel.
You think it's possible
that Iran leaked that intentionally?
I think it's quite possible.
They may have conveyed it to us.
I think
they probably weren't all that careful
about masking their preparation.
The fact that
President Biden
came back from Delaware early,
convene the national security team.
All these things
tell me that we had good insight
into what the Iranians were going to do.
And so why do it?
So why would they do it?
Well, I think the Israelis have
the Iranians have their own domestic
political pressures.
They have
they have some very
there are some very hard liners now
surrounding the supreme leader
So I think
they have that
that constituency to placate.
And the fact that they showed the
parade or, if you will, of
solitary the parade in Tehran
of the joyful Iranians,
so happy about the attack.
And I think that's
what was important to the Iranians.
And I still believe
they don't want a wider war,
as incongruous as that may sound.
But their proxy is are doing things that
are not meant to be
eliminated.
Their proxies Hamas slaughtering
you know 1200 Israelis.
Hezbollah firing rockets
into the north of Israel.
So as you know,
tens of thousands of Israelis
can't even live in their homes.
The Houthis shutting down
coastal passages, I mean, ocean passages.
So that seems incongruous to it does.
And I think that
raises the question
of just how much control
Iran actually has over the over
the proxies there.
I think they have their own objectives
and
and they're going to try to fulfill them.
And in the case of particularly
in the case of Hezbollah.
Well, this is a great opportunity
for them
to weigh in and increase the attacks
from southern Lebanon
and into northern Israel.
So,
you know,
this is not a rosy picture
for Iran either. I'll put it that way.
All right.
Retired General
James Clapper, former
director of national intelligence,
thanks so much for being here.
Appreciate it.",20240415
hkKjdA2itXk,"Hamas offered ‘extraordinarily generous’ ceasefire proposal, Blinken says","data/en_CNN\Hamas offered ‘extraordinarily generous’ ceasefire proposal, Blinken says.jpg","President Biden
is again
applying pressure on Israel over
its actions in Gaza.
The president spoke with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu over the weekend.
The White House
said Biden made it clear that the U.S.
would not support
a potential invasion of Rafah
without an explicit plan
to protect civilians.
But a source says
the primary focus of the call
was a potential hostage deal with Hamas.
It comes after the group
released a video of two hostages
on Saturday on the left as Israeli
Omri Moran.
On the right is American
Israeli Keith Segal.
In the video,
Segal pleaded for Israel
to negotiate a hostage release deal
that appeared
he he was speaking under some duress.
CNN cannot verify
where or when the video was shot.
Meanwhile,
the secretary of state is in Saudi
Arabia right now.
As Hamas is considering a new deal
calling for the release of hostages
held since October 7th in exchange
for a pause in the fighting in Gaza.
This morning,
Tony Blinken said
Israel has presented
Hamas with, quote, an extraordinarily
generous proposal,
adding that the militant group
is the only thing
standing between the people of Gaza
and a cease fire.
Let's get the latest
from CNN national security
correspondent Kylie Atwood.
Kylie over at the State Department
for us. Kylie.
What can you tell us about this proposal?
Well, listen, as you said,
the secretary of state
very clearly this morning
saying that in the U.S.
opinion, what has been put on the table
by Israel for
Hamas is an extraordinarily,
quote, generous proposal.
And he called on Hamas to
accept that deal.
He also said that they have to accept it
quickly.
And our reporting
is that some of the demands
that Israel had been
making has been lessened.
And so
it appears that this could be a proposal
that Hamas could accept.
And the reason for him
saying that Hamas has to act quickly
is because the backdrop here is that
Israel has been saying for some time
they plan to invade Rafah. And U.S.
officials are very eyes wide open
about the fact that they are likely
to go ahead with that invasion
if there isn't an agreement here
for a cease fire
and for hostages to be released.
So time is truly of the essence.
Yeah.
And clearly, a
source tells CNN
that there's a worry
inside the State Department
that Israel is not using
American provided weapons
in accordance with international law.
What's going on there?
Yeah.
So there is not a consensus opinion
within the State Department as to
if Israel is using
those american-made weapons in accordance
with international law.
That's according to a State Department
official who spoke with my colleague,
Jennifer Handler.
And this is important
because this is all going to
come to the fore next week.
There is a requirement
due to a new national security memorandum
that President Biden signed
at the end of last year
for the State Department,
for the secretary
to provide an actual assessment
as to with all of the countries
using american-made weaponry are doing so
in accordance with international law.
These countries are supposed
to provide their rationale,
their explanation
for the fact that they do believe
they are in accordance
with international law.
The State Department assesses
that, provide that to Congress.
But because there is disagreement
within the State Department over this
right now,
it's going to be interesting
to see
what the final determination
from the secretary of state
actually is next week
when he provides
that assessment to Congress Jim.
All right.
Very important development there.
Kylie Atwood, thank you very much.
U.S.
Secretary of state
is back in the Middle East
for the seventh time
since the start of the Israel-Hamas war
and is urging Hamas
to accept the latest framework
for a Gaza cease fire.
Anthony Blinken meeting today
with regional foreign ministers
and other top diplomats
at a special forum,
a special World Economic
Forum meeting, rather, in Riyadh.
It comes as a Hamas delegation in Cairo
is there to discuss the new proposal
for a truce,
which calls
for the release of Israeli hostages
and Palestinian prisoners.
Over the span of several weeks
in exchange
for a temporary cease fire
and the restoration of sustainable calm.
I want to play for you a little bit more
from that meeting with the Saudi
foreign minister was asked
specifically about the situation
in Gaza and Saudi Arabia's role.
Take a listen.
The situation in Gaza
obviously is a catastrophe by every major
humanitarian, but also a complete failing
of the existing political system
to deal with that crisis.
We in the region are not going
to focus only on
solving the crisis of the moment.
We are going to look at how we can solve
the bigger problem
in the context of Gaza.
That is
a real commitment
to a two-State solution.
That is a credible, irreversible
path to a Palestinian state.
That's the only reasonable
and credible
solution
that guarantees us
from not having to come back
to this same situation,
to three, four years down the line.
The shadow minister of state
for foreign affairs
also pointing
to reduced conflict in the region.
Take a listen.
Our objective is to link the region with
the world and to be able to
put the
resources of the region together
so we can create synergies
that have a positive impact
on all the inhabitants of the region.
This is complicated
by the tensions
that we have in the region.
So our objective is to try to put an end
to these tensions
so we can focus on the things
that matter.
Economic development and prosperity.
The crisis in Gaza, understandably
top of mind at the World
Economic Forum conference.
That is where my colleague Becky Anderson
sat down with the forum's president.
They began by speaking about
the future of the enclave
and what will be needed to help rebuild.
There will be no willingness
among any donors to rebuild Gaza
if there's no guarantee
that there will not be a Gaza war again,
because we will rebuild something
that will be bombed again.
That means an irreversible
path to a Palestinian state.
From the conversations
that you are having here
and these are around
that a unified Arab strategy
for Gaza and Palestinians going forward,
is your sense that we are close?
I think
with the cease fire in Gaza, at least
there will be a willingness
to have real political discussions.
What is in it for Israel is,
of course, a potential deal
with, for example, Saudi Arabia and Saudi
Arabia will then gain
additional support
from the US on the military side.
But we know that this has taken time
also before.
And I guess there is also
the complications with
the political situation in Israel.
Is there a willingness
to work for a two-State solution?
And then we have the American elections
coming up too,
that some people say
that is not possible to move
before or after those elections
because a plan, though, I think
has to also be supported
very strongly from outside.
You will have to have the Arab countries
and the US and other key players saying
this is the deal Take it or leave it.
Important points, of
course,
as in terms of the economic picture
for the region.
It is not defined,
of course, by conflict.
It's incredibly complex.
The host of the World
Economic Economic Forum
is a case in point.
Here's more about Saudi
Arabia's current trajectory.
So it is very significant that Saudi
Arabia have reached already
this big milestone
of 50% of the economy is now based on
oil and gas.
This was the plan for 2030
that the conference launched
and now we are in 2024.
So this is incredible.
But we also see other these days
doing really well
also with their investments knowing
they have a lot of talent there.
Qatar
but then the Middle East is kind of.
There is the JCC
and then there are other Middle
Eastern countries
that are really really struggling.
I'm assuming
that you will look at a country
like the kingdom and say here's
a great example of how
that kind of
portfolio comes together
successfully again.
How how does one take
what is going on here
and around this region
as a starter for ten as it were?
When you're looking at the wider world.
So Saudi
Arabia is going by thing investments.
That's important.
We're seeing people
also expats coming
to the kingdom and they also have an open
trade policy.
They're reducing tariffs
and they're not
sticking to protectionism.
The challenge globally is
that trade
was the engine of growth for decades.
So trade was growing much faster
than the global economy.
Now trade is growing slower.
Then
that is also leading
to more anemic growth
of what we have to avoid
is that the twenties become the 1970s.
So how do you avoid the twenties
becoming the 1970s like this?
It's also important
to look at some of the success stories
of these past decades.
So we are faced with that.
Globalization
is a different globalization.
I think on the global trends,
we will not only have a situation
where you stick
to comparative advantages,
you will have nurturing
particles or French roaring that you
then trade more with countries
where you feel that you are great.
But it's also very
important that you don't lose the baby
with the bathwater
because this globalization has led
to a situation where never seen
so much poverty being eradicated.
In 1994, 2% of the global population
lived in extreme poverty.
Today it's 10%
and we'll continue to watch
for more developments out of Riyadh.",20240429
Dr-OKI2NEng,"Israel’s military tells 100,000 residents in eastern Rafah to ‘evacuate immediately’","data/en_CNN\Israel’s military tells 100,000 residents in eastern Rafah to ‘evacuate immediately’.jpg","It appears that Israel is
setting the stage
for a long feared ground
offensive into Rafah.
The Israeli military
dropped leaflets urging people
in parts of eastern Rafah
to evacuate immediately.
The IDF calls it
a limited scope operation.
The defense minister
earlier told troops
to expect intense action and Rafah.
Now many Palestinians are already fleeing
the area.
The southern Gaza city was supposed to be
a safe place
where more than a million
Palestinians have taken refuge there
after fleeing from other areas.
The UN says the area
where people have been directed to go
is simply not suitable to live.
CNN's Arlette
Signs is at the white House.
But let's begin with Nic
Robertson, who's
following all the developments
from London now.
Nic,
this RAF operation was long anticipated.
What are you hearing about
what Israel is planning to say?
And if this indeed
is the ground offensive
that Israel has been warning about.
It has all the hallmarks
of a ground offensive.
And typically
when Israel has launched
previous ground offensives
going into Gaza not long after the
those horrific October 7th attacks.
it took many days before we began
to get an idea of the scope
and scale of the operation.
It was a big operation,
but Israel was sort of able to keep it
pretty much under wraps.
Remembering
journalists like ourselves
and other news organizations
are not allowed
by Israel
to go into Gaza
to freely report
and see what's happening.
So there's a level of difficulty
to to understand
precisely what's happening
in and around Rafah at the moment.
But what is clear,
these leaflets that the IDF are dropping
are very similar to leaflets
they've dropped at the heads
prior to other major military operations.
They've told, Palestinians
and about 12 different,
blocks of housing.
That's about 100,000 people.
The UN estimates to leave their houses
and go to an expanded, safer area.
And these leaflets, these fliers
that the IDF are dropping,
tell, tell the residents
there that their area is going to be used
as, is going to be
where an offensive is against terrorists.
And it says that those terrorists
are going to hide among you.
It's very clear
that when the IDF goes in that
the scenarios could be it appears like,
the previous military operations
where civilians
get caught up in the operations.
Now, has the operation
military operation actually begun?
It doesn't appear so, but again,
we're we're restricted in what we can see
and what we can actually
get access to report.
So, we know that
the negotiations at the moment
are sort of stalled.
They're not completely broken down.
So is this a last ditch pressure effort
by, Israel on Hamas
to, to cede to their terms?
The gap still remains
very big at those talks.
So what the UN is describing now and in
and around the area of Rafah,
where people are being
told to go to these areas
where there isn't enough food, isn't
enough water,
isn't enough sanitation,
not the right conditions
for them to go live.
And as we've seen in other operations,
it won't necessarily be safe in these
designated humanitarian safer areas.
So the U.N.
is very concerned
not just about their welfare, physical
but psychological welfare,
and that this could precipitate panic,
which could mean and in an area
where there are about 1.5 million
people living,
that could be a pretty dire consequences.
And Unicef,
Unicef is saying about 600,000 children
there, face a very uncertain time
at this moment.
Nic Robertson, thank you.
Let's head over to the white House now.
And Arlette signs.
What's the view from there
and what the Biden administration
is saying about all this,
considering cease fire talks are ongoing
where the CIA director,
Bill Burns, is in Doha right now
trying to broker a deal.
Netanyahu has said over and over again
that deal or no deal.
this ground incursion will go forward.
Yeah.
Amara, there's no question
that the white House is watching
these latest moves from Israel
relating to eastern Rafah
incredibly closely.
It comes as the administration
for months
now has warned about
a potential ground operation
in Rafah,
with President Biden
and others here at the white House
stressing to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that they need to ensure
there is a plan in place
to ensure the safety
and evacuation of the more than 1.4
million Palestinian Guineans
who are in the Rafah area.
at this time.
Now, on Friday,
we have reported that U.S.
and Israeli
officials had been in conversations
about Rafah, that Israel provided insight
into their thinking
relating to the evacuation of Rafah.
But sources cautions
that what was presented
did not appear to be a final plan,
that there was no full briefing
when it comes to
what a military operation
would look like.
The white House
certainly has been watching this
with quite
a bit of concern,
as President Biden's also facing
domestic pressure here at home,
relating to the way that Israel
has conducted its campaign in Gaza.
Now, over the weekend, we also learned
that the U.S. paused a shipment of U.S.
made ammunition
to Israel,
a source familiar with the matter told us
that this was not due
to this potential operation into Rafah,
and that this would not impact
aid going forward to big questions
about why exactly
there was that pause in shipment.
Senator Chris Coons,
a key
member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, suggested
there could have been logistical issues.
But this is all playing out.
As Nick noted, against the backdrop
of those
hostage
and ceasefire negotiations
that appear to have stalled out
over the weekend.
CIA director
Bill Burns was on hand in Cairo,
working as a mediator on this issue.
He then traveled on to Doha,
where he met
with a guitar Prime minister.
He was set to travel to Israel today,
but is actually remaining in Doha,
as the administration
all last week had really been
speaking in quite optimistic tones
about the prospect of
a deal coming together.
But we saw the Israeli and Hamas sides
both really blame each other
for what they viewed
as each other's extreme views.
So this is something that the white House
certainly wants
to try to get an agreement on.
But at the time it appears
that those conversations
are stalled out
doesn't mean that
they won't get on track at some point.
but also, I would note that today
President Biden here
at the white House
will be having lunch
with Jordan's King Abdullah.
Abdullah, of course, is a key,
player in the region.
He has warned
and expressed concerns
about the way
that this operation
has been conducted in Gaza,
about the humanitarian issues
that are on hand there.
So the president might have a chance
to hear
directly from King Abdullah
about his concerns.
But all of this comes
as you have big questions
about what
Israel will be doing going forward
when it relates to Rafah, as the U.S.
has been trying to stress
that they need to take great care
to ensure the safety of civilians there.
Yeah.
so much uncertainty
when it comes to the fate
of the civilians.
Arlette signs at the white House.
Thank you very much.
Now, earlier,
our Max foster
spoke to Scott Anderson,
the director of Unwra affairs in Gaza.
Unwra is a UN agency
that works to support
Palestinian refugees.
he is currently in Gaza,
and he says people need a
place to escape the fighting
are concerned.
Some 1.4
million people
that have sought refuge
from the violence in Rafah,
people need to be given an opportunity
to move away from conflict.
if they aren't, I mean,
the results will be catastrophic.
The impact will be catastrophic.
to have a fire in such a densely
populated neighborhoods
that that exists throughout Rafah,
where I sit and tell us all time,
which is one of the neighborhoods
for to the West,
it's incredibly densely populated.
You see tents and makeshift
plastic structures
everywhere,
as if an operation
happened here at any scale.
it's
hard to predict the scale of deaths
other than to say
it would be catastrophic
and the impacts
would be catastrophic
for people who sought safety here.
The Americans have
obviously warned against
civilian casualties.
they've given that warning to Israel.
how much support
you're getting from countries
other than Israel in your work
to making making
sure civilians are looked after?
I think this is
certainly a concern for everybody,
I think, including Israel.
But innocent civilians
are not harmed in this conflict.
we've heard very loudly
from the United States, as you mentioned,
but also many countries
within the European Union
as well as the Gulf states.
So anybody that's a donor here
or is active
here has the same concern
as the United Nations.
And that is we want
innocent civilians to be kept safe.
We want children to be kept safe.
And we continue to call on all parties
to the conflict,
to ensure that civilians are safe
and not impacted by ongoing hostilities.",20240506

has announced it has agreed to a ceasefire&nbsp;&nbsp;
agreement proposed by Egypt and cutter we're&nbsp;
waiting to see if Israel will accept the deal&nbsp;&nbsp;
as well Beth Sanner is a former deputy director&nbsp;
of National Intelligence for us she's joining&nbsp;&nbsp;
us on the phone so what's your reaction Beth&nbsp;
let me just read to you a little bit from the&nbsp;&nbsp;
statement that Hamas released the statement said&nbsp;
that uh Ismael hania the head of the political&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bureau of Hamas quote made a phone call to&nbsp;
the Cuttery prime minister shik Muhammad B&nbsp;&nbsp;
Abdul Rahman Alani and to the Egyptian minister&nbsp;
of intelligence Mr AB abas Kamal and informed them&nbsp;&nbsp;
of hamas's agreement to their proposal regarding a&nbsp;
ceasefire agreement what's your reaction Beth well&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think that um first we have to hold our breath&nbsp;
here but I do think that the um Israelis are&nbsp;&nbsp;
likely to sign on since this is the same terms as&nbsp;
far as we know to what they had signed on earlier&nbsp;&nbsp;
so I'm actually pretty hopeful I think that the&nbsp;
military pressure and this idea that the Rafa&nbsp;&nbsp;
operation was about to go forward may have made&nbsp;
the difference the last framework proposal that&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh we know about Beth had the release of 20 to 33&nbsp;
Israeli hostages over several weeks in exchange&nbsp;&nbsp;
for a temporary ceasefire and the release of&nbsp;
Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel uh&nbsp;&nbsp;
and that was supposed to result in ARR restoration&nbsp;
of sustainable calm during which the remaining&nbsp;&nbsp;
hostages captive Israeli soldiers and the bodies&nbsp;
of hostages would also be exchanged for the&nbsp;&nbsp;
release of more Palestinian prisoners that was an&nbsp;
earlier proposal that was clearly discussed with&nbsp;&nbsp;
both cter and Egypt uh if that is the plan right&nbsp;
now and if ifas has agreed to that that would be&nbsp;&nbsp;
a huge development an absolutely huge development&nbsp;
and I think that you know part of the issue here&nbsp;&nbsp;
is that Yaya senoir who is as far as we know still&nbsp;
holed up in southern Gaza um and the political&nbsp;&nbsp;
leadership hania who is the one who said publicly&nbsp;
that they were a go you know they have trouble&nbsp;&nbsp;
communicating uh it's hard for them to do that but&nbsp;
also they're not completely on the same page and&nbsp;&nbsp;
they don't have the same interests in some ways&nbsp;
given that senoir you know is potentially staring&nbsp;&nbsp;
down the barrel of a gun and also the party who&nbsp;
wants to walk away from this and survive so you&nbsp;&nbsp;
know it could be a very big deal and I think that&nbsp;
this delay may have been uh part of the discussion&nbsp;&nbsp;
and trying to hear back from sinir inside of Gaza&nbsp;
Beth standby I want to go to Jeremy Diamond he's&nbsp;&nbsp;
joining us live from Jerusalem right now Jeremy&nbsp;
has there been any reaction from the Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp;
government to what the Hamas has just announced&nbsp;
uh wolther has not yet and so we are applying a&nbsp;&nbsp;
lot of caveats to this this news that is just&nbsp;
breaking at this hour and that is wolf that we&nbsp;&nbsp;
have now heard from Hamas in a statement that&nbsp;
they posted to their telegram Channel saying&nbsp;&nbsp;
that they have agreed to the proposal regarding a&nbsp;
ceasefire agreement isma hania hamas's political&nbsp;&nbsp;
leader speaking to the kaderi Prime Minister as&nbsp;
well as the Egyptian intelligence Chief to relay&nbsp;&nbsp;
that message but as you uh said wolf we have yet&nbsp;
to hear from the Israeli government officially&nbsp;&nbsp;
we have yet to hear from the Americans from the&nbsp;
Egyptians from the cutteries and so we do have&nbsp;&nbsp;
to caveat this this news which does carry with&nbsp;
it uh quite a bit of promise and hope here hope&nbsp;&nbsp;
of course for the hundreds of thousands of people&nbsp;
in Gaza who have endured unspeakable Horrors over&nbsp;&nbsp;
seven months of War as well as for the families&nbsp;
of those hostages Who Remain captive in Gaza who&nbsp;&nbsp;
have hoped and prayed for the day that they&nbsp;
will get to hold their loved ones in their&nbsp;&nbsp;
arms once again uh but what we do know wolf is&nbsp;
that there has been an Egyptian framework on the&nbsp;&nbsp;
table over the course of the last week which uh&nbsp;
officials on all sides had had a lot of hope that&nbsp;&nbsp;
it could potentially uh bring these two sides&nbsp;
together in particular because Israel did make&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh several key concessions including allowing the&nbsp;
return the unrestricted return of Palestinians to&nbsp;&nbsp;
Northern Gaza as part of this latest framework&nbsp;
something that they had resisted for some time&nbsp;&nbsp;
and had been a major sticking point this framework&nbsp;
agreement that was on the table last week would&nbsp;&nbsp;
see the release of some 20 to 33 Israeli hostages&nbsp;
over several weeks uh of of a ceasefire and then&nbsp;&nbsp;
ultimately leading to a longer term ceasefire&nbsp;
perhaps a one-year ceasefire between Israel and&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hamas Israel had not agreed to every point in this&nbsp;
framework but it had uh it did have significant&nbsp;&nbsp;
input in this framework as it was then presented&nbsp;
to Hamas we've watched wolf over the last uh few&nbsp;&nbsp;
days as that optimism around those negotiations&nbsp;
had quickly soured it appeared that Hamas was&nbsp;&nbsp;
sticking to its demand that an end to the war&nbsp;
altogether that Israel commit to that as part&nbsp;&nbsp;
of this agreement something that Israel has&nbsp;
refused to do but now hours after the Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp;
military began dropping evacuation leaflets on&nbsp;
Eastern Rafa ordering a 100,000 civilians to&nbsp;&nbsp;
flee Hamas now putting in a statement hours later&nbsp;
that they have agreed to this initial proposal&nbsp;&nbsp;
we don't know whether that uh evacuation order in&nbsp;
Rafa was the key factor that changed hamas's mind&nbsp;&nbsp;
we also don't know whether any major changes to&nbsp;
this Egyptian framework have been made in order&nbsp;&nbsp;
to get Hamas to agree to it and and like I said&nbsp;
we have yet to hear from all of the other parties&nbsp;&nbsp;
involved so as much as there is a promise&nbsp;
and hope in this statement from Hamas there&nbsp;&nbsp;
is certainly not certainty at this stage wolf&nbsp;
Jeremy I want you to stand by MJ Lee our White&nbsp;&nbsp;
House correspondent is getting more information&nbsp;
us reaction I take it MJ the president President&nbsp;&nbsp;
Biden had a conversation a phone conversation with&nbsp;
prime minister Benjamin nanyu earlier today is&nbsp;&nbsp;
that right that's right we know President Biden&nbsp;
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;&nbsp;
spoke earlier today and of course these ongoing&nbsp;
hostage uh deal negotiations was one of the many&nbsp;&nbsp;
topics that the two leaders discussed as has&nbsp;
been the case for all of their recent phone&nbsp;&nbsp;
conversations uh but what we are waiting for right&nbsp;
now is an official White House and US reaction to&nbsp;&nbsp;
this news that Hamas has apparently agreed to&nbsp;
a temporary ceasefire deal so we'll bring that&nbsp;&nbsp;
to you whenever we have word of that uh but&nbsp;
I heard Jeremy in his last conversation with&nbsp;&nbsp;
you really leaning into the various caveats that&nbsp;
are at play here and I do think that uh kind of a&nbsp;&nbsp;
note of caution from here in Washington is wise as&nbsp;
well that is just to say that we have had moments&nbsp;&nbsp;
like this before in the months of negotiations to&nbsp;
get to a temporary ceasefire and hostages release&nbsp;&nbsp;
deal where we appear to be on the brink of a&nbsp;
deal and other moments where we appear to be&nbsp;&nbsp;
on the brink of these talks completely falling&nbsp;
apart so again as we wait for official US word&nbsp;&nbsp;
and reaction from the Israeli side to this news&nbsp;
from Hamas that they are agreeing to this deal I&nbsp;&nbsp;
do think again just uh leaning into that note of&nbsp;
caution uh is is definitely uh worth doing uh but&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh what US officials have been doing of course in&nbsp;
recent weeks is very much uh pushing hard for this&nbsp;&nbsp;
deal to get done because uh the administration&nbsp;
believes that this is really uh the only clear&nbsp;&nbsp;
way to eventually getting to an end to this War&nbsp;
uh but I can't underscore enough how important it&nbsp;&nbsp;
is for us officials to try to get to that point to&nbsp;
try to get to the point of uh hostages coming out&nbsp;&nbsp;
and this uh this conflict that has been going&nbsp;
on for so many months to come to an end and of&nbsp;&nbsp;
course a big part of that is avoiding a major&nbsp;
Rafa incursion from taking place and of course&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Israelis have been warning for weeks and weeks&nbsp;
now that they are getting increasingly prepared&nbsp;&nbsp;
to go ahead and take that step if this deal does&nbsp;
not come together wolf is the White House still&nbsp;&nbsp;
planning a press briefing at the bottom the hour&nbsp;
in about 15 minutes or so from now MJ yeah that&nbsp;&nbsp;
press briefing has actually been pushed back&nbsp;
to 2:00 so that is when we will hear uh from&nbsp;&nbsp;
National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby&nbsp;
and where we will get an opportunity to press&nbsp;&nbsp;
him on all of these latest developments and of&nbsp;
course we'll be bringing that to you as well wolf",20240506

DWhlNn_CPVg,Biden: Downplaying Hamas' October 7 attack must stop,data/en_CNN\Biden Downplaying Hamas' October 7 attack must stop.jpg,"right now, President Biden is
delivering remarks at the US Capitol.
So we're going to listen in.
Thank you.
Thank you. Sir, please.
Thank you to Isaiah
chapter ten introduction
for your leadership
in the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum.
There are two scholar statesmen
and, a dear friend,
Speaker Johnson,
Peter Jeffries, members of Congress,
and especially the survivors
of the Holocaust.
My mother here, she look at you.
God love you all.
God's love you all
a Foxman and all other survivors
who embody absolute courage
and dignity and grace are here as well.
During these sacred days of remembrance,
we grieve.
We give voice to the 6 million Jews
who were systematically targeted,
murdered by the Nazis
and their collaborators
during World War Two.
We honor the memory of victims,
the pain of survivors,
the bravery of heroes
who stood up to Hitler's
unspeakable evil. And we recommit
to heading
and heeding the lessons
at one of the darkest chapters
in human history
to revitalize and realize
the responsibility of never again,
never again, simply translated from me,
means never forget, never forget.
Never forgetting means
we must keep telling the story,
must keep teaching the truth,
must keep teaching our children
and our grandchildren.
The truth is, we are at
risk of people not knowing the truth.
That's why growing up,
my dad
taught me and my siblings
about the horrors of the Shoah.
At our family dinner table.
That's why I visited Yad Vashem
with my family
as a senator,
as vice president, and as president.
And that's why
I took my grandchildren to Dachau
so they could see and bear witness
to the perils of indifference,
the complicity of silence
in the face of evil that
they knew was happening.
Germany, 1933
Hitler and his Nazi Party rise to power
by rekindling one of the world's oldest
forms of prejudice and hate,
anti-Semitism.
His role didn't begin with mass murder.
It started slowly across economic,
political, social and cultural life.
Propaganda demonizing Jews,
boycotts of Jewish businesses,
synagogues to face with swastikas,
harassment of Jews in the street
and schools,
anti-Semitic demonstrations,
pogroms, organized riots
with the indifference of the world,
Hitler knew
he could expand his reign of terror
by eliminating Jews from Germany
to annihilate Jews across
Europe through genocide.
The Nazis call the Final Solution
concentration camps,
gas chambers, mass shootings.
By the time the war ended,
6 million Jews,
one out of every three Jews
in the entire world, were murdered.
This Asian hatred of Jews
didn't begin with.
The Holocaust
didn't end with the Holocaust, either.
Or after.
Even after our victory in World War two,
this hatred
continues to lie deep in the hearts
of too many people in the world
and requires
our continued vigilance
and outspokenness.
That hatred was brought to life
on October 7th.
In 2023,
on a sacred Jewish holiday.
The terrorist group Hamas
unleashed the deadliest
day of the Jewish people
since the Holocaust, driven
by ancient
desire to wipe out the Jewish people
off the face of the earth.
Over 1200 innocent people
babies, parents, grandparents
slaughtered in a kibbutz,
massacred at a music festival,
brutally raped,
mutilated and sexually assaulted
thousands more
carrying wounds.
Borrowed some shrapnel
from the memory of that
terrible day they endured.
Hundreds taken hostage,
including survivors of the Shoah.
Now
here we are,
not 75 years later,
but just seven and a half months later,
and people are already forgetting.
They're already forgetting
that Hamas unleashed this terror.
That was Hamas, a brutalized Israelis.
It was Hamas
who took and continues to hold hostages.
I have not forgotten, nor have you.
And we will not forget.
As Jews around the world
still cope with the atrocity
and trauma of that day and its aftermath,
we've seen a ferocious surge
of antisemitism in America
and around the world,
vicious propaganda
on social media.
Jews
forced to keep their hide,
their keepers under baseball
hats, tuck
their Jewish stars into their shirts.
On college campuses, Jewish students
blocked, harassed, attacked
while walking to class.
Antisemitism,
anti-Semitic posters, slogans
calling for the annihilation of Israel,
the world's only Jewish state.
Too many people
denying, downplaying
rash lies and ignoring
the horrors of the Holocaust.
And October 7th,
including Hamas's appalling use
of sexual violence to torture
and terrorize Jews.
It's absolutely despicable,
and it must stop
silence.
Silencing the vile can hide much,
but it can erase nothing.
Some adjusted is so heinous,
so graphic, so grievous.
They cannot be married, buried
no matter how hard people try.
In my view,
a major lesson of Holocaust is,
as mentioned earlier, it's
not always not inevitable.
We know hate never goes away.
It only hides,
given a little oxygen
and comes off one of the rocks.
We also know it stops hate
one thing all of us.
Later, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks
described antisemitism as a virus
that survived and mutated over time.
Together, we cannot
continue to let that happen.
We have to remember
our basic principles as a nation.
We have an obligation obligation.
We have an obligation
to learn the lessons of history.
So we don't surrender our future
to the horrors of the past.
We must give hate no safe harbor
against anyone, anyone.
From the very founding, our very founding
Jewish Americans.
Representative. Only about 2% of the U.S.
population have helped lead cause
of freedom for everyone in our nation.
From that experience,
we know scapegoating and demonizing
any minority
is a threat to every minority.
And the very foundation of our democracy.
So moments like this,
I have to put these principles
and we're talking about into action.
I understand
people have
strong beliefs
and deep convictions about the world
in America.
I respect and protect
the fundamental right to free speech.
To debate, disagree.
To protest
peacefully and make our voices heard.
I understand that's America.
But there is no place on any campus
in America, or any place in America
for anti-Semitism
or hate speech
or threats of violence of any kind.
Whether against Jews or anyone else,
violent attacks, destroying property.
It's not peaceful protest.
It's against the law.
And we are not a lawless country.
We're a civil society.
We oppose the rule of law.
And no one should have
to hide to be brave.
Just to be themselves.
The Jewish community
didn't want you to know.
I see your fear.
You're hurting your pain.
Let me reassure you.
As you're president, you're not alone.
You belong.
You always have, and you always will.
And my commitment
to the safety of the Jewish people,
the security of Israel
and its right to exist as an independent
Jewish state is ironclad,
even when we disagree.
My administration is
working around the clock
to free remaining hostages,
just as we have freed hostages already.
And we will not rest
until we bring them all home.
My administration,
with our second generals
leadership, has launched
our nation's
first national strategy
to counter antisemitism.
That's mobilizing the full force
of the federal government
to protect Jewish community.
But what we know
is not to work for government alone
or Jews alone.
That's why I'm calling on all Americans
to stand united against antisemitism
and hate in all its forms.
My dear friend,
who became a friend of the late
Ellie Whitesell, said, quote,
one person of integrity
can make a difference.
We have to remember that
now more than ever
here in Emancipation Hall, the U.S.
Capitol.
Among the towering statue to history
is a bronze bust of role Walmart.
Born in Sweden as a Lutheran.
He was a businessman, a diplomat,
all stationed in Hungary
during World War Two.
He used diplomatic cover
to hide and rescue
about 100,000 Jews
over a six month period.
Among them was a 16 year old Jewish boy
who escaped a Nazi labor camp.
After the war ended.
A boy received a scholarship
from the Hallel Foundation
to study in America.
He came to New York City penniless,
but determined to turn his pain
into purpose.
Along with his wife,
also a Holocaust survivor,
he became a renowned
economist and foreign policy thinker,
eventually making his way
to this very capital
on the staff of a first term senator.
That Jewish refugee was Tom Lantos,
and that Senator was made.
Tom and his wife Annette
and their family became dear
friends to me and my family.
Tom would go on to become
the only Holocaust survivor
ever elected to Congress,
for became a leading voice
on civil
rights and human rights around the world.
Tom never met Raul,
who was taken prisoner by the Soviets.
Never to be heard from again,
but through Tom's efforts,
rolls Busters here in the Capitol.
He was also given honorary U.S.
citizenship, only the second person ever,
after Winston Churchill.
The Holocaust Museum here in Washington
is located in a rural road
in Ralls, named
the story of the power
of a single person.
To put aside our differences,
to see our common humanity,
to stand up to hate,
and its ancient story
of resilience from immense pain
and persecution.
To find hope,
purpose and meaning in life.
We try to live and
share with one another.
That story endures.
Let me close with this.
I know these days when members
fall on difficult times.
We all do well to remember.
These days also fall during the month.
We celebrate Jewish American heritage,
a heritage that stretches
from our earliest days
to enrich
every single part of American life.
Today,
great Americans, great Jewish American
and Tom Lantos used the phrase
the veneer of civilization is paper thin.
We are its guardians,
and we can never rest.
My fellow Americans, we must.
We must be those guardians.
We must never rest.
Must rise against hate,
meet across the divide,
share our common humanity
and God
bless the victims and survivors of Shoah
and the resilient hearts.
A courageous spirit
and eternal flame of faith
of the Jewish
people forever
shine their light on America
and around the world.
Pray God, thank you all.",20240507

military doesn't want us to see.
CNN has gained
exclusive evidence
of Palestinian prisoner abuse
from multiple Israeli whistleblowers.
At the Sede Teman facility
in southern Israel.
We joined human rights activists
amid growing
public concern
for the detainees being held inside.
This is a protest by Israeli citizens
outside a detention center close to Gaza,
where we know
hundreds of Palestinians have been held.
You can see it's a closed
military facility.
It's behind the barbed wire fence.
We're not permitted access,
and there's hostility from passers by.
We just had somebody drive past in a car
and they shouted out to us in Hebrew,
you're defending murderers.
No defending. What do you feel?
We're defending basic human rights.
And eyewitnesses are now speaking out.
Way from the
military facility
near the beaches of Tel Aviv.
One young Israeli army reservist
agreed to speak
about scores of detainees at city to man,
he says are kept in cages or pens,
constantly shackled and blindfolded,
many for weeks on end.
We've hidden his identity and voice
to shield him from prosecution.
We were told
they are not allowed to move
and must sit upright.
They're not allowed to talk
or peek under their blindfolds.
And what happened
if they if they did do that?
What kind of punishments were meted out?
We were allowed to pick out
problematic people and punish them.
Having them stand with their hands
above their heads for an unlimited time.
If they didn't keep their hands up,
we could zip tie them to the fence.
These really military says
detainees are handcuffed
based on their risk
level and health status,
but the account tallies
with photographic evidence
obtained
by CNN of Palestinian detainees inside
Sede Teman
and with hand and wrist
injuries shown
to CNN by dozens of Palestinians
released back into Gaza.
I was zip tied and blindfolded, says this
former detainee,
and tortured in a way I never imagined.
One source
telling us the restraints were so tight
that to amputate a man's hand.
The view that I've heard expressed
is that,
you know,
how do you think Israeli hostages
are treated by Hamas?
This sentiment was voiced
in the facility.
But I think that
if Hamas is so abominable,
which I agree with,
then why use Hamas as a bar?
It's a descent into dehumanization.
A descent that's accelerated
since the rampage by Hamas
on October the 7th last year.
The killing, an abduction
to Gaza of hundreds of Israelis,
provoked outrage and a brutal response
made Israel's wrath.
Tens of
thousands of Palestinians
have been killed.
And thousands detained for interrogation.
Transported to facilities like
Sede Teman
where one Israeli guard
tells CNN prisoners are routinely beaten.
We've hidden his identity and voice, too.
You can take them out and hit them
maybe 4 or 5 times with a club.
It's not done in the face
so you don't see blood.
The detainees lie belly
down, being hit and kicked,
people screaming
and dogs barking at them.
It's terrifying.
Some detainees are taken away
and beaten really hard.
So bones and teeth are broken.
So you saw people who were subject to
these beatings,
had their bones broken,
and you had their teeth broken.
Yes.
It's a practice
which commanders know about.
They want intelligence,
but they also want revenge and punishment
for what happened on October 7th.
The Israeli
military hasn't approved CNN's requests
for access to Sede Teman
the gates of the facility.
We challenged the Israeli guards.
This is a facility.
As we leave, masked soldiers approach.
in the property of, of the army.
they tried to take our cameras.
Then order us to leave.
Well, we're driving now
to meet one
Israeli with personal experience of this.
A day time and facility.
It's experience that he says
has left him
shocked at the condition
and the medical treatment
of Palestinian detainees that
he told us he treated
Palestinian detainees
with gunshot wounds
fresh from the war zone in Gaza,
but was appalled at the lack of equipment
and expertise.
The problem is Gazans who are brought in
are labeled as terrorists,
and it is very popular opinion over here
that terrorists deserve to die.
So they do not deserve
the same medical care as everyone else.
Satellite imagery obtained by CNN shows
how the Sede Teman facility
was expanded
after the October 7th attacks,
with detention facilities
and makeshift
medical bays being added
after public hospitals in Israel refused
to treat injured guards and suspects.
Eyewitness accounts describe a field
hospital with 15 to 20 patients,
virtually naked and blindfolded,
with hands and feet
shackled to their beds
and wearing diapers.
What eye witness told CNN
painful procedures were carried out
by underqualified medics.
Treatment,
the medical worker
told us, amounts to punishment.
In my view,
it's the idea of total vulnerability.
If you imagine being unable to move,
being unable to see what's going on.
That's something that borders,
if not crosses into
psychological torture.
The Israeli
military says
prisoners are stripped
for security checks,
and that investigations are opened
when there's suspicion of misconduct.
Still,
the counts
from Israelis and Palestinians inside,
and the shocking images
paint a disturbing picture.

fIYS0H7J2SQ,Protesters walk out of Jerry Seinfeld's commencement speech,data/en_CNN\Protesters walk out of Jerry Seinfeld's commencement speech.jpg,"The pro-Palestinian protests
that engulfed college campuses
have now found a new stage
the graduation stage at Duke
University Sunday.
About 30 students
walked out of the commencement
ceremony as comedian
Jerry Seinfeld was being introduced.
Seinfeld has supported Israel
throughout the war against Hamas in Gaza,
and here is some of what he
then said in his address.
I totally admire the ambitions
of your generation
to create a more just
and inclusive society.
I think it is also wonderful
that you care so much about
not hurting other people's feelings
in the million and one ways.
We all do that every second of every day.
It's lovely to want to fix those things.
That is far from
the only protests to hit college
commencement ceremonies over the weekend.
CNN's Nick Valencia joins us now.
What all happened, Nick?
Yeah. Hey.
Good morning.
Commencement season is upon us.
And these pro-Palestinian demonstrators
are choosing
to voice their opposition to the war
in Gaza in a variety of ways,
some continuing to call for a cease fire.
And over the weekend,
we saw that at commencement ceremonies
across the country. Really?
Some chanted, others held signs,
some draped themselves
in Palestinian flags
calling for their schools
to divest from Israel.
But for the most part,
these ceremonies went on
with without a hitch.
in Southern California, though,
there was a brief interruption.
According to the New York Times,
at least one person was arrested
over a skirmish outside
of Pomona College's graduation.
They had to move their graduation
30 miles away from their campus.
And, at Duke University,
we saw what happened
there in the intro, comedian Jerry
Seinfeld, who's been
a very vocal supporter of Israel
since the Hamas terrorist
attacked on October 7th.
He was protested by a few dozen
pro-Palestinian demonstrators
who chose to walk out
and have their own commencement ceremony
across the country
in California, at UC Berkeley,
the dean of students
had to take the microphone.
There was a pause in ceremony
there and listen to
what the dean of students
had to say to try to get control
again of that graduation ceremony.
Students, if
you're open to it.
I invite you to speak with me
after the event in a space
that's more appropriate.
But in the meanwhile,
I ask that you allow the program
to continue.
Okay.
Because otherwise
we're going to have to continue
to have you leave.
And that breaks my heart.
So,
the ceremony did continue.
No one was arrested.
And those demonstrators,
we understand, did leave voluntarily.
More commencement
addresses and,
graduation ceremonies are planned
across the country this week.
And we're starting to see some schools
try to get ahead
of these potential demonstrations.
We're just learning.
The University of Wisconsin Milwaukee
has reached an agreement
with proposals
Tinian demonstrators
to dismantle their encampment
by tomorrow.
In exchange,
they've agreed not to interrupt,
or not to interrupt a, graduation
ceremony in exchange,
the university will join calls
now for a cease fire in Gaza.
Kate. Nick Valencia, thank you so much,
As college commencement
ceremonies continue,
so do the protests on Sunday.
Comedian Jerry Seinfeld was interrupted
at Duke University's graduation ceremony.
In addition
to receiving an honorary degree.
Jerry is also serving as our commencement
speaker today.
About 30 students walked out
as the comedian was introduced.
You can see some students
waving the Palestinian flag.
Here's how Seinfeld responded.
And I know all of you
here are going to use
all of your brains and muscle and soul
to improve the world,
and I know you're
going to do a bang up job.
And when you're done, as I am now,
I bet the world
because of
you will be a much better place.
But it will still not make
a whole hell of a lot of sense.
And it is worth the sacrifice
of an occasional discomfort
to have some laughs.
Meanwhile,
Pomona College
in, Southern
California moved its ceremony
more than 30 miles away
to avoid the pro-Palestinian protest
on campus.
CNN's Camille Banal has the story.
Many students and parents
frustrated in this case
because they have to drive 30 miles
and change their plans
just to make sure that commencement
goes on as planned.
So instead of it being in Pomona College,
it's going to be here in L.A.
at the Shrine Auditorium.
You can see it here behind me.
There are security measures
already in place.
There is a barrier
metal barrier, and already
security guards
who are not allowed inside the auditorium
if you do not have a ticket.
The school apologizing
and saying not only that
this was an inconvenience,
but also saying that they would provide
transportation
for the students
to get here to Los Angeles.
Nonetheless, students,
are just disappointed
and say they're not happy about this
whole change.
Take a listen to what one student said.
I think it's sad.
And I think it's,
it's a really bad way
to end your college career.
And I think it's showing
exactly where Pomona is headed.
And some universities,
like Columbia and USC,
canceling altogether
this big
traditional commencement ceremony
and instead
making other plans, citing safety reasons
and wanting to avoid protest.
We saw students at Duke University
walking out, right
as the commencement
speaker was introduced.
That was Jerry Seinfeld.
he was able to give his address
as planned,
with no apparent interruptions,
and this weekend
at different universities,
we saw students at UC Berkeley chanting
and protesting and briefly pausing,
the commencement ceremony.
They then walked out of that event
and also at,
Virginia Commonwealth University,
at least a dozen students
also walking out when the governor was,
beginning to give his
commencement address.
So, again,
that's what a lot of universities
are trying to avoid
this weekend and others
who have events later on.
And of course, this is also caused
just a lot of frustration
among students who had to deal
with graduating from high school
in the middle
of a pandemic, and now again,
having to deal with commencement
under difficult circumstances
or under something
that they do not consider
a normal commencement ceremony.

6BquEw4kNNE,EXCLUSIVE: ICC prosecutor seeks arrest warrants against Sinwar and Netanyahu for war crimes,data/en_CNN\EXCLUSIVE ICC prosecutor seeks arrest warrants against Sinwar and Netanyahu for war crimes.jpg,"Prosecutor Kerim Hahn,
welcome to the program.
Thank you for having me.
And of course, we're here at the ICC.
You are today
announcing that you are applying
for arrest warrants
for top military and political leadership
in the Israel Gaza war
since the October 7th events.
First and foremost, explain to me exactly
what you're asking for and who you are
charging today.
Christiane, we've applied for warrants
to the pretrial chamber
of the International Criminal Court
in relation to three individuals
that are Hamas members,
Sinwar, who's in charge on the ground?
That's Yahya Sinwar. Absolutely.
Deif,
who's in charge of the custom Brigade.
And Haniya,
who's one of their political bureau
based in Doha.
Let me just for everybody to understand,
Yassin was the head of what they call
the Islamic Resistance
movement, Hamas,
the military operation,
or even even wider.
Mohammad Dhiab, Ibrahim
al Masri, otherwise known as Dave,
commander in chief of the Military Wings
al-Hassan Brigade,
and Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas
political bureau.
What are the charges?
The charges are extermination, murder,
taking of hostages,
rape and sexual assault in detention.
So these are the key
crimes that are alleged
to have been committed
by these two individuals.
The world was shocked
on the 7th of October
when people were ripped
from their bedrooms, from their homes,
from the different kibbutzim in Israel.
And people have suffered enormously.
And we have a variety of evidence
to support the applications
that we've submitted to the judges.
And just tell us what the evidence is.
Obviously,
the world has seen the real time images.
The Israeli government
has put out videos
which it said to the UN and others
journalists about what happened.
There are body cams on many of the Hamas
fighters, whoever was there at the time.
Is that the evidence or do you have more?
We have more.
We have
authenticated videos and photographs.
We have CCTV
camera pictures.
We have eyewitness evidence.
We have evidence of survivors.
I mean, it is remarkable
the victims and survivors
that have from Israel
that have engaged with my office
have this
righteous demand for justice
and accountability. They've come here.
I've also met them
in the different kibbutzim, and they want
justice and accountability.
So we have expert evidence.
So there's a whole variety of information
that we have authenticated
that we think is relevant and probative.
And that is sufficient,
we say, to sustain the
the crimes
that we put forward to the judges.
You have also issued warrants
against the top political
and military
leadership of the government
of the state of Israel.
We've applied for warrants.
Of course,
the judges must determine
whether or not to issue them.
But we've applied today
will apply for warrants
for Prime Minister Netanyahu
and also Minister of Defense Galant
for crimes of
causing
extermination and causing starvation
as a method of war,
including the denial
of humanitarian relief supplies,
deliberately targeting
civilians in in conflict.
And
the sad thing really is in relation
to both categories,
I have been saying repeatedly
in
Cairo in October last year at the Rafah
crossing
on Israeli television in Ramallah,
everywhere I can to the parties,
to the conflict,
complain now, don't complain later.
And of course, hostages
have not been released.
That insidious crime continues
for so many innocent Israelis
that are in custody,
you know, held hostage
by Hamas and families
that are waiting for their return.
And of course, we see pictures
of starving children,
of emaciated children.
We have a variety of evidence to support,
not polemics, but evidence
that's been forensically analyzed
to sustain the charge
also of starvation
being used by Netanyahu and Galant
as a method of war.
And it's awful that in 2024,
we have had to submit these applications
to the judges of the ICC for warrants.
I'm going to get into starvation
as a weapon of war in a moment.
But first, I want to ask you.
The word genocide
has been used by both sides
and many believe that genocide
is being committed.
But you do not
you're not using that word.
Well,
this is an active investigation
and we have a
criminal charges
that we can use genocide,
war crimes and crimes against humanity
in relation to this current stage
of investigations.
The charges
that we have put forward to the judges
do not include genocide,
but we are continuing to investigate.
It's a very complex situation.
We have not been allowed access into Gaza
by the Israeli authorities.
We are also continuing our investigations
in relation to the Hamas attacks.
And if and when the evidence points us
in a particular direction,
we will not hesitate to act.
So it's still an active investigation.
But yes, today we haven't.
What is extermination? It's mass killing.
Different than genocide.
Yes.
Genocide is defined by specific intent,
not only killing, but an intention
to destroy the group in whole
or in part to be suspiciously content,
to destroy the group in whole or in part.
So we're not
we have not
included in our application today
a request for warrants
for the crime of genocide.
So extermination, war
crimes, crimes against humanity.
I want to ask you about starvation,
because although it was accepted
by the ICC as a war crime
when you were created in 1998,
I don't believe it's ever
been prosecuted
before as a weapon of war.
No, it's not that I'm aware of.
I think, unfortunately,
this situation will be a first.
And it's very unusual.
We see a population,
large numbers of children and women
that have already endured
more than 17 years of a very rigid regime
of allowing goods into Gaza.
I think even in 2022, the United Nations
and others said
that 80% of the population,
you know,
lived on humanitarian supplies.
And that's just become
even more pernicious
since the 8th of October
with all the other restrictions.
And,
you know,
the words
of the Secretary-General
of the United Nations, of the head
of the Office
of Coordination, of Humanitarian
Humanitarian Affairs, Martin Griffiths,
W.H.O., UNICEF.
I mean, it seems everybody
in the international firmament
has spoken with grave concern.
A extreme concern,
but we haven't seen food,
water, medicines
go to the most vulnerable.
And they have those rights
not because of
something that I'm saying
it's because it's required
in the Geneva Conventions
and it's required in the Rome Statute.
So as of April 17th,
according to humanitarian organizations
and the authorities,
whatever exist on the ground in Gaza,
28 children under 12 have died,
including 12 babies
about a month old,
because of malnutrition related
conditions.
The defense minister, you
have Galland,
who today
you are issuing an arrest warrant
or the request for an arrest warrant
for said on October 9th,
two days after October 7th.
We are imposing a complete siege.
There will be no electricity,
no food, no water, no fuel.
Everything is closed.
We are fighting human animals
and we will act accordingly.
Prime Minister
Netanyahu on October
13th said We will exact a price
that will be remembered by them
and Israel's
other enemies for decades to come.
Are those is that the basis
on which you establish intent,
or is that what is that
much of your evidence?
Much more than that.
But yes,
some of the words
uttered by the two individuals,
Minister of Defense Gallant
and Prime Minister Netanyahu,
are, of course, probative and relevant.
The fact that so many other individuals
have said, you know, words like there's
no such thing
as an innocent civilian in Gaza.
They're all responsible.
The words
by members of the security committee.
I mean, there's a whole variety of words
that are said and done by the government
that have not been disowned,
that have not been
denied, that have not that
they do to individuals,
have not disassociated themselves from.
And I think that's relevant.
But it's again, it's
a very complex operation.
It's not just the denial of aid.
It's the fact that as an occupying power,
Israel has an affirmative obligation
to make sure food and the objects
indispensable to survival
get to the civilians,
have an affirmative obligation
that in control of the north of Gaza,
for example, IDF tanks are in situ.
They could guard
aid convoys going in
and making sure it goes to the camps.
They're not doing that.
But in addition, one
has to look at a wider aspect.
Water has been cut off.
Electricity
has been plants have been
either destroyed or targeted.
Fuel can't go in.
Desalination
plants are completely dysfunctional.
There's no
desalination plant in the north of Gaza
at all.
Water purification tablets,
filtration systems have been classified
as dual use
objects, as have incubators,
as has oxygen for hospital,
as have anesthetics.
One sees
90% of all the greenhouses
in the north of Gaza destroyed 40% of
the land that was used for agriculture
has been destroyed since
the conflict started.
70% of the fishing vessels,
I mean, every avenue
that is so important to human survival
has been constrained
or suffocated because of a policy.
And the words of the Secretary-General
of the United Nations,
which said we're at breaking point.
The words of UNICEF, the words of UNWRA,
saying that we've got a trickle of aid
in a sea of need, all of these, you know,
giants of the international system,
their words, that concerns
have been put to one side,
unfortunately, in the face of
other imperatives.
And what seems to be a bit also filth,
the collective punishment of the
people of Gaza.
What is the international law
on the restrictions
that you're talking about
and for instance,
the checking of aid convoys?
The Israeli government says
it is at war with a terror organization
and has worked in coordination
with the US, Egypt
and international aid agencies
to get aid in.
Netanyahu himself, on October 29th,
after two weeks of nothing getting in
another week
later said we must prevent
a humanitarian disaster.
What do you make of those words
and what is the law
on stopping and checking aid convoys?
See, we have to look at words
and analyze them against
what is taking place.
Prime Minister
Netanyahu has been on the record
to say that
the access of humanitarian aid
gives Israel important leeway
that is being used.
Have talked about a diplomatic
iron dome as part of,
you know,
allowing aid in and not allowing aid
and all the rest of it.
Israel has every right
not to give succor to Hamas.
That is not contested.
Israel has every right
and did
an obligation to get hostages back.
But you must do so
by complying with the law.
The fact that Hamas fighters need water
doesn't justify denying water
from all the civilian population of Gaza.
There is an obligation,
as I said, it's an affirmative
in addition
to everything else
is an affirmative obligation
as an occupying power
that Israel is to make sure water,
medicines, anesthetics, insulin
goes to the people that need it.
If tanks can go in, why can't those tanks
and those soldiers guard aid convoys?
So there's a lot of
deficiencies that give rise
not just to recklessness
or negligence or indifference,
but seems to be part
of a criminal common plan to deny
these objects in dispensing both
to the survival
of the civilian population.
And how many doctors
have to talk about
amputating the limbs of little babies
or children without anesthetic,
or how many people need to die
without insulin,
or how many people with severe burns
can be left
by the doctors
and the different hospitals
because they don't have
antibiotic creams for burns
and they can't save them without that
for us to realize
that the law is being breached.
Now, this is what we have analyzed
and we've presented it for judges
who make the final decision
if warrants should be issued or not.
And again, you say that you have
requested these warrants
based on a higher level of evidence
than is normally required,
not just that it is a reasonable
belief that it could lead
to actual warrants and of charge.
But you believe your evidence has what?
Well, I
when I came in as prosecutor,
the standard for a warrant
are reasonable grounds to believe
that's what the judges have to determine.
I across all our situations,
when I became prosecutor,
I required the leaders in the office,
the heads of the teams
to certify
that there is a realistic prospect
of conviction.
It's not enough in these kinds of cases
to have enough to issue a warrant.
We must be able to bring it home.
On both sides.
And in relation to both, I've determined
and the team are unanimous that we have a
realistic prospect of conviction
in relation to the three warrants
being sought regarding the Hamas leaders
and the two
that are being sought in relation to
Prime Minister Netanyahu
and Foreign Minister Galant.
And of course the judges will decide
if we've got it right
and our analysis is spot on or not.
I'm going to get to the actual
how you effect these warrants,
given the practical
things, the situation in a moment.
But first,
I want to ask you
about the so-called political nature
that many people will claim.
Prime Minister
Netanyahu has already said
ICC charges would be a scandal
on a historic scale,
an indelible stain
on the idea of justice.
Israel's commitment
to international law is unwavering.
And Netanyahu has also said
it would be an anti-Semitic hate crime.
Now, we haven't heard anything from Hamas
about how they would react.
What do you say to that?
There must have been a huge
amount of pressure on you
from all sides to do and not to do.
Well, this court,
Christiane, is a child of Nuremberg.
It was built because of
the awful pictures
that haunt us today of the Shoah
and the gas chambers
and then the Balkans.
And the list goes on.
And
we have to look at the evidence.
And the way I very simply
tried to do things is
look at the evidence,
look at the conduct, look at the victims
and airbrush out the nationality.
And if a crime has been committed,
we should move forward.
Nobody is above the law.
No people by dint of birth or passport,
religion, nationality
or the color of their skin
have a get out of jail
free card, have a free pass
to say what the law doesn't apply to us.
This is a moment
when we see in the shadow of Ukraine
a increasing cacophony of noise,
of double standards and selectivity.
And what we're trying to do
is not go with a tide of emotion,
but take our time, move
as effectively as we can,
but be guided by evidence
and every human life, every baby
that is killed,
whether it's a baby
that's cruelly abducted by Hamas
and killed or a baby
that's been
bombed or killed
or has died in incubators
because of no electricity
or water or food in Gaza
for them, for their families
and for humanity, Humanity.
It's a tragedy.
And this is why we have a court.
It's about the equal application
of the law.
No, people are better than another.
I know people anywhere
are saints.
And so we have to
apply a yardstick of legality to conduct.
We've done that,
and this is why
we've made the applications
that the judges must determine.
I'm going to read you
some heavy criticism
that you've received
from the United States.
As we know,
the United States
is not a party to the ICC, nor is Israel.
Recently,
when word came out
that this may be happening at some point,
US senators and U.S.
Congress people,
mostly Republicans, wrote you
a letter, signed by Senator
Tom Cotton, Mitch McConnell,
Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and others.
This is the quote Target Israel
and we will target you
if you move forward with the measures
indicated in the report.
We will move to end all American support
for the ICC, sanction
your employees and associates,
and bar you and your families
from the United States.
You have been warned. Is that a threat?
I think
that's
the plain meaning of it in English.
But, you know,
there's hotheads everywhere
and there's people that are mature
statesmen and stateswoman
and and leaders.
There are those that have fidelity
to something greater than themselves,
whether it's their constitutions.
But ultimately, it's the rule of law.
The good news is,
I think for the last two
and a half years,
we've had very positive engagement
with the Biden administration
in the United States.
We're working
across a range of situations,
whether it's in Ukraine or Darfur.
And I've said to
distinguished members on the Hill
and to the administration
that Rome Statute values
are quintessential American values.
It's against bullying.
It's against the untrammeled power,
against the most vulnerable.
It's the rights,
the dignity
of the individual
is the protection of babies.
I mean, these are fundamental
American values
that should engender bipartisan support.
Now, of course,
this situation, unfortunately,
lives on the San Andreas
Fault of international politics and
strategic interests.
And of
course, I've had some elected leaders
speak to me and very,
you know, be very blunt.
This court is built for Africa
and for thugs like Putin was, what one
senior leader told me.
We don't view it like that.
This court is the legacy of Nuremberg.
This court is a sad
indictment of humanity.
This court should be the triumph of law
over power and brute force.
Grab what you can,
take what you want, do what you will.
And we're going to simply be and
we're not going to be dissuaded
by threats or any other activities,
because in the end,
we have to fulfill our responsibilities
as prosecutors,
as the men and women of the office,
as judges, as registry
to something bigger than ourselves,
which is the fidelity to justice.
And we're not going to be swayed
by the different types of threats,
some of which are public
and some maybe are not.
You mentioned without names
that there are many
who have been indicted
who are not in Democratic states,
who are essentially despots.
Israel is a democracy.
They have a judiciary.
They have law enforcement.
They have elected leaders.
Why do you need to do this
when they have a system
that could do this?
I'd much rather Israel does it.
I mean, Israel, you're right. It has a
very good Supreme Court.
It has very qualified, brilliant lawyers.
But even if you read recently
public information, for example,
in The New York Times,
I think the Bergman and Mazzoli report,
if one goes back to the eighties
and look at the COP report,
a deputy attorney general of Israel,
who said that Israel was unwilling
or unable to investigate crimes
in the occupied territories,
if one looks at the Sassoon report,
if one looks at General,
you have a three star general
that was in Washington, DC between
2019 and 2021
who said there's no accountability.
The simple truth is that
for all the application of the law
in the territory of Israel,
unfortunately it doesn't appear
to be
applied with vigor
or sincerity
in the occupied territories or in Gaza.
And this is why we have to move forward.
Of course, if Israel disagrees,
if they think they are investigating
the same individuals and the same conduct
and the policies that underpinned them,
they are free.
Notwithstanding their objections
to jurisdiction
to raise a challenge
before the judges of the court.
And that's what I advise them to do. But
the simple
truth of the matter
is the disregard of the law
in this situation and the policies
and the utterances
that are coming from the Prime minister,
the minister of defense
support
and corroborate the other evidence
we have from a variety of sources.
I just want to fill in for our viewers.
You mentioned in big New York Times
magazine report this weekend
by Ronen Bergman and Mark Mazzetti,
an eight year effort.
It was titled Unpunished.
And as you say,
it is about the failure
of the Israeli system.
Police, legal and military,
to punish settlers on the occupied West
Bank as they punish
Arab Palestinians on the West Bank.
Now,
you talk about the state of Palestine,
and therefore you have jurisdiction
over things that happen
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
There are those who disagree with you.
Clearly, Israel disagrees.
The United States disagrees.
They point out that as yet,
there is no official state of Palestine
recognized by the Security Council.
What is your jurisdiction there?
Well, it's a jurisdiction
that's detailed in the statute,
and that has been decided by majority
by the pretrial chamber.
Leaving aside the
for the moment,
the fact that 141 countries
have recognized Palestine as a state.
In the General.
Assembly, in the General Assembly,
124 states
that make up the Assembly
of State parties
agreed for Palestine to be accepted as a
state party to the Rome Statute.
And so by dint of that,
clearly we have jurisdiction.
The Geneva Conventions
also make it clear that it applies
to high contracting parties.
Israel is a high contracting
party, as is Palestine.
What does that mean?
It means that they have both committed
to comply with the provisions
of the Geneva Conventions.
That includes
the prohibition on starvation
as a method of war.
That includes the prohibition
on taking hostages
or willfully killing or extermination.
I mean, these come from the Rome Statute,
but originally they found form
in the Geneva Conventions.
So we apply the law.
There's been judicial pronouncements
by the
the ICC,
and we have to be guided by those.
The Hamas leaders
who have sought arrest warrants for.
Do you have any hope
that anybody will move against them?
Do you have any hope of
ever getting to them again?
The ICC does not have a police force.
You cannot go and apprehend.
As far as we know,
at least two of them are underground,
potentially in tunnels in Gaza.
And Ismail
Haniya
appears to be
the leader
involved in the political
negotiations, indirect between Israel
and Hamas
with the U.S., Qatar,
other nations mediating.
How do you expect to go after them?
Who do you think is
going to hand them over?
Well, the first thing is
the judge has to rule on the applications
until the judges rule on the application.
All it is is an application
that doesn't have legal effect.
But then states
have such responsibilities
and individuals have choices.
If individuals say that what their
what is alleged is not made out,
it's bunkum.
It's nonsense.
Put your case
before the independent
judges of the court.
This court has had acquittals.
This court has not confirmed cases.
The record shows
that it's a forensic laboratory
in which the evidence
determines
whether or not people are convicted,
cases are confirmed
or cases of kicked out.
That applies to Hamas leaders
if they want.
And if not,
we have to see
what are the other opportunities,
if they're either in Palestine,
which is a state party,
or if they're in Qatar,
which is a non-state party,
but in a way
that's getting ahead of ourselves.
Today,
the announcement is the application
and the judges have to be given the time
to independently
and dispassionately assess
what we've given. Nothing is a given.
They have to assess it
and make a determination
whether or not to issue warrants. But
I also
want to underline the fact that
you mentioned in an earlier question
the allegations of anti-Semitism,
the the hate, the idea that
by applying the law blindly,
we are favoring one side or persecuting
or being hostile to another side,
and nothing can be further
from the truth.
We have so many people of distinction
that are respected
and they independently came in.
I brought them in,
they sat in the evidence review.
And this is not a witch hunt.
This is not some kind
of emotional reaction to noise.
We've been criticized for going
too slowly, criticized
for going too fast.
It's a forensic process
that is expected of us
as international prosecutors,
as an independent court,
to build evidence that is solid,
that will not dissolve in the courtroom.
And that's what we've done
today, is the fulfillment of that
first stage.
This first round of applications
in which we say
we have done our job,
we now give it to the judges
to scrutinize.
So it's not against any people
and it's not against or for any interest.
It's simply
because if we don't
apply the law equally,
we're going to disintegrate as a species.
Of course,
what's happening in the West Bank is
extremely worrying.
It's an issue
also that we are investigating.
But there's a certain
in democracies,
political choices
tend to be determinative.
And all I can say is that Israel,
the leaders, the country, has a choice
that they can engage
and do what is necessary
to meet complementarity.
And the United Kingdom
in the Iraq investigations,
before I was appointed prosecutor,
it was found that there were deficiencies
in the legal system for military justice.
But we have really sincerely looked
at things with a broad horizon,
looking at incriminating
and exonerating evidence equally
looking at evidence,
authenticating the evidence,
and realizing that we're not worth
the job, the title as being a prosecutor
or being lawyers
or having an international
criminal court.
If we are dissuaded because of extraneous
interests from moving forward.
Because end of the day,
I go back to this basic
premise a child in
Myanmar that's
persecuted or a child in Israel
that is an orphan
or that has been taken and killed
or one in Ukraine for their family,
there's no difference.
The universe has been torn to shreds
and this is
the need for the court
and independent judges to scrutinize,
not look at the politics,
not look at a
dysfunctional Security Council,
not look at the difficulties it may cause
a regional organizer, nations
or different groupings,
but simply say, is the evidence reliable?
And if so,
we go back to King John
that the king is under no man
but God under the law.
We all must be subject to that.
Otherwise,
what is this
international rules based system?
What is the principles
of public international law
that so many men and women
have given their lives
for since the Second World
War particularly?
And I think it's a dishonor for them.
It's a dishonor
for the victims of the gas chambers.
If we airbrush out inconvenient truth
and we have to try our best
to achieve justice
for the victims of the 7th of October,
we also must try our best to do justice
for so many innocent people
that are suffering as we speak
in Israel and also in in Gaza,
as well as in other parts of Palestine.
Prosecutor Kerem Hahn, thank
you very much indeed for joining us.
Thank you so much.",20240520
qTvFuNNVwnA,Bolton says ICC actions show it’s not ‘tethered to rule of law itself’,data/en_CNN\Bolton says ICC actions show it’s not ‘tethered to rule of law itself’.jpg,"Tonight, President
Biden is
openly rebuking
the International Criminal Court
prosecutor
for seeking an arrest
warrant against both Hamas's
and the leader in the Israeli
Prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,
for what they say are war crimes.
Let me be clear.
We reject the ICC application
for arrest warrants against Israeli,
whatever these warrants may imply.
There is no equivalence
between Israel and Hamas.
Contrary to allegations
against Israel made
by the International Court of Justice,
what's happening is not genocide.
We reject that.
That is a notable comment
from President Biden
there, flatly
rejecting accusations
that there's a genocide underway in Gaza.
I should note those accusations
which have been made
in the International Court of Justice
are separate
from today's actions
in the International Criminal Court,
which seeks to hold individual Hamas
and Israeli leaders both accountable.
The ICC chief prosecutor, Karim Khan,
convened a group of legal experts
that also included
the human rights attorney, Amal Clooney,
to advise on these warrants.
He defended this in
an exclusive interview
with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
Nobody is above the law.
No people, by dint of birth or passport,
religion, nationality
or the color of their skin,
how they get out of jail
free card,
have a free pass to say
what the law doesn't apply to us.
Every human life, every baby
that is killed,
whether it's a baby
that's cruelly abducted by Hamas
and killed or a baby
that's been
bombed or killed
or has died in incubators
because of no electricity
or water or food in Gaza
for them, for their families
and for humanity, humanity.
It's a tragedy.
And this is why we have a court.
It's about the equal application
of the law.
Here tonight to discuss,
John Bolton,
the former national security adviser
under former President Donald Trump,
also the former U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations.
Ambassador Bolton, first.
Let me get your reaction to what we heard
from President Biden.
He had a pretty blunt rebuke
of what
we just heard there from the chief
prosecutor at the ICC.
And this idea that they are going
to seek these warrants
for both the leaders of Hamas,
but also the Israeli prime minister
and the defense minister.
Well, Biden is half right.
What's really illegitimate
here is the International
Criminal Court itself.
It's a fantasy.
It's a piece of government,
not a whole government,
a piece of government
floating around
in the international ether,
unchecked by executive
or legislative power,
utterly unable to enforce its judgments
and acting in a way that's
predictably irresponsible.
For many years,
people have referred to Israel
as the canary in the coal mine
on behalf of the United States.
This is another example,
because what
this rogue prosecutor,
this utterly unaccountable court
is doing here against Israel,
they're going to do against us
soon enough. Well, so what do you mean?
That the President Biden is half right.
He was he's
basically agreeing with you
that both of you agree
this is it's
wrong to say that you're going to go
after the leaders of Hamas
and also the Israeli leaders
and kind of create this equivalence
between the two of them.
No, I'm
saying it's wrong to go after
and this court is not the body
to prosecute anybody.
The court has also
indicted Vladimir Putin
in connection with Russia's
invasion of Ukraine.
That's the wrong way to do it, too.
You can't the
the the charge of moral equivalence
gives legitimacy to the court.
In effect,
if they indict really bad
guys, they're in favor of it.
And the fact is, it's the court itself
that's fundamentally flawed.
The example is right here in this case,
this unaccountable prosecutor
is interfering right
in the middle of
active conflict
now in a real government with real power.
In our case,
the president has both the war power
and the prosecution power
and sometimes has to make a trade off.
This utterly unaccountable prosecutor
didn't make any trade off at all.
And I think people should ask,
does this now make settling the conflict
in the Middle East easier or harder?
It won't matter to the prosecutor
because he'll never be held
responsible for it.
Yeah, and obviously,
you mentioned Putin there
and he's not really traveling a lot
maybe to China or something, but.
But what does this move mean
if they do get the judges
to sign off all these warrants?
And we don't know that they will.
But but if they do and they're executed,
what does that mean
for Israel's
allies who are parties to this court
and they're technically supposed to
to arrest them
if they travel and they
have an ICC warrant?
Well, it should be a wake up call to them
that they've stepped
into a very dangerous territory here.
And I think this is
the sort of thing
that that US
officials need to worry
about in particular.
You know, the one silver
lining in this cloud,
when you look at the self-righteous,
grandstanding, publicity
seeking prosecutor there,
I think this is the ICC digging its grave
in this country.
I think I would be happy to predict
right here.
I don't think
the US is going to join the ICC
within within the life span of anybody
watching this program
because the targets of this prosecutor
are fundamentally irrational
to proceed against a free, law
abiding democratic society
in the way that it did.
Shows it's
not tethered to a rule of law itself.
But, Ambassador, when you look at this,
there is growing criticism
of how Israel has conducted this war.
I mean, do you believe that
Israel has upheld
international law since October 7th?
I haven't heard
legitimate charges that it hasn't.
And I think there's been a lot of hype
propaganda.
One very important point,
just to prove that
there's a lot of United Nations,
the United Nations, the Palestinians.
Well, okay, let's let's talk
let's talk about that.
The United Nations just cut in half
the number of women and children
it reports killed in the Gaza conflict.
Now, this is the United Nations
accepting now the figures of the Hamas
ministry of Health
as opposed to the Hamas
information office.
But the fact is
the total number of casualties
and the number, particularly of women
and children killed
has been out of whack.
The U.N.
by its shift concedes
that numbers that have been used
on women
and children have been double what what,
what even another part of Hamas says
and I think this is a media problem, too,
if I may say so,
you know, these numbers have come from
Hamas entities
right from the start of this.
And normally what media outlets do
when they're given a fact like that,
they think it's important
enough to report that's fine.
They then go on to say,
we have not been able to verify
this independently.
Well, Ambassador,
were any media outlets in the country
because that is verified those numbers.
We have been deeply
skeptical of the numbers because we
they don't let free
and independent journalists go.
And CNN is tried on multiple occasions.
But while
even if you are skeptical of that
figure, as we've seen, even
President Biden expressed skepticism,
we do know that a lot of women
and children and Palestinian civilians
have been killed.
Have they been colluding with Hamas?
Do you have any information on that?
Palestinian babies?
Can women collude with Hamas?
Can women collude with Hamas
little children
that we're seeing, Ambassador,
who were in hospital
early 16 or 16 inside this
on this 16, 17 year old,
four years old.
All right.
Let's let's take that fun.
Let's let's take that.
The question
in conflict in urban conflict,
which the United States itself
has faced as recently
as Iraq with Fallujah and Mosul,
is is Israel targeting
legitimate military targets A and B,
has it taken into account
the proportional collateral effects
if it goes after those targets?
There's no prohibition
about civilian casualties,
otherwise you wouldn't
have urban conflict.
And the studies
that were done of American action
in Fallujah and Mosul
and other places in
Iraq and Afghanistan
have shown ratios of civilian
to military casualties
in the range of 5 to 1 in Gaza
by Hamas's own statistics.
The range is 2 to 1.
So I just think it's important
to understand that when Hamas
cynically barbaric
uses its own population as human shields,
the morally culpable party here is Hamas,
and no one is defending Hamas.
It's a good conversation to have.
Ambassador John Bolton,
thank you for your time tonight.
Glad to do it.",20240521
dsnvUjPrC3g,"At least 45 dead as Israel strikes Rafah, Gazan officials say","data/en_CNN\At least 45 dead as Israel strikes Rafah, Gazan officials say.jpg","Israel has struck a displacement camp
where civilians were sheltering,
killing at least 45 people in Rafah
in southern Gaza.
That is according
to the Gaza Health Ministry.
We must warn you
that you are about to see in
this segment is going
to be very difficult to watch
out.
For.
All these are
the scenes overnight of the camp in Rafah
set ablaze Israeli military claim
to CNN Hamas
officials were killed in the strike
with what they called precise munitions.
Local officials
say most of the casualties
were women and children.
Now you can see the location of the camp
on this map,
and it's a reminder
that over a million
people have been sheltering in Rafah
as the war
forced people further south,
though many have fled yet again
as Israel
ramps up the operations in that area.
The strike came just two days
after the International Court of Justice
ordered Israel
to halt its offensive in Rafah.
On Sunday, Hamas fired
rockets at Tel Aviv,
the first attack of its kind into Israel
since January.
CNN's Not Bashir
Following developments for us,
he's standing by in London,
but a distressing video out of Rafah.
A lot of that video
we actually cannot share
because it is so disturbing.
Help us understand the
impacts of this strike.
Well, a colony,
as you
mentioned, many of those
who were sheltering in this
Talal Sultan neighborhood
in Rafah have been displaced.
Time and time again,
they have been pushed south
into the southern city of Rafah
by the Israeli military, told
that this would be a safe zone.
And in fact, over the last month,
we have been hearing warnings
from the IDF
telling civilians now
to evacuate parts of Rafah
to Gaza's coastal area for their safety
and protection,
ahead of a looming
full scale ground operation.
This was not one of those areas.
This was not an area
that received an evacuation order.
This was supposed to be a safe zone
for civilians.
Clearly, that is not the case.
And seen this incident overnight.
Airstrikes targeting an area
that is densely
populated by civilians filled with tents,
makeshift tents sheltering civilians.
And we have seen
graphic, disturbing, horrifying video
emerging from the scene last night.
Tents completely engulfed in flames,
charred bodies
being pulled from the burning
shelters,
including the bodies of children.
Now, as we have heard
from the
health authorities in Gaza,
the majority of those casualties
were women and children.
More than 240 people have
so far said to have been badly wounded
and injured.
We've heard from health authorities
saying they simply do not have
the capacity
in the remaining hospitals in the area
to care for that number of casualties.
So this is an overall
disastrous situation
for many of those civilians
in the southern city of Rafah.
Huge amount of concern.
Of course,
we've been hearing widespread
condemnation and warnings
against further military action in Rafah.
Clearly,
those warnings have not been heeded. So,
yeah, and
you know
what is, of course, you know,
getting a lot of attention as well.
Is this
just a few days after the ICJ ruling
for Israel to halt operations in Rafah?
We have seen some reaction, firstly,
to whether Israel
is going to be adhering to that ruling
and of course,
the criticism of the way that Israel
is conducting this operation in Rafah.
What more do we know?
Yeah, absolutely.
We've been hearing fierce criticism,
of course, from European leaders.
We heard earlier this morning
from the EU's foreign affairs chief,
Josep Borrell,
saying that Israel
must adhere to the ICJ ruling that
it must immediately halt
military operations in Rafah.
We've heard from the German
foreign minister
saying earlier today
that the international Court
of Justice order
for Israel
to halt its military operation
in the southern Gaza City is binding
and has to be followed.
And in fact, President Macron.
France has also issued a statement.
He said that he was outraged
by last night's attack on Rafah,
that these operations must stop.
There are no safe areas in there
for Palestinian civilians.
I call for full respect
for international law
and for an immediate ceasefire.
And of course,
there is huge amount of concern
around the potential
for further military action in Rafah.
We've had previously from one of Israel's
closest allies, the Biden administration,
President Biden himself
speaking to CNN, saying
that if Israel were
to fully go into Rafah, than the U.S.
would not be able to support
in the form of arms
and weapons, that
that would not be the case.
It remains to be seen
whether this latest incident is in fact,
a red line for President Biden.
This has certainly drawn
outrage amongst many
in the international community,
particularly, of course,
from the United Nations,
which has repeated,
he warned, against a full operation
in Rafah
and continued airstrikes in Rafah.
This is an area that is densely populated
still with civilians, the vast
majority internally displaced.
And of course, there is simply nowhere
safe left for civilians to turn.
And of course,
there are questions around
how this will impact ongoing
ceasefire negotiations.
That is another point of concern.
We heard today
from Qatar officials
saying that they are worried
that this could hinder
the ongoing discussions
around a potential truce
between Israel and Hamas. Only
that.
Nada.
Bashir, thank you
so much for that update.
Well, the Palestinian Authority
is calling on the United States
to put more pressure
on Israel to stop the violence
and said the US bears responsibility
for these crimes that shames humanity.
We have not heard from the Biden
administration yet
regarding the attack on the refugee camp.
Just a few weeks ago,
the US
president seemed to put forward
a red line
when it came to targeting
civilians in Rafah.
If I go into Rafah,
I'm not supplying the weapons
that have been used historically to deal
with a deal with the cities,
a deal with that problem.
We're going to continue
to make sure
Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome
and their ability
to respond to attacks
that came out of
the and Middle East recently.
But it's it's just wrong.
We're not going to
we're not going to supply the weapons
and artillery shells used.
Well, we are closely
following the response
from the Americans,
and we will bring it to
you when we get us.",20240527

9h8FeGqPO7w,"The situation is absolutely ‘apocalyptic,’ says surgeon on his recent trip to Gaza","data/en_CNN\The situation is absolutely ‘apocalyptic,’ says surgeon on his recent trip to Gaza.jpg","British surgeon doctor Nick
Maynard is just back from Gaza,
where he saw the collapsing health
care system with his own eyes.
He left Rafah
just before Israel's offensive began,
and he's joining me here
now in the studio.
Doctor Maynard, welcome to the program.
Thank you very much for asking me.
I'm you left and I'm just going to
read what you said
because you left
just as the Israeli incursion began.
You told Reuters that you heard bombs
and gunfire all over
driving through Rafah.
The tension was palpable with people
evacuating as rapidly as they could.
You saw some of that attempt
to evacuate in Jeremy's package.
There.
What did you see?
And what is the status of people
who just want to get out of the way?
So they issued
the initial evacuation orders
about two hours
before we left for the crossing,
and we saw hundreds of people
rushing out of their
I was going to say houses.
They're not houses.
Of course,
these people have been displaced
many times.
So they were leaving their very temporary
shelters, their
makeshift tents, their tarps in shelters,
gathering their belongings
together, going in cars,
some of them walking,
some of them going on a cart
with donkeys and rushing out. And it was
very distressing to see them
leaving so urgently
because that this for some of them,
this is the fifth, sixth or seventh time
they've done that in the last six months.
You were leaving as well.
What was it like for you? Is it?
I mean,
did you get you obviously out safely,
but was it
dangerous as you were trying to get out?
So we
we didn't
think we were going to get that.
We were initially turned away.
So we went back to the temple.
What we were advised to leave.
So there was ongoing
discussions between
the the medical aid,
the Palestinian ground staff
and CogAT, the liaison part of the IDF.
And so they initially decided
for security reasons,
we should go back to the house.
But then we left again late morning,
got to the crossing
as the bombings were intensifying.
So we were surrounded by bombs
going off really virtually nonstop.
And there was very difficult decisions
to be made
about whether we should carry on with our
planned departure
or whether we should turn around,
because it was getting too dangerous.
But we did stay
and we managed to get out.
you were
warned in March, actually,
before the Rafah operation
started, certainly before,
you know that
if a ground invasion happened,
a ground incursion of some sort,
it would be apocalyptic.
And Gaza's health ministry
said in a statement
now, particularly after the Sunday
attack, there is no hospital in Rafah
with enough capacity
to take this number
of killed and injured,
causing confusion amongst
ambulance teams
on where to transfer them.
Give us a layout of what
hospitals remain,
what don't anywhere near by these places
that are, you know, under IDF attack.
So? So Rafah is a small town.
It has a population of 1
to 200,000 people,
normally as
it has two hospitals, one government
hospital, another hospital
which normally has a capacity
of about 60 beds,
and a small hospital
called the Shetty Hospital,
which has been in the news
a lot in the last few days,
which has a capacity
normally of 15 one five beds.
So they have very limited beds.
They've got a bigger hospital
between Rafah and Hand, Unesco,
the European Gaza Hospital,
which I've worked
in a lot over the years,
which is surrounded
by the Israeli ground forces,
as very difficult
for patients to get that.
So effectively,
there are no hospitals for these patients
to go to.
There are some field
hospitals have been set up,
but the number of acute beds
available to take these patients is very,
very few.
And have you been in touch
with any colleagues
in the medical profession
or anybody in Rafah
since you've left,
particularly in the last few days? Yeah.
I mean,
I spoke yesterday
to a dear friend of mine
who's an operating theater nurse
who almost to the day a year ago,
I was operating within the theaters
in European Gaza Hospital.
She stayed in Rafah.
She and her husband are living there.
They don't want to leave.
And she said to me yesterday
she would rather die,
and she expects to die in her home.
And she's not going to leave.
I haven't been able to
get hold of her today
and she hasn't answered any message,
so I don't know what's happened to her.
Half a family has been killed
in the last few months.
I've got a close friend
who's a doctor who's out there,
and I've been speaking to them regularly.
But the the the words we used a few weeks
ago of this being apocalyptic,
it absolutely is.
There are many people being killed.
There are those that have been evacuated,
have been forced to go to Al Malaki,
which is an area I know well.
There are already hundreds
of thousands of people there.
They've had to accommodate
nearly a million extra people.
And there is nothing.
There almost is a thin stretch of sand
and wasteland divided by a
road with no facilities at all.
So the idea that you can accommodate it
in any sort of safe way, another million
people, is, is fanciful.
You're a doctor, you're a surgeon,
and you've worked in Gaza for
for some ten years.
You've been going back and forth
through other wars, presumably.
I want to ask you this
because you saw
in Jeremy
Diamond's report
that they saw the weapons,
they were described as slightly less,
huge and powerful,
perhaps to try to mitigate
civilian damage.
These are American made weapons.
but from a doctor's
point of view, particularly as he said,
Jeremy, in a in a densely populated zone,
a light weapon, a light bomb,
a heavy bomb is going to create
a huge amount of civilian destruction.
What would you
what can you say about the weapons
that are used to
Gaza has got a population of 2.2 million.
It is the most densely
populated place in the world.
I was there last May operating.
I'm a cancer surgeon.
I was operating on cancer patients,
part of the Map program,
and it was the last big bombardment
before October the 7th beginning of May.
And I was stuck there.
They closed the borders
and we had to be evacuated eventually.
But I witnessed for four days
this nonstop bombardment,
and it was an incredible demonstration
of how precise
the bombing can be
when the Israeli Defense Force
want to do that.
They were targeting
specific rooms
and building specific floors,
and there was collateral damage
but minimal collateral damage
at that time.
So I've witnessed
firsthand how precise their targeting
can be.
Move forward to post October the 7th.
I was there over Christmas and New Year,
and I witnessed
I watched
the indiscriminate bombing
of large
populations in the surrounding camps
in Daryl Balad,
where I was staying for two weeks.
So I've witnessed two extremes.
I've seen how precision,
how precise their targeting can be,
and I've seen
how indiscriminate it's going to be.
And there's no doubt in my mind
that what we've seen since October
the 7th is indiscriminate
killing of large populations, civilian
large populations.
You know, they deny that every time.
And they say over and over again
that we are doing our best
to minimize civilian.
And they say, what do you expect if
the Hamas terrorist
organization, as they say
they're fighting,
is using human shields,
is using Gazans to
to shield themselves
from any kind of retaliation or action?
What do you say about that?
Well, I've I've not witnessed that.
I think if it's difficult for me
to understand
how anyone can claim that
killing 35 civilians is a proportionate
response to, to, to to events earlier,
but you mean 35,000 35,000 people?
I've not witnessed
what they've describing.
And perhaps more importantly than that,
my friends and colleagues
who I have spoken to daily
since October
the 7th, have lived out there
with them for several weeks
and then do not
provide any evidence to support that.
They would say that they're there.
They live in these,
whatever the underground
or in buildings or whatever.
That's what they would say.
But it's interesting
what you said about witnessing
very targeted
and witnessing something
that's much less targeted.
I want to ask you specific
specifically in your,
you know, your your domain
about the health, system.
I mean, I can just read you
and you'll tell me much more.
I mean, Kamel at one hospital, you know,
dozens of medical staff
is taken to an undisclosed location.
Location? That was in December last year.
The IDF says takes
all feasible precautions
to mitigate harm, etc..
Nasser Hospital, February of this year.
70 health care workers
in the medical complex arrested
by Israeli forces,
80 patients transferred out.
They said they had apprehended
hundreds of Hamas militants.
Al-Shifa hospital.
We know what's happened.
There is completely, a ruin.
They said they were going after
Hamas targets underneath and tunnels.
did you ever come across
anything suspicious?
Did you ever ask any of your
actually the directors of the hospitals,
the people who would be there
when you're not there,
whether there was any threat from,
you know, a militant group
using their premises?
I did,
and I can only really vouch
for what I have witnessed.
And what close friends and colleagues
have said.
I've been in these hospitals
on many occasions,
before October the 7th, but also since
then I have never witnessed.
I've never seen any evidence of Hamas
militants in these hospitals.
And my close friends and colleagues,
some of whom I've known
for nearly 15 years,
I've asked them repeatedly,
and they've never witnessed any of this.
Now, clearly,
I cannot
provide any evidence of what goes on in
any tunnels underneath.
I've never seen them.
But if you take Shifa Hospital
as an example, which I know very well, I.
I've been to every square
inch that hospital.
I've never seen
any restricted access at all
to any parts of the hospitals.
So I've seen no evidence
of what they describe.",20240530

16 health care workers
finally evacuating the Gaza
European Hospital,
a journey many outside Gaza haven't seen
and most inside are unable to make.
Among them Doctor Adam Hamhuis, a U.S.
combat surgeon and humanitarian,
first responder.
He recently chose to stay behind
when an initial evacuation
was only offered to U.S.
citizens.
This is the first wave.
Another one usually starts around 2 a.m..
These are the conditions
Hamoudi and his colleagues worked under.
They just wait
until everyone really falls asleep
and then they try to wake you up again.
He wrote a letter to President Biden
saying he had never witnessed, quote,
the level of atrocities
and targeting of medical colleagues
as he had in Gaza,
urging the president
to allow a humanitarian corridor
to be established
and for his colleagues and himself
to be allowed to evacuate.
Days later, the team were on their way.
Our farewell was marked
with many tears on both sides.
We gave them everything we had, like
we left really with the the,
the clothes we were wearing
and in a small backpack.
But even then they were giving us
little gifts to remember them by.
And and, with promises that now
we will come back
and we will continue to help them
and and, we won't forget.
You do want to go back, right?
All of us want to go back.
There are people who are not able
to leave like
the Palestinians themselves.
And we can't forget them.
The local level.
And while getting permission
was one thing,
making the treacherous
journey was another.
It was very dystopian.

by phone, with very choppy, service.

It was.
There was nothing left standing.
the the unusual part
which was really like I said, it was like
out of a science fiction movie.
You know, once you left the gate
and when we were driving to Israel,
was that that crossing,
it was a completely another world.
It was I went from what I just described
to driving through California.
It was like that place didn't exist.",20240531
l-RBT5KE_Z4,Video shows helicopter rescue of Israeli hostages,data/en_CNN\Video shows helicopter rescue of Israeli hostages.jpg,"your.
&gt;&gt; On CNN newsroom. Hi,
everyone. I am Jessica Dean in
New York and we begin with
breaking news out of the middle
East as Israel welcomes home
four hostages rescued this
morning from gaza during a
special military operation all
for kidnapped by hamas from the
nova music festival during the
a6 October 7 attacks, eight
months so go and they include
22-year-old almog meir, John,
25-year-old Noa argamani, 20.
Andre kozlov, 41-year-old,
shlomi Ziv andrii in shlomi
were working as security guards
at the music festival and you
may remember Noa argamani from
this horrific video from the
October 7 attacks we also heard
screaming as hamas fighters
drove away with her on a
motorbike we know her boyfriend
was also kidnapped and it's
still being held captive.
Israel says this morning's
rescue mission took place it to
separate locations in central
gaza and your refugee camp
Palestinians, they're described
the raid as hell on Earth is
heavy shelling and artillery
fire bombarded that area.
&gt;&gt; Officials in gaza say at
least 210 people have been
killed more than 400 injured,
including women in children.
&gt;&gt; But CNN cannot independently
verify those numbers. We are
covering these breaking
developments from all angles.
Been wheat a man has more on
the casualties inside gaza, but
first we start with Paula
hancocks and tel aviv, who has
more details on the surprise
rescue mission that brought
these four hostages home.
Apala, how are these hostages
doing well, Jessica, what we've
been told from the doctor at
the medical center, they were
all taken two once they were
rescued, is that they are all
stable.
&gt;&gt; They are in good medical
condition than just outside
that hospital. We have seen all
day friends and family coming
to welcome home. There loved
ones that have been in
captivity for the past eight
months. Now, many of them have
thanked the military for the
mission they have thank those
that a part of this rescue
operation, but they have also
said that there are 120 more
hostages that needs to be
rescued. Now, we did hear from
the mother of one of the
hostages and almog, meir, Jan
and let's listen to what she
said thank you.
&gt;&gt; So bringing my son to me to
ask I'm so excited hugging
today.
&gt;&gt; I couldn't stop hugging
him. I couldn't stop and
tomorrow is my birthday. I got
my presence now, she also said
that they want a ceasefire deal
to make sure the rest of the
hostages can be released.
&gt;&gt; It's something we've heard
here tonight in tel aviv where
the week plea protest that has
been held, we heard from the
one of the women speaking her
cousinone of those who has
died in captivity. The body
still being held by hamas,
saying, not everything will
have a holiday he would ending.
So there's a real push at the
same time as celebrating the
rescue of these four hostages.
A push for a ceasefire and
hostage deal. Jessica and Paul,
what more are you learning
about the rescue? Mission
itself? This was high-stake
stuff. How did it come together
what we're hearing from the
idf Sayyed is that the
military, the acuity agency,
the police, had a joint
operation.
&gt;&gt; They had been planning this
for weeks. They say it was
based on intelligence and it
was just on Thursday night the
Israeli prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu gave the green light
to go ahead with this mission.
They said they effectively
built to apartment blocks. They
knew that these civilians
excuse me, hostages were being
held in civilian multi-story
buildings and they built block
so that they could train in how
to try and extract them from
that area. Now they have
pointed out it wasn't a
civilian area and that many of
the other hostages would not be
held in a similar situation
they don't believe that this
could be necessarily replicated
after this Jessica, I Apollo
handcuffs for us.
&gt;&gt; Live in tel aviv. Thank you
very much. Let's turn now to
the impact in gaza. Were
Palestinians are describing
that special operation as hell
on Earth. And I do want to warn
you some of the video we're
about to show you is graphing
locals, telling CNN this about
the aftermath of the attack,
quote, there are children torn
apart and scattered in the
streets. We turn now to been
Wiedemann for more on the
impact inside gaza and Ben
hamas officials say they are
more than 200 people dead,
hundreds more injured. We were
just looking at some of that
video. What more do we know
this is without a doubt, one of
the bloodiest is rarely
assaults in this war.
&gt;&gt; So far no doctors at the
aqsa martyrs hospital indebted
Bella say that the death toll
at the moment stands at least
at 400 Jordan ten, with more
than 400 injured, no CNN has a
camera man who got into that
hospital and the scenes are
utter pen ammonium. Women,
children, wounded, dead all
over this hospital. The morgue
is full. The debtor on the
ground side. There are many
relatives there trying to get
treatment for their wounded
loved ones. Others are weeping
and brain over the dead. Now,
this assault took place
mid-morning just before noon,
actually. And at a time when
many people are out and about,
there's the market in the
nuseirat camp where this
happened. Lots of people were
in the street. And what we've
seen video coming out of that
place is that he Israelis used
a lot of heavy firepower in
that area where there were many
civilians walking around so
certain this is a success for
the Israelis, but for the
Palestinians, it comes at a
very high price and it's worth
mentioning that the Israelis
and military operations going
back to October have managed at
this point to free seven
hostages. However, 105 hostile
judges were released during a
ceasefire back in late
November, in which at one
Israeli hostages were freed as
well as 20 for foreign
nationals. It's clear that
after eight months of war in a
death toll of over 36,000 in
gaza. That the best way to get
people out, the hostages free
is not through dramatic
military action, but it's
through ceasefire Jessica and
then secretary St. Anthony
blinken is traveling to the
Middle East to push for a
ceasefire deal between Israel
and hamas what is the word at
this point on how this
potential, how this rescue
mission may potentially impact
those discussions well, we've
seen a statement from spokesman
for hamas indicating that this
might make things more
difficult, but they're already,
it seems that even though
president Biden came out onto
30 of may, come meet with a
three-point proposal to try to
end this one for both sides
have been ambiguous.
&gt;&gt; The Israelis have indicated
sort of a willingness to go
along with it. But prime
minister Netanyahu has made it
clear that his the ultimate
goal is the destruction of
hamas. Hamas wants Israel to
agree to a complete and
permanent ceasefire, so they
still seem to be well, a apart.
The gap is wide between the two
sides. Now, we know that
William burns, the head of the
CIA was in Qatar, and Brett
Mcgurk, the mideast coordinator
for the white house, was in
Cairo. So the efforts are being
made, but they don't seem to be",20240608

Ur7pc-OqXXM,Israeli minister Benny Gantz resigns from Netanyahu's war cabinet,data/en_CNN\Israeli minister Benny Gantz resigns from Netanyahu's war cabinet.jpg,"We start with breaking news
out of the Middle East.
A short time ago,
Benny
Gantz, a key
minister of the Israeli war cabinet,
announced that he is quitting
the emergency government.
We leave the government,
the emergency government
with a heavy heart,
but your complete heart.
We stand again
for the campaign for Israel,
for General issues
in order to get real victory.
So we are going to go
for elections carefully
and at the end of it will have
a government
that will have the
confidence of the people.
GANTZ His resignation
marks a pivotal moment
in Israel's war against Hamas
and a major blow to Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
who was facing mounting pressure
to end the conflict in Gaza.
His departure comes
just a day after Netanyahu
failed to meet Gantz's
ultimatum,
which was calling for a postwar
plan in Gaza. By June eight,
Gantz delayed his announcement
after Israeli forces
rescued four hostages
from Hamas militants in Gaza.
Gantz
was to make his announcement yesterday,
which was that deadline of June 8th,
but instead had it.
Today, CNN
has correspondents tracking
all of these developments
around the world.
Let's begin
with CNN's Paula Hancocks
live for us in Tel Aviv Paula.
So Gantz had been facing pressure
to stay in place in recent days.
Netanyahu publicly
asking him to stay even members
of the Biden administration
were urging him to stay.
So why did he come to this decision?
Well, Fred,
what he said in that statement
just a little earlier
this Sunday evening
was that with the Israeli
prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, at the helm,
that the state of Israel
could not be victorious.
He said that Israel needed somebody
who put the hostages ahead of politics.
Now,
he has been very
critical of Benjamin Netanyahu
in recent months.
Just last month,
he said that if there weren't
certain conditions that were met,
then he was going to have to walk away
from the emergency government.
Now, those conditions were
a definitive and decisive plan
to get the hostages back.
We know that Gantz has been very vocal
about his support
for the proposal
that's on the table at the moment,
the proposal that U.S.
and Israeli officials
are waiting
for an official response from Hamas.
He also said he wants to have a day
after strategy
so the day after the war ends.
What exactly is the plan for Gaza?
Now, Netanyahu has been very vague
over recent months when it comes to that.
And then he also wanted a plan
to calm down the situation
on the northern border
with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon,
saying that there are tens of thousands
of Israeli residents
who want to be able
to move back to their homes.
They've been evacuated for many months
now because of tensions there.
So he has said that
those were the reasons
he needed to step down.
Now, what this means,
it doesn't mean that
the government collapses.
Netanyahu still has a slim majority,
so can continue.
But it does mean that
he is far more isolated now.
Both domestically and internationally.
We know that he has a very far right
element to his coalition.
And Gantz had been seen
as a counterweight to that.
He was a key member of the war cabinet.
There was three
members
that were the main members of that.
The prime minister, the defense minister,
Benny Gantz.
So a third of that key
war cabinet has now stepped down.
And we know that
that the far right
wing of Ben-gvir for example,
the Minister for National Security,
wants to be part of that war cabinet.
So there is a fear that that could be
less of a counterweight
to the far right elements,
and that is certainly not welcome here
for many in Israel.
He is a popular figure.
Benny Gantz,
we've also heard as well, though,
fears of what this means
for the hostage deal, the cease fire deal
that is on the table.
At this point,
we've had a statement from the
the group that represents
the families of those
that are being held hostage.
And they say they hope
it won't make a difference to that deal.
That deal remains as it is,
and they hope that it will be signed
and agreed to very quickly Fred.
All right, Paula, thank you so much.
Let's go now to CNN's Ben
Wedeman in Beirut Ben.
You know, officials in Gaza
claim Israel's
raid left more than 270 people dead.
Israel disputing that number, saying
the casualties were under 100.
What is the reaction like where you are?
Well, certainly, I think
across the Middle East,
across the Arab world,
there's one of shock
at the high number of casualties
as a result of that operation
that happened yesterday.
Now, we did get a breakdown
from the Palestinian Ministry of Health
in Gaza.
Of that 274 dead yesterday,
they said 64 of the dead were children,
57 were women and 37 were elderly people.
And certainly
from the video we saw yesterday,
there were a lot of wounded children
and women among those being treated
in the hospitals
in the central part of Gaza.
And, of course,
keep in mind
that many of the people
who had taken refuge
in Rafah in the far
south of the Gaza Strip
had moved north
because of Israel's operation there.
So they do say that refugee camp
was teeming
with people who thought
they would be safe.
And of course, the operation
took place at 11:00 in the morning
on a Saturday
when people were out and about.
There was a market nearby
where many of the Israeli
ordnance landed, and that would explain
why there's such a high death toll.
And, of course, people who were there
describe a scene that was absolutely
horrific.
So, of course, the
increasing bombardment
started hitting everywhere,
something we never witnessed before.
You can maybe 150 rockets fell
in less than 10 minutes
while we were running away.
A lot more fell on the market
for good reason.
And
there are children torn apart
and scattered in the streets.
And they wiped out Nusrat.
It is hell on earth.
And the worry, of course, now
is that after this operation where
Prime Minister Netanyahu can brag
that military action
brought about the freedom
of some of the hostages,
that perhaps Israel
will be putting that 31st of May
Biden cease
fire proposal on the back burner
and will continue
with the military option Fredricka.
All right, Ben Wedeman in Beirut,
thank you so much.
On to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez
now in Wilmington, Delaware,
where President Biden
will soon be returning
following his overseas trip.
Priscilla,
how is the White House
reacting to the news of
Benny Gantz's departure?
Well, the White House
is not commenting on it at this point,
but we do know that U.S.
officials have been concerned
about his departure,
jeopardizing those ongoing hostage
and cease fire negotiations.
And behind the scenes, U.S.
officials have been urging him
not to leave the government,
making the case that it could impact
those ongoing talks.
And, of course, Benny
Gantz had visited Washington before.
He had met in March with Vice President
Kamala Harris and national security
adviser Jake Sullivan
to talk about the ongoing cease fire
negotiations and also the day
after planning for Gaza.
Now, that was in opposition
to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu,
and the White House defended
those talks at the time,
saying that it was appropriate,
given his position
and that the discussions
were focused on the Israel Hamas war.
Now, of course, leading up to today,
the other question was
whether or not
President Biden's proposal
that for the release of hostages
in exchange for that cease fire
would reverse his decision,
that he had outlined that on May 31st,
that those three phases
and really put pressure on Israel
and all of the parties
involved to reach an agreement.
But we now know today
that that did not reverse his decision.
And instead, Benny Gantz
is departing the government.
This also, of course, coming on
the heels of the operation
that you just heard Ben
talk about, that rescue operation
that occurred yesterday.
Now, today,
the national security adviser,
Jake Sullivan, was asked
about that on CNN.
And whether the US was comfortable,
given the toll on civilians.
Take a listen to what he had to say.
The president himself has said
in recent days
that the Palestinian people
are going through sheer
hell in this conflict
because Hamas is operating
in a way that puts them in the crossfire,
that holds hostages
right in the heart of crowded
civilian areas.
Unfortunately, we are going to continue
to see ongoing conflict
and military operations
in which Israel makes efforts
to recover its citizens and frankly,
to recover American citizens.
What we would much prefer to see
is a cease fire
where the hostages come out peacefully.
So you heard the national security
adviser there continuing to push
for a diplomatic solution.
That is what we continue
to hear from senior U.S.
officials across the board.
Of course, the president
currently on his way back
from France to here,
Wilmington, Delaware,
where reporters will have a chance
to ask him questions about this
latest news Fred.
All right.
Priscila Alvarez, thank you so much.",20240609

LRQaFxADQjg,Benjamin Netanyahu disbands Israeli war cabinet,data/en_CNN\Benjamin Netanyahu disbands Israeli war cabinet.jpg,"an Israeli official says prime minister Benjamin&nbsp;
Netanyahu has disbanded the war cabinet which was&nbsp;&nbsp;
responsible for key decisions relating to&nbsp;
the Israel Hamas War it was formed in the&nbsp;&nbsp;
days after the October 7th Hamas attacks the&nbsp;
decision comes after opposition leader Benny&nbsp;&nbsp;
gance withdrew from the body last week&nbsp;
meanwhile Israel's military announced a&nbsp;&nbsp;
daily tactical pause along a specific route and&nbsp;
specific times to allow for humanitarian Aid&nbsp;&nbsp;
into Gaza the IDF later clarified that it's&nbsp;
still its troops are still fighting in Rafa&nbsp;&nbsp;
and parts of Gaza CNN's Paula hanock is joining&nbsp;
us now from Southern Israel Paula let's start&nbsp;&nbsp;
with uh Benjamin netanyahu's decision to&nbsp;
disband his War cabinet what's behind that
decision well am in the war cabinet there were&nbsp;
always three men who are basically making the&nbsp;&nbsp;
decisions which was the Prime Minister the defense&nbsp;
minister and the opposition leader Benny Gant now&nbsp;&nbsp;
of course since Gant has resigned saying uh he's&nbsp;
in protest of the fact there's no uh plan to get&nbsp;&nbsp;
the hostages out no day after plan uh for Gaza&nbsp;
and another plan to to get people back to Northern&nbsp;&nbsp;
Israel as well who've been evacuated it is now&nbsp;
effectively a twers war cabinet so what he has&nbsp;&nbsp;
done is he's disbanded that and he has said&nbsp;
according to an official in his office that&nbsp;&nbsp;
the decisions when it comes to the war in Gaza&nbsp;
will be made on a uh a security cabinet basis&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is uh a wider cabinet basis uh also saying&nbsp;
that or experts are saying that this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;
avoids the uh the pressure that was coming from&nbsp;
the far right of his Coalition uh some of those&nbsp;&nbsp;
far right elements wanted to be part of the war&nbsp;
cabinet uh so by disbanding it potentially he&nbsp;&nbsp;
has uh uh got rid of that problem as well he&nbsp;
doesn't have to accept or reject them because&nbsp;&nbsp;
he does have a balancing act when it comes&nbsp;
to his Coalition at this point uh but they&nbsp;&nbsp;
do say within the prime minister's office this&nbsp;
won't make a difference to actually making the&nbsp;&nbsp;
decisions on the uh the war in Gaza and if they&nbsp;
have to they will have smaller groups to decide&nbsp;&nbsp;
tactical changes amra and regarding that tactical&nbsp;
pause uh if there is still fighting going on in&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rafa and parts of Gaza as the IDF says is this&nbsp;
tactical pause in effect to allow humanitarian Aid
in so this is a pause that comes from the&nbsp;
Kem Shalom Crossing where we just were&nbsp;&nbsp;
and it goes into Gaza and then up the salahadin&nbsp;
road which is effectively the the north south Road&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh that runs through Gaza now from the idf's point&nbsp;
of view they say that they are securing that road&nbsp;&nbsp;
so it will be safe for uh in uh International Aid&nbsp;
organizations to distribute AIDS which they say is&nbsp;&nbsp;
stuck on the Gaza side uh of the Kem Shalom border&nbsp;
they say there's more than a thousand trucks that&nbsp;&nbsp;
are there currently but we've spoken to some of&nbsp;
those Aid groups including the UN groups in Gaza&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh and they say that sometimes it is simply too&nbsp;
dangerous for them to be able to get to that&nbsp;&nbsp;
cross in and pick up the aid it's not just the&nbsp;
fighting that they're concerned about it's also&nbsp;&nbsp;
the sense of of lawlessness uh in Gaza there is&nbsp;
a lot of looting uh they say it's very dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;
for them to be able to try and distribute the&nbsp;
aid I did ask the IDF spokesperson if there&nbsp;&nbsp;
would be some kind of military uh escort with uh&nbsp;
these uh these trucks to try and get the aid in&nbsp;&nbsp;
and that was uh not answered so at this point&nbsp;
it doesn't appear that that would be the case&nbsp;&nbsp;
we've also heard from the Gaza media office&nbsp;
saying uh that as far as they're concerned&nbsp;&nbsp;
there's been no tactical pause uh so they believe&nbsp;
that it is Israeli lies in their uh words now the&nbsp;&nbsp;
IDF has been quite clear that the fighting will&nbsp;
continue it will continue in Rafa which is very&nbsp;&nbsp;
close to where this uh this route is uh for the&nbsp;
Tactical pause uh as they will be continuing uh&nbsp;&nbsp;
what they have been doing since last month Amar&nbsp;
all right Paula hanock watching this for us from&nbsp;&nbsp;
Southern Israel thank you Paula meanwhile a&nbsp;
US Special Envoy arrives in Israel Monday as&nbsp;&nbsp;
tensions escalate on Israel's northern border&nbsp;
with Lebanon CNN's Ben Weedman is joining us&nbsp;&nbsp;
now live from Beirut uh Ben you and officials&nbsp;
are warning that there is a very real danger&nbsp;&nbsp;
of miscalculation escalating the conflict along&nbsp;
uh the Israel and lebanon's Border what have you
learned well what we've been seen is that&nbsp;
certainly in the last few weeks uh things&nbsp;&nbsp;
on the border have gotten much hotter in terms&nbsp;
of the daily back and forth between hisbah and&nbsp;&nbsp;
Israel although I must add that it's a currently&nbsp;
a Muslim holiday and yesterday on the at least&nbsp;&nbsp;
from hisbah side they didn't fire anything at&nbsp;
the Israelis as far as we can tell but this&nbsp;&nbsp;
Envoy Amos Hawkin who's the senior energy&nbsp;
adviser at the White House and he's really&nbsp;&nbsp;
the point man in dealing with the sort of the&nbsp;
Lebanon on Israel file for the United States&nbsp;&nbsp;
he's in Israel now we assume although it has&nbsp;
not been officially announced that he's going&nbsp;&nbsp;
to be coming uh to Beirut in the coming days&nbsp;
nonetheless what is obvious certainly from&nbsp;&nbsp;
statements made by senior Israeli officials&nbsp;
including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the signs we're getting from hisbah is&nbsp;
that both sides are primed for escalation
every day the message goes out from South&nbsp;
Lebanon in slick propaganda videos accompanied&nbsp;&nbsp;
by a stirring soundtrack hisbah is ready&nbsp;
to go from daily skirmishes to full scale&nbsp;&nbsp;
war with Israel Meed in what appears to be&nbsp;
an unwinable war in Gaza Israel has vowed&nbsp;&nbsp;
to turn its military might on Hezbollah&nbsp;
earlier this month Israeli Prime Minister&nbsp;&nbsp;
Benjamin Netanyahu visited the Border saying&nbsp;
we are prepared for very strong action in the
north but the Iranian back group is by far the&nbsp;
most formidable battle hardened foe Israel has&nbsp;&nbsp;
faced on its borders since the 1973 October&nbsp;
war after its guillas forced Israel to pull&nbsp;&nbsp;
out of South Lebanon 24 years ago in 2006&nbsp;
Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill&nbsp;&nbsp;
although the war left parts of Beirut and much&nbsp;
of Southern Lebanon in Ruins retired Lebanese&nbsp;&nbsp;
Army Brigadier General elas Hana knows the&nbsp;
militant Group Well hasbalah is an exclusive&nbsp;&nbsp;
Club well disciplined monitored and they have&nbsp;
which is the most important issue a charismatic
leader since October Israeli strikes&nbsp;
have killed more than 300 hisbah Fighters&nbsp;&nbsp;
including last week high ranking&nbsp;
Commander Talib Abdullah given a&nbsp;&nbsp;
hero's farewell in Beirut at the funeral&nbsp;
senior Hezbollah leader Hashim safadin&nbsp;&nbsp;
warned we will increase our operations&nbsp;
in intensity and force in quantity and
quality analysts believe Iran has provided&nbsp;
Hezbollah with an arsenal of sophisticated&nbsp;&nbsp;
long range missiles capable of reaching Tel Aviv&nbsp;
and Beyond until now Hezbollah has mostly limited&nbsp;&nbsp;
its strikes to military targets along the rugged&nbsp;
mountainous Frontier hitting Israel's extensive&nbsp;&nbsp;
network of surveillance posts It also says&nbsp;
it is taken out an Iron Dome battery the&nbsp;&nbsp;
backbone of Israel's missile defenses and has used&nbsp;
ground to- a missiles to shoot down three top of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the line Hermes 900 drones in the process forcing&nbsp;
tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the north healah is learning faster than Israel&nbsp;
can adapt says Hanah you know they are learning&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's like learning process it's like trial and&nbsp;
error so as far as you go in time you are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;
more intensity more combined use of weapon and&nbsp;
then more in depths and More in Effectiveness&nbsp;&nbsp;
against the Israelis and what is the problem&nbsp;
that the Israeli have no Pro have no answer&nbsp;&nbsp;
for that since October Israel has bolstered&nbsp;
its forces on the border and held exercises&nbsp;&nbsp;
to prepare for war Hezbollah is also Ready&nbsp;
for War a war that is just one miscalculation
away now Mr Hawkin is probably trying to convince&nbsp;
Vin the Israelis now is not a good time given the&nbsp;&nbsp;
situation in Gaza to jump into a war with&nbsp;
Lebanon and of course in Lebanon given H&nbsp;&nbsp;
hezbollah's strength and abilities to strike well&nbsp;
inside Israel the price for Israel would be very&nbsp;&nbsp;
high but prime minister Netanyahu is under&nbsp;
intense pressure from the public in Israel&nbsp;&nbsp;
to allow those people who fled the north to go&nbsp;
back home so they're really in a bind now the&nbsp;&nbsp;
one solution and what has been seen before is&nbsp;
that in late November of last year when there&nbsp;&nbsp;
was an 8 day halt in the fighting in Gaza and&nbsp;
there was a release of hostages in exchange for&nbsp;&nbsp;
Palestinian prisoners and detainees the Border&nbsp;
along between Lebanon and Israel was quiet hisb&nbsp;&nbsp;
has made it clear if the fighting stops in&nbsp;
Gaza the Border will be quiet so probably a&nbsp;&nbsp;
ceasefire is the best solution all around amra&nbsp;
Ben Weedman and beay for us thank you so much",20240617

n_LixBP0vXE,"Israel warns of possible ‘all-out war’ after Hezbollah publishes video of military, civilian sites","data/en_CNN\Israel warns of possible ‘all-out war’ after Hezbollah publishes video of military, civilian sites.jpg","fears of an expanding
conflict in the Middle East.
After Israel's foreign minister
warns Hezbollah
it would be destroyed
if all out war breaks out.
Israel Katz his comments online follow
Hezbollah's release of a purported
nine minute drone video
that shows sensitive military locations
and civilian areas in Haifa
and other Israeli cities.
And while tensions
percolate along the northern border
with Lebanon, there's a brewing
diplomatic rift between
the Netanyahu government
and the white House.
We are connecting the dots on this
for you with Ben Wedeman back with us
this hour from Beirut.
Paula Hancocks is in
Jerusalem, and Loren
Fox is in Washington on Capitol Hill.
Let me start with you, Ben.
just describe to us the importance
of this purported video, shot by, drones.
Hezbollah says,
from Lebanon
over Israeli cities, including Haifa,
which of course, serves
as a crucial gateway
to the rest of the world.
And maybe more importantly, for Israel.
How does Hezbollah manage to fly a drone
in such strategic locations?
And is this psychological warfare
that we're looking at here?
Well, basically,
I think the Israelis are also trying
to figure out how it is
that Hezbollah was able to fly
those drones
over some very sensitive military,
positions, military industries, the port,
where we see huge oil storage facilities.
They got it all. Now, for one thing.
What we've been seeing from
almost
the beginning of the back
and forth skirmishes
between Hezbollah and Israel,
is that
Hezbollah has been targeting
Israel surveillance
and observation equipment
all along the border.
The Israelis, in fact,
in brought in cranes
to replace the destroyed
surveillance equipment.
And Hezbollah took those out as well.
So clearly,
there are holes in their ability
to see what enters Israeli, airspace.
But above and beyond that,
clearly Hezbollah
has the technical capabilities,
to collect this sort of sensitive
information.
Well, inside,
Israeli territory, it's about 30km
from the nearest point on the Lebanese
Israeli border, to Haifa.
Was it a propaganda video?
Well, the actually,
if you looked at the text in the video,
there wasn't anything about attacks.
It was just very sort of factual
explaining what
this location is,
what it served, what you're seeing.
And it really is a message
to the Israelis,
that, you know, don't don't mess with us.
We not only have the ability to collect
intelligence inside,
deep inside your territory
on very sensitive, sites, but
along with that
probably comes other capabilities
that we've seen slowly unveiled
in the last few weeks.
For instance,
Hezbollah in the last few months
has been able to that fire
shoot down
three Hermes 900 Israeli drones,
very sophisticated drones
that can fly as high as 30,000ft.
They took those out with anti-aircraft
missiles two weeks ago.
They were able to strike
according to Hezbollah.
But the video would also seem
to confirm that an Israeli
Iron Dome battery,
the Iron Dome, is really the back
backbone of Israel's missile
defense system.
So even though Israeli officials
like the foreign minister
talking about destroying,
Hezbollah, Hezbollah
is showing that it's, not a foe
that should be underestimated
in any sense of the word. Becky.
Yeah.
This is,
this is not Hamas
we are speaking about here.
Paula, let me bring you in here
because as we discuss with Ben,
what is going on on that northern front,
which is a, you know, a clear issue.
for the Israelis, there is a serious rift
beginning to open up now
between Benjamin Netanyahu
and the Biden administration.
So listen to what he had to say
about Secretary of State
Antony Blinken yesterday.
It's inconceivable
that in the past few months,
the administration has been
withholding weapons and ammunition stores
from Israel, America's closest
ally,
fighting for its ally,
fighting against Iran
and our other common enemies.
Secretary Blinken assured me
that the
administration is working day
and night to remove these bottlenecks.
I certainly hope that's the case.
It should be the case.
What's the perspective in Israel
about why it is that Benjamin Netanyahu,
released that video yesterday
very pointedly,
speaking there about a conversation
with Antony Blinken.
And speaking in English, Becky.
So it's very clear
that the audience is American.
The audience is international.
This is not for domestic considerations.
Now, it's it's no secret
that there are differences
between the Israeli leader
and the the US president, Joe Biden.
They've certainly
had their differences over recent months,
not least because the U.S.
has been pushing Israel
to to be more careful in Gaza
to to push for this cease fire,
something that the Israeli prime
minister has not openly
said that he will agree
to this ceasefire hostage deal
and also pushing for a Palestinian state,
something that the Israeli prime
minister has said he does not support.
So the differences
between these two sides,
are very pronounced.
It is surprising, though,
that he would come out and
and do this
so publicly
washing dirty laundry in public,
if you like.
And and it did have,
quite a surprised response
from the Biden administration as well.
Listen to this.
We, as you know,
are continuing to review one shipment,
that President Biden has talked about,
with regard to 2,000 pound bombs
because of our concerns about their use
in a densely populated area like Rafah.
That remains other, under review.
but everything else is moving
as it normally would move.
We generally do not know
what he's talking about.
we just don't.
And there's
no Israeli official at this point
that's going on the record
to speak about this.
No one appears to want to have their name
next to this video. Becky.
So, I mean,
Lauren, let me bring you in,
at this point,
because all of this happening
just ahead of Benjamin Netanyahu's visit
to Washington,
in July to address Congress,
we have seen some pushback already
with some lawmakers saying
that they will boycott that.
Have a listen to Senator
Elizabeth Warren earlier.
Do you
plan to attend
Prime Minister
Netanyahu's address to Congress?
No. Look,
we need a cease fire.
We need to get those hostages back.
We need humanitarian relief,
and we need to be giving both parties
a big shove toward
getting to the negotiating table
and working out a peaceful solution
to the president made clear
that he should not address Congress.
Netanyahu.
Like that's up to the president.
But I'm not going.
Well, Joe
Biden facing some quite serious backlash
within his own party, on this, isn't it?
And he's
really looking
at a dilemma ahead of November's
election. Explain, if you will.
Yeah.
I mean,
this is still a month away,
and I think it's clear
that there are many progressive
Democrats who plan to boycott
Netanyahu's speech
when he comes to address
Congress in July.
But this is really coming from
two different places.
You know, on the one hand,
there is just disagreement
with Netanyahu's
handling of this conflict
in the Middle East.
On the other,
there's also this feeling
from some liberals
that you are putting Joe Biden
in this position
where someone who has been
critical of
the president
is coming and addressing
Congress just months
before the November election.
So it's really sort of
the politics abroad
and also the politics at home
that they don't agree with.
You have to keep in mind,
this is happening in the context
in which the House speaker, Mike
Johnson,
has put a series
of really tough votes on the floor
that have fractured
Democrats in some cases.
Now, there's really typically
just a small number
of Democrats that vote with Republicans
on some of those proposals.
But it has been
one of the most difficult conflicts for
the leader,
the Democratic leader in the House,
Hakeem Jeffries, to manage
within his conference.
And so,
you know,
I expect that there's
going to be a large number
of Democrats boycotting
Netanyahu's address to Congress.
We should note that about a decade ago,
when he came to Capitol Hill,
there were also dozens of Democrats
who boycotted the speech.
So that's not precisely new,
but I think the numbers might be larger.
It's also possible
that they have press conferences
or some kind of other counter programing
when he comes to speak.
So it would go beyond
just not showing up for the speech.
It would be sort of more of
a tacit opposition as well.",20240619

J1OkO6TW3Ck,Ex-US Defense Secy. under Trump explains the message Hezbollah is sending Israel,data/en_CNN\Ex-US Defense Secy. under Trump explains the message Hezbollah is sending Israel.jpg,"Fears are growing about a potential full
blown war
between Israel and Hezbollah
militants in Lebanon.
Right now,
Israel and Hezbollah
are trading increasingly intense threats.
The latest from the leader of Hezbollah,
Hassan Nasrallah,
who says if a war breaks out,
the group will target Cyprus.
The nearby island nation
that is a member of the European Union.
Earlier, Israel warned
the possibility of war
is getting very close
after Hezbollah released
this threatening drone video
purporting to show
sensitive
Israeli military
as well as civilian sites.
Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah
have been rising ever since
the October 7th attacks by Hamas,
but especially here in recent weeks.
We have former defense secretary
from the Trump administration,
Mark Esper, with us now.
He also serves on the board
or as a strategic advisor
for several aerospace
and defense related companies.
Sir, we see this
Hezbollah drones,
the message loud and clear.
But these drones have also
been rather effective at evading Israeli
air defense, hitting Israeli
military sites,
even civilian homes in northern Israel.
And U.S.
officials, we've learned, are worried
that Israeli systems,
including Iron
Dome, will not be able to keep up.
How concerned are you about this?
Short.
Beyond. Look, we should be concerned.
And this has been a been a concern now
since the beginning
of the conflict in Gaza.
since that time, Hezbollah
has been shooting
rockets and drones
into Israel from the north,
nearly every day.
And, at this point,
they've caused a handful of Israelis
to be killed.
But but,
you know, they also have displaced
well over 60,080 thousand Israelis
from northern Israel.
So they've been displaced for some time.
I'm very concerned about this
because we're now
seeing a real escalation
in terms of the rhetoric.
I think what,
Hezbollah did with regard
to sending that drone, over Israel,
over the port of Haifa
was, was a clear threat,
a warning that we can see you
and if we can see you, we can shoot you.
And that's important
because we know that Hezbollah
has an inventory of well over
150,000 rockets and missiles,
which could do a lot,
quite a lot of damage
to all parts of Israel.
What would a two front war mean
in this conflict,
and also specifically for the
US as Israel's main patron?
Well, fighting
across two fronts is hard
because of course, it
draws resources, one from each.
And,
maybe the Israeli view is
that they are wrapping up
operations in Rafah that they can turn
to, I'm sorry, in Gaza
so that they can turn to, Hezbollah
now in the North.
They've been talking about this,
hinting about this for some time.
There are parts of the Israeli government
that have wanted to,
to stir things up with,
Hezbollah in the north.
And maybe they're reaching this point
right now,
I think, for the United States.
Look, we're
trying to get the Middle East
to simmer down and not expand.
And yet this would be quite an expansion.
Keep in mind that Hamas,
while it had an estimated 30,000
or so fighters
in a small swath of territory.
Hassan Nasrallah,
the leader of,
Hezbollah, has claimed
to have over 100,000 fighters.
And so you could see
a much broader conflict.
And then on top of this,
we've got to keep in mind, strategically,
geopolitically,
Iran is in the midst
of a leadership transition.
And we should know
by the end of this month
who the next president of Iran is
and what direction
will he take the country,
particularly with regard
to this conflict in the Middle East?
I wonder what you make of the fighting
between Benjamin
Netanyahu and the IDF,
because the IDF, spokesperson
Daniel Hager
said, those
who think Israel can make Hamas
disappear are wrong.
I mean, paging Benjamin
Netanyahu loud and clear here.
He's been very critical of the IDF lately
and his office pushed back on that.
Who's right here?
Well, the IDF spokesman was right.
He's correct.
I mean, we've all been saying
for some time, you cannot destroy Hamas.
It's it's an an ideology, a theology.
It's a it's a cult. Right.
now, what you can do is
you can neutralize its leadership,
which I've argued and others have.
You can
you can
decimate the ranks of its fighters
to make sure that they're no longer
combat ineffective.
But in terms of completely destroying
and eradicating them is not possible.
What you have to do
is, again, to take out the leadership,
remove their warfighting capability,
and then you have to have a,
a police or a security presence
on the ground to continue to kind of,
as we say,
keep mowing the lawn every now
and then
to make sure that the right fighters
don't rise up.
So look, I think the spokesman was right.
you see this growing split between,
the IDF and the political leadership,
which is quite curious.
We saw when,
Benny Gantz left the government
a couple weeks ago.
Gantz, of course, was an opposition
political leader
and a former head of the IDF military.
And I think lastly, Brianna,
we saw just the other day
over the weekend,
it seemed to catch the surprise
of Netanyahu
that the IDF called
for a tactical pause in operations
in, in Gaza to allow for the,
humanitarian aid to get through.
And that really caught
the government off guard.
And it was others in
the government have objected.
So we see a growing rift
now between the military
and its political leaders.
Yeah.
You seem surprised
and also pretty ticked off by it.
It was very clear.
Secretary Esper,
we always appreciate you being on.
Thank you so much.",20240621
3-g3tHgUfW0,Threats of all-out war grow between Israel and Hezbollah,data/en_CNN\Threats of all-out war grow between Israel and Hezbollah.jpg,"the European Union's top diplomat warns
the risk of Israel's war
spilling over into Lebanon is growing.
Joseph Burrell
says he's much more worried
than before, pointing
to increased bombings
on both sides of the border.
Ben Wedeman is in Lebanon,
where life goes on
as the shadow of war looms large.
It's a day of joy
and celebration here in South Lebanon.
Israeli forces are just
about five miles away from here.
But nonetheless, here
in the town of Hezbollah,
there's a wedding going on.
It didn't seem right to spoil
this special day
for newlyweds Tamer and Faten,
with questions about the dark clouds
hovering over Lebanon.
But one guest told us off camera,
we're celebrating here
while war is around the corner.
Hezbollah has been spared
the worst of the barrages
and counter barrages
between Israel and Hezbollah.
Here they stop anyone from firing
towards Israel.
Parliament member Elias
Gerardi was elected
to represent Christians in this area.
Majority of the southern people,
majority of the Lebanese people
from all sects or religions or parties,
they are in one way or another.
They are committed with the Palestinian.
Everyone we spoke with
had a completely contrary opinion.
Few people wanted to speak on camera
about the looming
danger of war for fear of repercussions.
Off camera, we got an earful.
There is zero appetite for escalation.
Little support for Hezbollah.
85 year old Abu Nabeel has seen it all.
War and civil war.
Invasions and occupation of weapons of
war is ruination, he says.
In war, everyone loses.
Even the winner,
Abu Nabeel, knows of what he speaks.
Since October,
Israel and Hezbollah and its allies
have been engaged
in low intensity warfare,
largely limited to the border.
If full scale war breaks out,
that war will spread
well beyond the frontier on both sides.
Last week, Israeli
generals approved a plan
to attack Lebanon right now,
while Hezbollah leader Hassan
Nasrallah recently warned
if it comes to war,
the group will fight Israel on land,
sea and air
and also incite Israel itself.
All this webinar covered webinars.
The Iranian backed groups
sophisticated attacks
have surprised Israeli officials,
including precision strikes
on surveillance posts
on the border,
shooting down high flying Israeli drones
and knocking out anti-missile
and anti-drone defenses,
and posting online
more than nine minutes of what it claimed
was drone
footage
of sensitive military
and civilian infrastructure in
and around the city of Haifa.
The bell summons the faithful to mass
in the predominantly
Christian town of Marjayoun.
More than 90,000
people have already left
the South for safer ground
in Hebron.
Among, Amal
says she's determined to stay, but adds
if things escalate to war
and it reaches here like it did
before with some shelling,
of course,
like others will have to leave this.
But for now they can only pray for peace
and hope those prayers are heard.
Our Ben Wedeman joins us now from Beirut.
Ben, I want you to pack this for us
because the rhetoric
has definitely changed.
There's a sense and major concern
about potential escalation.
Israel last week
approving operational plans
for potential offensive in Lebanon.
Netanyahu is saying
they might shift focus to Lebanon.
How are people responding on the ground,
and what are they reading into this
new rhetoric
about the prospect of a bigger conflict?
Well, people have heard here in Lebanon
for months now, sort of saber rattling,
coming from Israel.
But I think what has people
really worried
with was,
what we've heard reported on CNN
that the Biden administration
has expressed its full support for Israel
in the event
of a full scale
hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel,
which is rather reminiscent
of the full bodied
support the Americans voiced
at the beginning
of the disastrous war in Gaza.
So really, that has people worried.
And we're already seeing signs of
of things, for instance,
cancellations in hotels in Lebanon
in the summer,
Lebanon is highly dependent on,
members of the Lebanese
diaspora and tourists
to come here
to bring badly needed hard cash.
There have been many cancellations,
and at hotels and elsewhere.
we also know that Kuwait,
Sweden and North Macedonia,
have warned their citizens not to travel
to Lebanon
under the current circumstances.
And those who are here to leave
immediately.
this is reminiscent,
of course, of the kind of things
we were seeing back in October last year.
And finally,
the London Telegraph has put out a report
saying that
the Beirut International Airport
is being
used as a storage depot for weapons
by Hezbollah.
Now, Lebanese
officials have come out
and flatly denied that,
the Minister of Information,
the Minister of Transport
and the foreign minister
actually led a tour of journalists
and foreign diplomats to show them
there's nothing there.
But people are worried
that this is a sign,
that, for instance,
there's a target that the Israelis
might hit the airport,
which is essential
for this small country,
which only has one international airport
and 90.
Yeah.
Ben Wedeman,
thank you so much for that analysis.
Good to see you.",20240624
FWibxMDbMFc,'We have 3 minutes': CNN goes inside one of most dangerous places in northern Israel,data/en_CNN\'We have 3 minutes' CNN goes inside one of most dangerous places in northern Israel.jpg,"Israel is pressing ahead with
a major military offensive
in Gaza City,
as Hamas warns
the attacks could send cease fire efforts
back to square one.
Israeli forces report
close quarters combat
with Hamas fighters
saying they are destroying
terrorists infrastructure.
Hundreds of thousands of people,
meantime, are fleeing their homes
once again
under yet new evacuation orders.
Gaza's civil
defense says
bodies are trapped under buildings
and lying in the streets,
but it's just too dangerous
for crews to try and retrieve them.
The Palestinian Red Crescent
says all of its medical clinics in Gaza
and Gaza City are now out of service.
You want to go
to our Jeremy Diamond
now for more is live for us in Jerusalem.
You know what a nightmare
repeating itself here again.
I mean, evacuations ordered.
And again, it's a familiar horror, right?
Where the heck do these people go?
What more are you learning about exactly?
The Israeli operation that is underway
and what it means for civilians.
Well, you're right, Paula.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians
are once again on the move.
We have seen over the course
of just the last week,
evacuation orders
for parts of Khan Younis
and then in northern Gaza,
several evacuation orders
in different neighborhoods of Gaza City.
And that is where the Israeli military
has been concentrating
its military operations
over the last 48 hours
or so inside Gaza City
neighborhoods, where the Israeli military
says, that, Hamas has returned to areas
that the Israeli military
had previously cleared.
and that is what we are continuing
to see in Gaza, absent
a long term strategy
for the governance,
an alternative
to Hamas's governance in Gaza,
the Israeli military
going back into areas
that it had previously withdrawn from.
And not only is that resulting
in increased fighting, increased
artillery shelling, airstrikes,
but also,
of course, the impact to civilians,
not only those who are killed
and wounded in the fighting,
rescue workers having trouble actually
reaching the dead
and the wounded
as a result of the heavy fighting.
And then, of course,
as we were talking about
the tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands,
in some cases of people who are, moving
to areas of central Gaza, to that
almost the coastal area
where they are simply finding that
there are not enough resources
for the number of people
who are currently displaced in Gaza,
even things like tents, are,
running in short supply
in Gaza at the moment.
And for now, the only salve
that they could potentially get is
if indeed
there is a cease fire agreement.
We are seeing those negotiations
continuing this week in Cairo
as well as in Doha, Qatar.
But for now, no deal as of yet.
You know,
the other aspect you
that you've been following
closely has been whether or not
this will also be a conflict
on another front,
Israel's northern border.
What did you learn by visiting?
Well, late last,
last week we traveled to Shula,
which is just a few hundred feet
away from the Lebanese border,
to get a sense of just
how tense things are there
and to see some of the destruction
wrought by Hezbollah's
anti-tank missiles.
They're going to see us right
when we get up there.
And we have three minutes.
Colonel Jordan Hertzberg
is talking about Hezbollah.
After three minutes, though,
they can start the fire.
So a very quick
he's taking us to an Israeli community
on the front lines of Israel's
simmering conflict
with the Lebanese
militant group up
a winding mountain road,
past a roadblock in a security fence
and into the village of Shula,
which sits right on the Lebanese border.
We've just entered the village of Shula.
This is,
a community of about 300 people normally,
but right now it's
just an absolute ghost town.
Let's go quick.
The three minute countdown starts
as soon as we are
within line of sight of southern Lebanon.
Look how close you are to the border here
where Hezbollah militants
armed with anti-tank missiles are closely
watching the border
prepare to fire once again.
This house was hit by a high tech
missile right here,
past the window.
Two homes,
one next to the other,
hit in the same attack.
According to the Israeli military,
this is one of the most dangerous places
in northern Israel.
Right now, we're in Shula,
and you can see the Lebanese border
just right across there, across
from those concrete barriers.
We're just a few hundred feet.
And what that means
is that we are within range
of those anti-tank guided missiles.
And that is exactly
what has wrought this destruction
on this civilian home.
The threat of anti-tank
missiles is part of
why Israel
wants to push Hezbollah
back to the Litani River, about 18 miles
north of the border,
outside the range of those missiles.
Okay, we have 35 seconds.
We've been here for three minutes.
The colonel has been watching his watch
the entire time that we've been here.
And now he's telling us it's time to go.
Hezbollah has been firing rockets,
missiles and drones
at northern Israel since October 8th.
Israel has responded
with air strike
after airstrike,
devastating parts of southern Lebanon,
where more than 90,000
people have fled their homes
since October.
In northern Israel,
about 60,000
Israelis have been displaced.
People like Ori Eliyahu
and his nine dogs. To this day, leader.
His grandfather was among
the first people.
Israel settled in Shula
in the late 1960s,
and after spending his summers
there as a child,
Ori decided to move there.
Meaning there
still is a special place for you.
It's my heart
to be honest.
If you could return to Shula, you would.
Of course I wouldn't.
I would have,
and the first moment
I would have been to. Yeah.
But he says that may not be the case
for families with children.
I don't think that there is a condition
that will make them come back,
because whenever they know
the tree symbolizes,
like Hamas can do
what they did in October 7th
and attack them,
they want to be with them.
And there is no real solution
because a big wall might ruin everything.
A big war is exactly
what the Israeli military
is preparing for.
Our division has been training
for this war for a long, long time.
Whether that war materializes is unclear,
but for Colonel Hertzberg,
the objective is obvious
get Israel's northern residents
back into their homes.
Whether it happens
before a major ground operation
or after ground operation.
I can't tell you I'm in the tactical open
mind of the political level
or the policy level,
but the people are going to come back
sooner than later.
And, Paula,
the situation along that border
still remains very, very tense.
And it's not clear yet
whether it will blow up into that
all out war that has been feared.
What we do know, though,
is those cease fire negotiations
happening this week in Doha, Qatar.
They could not only,
unlock a cease fire in Gaza,
but they could also potentially unlock
a broader peace in the region.
Yeah.
And as you pointed out in your report,
tens of thousands of people
on both sides of the border
want to get back to their lives.
it's obviously
an agricultural hub as well.
And we'll wait to see
if there is progress
on these cease fire talks.
Jeremy Diamond for us.
Thanks so much. Appreciate it.",20240709
IXLANlZX4tg,This Israeli battalion has a history of abuse. CNN uncovers how their commanders are now operating,data/en_CNN\This Israeli battalion has a history of abuse. CNN uncovers how their commanders are now operating.jpg,"This is the Netzah Yehuda Battalion,
an Israeli army unit
showcasing their military might.
In a promotional training video
unavailable for.
But the unit has a decades long history
of abusing Palestinians
in the West Bank,
and the Americans know it
. A State Department investigation found they had committed
gross human rights violations,
but this finding never led to U.S.
sanctions.
Even media reports
of possible sanctions outraged Israel in.
Bits on Angela Bassett.
The whole Qatar.
So despite their track record,
the Natalie
Yehuda Battalion is still receiving
American arms
and is now operating in Gaza.
We tracked down
one former soldier from the unit.
In a rare interview,
he remembers
fellow soldiers
bragging about their excessive
violence towards Palestinians.
We've hidden his identity
and voice as he fears reprisal.
There were some kids
throwing rocks in a small village
that normally isn't a big deal,
but the company commander decided,
let's throw them a party.
So they took the emergency response team
and 20 soldiers.
They walked door to door,
throwing flashbangs and gas grenades
into people's homes
as a punishment
for the kids throwing rocks.
Collective punishment?
Yes. Collective punishment.
The commander said it was fantastic
to see the look on their faces.
When we look at those abuses
that have happened
in that state over the years.
There's a chain of command here. Yeah.
What responsibility
does the battalion commander?
The person at the very top.
What responsibility
does that commander have
for what happened?
I think he has all the responsibility.
If these commanders
don't put their foot down
and punish them for their behavior,
then they are in fact,
condoning their behavior.
He told us his years in the battalion
changed his outlook completely.
He now feels compelled to speak out
about the battalion's
mistreatment of Palestinians.
The officers he's talking about
follow a chain of command.
What happens under their watch
is their responsibility.
But despite this,
we found some of these same commanders
who were in charge
when allegations of human
rights abuses emerged
have been promoted again and again
into senior roles in the IDF,
using facial recognition technology.
CNN found this commander,
Lieutenant Colonel Amitai Okasha,
now in Gaza, in a senior role
running ground operations. Be
back in 2019.
He ran the Netzer Yehuda battalion Way
and was in charge
when these soldiers seen him
laughing as they beat and humiliate.
A Palestinian man and his son
both arrested for assisting the killer
of two fellow Netanya Yehuda soldiers.
That journey to the police station
left the father with three broken ribs.
Five were later
jailed for their actions and
their commander,
Okasha told investigators.
While he condemned the violence,
he said deploying
the soldiers was necessary
to make the killer pay
and to create a sense of success
among the fighters.
He remained as commander
and has been promoted since.
But Akashi is not the only Netanyahu.
The commander with a dark past
coming in for them.
I'm going to see that it's normal.
I'm going to die.
This is Lieutenant Colonel
Marty Sheva
rousing troops before deployment.
But just over a year later,
soldiers under his command
left for dead
this elderly Palestinian-American man.
Oh, more sad here.
Lying on the ground,
bound and blindfolded
as a soldier watches.
On his death,
the IDF admitted a moral failure.
But no soldier
faced charges for his death,
and their commander
faced only a reprimand.
Yet still he was later promoted.
Now training Israeli ground
troops, preparing to enter Gaza,
even featuring in high profile
interviews with American media
boasting of his soldiers
enthusiasm for war, the major concern for
most of the soldiers
is we're going to have to stop.
We asked the man
previously in charge
of investigating
the Netanyahu does abuses
for the US government,
what he made of these promotions
that is very bad news.
that shows, first of all, that Israel,
that the government of Israel
has no intention
of holding the Netanyahu
to battalion accountable.
He says the US
is not following their own laws
by sending them weapons.
Of course,
we treat Israel differently,
and that really undermines,
our human rights advocacy
and the rest of the world.
The law that Congress passed and
our taxpayer
funded assistance
is going to Israeli units
that have committed gross
violations of Human Rights Watch
this assistance
despite the growing evidence of abuse.
CNN exclusively obtained
the names of three more Israeli
units found by U.S.
officials to have committed
gross human
rights violations prior to October 7th.
All are still operating,
including the Yemen
seen here in Gaza
in an operation
that rescued four Israeli hostages
but left nearly 300
Palestinian dead,
according to local health authorities.
The Israeli
military dispute
that the toll was so high,
such as the death
and destruction, mounts.
It is U.S.
weaponry supporting these units,
begging the question
for how much longer will Israel's
greatest ally choose to turn a blind eye?

T_0cXkyvTBg,Bernie Sanders rips Netanyahu ahead of high-stakes speech to Congress,data/en_CNN\Bernie Sanders rips Netanyahu ahead of high-stakes speech to Congress.jpg,"Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
will address a joint meeting of Congress
ahead of his speech,
hundreds of protesters
staged a sit in inside
the Capitol
calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Dozens of Democratic lawmakers
are planning to skip the speech
as the party remains
divided over his handling of the war.
CNN's Lauren Fox is with me now.
What are we expecting today? Loren?
Yeah, this address is coming
at such a tumultuous time.
And not just U.S.
politics, but also Israeli politics.
And as Benjamin Netanyahu
faces challenges back home.
This is a high stakes
speech for him,
given the fact that there are lawmakers
who are going to be in this audience,
who have serious questions,
serious doubts
about Netanyahu's leadership right now.
And that includes some Republicans.
I was talking last night
to Senator Joni Ernst.
She serves on the
Armed Services Committee,
and she said she has to hear a very clear
and concise message from Netanyahu today
about the path forward in this war
and how he is going to get hostages home.
She said.
It is far beyond time for that to happen.
But you are also going
to see many Democrats
not attending this speech today.
There are more than 80 House
Democrats
who we know
are going to be boycotting six U.S.
senators who are going to be boycotting,
including Patty Murray,
who is a top Democrat in leadership,
who is not going to be
attending this speech today.
Overseeing it is going to be Senator
Ben Cardin. He's going to be presiding.
And I think that that just says a lot
about this moment right now
as Netanyahu comes in
to give this address.
You know,
there are some Democrats
who are going to be
having alternative programing.
This is Congresswoman
Pramila Jayapal, who said in a statement,
instead of attending
Benjamin Netanyahu's address,
I will attend a panel discussion
led by the Center of American Progress
and other organizations
on the path to Peace.
This event
will feature a Palestinian leader,
a Jewish
Israeli leader and a former IDF soldier,
all of whom are dedicated
to finding a path
toward peace and security.
And I just want to remind people
that this address is happening
after the initial invitation
went out from speaker Mike Johnson.
Obviously, it's
going to be really interesting
to see what House Republicans
think of this speech.
Meanwhile, last night
on the Senate floor,
a series of Democrats
addressed the issues
that they see
happening
and concerns
that they have about Benjamin
Netanyahu coming.
This is independent
Senator Bernie Sanders.
It will be the
first time in American history
that a war criminal
has been given that order.
Frankly, this invitation
to Netanyahu is a disgrace
and something that we will look back on
with regret.
And earlier this year,
remember, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer
actually called on the Israeli people
to hold a new election
and replace Benjamin Netanyahu.
Laura Fox in Washington
will be watching this very closely.
Lauren, thank you very much.
Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
will address the US Congress
for a record fourth time.
Now he hopes to shore up
American support for the war in Gaza.
But many of the families
of Israeli hostages
still held in Gaza
are criticizing his trip,
with some saying
he should have remained at home
to secure a deal to release the hostages.
Now his trip comes amid
an upheaval in U.S.
politics.
Though his visit was orchestrated
by Republican leaders,
many prominent Democrats
like Vice President Harris
and Senator Elizabeth Warren
won't be in attendance for his speech.
I'm not going
because, Benjamin Netanyahu
has led that region
into a complete humanitarian disaster.
He has put his own personal interests
ahead of the interests
of the people of his country.
And what he has done in Gaza
is unspeakable right now.
Prime Minister Netanyahu is scheduled
to meet
President Biden on Thursday
and former President Trump on Friday.
CNN's Not a Beshear
joins us now live from London.
so not a what
can you tell us about the upcoming speech
and what
Netanyahu here expects to achieve?
Look, mean?
There is growing pressure
from representatives and family members
of those hostages
still held captive by Hamas in Gaza.
For Prime Minister Netanyahu
to strike a deal.
They want that to be
the focus of his address to Congress.
In fact, we've heard from the
host of Challenge Forum,
which has said they want to see
Netanyahu opening his address
by saying that is a deal.
And we have heard some optimistic notes
from the Israeli prime minister,
and we've even heard some
signs of optimism from U.S.
officials as well.
It's understood
that there is
a clear
framework on the deal
that they're just hammering out
those finer details and technicalities.
But as you mentioned,
there is growing criticism
of the Israeli prime
minister back home in Israel
and from the family members
and representatives
of those hostages
still have cut to saying that
he should be at home focusing
on the return of those hostages,
bringing an end
to the war in Gaza, securing
that ceasefire agreement.
Now, of course,
all eyes will be on his address.
Now, as you mentioned,
we are already seeing backlash
in Washington DC,
not only as members of the Democrat Party
now choosing to boycott, to
not attend
the congressional address
by the Israeli prime minister.
But we're also seeing protests as well.
Of course, we saw protests yesterday.
Members of the Jewish Voice for peace
movement occupying is staging a sit in
in congressional building.
We've also seen,
of course, other protest
taking place across the country
and are expecting to see more today.
But of course, that
growing black
backlash is not only centered in Israel
and in Washington.
It is a global backlash.
And, of course, the U.S.
has been vocal in pushing
the Israeli government for a cease fire
deal to be struck.
Now, at this stage,
we've heard from President Biden
speaking on Monday,
he believes that the parties
involved in this negotiation
are, in his words,
on the verge of coming
to some sort of agreement.
The State Department has said
that the gap separating
those two is narrowing,
that there are still some issues
which remain.
But of course, pressure is mounting.
And of course, the situation in Gaza
is only worsening as well.
If a deal isn't struck soon,
we will be entering ten months
of this war.
That is, ten months
with hostages
still held captive in Hamas.
That is,
ten months with civilians
in Gaza being killed on a daily basis.
That death toll now topping 39,000.
The UN
warning that famine is spreading
throughout the Gaza Strip,
and we are seeing
the humanitarian situation
worsened with that disease,
is spreading rapidly
across the Gaza Strip.
We're seeing continued airstrikes
in southern Gaza as well.
Of course, deadly strikes in Khan
Younis, where
hundreds, thousands,
even civilians
have been ordered to evacuate once again.
So it is a deteriorating situation.
We're seeing mounting pressure from U.S.
officials.
Many have been careful
to clarify that the U.S.
maintains
its strong relationship with Israel,
that Israel continues
to be
one of the United States closest
and perhaps
most important allies in the Middle East.
But again,
we have seen those
tensions mounting,
particularly between President Biden
and the Israeli Prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
They are expected to meet, of course,
on Thursday.
Netanyahu now also expected to meet with
with Donald Trump formally as president,
and of course, also with Kamala Harris.
So important meetings taking place.
But all eyes will be on that
congressional address later today,
expectations around what he might say.
And of course, the reaction,
crucially from the Democrats as well,
and all of the very real dynamics
that you laid out,
particularly on the humanitarian front,
playing out in the politics of
who will attend Netanyahu's address.
surely not a Beshear.
Thank you so much for the reporting.
Now, the head of the opposition
Labor Party in Israel is blasting
the trip.
Yeah, your goal and posting on it,
saying, quote,
Netanyahu went to the US
for an extravagant show
in the middle of the war
without a deal to return hostages.
I want to bring in CNN
global affairs analyst Mark Esper.
He was U.S.
defense secretary under President Trump.
good to see you.
Thanks for being here.
Now, Secretary of State
Antony Blinken says
they're inside the ten yard line,
driving toward the goal line
and getting a cease fire.
That's his metaphor, not mine.
But in getting a cease fire
and hostage agreement
that would produce, a cease fire.
How optimistic
are you of a deal
getting done at this stage?
And what do you make of Netanyahu
appearing before Congress
without a finalized deal?
Right.
Well, I was
actually with,
Jake Sullivan and Tony Blinken
this past weekend in Aspen,
and we talked about this
and both believe are confident
that we're within the ten yard line,
as you said.
But they also note that the often
those last
ten yards are the most difficult.
look, I would say in some ways
we've been here before.
There have been numerous proposals
on the table for Hamas.
at the last minute
they've raised the ante with,
asking for adjustments
and amendments and so forth.
So we'll see.
I mean, there is hope
that there will be
some type of agreement,
but my view has been that
Hamas is not going to be interested
in any deal
that does not call
for a complete cease fire
and the removal of all Israeli
troops from Gaza.
And,
I see the Israeli government,
Netanyahu unwilling to go there yet.
if you look,
the polling shows that a majority of,
Israelis want to see,
no more Hamas in Gaza.
And they are very concerned
about what might happen
if, if Hamas is not dismantled.
So I think they're probably further apart
than we would like,
but we'll see what happens
in the coming days.",20240724
RUUqUNYFcmo,‘Iran’s useful idiots’: Netanyahu calls out protesters during speech to Congress,data/en_CNN\‘Iran’s useful idiots’ Netanyahu calls out protesters during speech to Congress.jpg,"We recently learned from the national
security director, a director of U.S.
Director of National Intelligence,
that Iran is funding
and promoting anti-Israel
protests in America.
They want to disrupt America.
So these protesters burned
American flags even on the 4th of July.
And I wish to salute
the fraternity brothers
at the University of North Carolina
who protected the American flag,
protected the American flag against these
anti-Israel protesters.
For all we know,
Iran is funding
the anti-Israel protests
that are going on
right now outside this building.
Not that many, but they're there
and throughout the city.
Well, I have a message
for these protesters.
When the tyrants of Tehran
who hang gays from cranes
and murder women
for not covering
their hair are praising,
promoting and funding you.
You have officially become
Iran's useful idiots.
Some of these protesters.
That's amazing.
Absolutely amazing.
Some of these protesters
hold up signs proclaiming gays for Gaza.
They might as well hold up
signs saying chickens for KFC.
These protesters chant
from the river to the sea.
But many don't have a clue what river
and what sea they're talking about.
They're not only good enough
in geography,
they've got enough in history.
They call Israel.
They call Israel a colonialist state.
Don't they know that the land of Israel
is where Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob prayed,
where Isaiah and Jeremiah preach,
and where David and Solomon ruled?
For nearly 4000 years.
The land of Israel has been the homeland
of the Jewish people.
It's always been our home.
It will always be our home.
It's not only the campus protesters
who get it wrong.
It's also the people
who run those campuses.
80 years after the Holocaust.
The presidents of Harvard, Penn.
And I'm ashamed to say,
my alma mater, MIT,
couldn't bring themselves
to condemn
the calls for the genocide of Jews.
You remember what they said?
They said it depends on the context.
Well, let me give these
befuddled academics a little context.
anti-Semitism is the world's
oldest hatred.
For centuries.
The massacre of Jews was always preceded
by wild accusations.
We were accused of everything
from poisoning wells
to spreading plagues,
to using the blood
of slaughtered children
to make Passover martyrs.
These preposterous anti-Semitic lies
led to persecution, mass murder,
and ultimately to history's
worst genocide. The Holocaust.
Now, just as malicious lies
were leveled for centuries
at the Jewish people.
Malicious lies are now being leveled at
the Jewish state.
No, no, don't applaud.
Listen.
The outrageous slanders that paint Israel
as racist and genocidal
are meant to delegitimize Israel.
To demonize the Jewish state
and to demonize Jews everywhere.
And no wonder,
no wonder we've witnessed
an appalling rise of anti-Semitism
in America and around the world.
My friends,
whenever and wherever
we see the scourge of anti-Semitism,
we must unequivocally condemn it
and resolute to fight it.
Without exception.
And don't be fooled.
When the blood libels
against the Jewish state
come from people who wear
fancy silk robes and speak in lofty tones
about law and justice.
Here's a case in point.
The prosecutor
of the International Criminal Court
has shamefully accused Israel.
He continued to bring back to Iran,
the country that is,
by all accounts, funding and supporting
not just Hamas in Gaza, but Hezbollah
in the north, in Lebanon and the Houthis.
So this is
this was
another really important
overarching theme.
You know, that
Netanyahu, understandably,
has been obsessed with the
the growth and the strength
and the determination of Iran
to eradicate Israel.
And what he did here
was to continue to connect
for an American audience
and an Israeli audience.
But Israel
doesn't need to be educated on this,
but more for an American audience
that Iran isn't just out for Israel.
Iran is out for Americans
to topple American democracy.
No. That's right.
And he called the protesters
Iran's useful idiots.
Relish going
after the protesters,
saying that they didn't
realize, did not know the history,
know the context,
know how oppressive
the Iranian regime is.
And he relished it.
I mean, this was,
you know, he was going
after these protesters,
going after the leaders
of some of these schools.
He called them befuddled academics.
We're ten months into this conflict.
We're 100 days out
from a presidential election.
In some ways,
the conflict has fallen off the radar
of many Americans.
It's going to start back up, right.
If you think about what's happening
in the context
of some of these campus protesters,
they're going to go back to school.
There's going to be a DNC convention
in Chicago
expected to be a lot of protesters.
There.
So this is very much
going to be top of mind
heading into this election.
And we don't quite know.
We don't have,
you know, an idea
yet of what
Trump would really do in office.
It's something he hasn't really detailed.
And we also don't know,
what a Kamala Harris
administration would do
and how that would be different
from a Biden administration
to think of that reception
he received in the Congress.
So that was powerful.
It was powerful.
Listen, and these are Republicans
mostly, a lot of the Democrats income,
although some Democrats were there
and they were standing up and cheering.
And listen, there is a sense,
that Americans do
need to be more educated
on what's going on
there, on the history of anti-Semitism,
on the ways
in which,
antisemitism tropes led to the Holocaust.
And so there was a teachable
moments, right?
when he was trying to educate people
in terms of the history.
Jeremy Diamond is in Israel, and Jeremy,
I wanted to ask you about the hostages.
And I talked to right before this speech
to the parents of one of the,
Israeli and American hostages,
Don Alexander.
And there were
they the parents were there
other family members of hostages?
Were there?
We didn't.
We did see the Prime minister,
call out some of them,
acknowledge some of them.
And then when it comes
to the big question that they all have,
when are my family members
going to come home? He did promise that.
But just like David
and Barack were saying, not a lot knew
that we heard from him
about getting to that point
with a deal with Hamas,
with the help of Qatar and America.
Yeah, that's right,
that I think
the Israeli prime
minister paid a lot of lip service
to the issue of the hostages.
He talked about it
during a section of his speech.
But if you look
at the overall context of the speech,
the overall content of what
the Israeli prime minister said,
he talked far,
far more about achieving victory
in this war
against Hamas,
about destroying
Hamas's military capabilities and,
vowing
we will fight until we achieve victory.
He said some, a phrase, like that
a few different times
throughout the speech,
he talked about that
far more than he did.
This ceasefire agreement, which U.S.
officials, as well as Israeli officials
have indicated to me in recent
days, is very much within reach.
One official actually told me
that it's now up to Israel,
and it's now up to the Israeli
prime minister, effectively to decide
whether or not he actually wants a deal.
And as Barack was saying there,
the Israeli prime
minister has told his delegation
to hold off on traveling,
to, meet with the mediators
and share Israel's
latest response
until after
he meets with President Biden tomorrow,
effectively pushing off,
that trip by the delegation
most likely until after Shabbat.
So that would probably be on Sunday.
But I think beyond that, Dan,
I think what we also need to do here
is fact
check a few key
things that the Israeli Prime
Minister said,
because he made several claims here
that attempted
to not only defend the Israeli
military's conduct in Gaza,
but that also flew in the face of
many of the facts on the ground
when he was talking about the ICC's claim
that Israel is starving people of Gaza.
You know, he
he talked about big numbers of aid
getting in,
but there is just very,
very clear evidence.
You talk to any humanity, an organization
that actually works on the ground
in Gaza, the United Nations.
And even when you look at Israel
in the way
that they have turned on
and back off the faucet of aid to Gaza,
there is clear evidence
that Israel has not always allowed enough
aid in that.
They have not done enough
to conflict militarily,
to provide safe routes
for that aid to get in.
And you also have to remember that
ministers, members of his
of Netanyahu's own government
called for starving the people of Gaza
in the earliest days of the war.
Then he also made this
frankly laughable claim
that there are practically
no civilians who were killed in Rafah.
I can think of several strikes
in which civilians were killed.
So that just doesn't
even pass the smell test.
And then he once again cited,
this West Point
expert, John Spencer, claiming
that Israel has the lowest
civilian casualty ratio.
You talk to any other expert
on the conduct of militaries in warfare,
including how the United States
has carried out its campaigns.
And they will all say that
Israel has not taken,
nearly as many precautions
as most modern militaries do,
in warfare in Gaza.",20240724
jJkdgDneBho,"Flags burned, monuments graffitied and US flags replaced with Palestinian ones by protesters","data/en_CNN\Flags burned, monuments graffitied and US flags replaced with Palestinian ones by protesters.jpg","Jonathan, you came from this address.
You were in the hall in the,
the House chamber.
What was your impression of the speech?
Knowing that he had multiple audiences
there?
Yeah, it was pretty extraordinary,
Deanna.
I mean, to be there
in the chamber watching
Prime Minister Netanyahu deliver
those remarks were few things
that stood out for me.
Number one, it was a unity message.
Like, literally,
you had Democrats and Republicans
standing up and applauding.
You know,
I thought there was going to be
lots of empty seats.
There simply weren't.
It was a pretty full house.
And he complimented President Biden
and praised him as Jamie, said Andy
Kaufman of President Trump
of the Abraham Accords.
So he was sort of finding a way to praise
both sides.
That's number one.
Number two,
he talked about anti-Semitism.
He talked about what's happening
on our college campuses,
what's happening in the streets,
and how that is not just about protesting
policies of the government.
You're seeing people going
after Zionists and Jews.
And literally
while he was speaking outside
of the Capitol,
you had people
burning American flags
in front of Union Station.
I saw signs
as they came over here to the studio,
people saying things like,
any resistance is justified.
I mean, comparing that
those kind of that kind of language,
when you think about the babies
who were burned
and the women who were raped.
So he talked about that.
That was important.
And then thirdly,
I think he laid out a path forward.
He talked about hostages
and needs to get them home.
They talked about what a future
could look like for Israel
and a demilitarized Gaza,
like a vision of peace.
That, to me was really quite welcome.
But there are a lot of
dozens of Democrats boycotted the speech,
didn't show up.
A lot of those seats
where the Democrats
would have been seated
were congressional staffers
just showing up.
They're sitting there.
You know,
there may have been some empties,
but I watched Hakeem Jeffries
stand and applaud.
I watched Chuck Schumer
stand and applaud.
I watched almost every Democratic senator
stand and applaud.
So I hear what you're saying.
But I got to say,
I saw unity in that room.
I saw him try to appeal to both sides,
and I saw
people from both parties respond.
What you do at the ADL
is try to stamp out hate.
Of course, anti-Semitism, hate against
phobia, Islamophobia, racism, all of it.
How do you think that
Netanyahu's attempt to do that in
his speech is going to play?
I mean, I was getting a text from,
one American Jew
who said, okay,
it's fine
to call people useful idiots,
but how about,
like, a slight nod to people
who are genuinely upset about the,
what's happening in Gaza?
Well, I, I'm not.
And understanding
that you're also saying
the signs that you just described,
which is just plain hate.
And he talked about the director
of national intelligence
acknowledging a few weeks ago
that Iran is involved in these protests,
something we've been seeing NATO
for a long time.
But he did something
very interesting, Diana,
before the speech really got started.
He called out some of the folks
that he had brought over
as part of his delegation,
including, for example,
a Bedouin soldier.
Which was interesting, cause
I think most Americans
don't realize there
Israeli Muslims in the IDF.
And then he had an Ethiopian
Israeli soldier
who ran eight miles on October the 7th.
So I point this out
because he demonstrated
the diversity of Israeli society.
I think you pointed this out earlier
in a way that surprised a lot of people.
He could have come with
just decorated Jewish veterans.
He didn't do that.
He brought a more diverse delegation.
And I think that sends a message.
I just
to push back
just a little bit
about about all the unity,
you know,
several Israelis
from both sides of the aisle
were texting me during the speech.
And what I heard from them
is that that was, in effect,
a very celebratory speech.
that really does not fit
and that there is an alternate
reality on the ground
that's going on
both in Gaza and in Israel.
As we know,
in the north, 60,000
plus Israelis, are displaced.
There has been an extraordinary impact
on the economy.
And then, of course,
there is the devastating reality
of the number of deaths
in Gaza,
Palestinians, the humanitarian disaster.
So, he had a welcome
audience there today, but he did ignore
what I'm hearing from Israelis
is a very dire reality on the ground.
Look,
there is no question
that that is an incredibly
difficult situation.
And every civilian life
lost is a tragedy.
Every Palestinian
woman or child
who was killed inadvertently,
no matter what the IDF tries to do,
that is a tragedy.
We should mourn every
one of those deaths.
But he talked about, for example,
the dire situation in Gaza
and how they are trying
to bring in supplies.
He talked about the situation
in the North, like you're pointing out,
and the need to bring those people back
to their homes, 60 or 80,000 Israelis.
And he talked about the need
to bring the hostages home.
I know at ADL
and we're folks
at fighting
aid here at home,
but we all wear the dog tags
because we want these civilians,
these innocent people back,
including, by the way, dozens of them.
I think
maybe it's eight Americans at this point.
So I think he tried to address
that, Jamie.
But look, if you've lost a child,
if you're I think about my friends,
the Polands.
I was with the Nazis before we came on.
Their. Their sons are both held in Gaza.
I can't even begin to grasp
the unspeakable pain
they deal with every day.
We have got to get those kids home.
So I hope they get a deal very fast.
So we can see on air.
And we can see Hersh back
home, safe and sound.
And all the hostages, once and for all.
Hope there is a deal
that will bring those hostages
home as quickly as possible.
Jonathan Greenblatt, thanks very much.
Jamie, thanks to you as well.
I want to go see this,
began Mark,
as he's
been covering the demonstrators
out there in the streets of Washington.
Jamie, give us a sense
of what's been going on.
lots and lots of
demonstrators and protesters
throughout the Capitol
around the Capitol building.
But I won't say it all ended here
at Union Station.
This is the remnants of one U.S.
flag that was burned here
over in the distance.
So you can see the the ashes there.
That's the remnants of another flag.
I want to show you
sort of the bell over here, though.
The liberty, the copy of the Liberty Bell
that's out in front of the station
that's been covered in graffiti.
And then the Columbus Memorial
has also been covered in graffiti here.
And, Jonathan,
if you can show all three U.S.
flags on the three flagpoles,
massive flag poles out in front of Union
Station have been pulled down
and Palestinian flags
have been put up in their place.
Most the protesters
a few dozen,
maybe 100 or so, still gathered here.
Most of the protesters have left,
but you can see the number
of police officers
in front of Union Station.
And I'm looking over across the way here,
and there are lots of
police with shields now
and heavy vehicles.
So it looks like most
protesters are leaving
and police will come back in
and bring this place back to order.
Well all right media,
let's hope it's peaceful over there.
Bigo Marquez reporting for us.
Thanks very much. Now.
Thank you so much.
And with us
now is Republican Senator
John Thune of South Dakota.
Senator,
thank you so much for being here.
Really great to see you
and to have you here.
first, generally speaking, your reaction
to Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks.
strong speech.
And, as as is
usually the case with,
the Prime minister,
very well articulated.
and I thought he
he hit all the right points.
I think the one thing that he needs
to do for people in this country,
and for that matter, people,
all around
the world is connect
the dots back to Iran.
And the fact that Israel
is the only thing standing
between Iran and the United States,
which they consider
to be the great Satan.
And so Iran is behind
all the mining activities in that region.
whether it's Hezbollah in the
in the north or the Houthis in Yemen,
or Hamas, right there in the Gaza Strip.
But I thought he was really effective in
in that in particular,
and also articulating a vision
of what it could like,
could look like in the future
if you had an integrated Middle East
and a direct allies demilitarized, Gaza.
And that, of course,
means that you've got to get
rid and eliminate Hamas.
I want to get back to
what you were just talking about.
Back to the Prime
Minister speech in a second.
I'm not sure if you were able
to hear our reporter, Miguel Marquez,
who was talking about
the protesters outside.
Specifically, he was reporting on
and showing,
the American flag being lowered,
the Palestinian flag being raised.
We even saw some red triangles.
we're showing it now.
I don't know if you can see it,
but we even saw some red triangles
on some of the statues.
what's your reaction to that?
Well, I think it's it's disgraceful.
It's, shameful
and the kind of thing that we shouldn't
see in this country.
But again,
as the Prime Minister pointed out
today, a lot of these activities
that are happening here
in the United States,
Iran is behind them.
They are trying to create
tumult and instability and chaos and,
use in fueling all these protests
and the violence, particularly
the anti-Semitic violence
in this country.
that's Iranian activity.
And that's why they have to be stopped,
and that's
why it's so important
that we continue to support Israel,
including, as the Prime minister said,
give us the tools faster
and we will finish the job.
they've got to get this, this thing
over with and,
and send a clear statement to the world
that this kind of behavior
and the kind of thing
that we're seeing right here in the U.S.
and right here in this city today,
just can't be tolerated.
Senator,
one of Prime Minister Netanyahu's
predecessors, Ehud Barak,
who we understand
and we should tell our viewers
who might not know,
is not from the same party
as Prime Minister Netanyahu.
and but nonetheless, he has somebody he's
somebody who has been intimately involved
in trying to get to peace.
He almost got there,
when Bill Clinton
had him
and Yasser Arafat in 2000,
here in the United States.
He said
very, very strongly
and very clearly to Wolf,
that he does not believe
that Prime Minister Netanyahu
actually wants to end the war
because it would mean
the end of his own political viability
at home.
And that might even mean,
that hostages stay longer.
Are you concerned about
I mean, you're a politician.
You understand what's going on in Israel?
Are you concerned about the notion
that Bibi Netanyahu
isn't trying as hard
as he can to get this deal because of
his own concerns about his own future?
I don't think that
I've met with him in Israel.
I've met with, Ehud Barak in Israel,
previously as well.
And obviously they have
political differences there.
But those aside,
my sense coming out of this was is
he is desperate to end this
because this is putting the lives
of Israeli citizens at
risk every single day.",20240724

Hirsh Goldberg,
Poland,

Rachel, I'll start with you.
You and John attended.
Prime Minister Netanyahu speech.
What was your main takeaway?
Look, as parents of
one of the American eight,
we were saddened.
We were disappointed.
We really wanted to hear
that the Prime Minister
was on the brink of signing this deal,
or that he was going to announce,
I have signed
or we are signing right now,
this first phase of the deal,
just to get some movement going.
And we didn't hear that.
So we are laser focused.
And that's obviously,
as any parent can appreciate
our main objective. We didn't get that.
And so we are
continuing to be broken
and moving forward
and trying to be hopeful and optimistic.
And John,
we interview
a lot of hostage families on this show.
and we've heard from many of them
who believe that
Prime Minister Netanyahu doesn't
actually want a hostage deal
any time soon.
so that the work continues.
He gets to remain prime minister.
I know you're reluctant to wade
into the politics of this,
but what's your assessment of it all?
My assessment is that the
Prime Minister wants to do a deal.
I think he understands
that there could be no victory
without bringing home the hostages.
I think that as the son of an historian
and somebody who himself
appreciates history,
the Prime Minister understands
that his legacy is going to be
very much
shaped by whether or not
he's able to bring home these hostages.
So I know he wants to get this done
as all of the families.
What we're trying to push on
is Doctor King's fierce urgency of now,
and we need this to happen
in the next few days.
We believe there's an opportunity,
and so we hope
that that's going to happen.
And, hopefully today's speech
solidified the support
from both sides of the aisle
that we know has been present,
but that we think that the Prime Minister
is going to take out of Washington
this week,
and it's going to give him the energy
and the
everything he needs to go out
and get this deal done imminently.
Senator Ernst,
Prime Minister
Netanyahu has been accused
of making the speech
just to shore up support,
back home domestically, back in Israel,
he's also been accused of trying
to stoke division in the U.S.
domestically because
obviously his leadership is is,
not universally praised, shall we say?
I think about 80 Democrats from Congress,
did not attend.
Many of them were
meeting with hostage families.
how do you see it all?
Well, I do think it's important
that the Prime minister
lay out for the United States
what his plan is to return
not only the American eight,
but also all of the hostages.
And we also did hear a little bit
about the day after plan, what he hopes
to accomplish
as soon as the war concludes.
I was able to briefly speak with him
after the speech
and asked him, please,
to get the American hostages home
as quickly as possible,
and he did respond
that they are working on it.
and I also think that the United States
needs to shape and influence
where we can.
We should not tell Israel
how to run the war,
but certainly we can shape and influence,
because we cannot forget
that nearly 40 Americans
were killed on October 7th.
Eight of them were taken hostage.
among those hurt.
So we need to do what we can as America
to help Israel
find a way to win this war
and bring our hostages home.
Well, Senator,
given the fact that 40 more than 40
Americans were killed on October
7th and eight
Americans are being held hostage.
What do you make
of the protesters
outside the Capitol today?
I don't know what you saw
in terms of images or video.
but an American flag was burned.
somebody's spray painted on the statue
of Columbus
of Christopher Columbus
outside Union Station.
Hamas is coming with one of those,
red, triangles,
which is a target indication
for Hamas to hit.
these are presumably Americans,
in the street.
what's your reaction?
Well, we do know that Iran funds a number
of these demonstrations
through many means and
and secondary
and tertiary groups
that claim to be maybe nonprofits.
so I would say
Iran is really stoking
the fire here in the United States.
Let's never forget that
they chant death
to Israel as well as death to America.
it's a really sad situation.
I appreciate that
we have our First Amendment
right to to protest,
but to do it
peacefully
and not destroying
other people's property.
so it's really unfortunate
that we see this,
and I think that many of those protesters
don't
fully understand
the loss of American life on October 7th.
They probably have no idea
that eight Americans
are being helped by Hamas.
Hirsh.
We know, was badly
injured by Hamas on October 7th,
and he has yet to be released.
so I would just challenge
those that are out there protesting.
Do they truly know
what they are protesting for
and who they are protesting for?
Rachel, what is it
like for you to see those protesters?
I think,
Senator Ernst, his
interpretation of their ignorance
is some, I'd say, charitable.
what do you think?
Look,
I think part of living in a democracy
is that you have the right
to express your opinions.
And I don't have to agree
with your opinions,
and you don't have to agree
with my opinions.
And I think that that is
part of the vibrancy of living in a place
like America,
where many places in the world,
you don't have that ability
to express yourself.
And I do agree with the senator
that unfortunately,
I think many of the people,
not all,
but many of the people protesting,
don't even understand
the core source and the real,
very textured, complicated background
and history of this conflict.
John, tell us about Hersh.
What do you miss most
about him right now?
So there's so many things
that I miss about Hersh
all day, every day.
But what it boils down to is
I miss what I would call
the simple moments in life
sitting around the dinner table,
sitting at the breakfast table,
just relaxing on the couch at night.
Hersh is a guy who really is
universally liked for,
I would even say loved
by people of all ages.
And it's not because he has a need
to be a big personality
or to take over a room.
He doesn't walk in a room and immediately
make his presence known,
but he, in not a long period of time
after walking
in, will have made his way
into everybody's hearts. And,
we hope we'll be home soon.
And we always say
we're not looking to go to Disney World
or anything big.
We want to get him home,
and we want to relax at home quietly
and with all due respect,
Jake, not be talking to you much more.
Right.
Well, I'm not going to
take offense at that
because I know I know how
you mean it, but,
we're going to keep covering Hersh
and the other four Americans
and the other hostages.
and I know it's not easy to talk about.
I can't imagine what
you're going through, but but thanks to
thanks to you guys.
And thank you, Senator Ernst,
for talking to us today, I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Here are the names of the five
Israeli American hostages
thought to still be alive in Gaza.
20 year old Ethan Alexander.
22 year old Omar Neutra,
23 year old Hirsh Goldberg.
Poland, whose parents
you just heard from
35 year old Siggy Declan and 65 year
old Keith Samuel Segal,
whose wife we interviewed yesterday.
We do all hope that they get home soon
and there is peace in the region.
The Israeli Prime Minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu,
just gave a fiery speech
in front of a U.S.
Congress deeply
divided over the war in Gaza.
That speech earlier today,
our chief
national security correspondent,
Alex Marquardt, is joining us right now.
Alex, as you know,
there was a lot of speculation
about how Partizan
the speech
would be like his speech back in 2015
at Congress.
What happened today?
Well, Wolf,
and that's because that speech
nine years ago was quite bombastic.
And the Obama Biden administration
was furious afterwards.
This time, it was not nearly as Partizan.
There was a lot of thanks for the U.S.
for their support of Israel, particularly
during this war in Gaza.
There was a lot of
thanks for both
President Biden and President Trump.
he spent a lot of time Netanyahu did,
speaking about the hostages
and bringing them home.
Critics of Netanyahu say
that he's not doing
nearly enough to bring them
home, in fact, that he's delaying it.
I have just learned, Wolf,
from a source that there are talks about,
getting the negotiations
back up and running early next week
with the top mediators,
including the CIA director, Bill Burns.
Now, as Netanyahu was speaking,
protests were raging on
the streets of Washington.
And we've seen these
anti-Israel protests for months.
Netanyahu painted these
anti-Israel protesters
as supporters of Hamas and pawns of Iran.
Take a listen.
I think that
I think many anti-Israel protesters,
many choose to stand with evil.
They stand with Hamas.
They stand with rapists and murderers.
You have officially become
Iran's useful idiots.
Useful idiots.
That's going to be one of the phrases
remembered from this speech.
Now he is referencing newly released U.S.
intelligence that says
that Iran has been cementing
and financing some of these anti
anti-Israel protests here in the U.S.
but that intelligence,
notably Wolf, goes on to say
that Americans
who participate in
these protests are in good faith,
expressing their views
on the conflict in Gaza.
Now, Netanyahu also pushed
back on the civilian death toll
and the lack of aid
for Palestinians in Gaza.
Take a listen to this.
Despite
all the lies you've heard,
the war in Gaza
has one of the lowest ratios
of combatants
to noncombatants
casualties
in the history of urban warfare.
If there are Palestinians in Gaza
who aren't getting enough food, it's
not because Israel is blocking it.
It's because Hamas is stealing it.
Now, Wolf, a bit of a fact check there.
The the death toll in Gaza
is believed to be close to 40,000,
even if we take out the number of Hamas
militants.
Israel has argued
that they have killed some 14,000.
The civilian death
toll is still more than 1%
of the overall population of Gaza,
likely higher.
That is shockingly high, Wolf.
As far as the aid goes, U.S.
officials continue to argue that it is
Israel's military operation
that makes it very difficult
for the aid to be distributed,
and has caused a breakdown
in the security in the Gaza Strip.
Wolf.
Jonathan, you came from this address.
You were in the hall in the,
the House chamber.
What was your impression of the speech?
Knowing that he had multiple audiences
there?
Yeah, it was pretty extraordinary, Diana.
I mean, to be there
in the chamber watching
Prime Minister Netanyahu deliver
those remarks were few things
that stood out for me.
Number one, it was a unity message.
Like, literally,
you had Democrats and Republicans
standing up and applauding.
You know,
I thought there was going to be
lots of empty seats.
There simply weren't.
It was a pretty full house.
And he complimented
President Biden and praised him,
as Jamie said, and
of President Trump
of the Abraham Accords.
So he was sort of finding a way to praise
both sides.
That's number one.
Number two,
he talked about anti-Semitism.
He talked about what's happening
on our college campuses,
what's happening in the streets,
and how that is not just about protesting
policies of the government.
You're seeing people going
after Zionists
and Jews and literally
while he was speaking outside
the Capitol,
you had people
burning American flags
in front of Union Station.
I saw signs
as I came over here to the studio.
People saying things like,
any resistance is justified.
I mean, comparing that
those kind of that kind of language,
when you think about the babies
who were burned
and the women who were raped.
So he talked about that.
That was important.
And then thirdly,
I think he laid out a path forward.
He talked about hostages
and the needs to get them home.
They talked about what a future
could look like
for Israel and a demilitarized Gaza,
like a vision of peace.
That, to me was really quite welcome.
But there are a lot of
dozens of Democrats boycotted the speech,
didn't show up.
A lot of those seats
where the Democrats
would have been seated
were congressional staffers
just showing up.
They're sitting there.
You know,
there may have been some empties,
but I watched Hakeem Jeffries
stand and applaud.
I watched Chuck Schumer
stand and applaud.
I watched almost every Democratic senator
stand and applaud.
So I hear what you're saying.
But I got to say,
I saw unity in that room.
I saw him try to appeal to both sides,
and I saw
people from both parties respond.
What you
what you do at
the ADL is try to stamp out hate.
Of course, anti-Semitism,
some hate against racism, phobia,
Islamophobia, racism, all of it.
How do you think that
Netanyahu's attempt to do that in
his speech is going to play?
I mean, I was getting a text from,
one American Jew
who said, okay,
it's fine
to call people useful idiots,
but how about,
like, a slight nod to people
who are genuinely upset about the,
what's happening in Gaza?
Well, I, I'm not.
And understanding
that you're also seeing
the signs that you just described,
which is just plain hate.
And he talked about the director
of national intelligence
acknowledging a few weeks ago
that Iran is involved in these protests,
something we've been seeing NATO
for a long time.
But he did something very interesting.
Diana, before
the speech really got started.
He called out some of the folks
that he had brought over
as part of his delegation,
including, for example,
a Bedouin soldier.
Which was interesting cause
I think most Americans don't realize
there are Israeli Muslims in the IDF.
Many had an Ethiopian Israeli soldier
who ran eight miles on October the 7th.
So I point this out
because he demonstrated
the diversity of Israeli society.
I think you pointed this out earlier
in a way that surprised a lot of people.
He could have come with
just decorated Jewish veterans.
He didn't do that.
He brought a more diverse delegation.
And I think that sends a message.
I just
to push back
just a little bit
about about all the unity.
You know, several Israelis
from both sides of the aisle
were texting me during the speech.
And what I heard from them
is that that was, in effect,
a very celebratory speech.
that really does not fit
and that there is an alternate
reality on the ground
that's going on
both in Gaza and in Israel.
As we know,
in the north,
60,000 plus Israelis, are displaced.
There has been an extraordinary impact
on the economy.
And then, of course,
there is the devastating reality
of the number of deaths in Gaza.
Palestinians, the humanitarian disaster.
So, he had a welcome
audience there today, but he did ignore
what I'm hearing from Israelis
is a very dire reality on the ground.
Look,
there is no question
that that is an incredibly
difficult situation.
And every civilian life
lost is a tragedy.
Every Palestinian
woman or child
who is killed inadvertently,
no matter what the IDF tries to do,
that is a tragedy.
We should mourn every
one of those deaths.
But he talked about, for example,
the dire situation in Gaza
and how they are trying
to bring in supplies.
He talked about the situation
in the North, like you're pointing out,
and the need to bring those people
back to their homes,
60 or 80,000 Israelis.
And he talked about the need
to bring the hostages home.
I know
at ADL, again,
we're folks at fighting aid here at home,
but we all wear the dog tags
because we want these civilians,
these innocent people back.
Including, by the way, doesn't have a
I think
maybe it's eight Americans at this point.
So I think he tried to address
that, Jamie.
But look, if you've lost a child,
if you are,
I think about my friends,
the Poland I was with the Nazis
before we came on.
Their their sons are both held in Gaza.
I can't even begin to grasp
the unspeakable pain
they deal with every day.
We have got to get those kids home.
So I hope they get a deal very fast.
So we can see on air.
And we can see Hersh back
home, safe and sound.
And all the hostages, once and for all.
Hope there's a deal
that will bring those hostages
home as quickly as possible.
Jonathan Greenblatt, thanks very much.
Jamie, thanks to you as well.
I want to go to CNN's Miguel Marquez.
He's been covering the demonstrators
out there in the streets of Washington.
Jamie, give us a sense
of what's been going on.
lots and lots of
demonstrators and protesters
throughout the Capitol
around the Capitol building.
But I want to show you
all of the here at Union Station.
This is the remnants of one U.S.
flag that was burned here
over in the distance.
So you can see the the ashes there.
That's the remnants of another flag.
I want to show you
sort of the bell over here, though.
The liberty, the copy of the Liberty Bell
that's out in front of the station
that's been covered in graffiti.
And then the Columbus Memorial
has also been covered in graffiti here.
And, Jonathan,
if you can show all three of U.S.
flags on the three flagpoles,
massive flagpoles out in front of Union
Station have been pulled down
and Palestinian flags
have been put up in their place.
Most of the protesters
a few dozen,
maybe 100 or so, still gathered here.
Most of the protesters have left,
but you can see the number
of police officers
in front of Union Station.
And I'm looking over
to across the way here.
And there are lots of
police with shields now
and heavy vehicles.
So it looks like
most of the protesters are leaving
and police will come back in
and bring this place back to order.
Well,
all right, Miguel,
let's hope it's peaceful over there.
Bigo Marquez reporting for us.
Thanks very much. Now.
Thank you so much.
And with us
now is Republican Senator
John Thune of South Dakota.
Senator,
thank you so much for being here.
Really great to see you
and to have you here.
first, generally speaking, your reaction
to Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks,
strong speech.
And, as as is
usually the case with,
the Prime minister,
very well articulated.
and I thought he
he hit all the right points.
Dan, I think the one thing that he needs
to do for people in this country
and for that matter, people,
all around the world,
is connect the dots back to Iran.
And the fact that Israel
is the only thing standing
between Iran and the United States,
which they consider
to be the great Satan.
And so Iran is behind
all the mining activities in that region.
whether it's Hezbollah
in the, in the north
or the Houthis in Yemen,
or Hamas, right there in the Gaza Strip.
But I thought he was really effective
in in that in particular.
And also articulating a vision
of what it could like,
could look like in the future
if you had an integrated Middle East
and a radicalized, demilitarized,
Gaza and that,
of course, means that you've got to
get rid and eliminate Hamas.
I want to get back to
what you were just talking about.
Back to the Prime Minister's
speech in a second.
I'm not sure if you were able
to hear our reporter, Miguel Marquez,
who was talking about
the protesters outside.
Specifically, he was reporting on
and showing,
the American flag being lowered,
the Palestinian flag being raised.
We even saw some red triangles.
we're showing it now.
I don't know if you can see it,
but we even saw some red triangles
on some of the statues.
what's your reaction to that?
Well, I think it's it's disgraceful.
It's, shameful
and the kind of thing that we shouldn't
see in this country.
But again,
as the Prime Minister pointed out
today, a lot of these activities
that are happening here
in the United States,
Iran is behind them.
They are trying to create
tumult and instability and chaos and,
use in fueling all these protests
and the violence, particularly
the anti-Semitic violence
in this country.
that's Iranian activity.
And that's why they have to be stopped,
and that's
why it's so important
that we continue to support Israel,
including, as the Prime minister said,
give us the tools faster
and we will finish the job.
they've got to get this, this thing
over with and,
and send a clear statement to the world
that this kind of behavior
and the kind of thing
that we're seeing right here in the U.S.
and right here in this city today,
just can't be tolerated.
Senator,
one of Prime Minister Netanyahu's
predecessors, Ehud Barak,
who we understand
and we should tell our viewers
who might not know, is
not from the same party
as Prime Minister Netanyahu.
but nonetheless, he has somebody he's
somebody who has been intimately involved
in trying to get to peace.
He almost got there,
when Bill Clinton
had him
and Yasser Arafat in 2000,
here in the United States,
he said
very, very strongly
and very clearly to Wolf
that he does not believe
that Prime Minister Netanyahu
actually wants to end the war
because it would mean
the end
of his own political viability at home.
And that might even mean,
that hostages stay longer.
Are you concerned about
I mean, you're politician.
You understand what's going on in Israel?
Are you concerned about the notion
that Bibi Netanyahu
isn't trying as hard
as he can to get this deal because of
his own concerns about his own future?
I don't think that
I've met with him in Israel.
I've met with, Ehud Barak in Israel,
previously as well.
And obviously they have
political differences there.
But those aside,
my sense coming out of this was is
he is desperate to end this
because this is putting the lives
of Israeli citizens
at risk every single day.
He continued to bring back to Iran,
the country that is,
by all accounts, funding and supporting
not just, Hamas in Gaza, but Hezbollah,
in the north, in Lebanon and,
the Houthis.
So this is
this was
another really important over
arching theme, you know, that Netanyahu,
understandably, has been obsessed
with the the growth and the strength
and the determination of Iran
to eradicate Israel.
And what he did here
was to continue to connect
for an American audience
and an Israeli audience.
But Israel
doesn't need to be educated on this,
but more for an American audience
that Iran isn't just out for Israel.
Iran is out for American
to topple American democracy.
No. That's right.
And he called the protesters
Iranians useful idiots.
Relish going
after, the protesters,
saying that they didn't
realize did not know the history.
You know the context,
know how oppressive
the Iranian regime is.
And he relished it.
I mean, this was,
you know, he was going
after these protesters, going after,
the leaders of some of these schools.
He called them befuddled, academics.
We're ten months into this conflict.
We're 100 days out
from a presidential election.
In some ways,
the conflict has fallen off the radar
of many Americans.
It's going to start back up, right.
If you think about what's happening
in the context
of some of these campus protesters,
they're going to go, back to school.
There's going to be a DNC convention
in Chicago,
expected to be a lot of protesters there.
So this is very much
going to be top of mind,
heading into this election.
And we don't quite know.
We don't have,
you know, an idea
yet of what
Trump would really do in office.
It's something he hasn't really detailed.
And we also don't know,
what a Kamala
Harris administration would do
and how that would be different
from a Biden administration.
Think of that reception
he received in the Congress.
So that was powerful.
It was powerful. Listen.
And these are Republicans
mostly, a lot of the Democrats income,
although some Democrats were there
and they were standing up and cheering.
And listen, there is a sense,
that Americans do
need to be more educated
on what's going on
there, on the history of anti-Semitism,
on the ways
in which,
anti-Semitic Semitic tropes
led to the Holocaust.
And so there was a teachable
moments, right?
when he was trying to educate people
in terms of the history.
Jeremy Diamond is in Israel.
And, Jeremy,
I wanted to ask you about the hostages.
And I talked to right before this speech
to the parents of one of the,
Israeli and American hostages.
Don Alexander.
And there were they the parents?
Were there other family
members of hostages were there?
We didn't.
We did see the Prime minister.
call out some of them,
acknowledge some of them.
And then when it comes
to the big question that they all have,
when are my family members
going to come home? He did promise that.
But just like David
and Barack were saying, not a lot
knew that.
We heard from him
about getting to that point
with a deal with Hamas,
with the help of Qatar and America.
Yeah, that's right,
that I think
the Israeli prime
minister paid a lot of lip service
to the issue of the hostages.
He talked about it
during a section of his speech.
But if you look
at the overall context of the speech,
the overall content of what
the Israeli prime minister said,
he talked far, far
more about achieving victory
in this war against Hamas,
about destroying Hamas's
military capabilities and,
vowing we will fight
until we achieve victory.
He said some, a phrase
like that
a few different times
throughout the speech.
He talked about that
far more than he did.
This ceasefire agreement, which U.S.
officials, as well as Israeli officials
have indicated to me in recent
days, is very much within reach.
One official actually told me
that it's now up to Israel,
and it's now up to the Israeli prime
minister, effectively, to decide
whether or not he actually wants a deal.
And as Barack was saying there,
the Israeli prime
minister has told his delegation
to hold off on traveling,
to, meet with the mediators
and share Israel's
latest response
until after
he meets with President Biden tomorrow,
effectively pushing off,
that trip by the delegation
most likely until after Shabbat.
So that would probably be on Sunday.
But I think beyond that, Dan,
I think what we also need to do here
is fact
check a few key
things that the Israeli Prime
Minister said
because he made several claims here
that attempted
to not only defend the Israeli
military's conduct in Gaza,
but that also flew in the face of
many of the facts on the ground
when he was talking about,
the ICC's claim
that Israel is starving people of Gaza.
You know, he
he talked about big numbers of aid
getting in.
But there is just very,
very clear evidence.
You talk to any humanitarian organization
that actually works on the ground
in Gaza, the United Nations.
And even when you look at Israel
in the way
that they have turned on
and back off the faucet of aid to Gaza,
there is clear evidence
that Israel has not always allowed enough
aid in that.
They have not done enough
to conflict militarily,
to provide safe routes
for that aid to get in.
And you also have to remember that
ministers, members of his
of Netanyahu's own government
called for starving the people of Gaza
in the earliest days of the war.
Then he also made this
frankly laughable claim
that there are practically
no civilians who were killed in Rafah.
I can think of several strikes
in which civilians were killed.
So that just doesn't
even pass the smell test.
And then he once again cited,
this West Point
expert, John Spencer, claiming
that Israel has the lowest
civilian casualty ratio.
You talk to any other expert
on the conduct of militaries in warfare,
including how the United States
has carried out its campaigns.
And they will all say that
Israel has not taken,
nearly as many precautions
as most modern militaries do,
in warfare in Gaza.",20240725

In the second phase, the Israeli

It is time for this war to end

Kayla, some strong words
there from the vice president

And it obviously
is coming at an interesting
political moment for her as well
Pam, it's
been the clearest distillation y
that we've seen of Vice Presiden
Harris's own beliefs
and views on this situation.
And I think there's
one line in particular
that sums it up best,
and that is toward the top.
When she said
Israel has a right to defend its
and how it does so matters.
She's
speaking to those who want to se

and want this war to end,
and also those who want to seek

that has inflamed divisions
in this country
as well as around the world,
these are the most forceful word
and the
perhaps the clearest position
that's been laid out on this sit
from this administration so far,
and certainly from the vice
president herself.
And it's worth
noting that
because in listening
to some of her comments up
until this point, aides
of hers, administration official
and those who know her
very well have noted that
substantively, she's not differe
from President Biden on this top
But tonally, rhetorically,
she is that she has a tendency
to speak more forcefully on this
that at times has raised
eyebrows inside the white House.
But then when you look
at the substance of the remarks,
they're actually not that differ
She is now at a crossroads
where she has to decide
what her nuance is on this issue
whether she wants to break
from Biden's position
or whether she wants to stay the
with what the administration
has laid out. Fulsomely so far.
This appearance tonight
appears to be her saying,
this is where I'm going
to be on this matter,
that Israel has a right to defen
and how it does so matters,
and that for people
on all sides of this debate
that she hears them and she sees
Pam. All right. Kayla, thank you
And for more reaction to Vice
President Harris's comments,
I want to bring in
Democratic Congressman
Jason Crow, Colorado.
First off, what is your reaction
What we just heard from Harris.
Well, I agree with your colleagu
that the
the line that we support Israel,
but how it does so matter.
that is a key element to this,
that we can both stand with Isra
and help it defend itself,
but it has to do so consistent
with its values
at the level of civilian
casualties has been unacceptable
and untenable.
And the humanitarian catastrophe
in Gaza
is also not aligned
with our values and our interest
And then finally, her
calling on the American people
to embrace the complexity
of the situation
and the history here
is also really important.
You know,
we have to be able to have
that confidence,
that confidence
to have that conversation.
What's this,
a stronger
stance on Palestinian suffering
than we have heard
from President Biden
in almost ten months of this war
In your view?
Now, I wouldn't compare
it to President Biden.
President Biden has handled this
in a very complicated
and a very strong way.

SeDri9zeCgc,Deadly strike in Golan Heights raises fears of major escalation,data/en_CNN\Deadly strike in Golan Heights raises fears of major escalation.jpg,"We have breaking
news tonight out of the Middle East
where Israeli officials
are vowing to respond
after a deadly strike
in the Golan Heights.
When when
they responded saying at least 11
people were killed,
including children
when rockets fired from Lebanon
hit a football field.
We spoke with former Israeli Prime
minister Naftali Bennett last hour.
He said both Hezbollah
and Lebanon
have effectively declared war on Israel
and Israel must now respond accordingly.
The state of Lebanon
essentially shot a rocket made in Iran.
We know the name of the guy who shot it.
His name is Ali Mahmoud Yesha.
These rockets were made in Iran.
Iranian rockets, 50 kilograms of warhead.
And it's time that we hit back.
Jeremy Diamond is on the ground for us
where this strike hit.
Jeremy, we see it behind you there.
What are you hearing about all of this?
You know,
Jessica, we arrived on the scene
and the mood is very, very heavy here.
The Israeli military now
says that 12 people were killed
and these are all
children and young adults
between the ages of ten and 20.
Several dozen more were injured,
some of them
in very serious condition
at local hospitals.
But this is the deadliest incident
since October 7th on civilians
since the beginning of this conflict,
according to the Israeli military.
And there are now very real concerns
that this could trigger
a broader escalation in this conflict.
But before we get to that,
I do want to bring in Timor here,
who actually lives right across
from this soccer field
where this strike actually happened.
Timor.
You were nearby.
You.
You heard the sirens
and you actually saw this rocket
hit right here? Yeah, I did.
I live about 50 meters across
from the playground on the first floor,
so I have a direct
view of what happened here.
I was just sitting on my desk.
I got my notification
and like, 2 seconds later, maybe less.
I heard the sirens.
I just rushed to the window.
Not even 45 seconds.
I opened the window.
I was just looking straight.
I saw it hit.
I thought I saw the kids
panicking, running around.
And that happened around 6:18 p.m.,
something like that.
And I just ran straight here.
I got here, like, 10 minutes later.
And that's when I arrived to the scene.
And I had, like, a clear
vision of the impact
and of the crater zone.
So that's what I saw.
And so you heard the warning
sirens telling you
that rockets were coming in.
But but it was just seconds.
No, there's not enough time.
That's impossible.
If someone tells you otherwise
that it's impossible, even.
Possible to get to. What, 4 to 5 seconds?
What can you do in 45 seconds?
You can do nothing.
It's like you said,
if I'm saying 5 seconds, maybe I'm just.
It's too long.
I think it's 4 seconds, maybe less.
Like the sirens were still going on.
That's when we heard.
I heard them back then.
I saw it
and I saw the kids
like you know, you're
talking about kids and children also.
They have a reaction time.
They're panicking.
They're going to stress
they need much more time than that.
Even if you have 5 seconds
and you're
completely aware of the situation,
you wouldn't have enough time
to react to this.
And so so once you saw that rocket
actually hit,
you came here, you came to the scene.
I did.
And what what what did you see?
Well, at first I saw the injured
and your children running around.
I saw blood.
They didn't respond to us.
They were panicking.
I saw a lot of guys gathering here.
Most of them didn't go down.
I went down here
and I saw a lot of things
that are way too gruesome to mention
out of respect for the families.
And we tried to help, but it was beyond
our help. There is nothing we can do.
There were injuries that you saw
that were
too gruesome, too critical
for any medical attention.
So there's nothing you can do?
No, I'm not.
I will not go into details,
but there's nothing you can do.
And this
this area around 6 p.m.,
you know, it's summer.
Yeah, it must be.
It's summer.
Kids are playing.
And we kind of got used to the situation
because it's been going on for a while.
We hear the sirens
all the time and we just.
We just got used to it.
Nothing like this ever happened before.
And tell me about this. This community.
I mean, when we came out here,
everyone is around.
Everyone is still up.
It's very late at night.
It's two in the morning,
but everyone is still up.
Everybody must feel very impacted.
It's a very close knit community,
of course.
I mean,
if you look around,
everybody is helping,
trying to prepare for the ceremony
for the funerals tomorrow.
And because everybody knows everybody
and everybody is related to someone
and we know the kids,
we know the children,
all the families is well connected.
And so we stand together
in good or in bad.
And this is what's happening right now.
It's a dark day for our town.
It's a tragedy that hit us all.
And this day will be remembered
for generations to come.
And and it will go down in history
as this is a must
and not just in our town,
in the whole of the country.
As you said, it's the deadliest attack
since the 7th of October.
And it's happened in the
in our small village.
So what is
what is the feeling around here?
Obviously, there's sadness.
Is there anger as well with that?
And and where is
that anger being directed?
I don't know what the answer is.
I mean,
this anger is directed at the war
in general, because, you know, in war
there is no one is winning.
We're all losing.
And the longer it goes
on, the more we're going to lose
and we're helpless.
There is nothing
not much that we can do,
but I think that should be a response
for what's happened here today.
And we will not go quiet
until we get a response
for what's happened here,
because these are our children.
These are our children, you know,
and what's happened
here is unforgettable.
Like, just look at it.
They're just kids playing
soccer, playing football here.
And they didn't even look at the shelter.
It's only like a few meters away,
but I'm quite sure
they didn't have enough time
to get there, even if they were there.
Acted like instantly
there was not enough time. Yeah.
Thank you so much.
Teamwork, Jessica. I do.
I do want to bring you closer
to the scene here because
this is where you can see this crater.
Right here is where that rocket
actually struck.
The Israeli military says that this was
an Iranian made
rocket that they say
is only in Hezbollah's arsenal.
Hezbollah has denied responsibility
for this attack,
but the Israeli military says
that they are clear
that this was Hezbollah
that carried out this attack.
They say that the rocket
was fired from a village
in southern Lebanon.
And you can
they say that this was an Iranian war,
miss a rocket.
Forgive me,
that had a 50 kilo warhead
attached to it.
You can also see behind here
there are bicycles.
This scene is
is effectively frozen
in time from the moment
when this strike happens.
And just to bring you over to the side,
I have my cameraman offset pan around.
You can see how close this is.
That cinderblock building right
there is a safe space.
That is where you rush to
when you hear those sirens.
And so just so devastating
to see
how close
these children were to that shelter.
But obviously,
with just a few seconds to be able
to try and rush into there once
they heard
those sirens was simply simply
not enough.
And the results now
12 people,
according to the Israeli military
who are dead
between the ages of ten and 20
and an entire community here
that is absolutely devastated.
Just it is truly,
truly devastating news,
Jeremy, And clearly just so heartbreaking
for that whole community
and these children
who are just playing soccer
to be targeted in that way.
We know that Prime Minister
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was still in the U.S.
when this happened.
He cut his trip short.
He's now headed back.
We're told
he'll be convening
with his war cabinet upon his arrival.
What are you hearing about
how the government
might be responding to this?
Well, there was a
very swift response
from a number of government officials,
all of them making very clear
that there will be a response
for this attack, a very serious response,
and that the Israeli prime
minister himself said,
I can say that the state of Israel
will not be silence about this.
We will not put this off the agenda.
Benny Gantz,
a former member of the war cabinet,
a member of the opposition.
Now, he came to Majdal Shams
this evening
to meet with community leaders,
and he was also making very clear
that not only will there be a response,
but that the Israeli government
will have his support
as a member of the opposition
for a decisive response in Lebanon,
and that really is now the big question.
There have been fears
not only in Israel but also in the U.S.
government that an incident
like this one with so many casualties,
notably civilian casualties,
and in this case,
many of them
being children,
that an incident
like this
could potentially set off
a very dangerous escalation,
potentially lead to war.
And that is certainly the question
now, is whether or not
the escalation,
the response from Israel
will be so severe
that it could lead to that
all out conflict
with Hezbollah,
that all out war with Hezbollah
that so many have feared.
At this hour,
it is too premature to say
whether or not that will happen.
What is clear
is that we've been hearing
the sounds of jets buzzing above us.
We are very close
to the Lebanese border here.
It is clear that the Israeli military
will respond to this attack,
which they say was carried out
by Hezbollah.
How severe that response will be
will determine
the course of things, will determine
what the counter reaction from Hezbollah
will be
and will determine
whether or not we are headed
for a very,
very dangerous and deadly path Jessica.
Jeremy Diamond, live from Golan Heights,
the new reporting there.
Thank you so much for that.",20240728
5K-aUvgP8sE,‘It wont be Hezbollah alone’: Lebanon’s FM warns against Israeli invasion,data/en_CNN\‘It wont be Hezbollah alone’ Lebanon’s FM warns against Israeli invasion.jpg,"Israel's security cabinet
now authorizing Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu,
as well as Defense Minister Yoav
go on to decide on the country's
response to yesterday's deadly
rocket attack in the Golan Heights.
Already,
the Israeli military say
they have struck
multiple Hezbollah
targets inside Lebanon overnight
and now the region
and the world waits to see
whether this will escalate further.
With us now, Jeremy Diamond,
who's on the scene
in the Golan Heights,
and Ben Wedeman in the Lebanese
capital of Beirut.
Dami, let's start first with you.
We know the international community
is urging restraint on both sides.
What are Israeli
leaders saying right now?
Well, Jessica, there's no question that
there is a flurry of diplomatic activity
right now
trying to de-escalate these tensions,
trying to ensure
that the Israeli response to
what they say was a Hezbollah strike
right here behind me
on this soccer
field will be a limited response.
Israeli officials have not indicated yet
how limited that response will be,
but they have made clear
that there will be a response,
that there will be a price
to pay for this attack that killed 12
children in this community
of Majdal Shams.
The Israeli security
cabinet met this evening once
Prime Minister
Netanyahu returned to Israel
from the United States
authorizing him
and the defense minister, Yoav Gallant,
to try to move forward with a strike
at a time
and with a scope of their choosing.
So remains to be seen
how quickly
that will actually come together.
But right now this is a community
that not only is anticipating
the possibility of that Israeli response
waiting to see what will unfold
from the events that have happened here,
but it is also very much
still a community in mourning.
It is just after midnight
here in Majdal Shams.
And you can see behind me
that there are, you know,
several dozen teenagers
who have come here to just sit together,
to speak to to mourn
quietly and to take in
all that has happened
over the course of these last two days.
Flowers
have now been set up
where that crater still stands.
Lights have also been put up.
This is a very small, tight knit
Syrian Druze community
and they are definitely all feeling
the tremendous impact
of what has happened,
an attack
that has shaken
this community to its core
and in many ways shattered its very soul.
Jessica Hmm.
Jeremy Diamond
All right, Thanks
so much for that reporting.
And Ben, this
this says the Lebanese government
in a tenuous spot.
How are they responding?
Yes, the Lebanese
government
is this really underscores, Jessica,
just how weak the Lebanese government
is in trying to determine
the course of events.
Hezbollah is has in terms
of military strength,
has far more firepower than the Lebanese
army itself.
Now, we spoke today
to the caretaker
Lebanese foreign minister,
Abdullah Abo Habib,
who made it clear that
the worry of the Lebanese government
is that if Israel attacks
Lebanon and Hezbollah in particular,
that it could easily spiral
into a regional war.
You know,
not because of conviction,
but because of any attack on our country.
We support Hezbollah as the art,
but it's not going to be Hezbollah
alone, as I mentioned.
Iran's foreign minister said yesterday
it will be Hezbollah alone.
And you have the houses of
the Iraqi militias. You have
militias in Syria are not serious,
but certainly have got the militias.
And, of course,
the concern here
is that if that happens,
life,
which at the moment
is actually going on very much normally
to my right, there is a disco party.
It's Sunday evening,
but people are enjoying
the cool evening temperatures.
A little while ago,
we heard some very loud bangs rushed out,
wondering
if this was the much anticipated
Israeli attack.
No, it was actually fireworks
just above our head.
Nonetheless,
several airlines have either delayed
or canceled flights into Beirut in fear
of an imminent Israeli attack.
And the US embassy today
reissued a statement strongly urging U.S.
nationals to reconsider travel
to Lebanon.
Now, I was at the airport today.
I arrived in Beirut
and what I saw was there was a very long
line of people
waiting to enter the country.
Many of those from the Lebanese diaspora,
many of them with American passports
Jessica. All right.
Ben Wedeman for us
live in Beirut tonight.
Thank you so much for that reporting.
I first want to ask
just your reaction
to this attack on the Golan Heights
and what we've seen from
Israel in response so far.
I mean, yet another heinous
attack by an Iranian proxy.
Right.
I mean, 12
children
and teenagers killed on a soccer field,
just barbaric.
And yet another
the deadliest attack
on Israel since October 7th.
So it's yet again,
I mean, we've seen it's 5000 attacks
now from Hezbollah
into Israel since October 8th.
So this is just an ongoing
and these are just ongoing attacks,
this one particularly heinous.
And so so, Jessica,
I think what this shows us is now of Iran
and its continued attack on our allies,
but also on democracy
in the United States.
As the foreign minister
and one of the foreign ministers
recently said from Hezbollah
said, Israel is merely a tool,
the main war.
The real war is with America.
And I think that's important context
that you bring up, that Hezbollah
has been firing rockets
into Israel
at the northern border for months
now, that this has been ongoing,
it has been a deep concern,
especially from U.S.
officials, that this particular region
could escalate, that
that conflict could escalate.
What do you think is the appropriate U.S.
response to the current escalation?
I think the United States, as it did
today, has to continue to work
very closely
with with Israel and in deciding
what's the appropriate response here.
So we'll leave it to them
to work that through.
But the bottom line is,
when there is an attack on a nation,
an attack on Israel yet again,
with, of course,
the loss of 12,
then 40, more than 40 wounded,
you realize that it does
merit a response.
So we'll leave it to them
to work together on that response.
But the bigger point here
is whether you're
talking about the Houthis
and their attack on Israel,
but also on the United States, on our
on our service members, other Iranian
backed proxies in Iraq and Syria,
continuing to attack the United States
and our service members around the world.
What you see here is terror,
you know, at its worst.
And that's really what Hamas
and Hezbollah and all and Palestine,
Islamic Jihad and others and the Houthis.
That's what this is about.
It's an attack
not just on Israel, but an attack
on democracy.
Last night, I spoke with the
former Israeli prime
minister, Naftali Bennett.
He told us the following.
I'll play this clip.
With respect
to Lebanon's
responsibility for Hezbollah,
here's what he said.
We are not going to tweezer our way
through and look for Hezbollah amid
Lebanon.
Hezbollah is part of the government.
Hezbollah is part of Lebanon.
And what Lebanon needs to do
tonight is move
all of Hezbollah away from the border,
all the way up to the river of Litani
and stop everything they're doing.
That is the only way they can prevent
an all out war.
And so, Congressman,
what is your response to that?
Again,
kind of helping people understand that
Hezbollah operates within Lebanon?
There's also a Lebanese government.
Right.
And the Hezbollah in southern Lebanon,
right on the border of Israel.
After the attack of October 7th,
Israelis pulled back from the border
after the attack
started from Hezbollah
in southern Lebanon.
More than 80,000 have been displaced.
They haven't been able to go home
since October 7th. Right.
They've left their homes
in the northern part of Israel,
right on the border of Lebanon
because of the attacks
coming in from Hezbollah.
And people want to go home. Right.
And many of them want to go home.
School is starting in a few weeks
for the students there in Israel.
They haven't.
They've been displaced from.
And so that's a big issue
in Israel right now.
How do we get them home?
And Hezbollah
has not pulled back
from from that border.
And we see just the attacks
going, as I mentioned,
have been 5000 of them
yesterday, being one of the
being the deadliest.
But the bottom line is
this has been going on
nearly every day, rockets
being fired from Lebanon, from Hezbollah
into Israel.",20240728
ErMsMa37UPk,Explosion heard in Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut,data/en_CNN\Explosion heard in Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut.jpg,"We're following more
breaking news in to CNN.
This out of the Middle East.
According to a Hezbollah run TV agency,
a loud explosion
has been heard
in the southern suburbs of Beirut.
Let's take you there
live with CNN's Ben Wedeman.
Ben, what more are you learning
about this explosion?
Of course,
we know that within the last a half hour,
there was a large explosion
in what's known as the Heart break
neighborhood of southern Beirut.
That's an area
where many of the leaders of
Hezbollah have been known to operate.
Now, we don't have a lot of details.
We know that
some local channels are saying
that the one of the building
hit was a residential building.
We don't know about casualties
at this point.
It still seems to be
a fairly chaotic scene.
We have seen pictures of smoke rising
from that part of the city,
but certainly
that is what we know at this point.
It is the first time
the southern suburbs of Beirut
have been hit
since early January,
when the Israelis had killed
a senior Hamas leader who was in
that area.
But as I said,
this is the first strike since then.
And Hezbollah has made it very clear
all along that if Beirut is struck,
they will answer accordingly.
They have said
that they will meet escalation
with escalation
in the aftermath
of last Saturday's attack on the Golan
in the
Israeli occupied Syrian Golan
Heights, that left 12 children dead.
So perhaps this is the first major
Israeli response to that attack.
Doris
and Ben, just to be
clear,
when this you're saying
this happened in the Beirut suburbs.
Can you give us some specificity
on what Hezbollah might see
as, an attack, maybe Beirut proper
versus in the suburbs?
Will this matter?
Well, we call it
it's called the Beirut suburb.
It's the El Dia in Arabic,
but it really is
part of the city of Beirut.
It's between where I am,
down by the port,
and the and the airport.
So it really is Beirut proper, despite
what we call it.
And of course, that has been made clear
time and time again, by Hezbollah there.
That's a red line.
Now, just the other day,
I spoke with the foreign
minister of Lebanon,
who told me that
through diplomatic channels
they had received
assurances from, their friends.
He called them,
that Beirut,
that the Israeli response
would be limited.
And the Lebanese government interpreted
that as meaning,
that Beirut,
the southern suburbs of Beirut,
and the airport would not be targeted.
That perhaps was not a very correct
interpretation of those
so-called assurances. Brianna.
Ben, please stand by for us in Beirut.
We want to bring in CNN
military analyst, former
general Mark curling,
who is joining us now live.
general,
thank you so much for being with us.
Walk us through the significance
of these explosions
happening in Beirut, and specifically,
what would give you evidence
or what would, suggest to you
that this was, in fact,
an IDF led attack?
We have nothing that leads to that
just yet,
but it's the possibility
of an IDF attack.
Usually it's not done
this early, even in the evening
after sunset.
The IDF usually waits
until the later, hours
of the of the evening,
where they can assure that there's no,
collateral damage on civilian casualties
when they conduct a strike.
But when you're talking about explosions,
you don't really know where they come
from.
And again,
I would suggest, because this is,
Lebanon, this is Beirut,
that there is the potential
for other types of explosion
in this area.
So you can't conclude anything just yet.
I do, general,
I do want to stop you there
because Israel is now
Israel is now claiming responsibility
for this strike in southern Beirut.
So obviously that's,
important information and changes.
your calculus of how you're seeing
this explain the significance.
Now that we know that we just literally
got that in the Israeli
military, saying that it carried out
a targeted strike in southern Beirut.
Well, Brianna, thanks for
being the scout on the screen line
right there.
As soon as you've confirmed it,
then you can talk about it
a whole lot differently.
The thing that I was about to say,
Ben's reporting about,
you know, promises of not striking
or having limited strikes
doesn't necessarily mean
they're not going to strike in Beirut.
There are areas there.
we're in and around the capital
where Hezbollah has centers.
Let's just call on that.
Anything from cells
to intelligence centers
to military command structures
in and around the area of Beirut,
they've always had that.
So when you're talking
about the potential to limit that
and not go near the capital area
or near the airport,
I just find that a little bit, and not,
it's a little bit of hyperbole
from the standpoint of someone
hoping for the best
that this wouldn't happen.
So if it is, and I'll say one more thing,
if it's just us,
a couple of explosions
has been has been reported.
Two explosions.
That is a proportional response so far.
it could get bigger.
But when you're talking about
what happened the other day
with the killing of civilians
and especially children
in that, in that, playground
or that soccer field,
you're talking about the potential
for a much greater response by Israel.
And again, this could just be step one.
But this is a proportional response,
not only against Hezbollah, but against,
it's a signal
to the Lebanese government
of get control of these terrorist
that are living among you.
And I want to read
and paraphrase
a portion of the statement
that we just got from the IDF
taking responsibility.
It says, quote,
the IDF carried out
a targeted strike
in Beirut
on the commander responsible
for the murder of the children
in the Golan Heights
and the killing of numerous
additional Israeli civilians.
General,
I think the concern has been going back
to October 7th,
of a wider regional conflict.
the United States
has repeatedly warned Israel
about any potential attacks
going into Beirut specifically.
But we heard,
John Kirby,
the spokesperson
for the NSC, recently
say that,
concerns about a wider conflict based on
an Israeli response are exaggerated.
How do you see where
the conflict stands now
versus what this could
potentially lead up to?
Hey.
Well, there were a
couple of actions, Boris,
and you're exactly right.
John Kirby did say all those things.
And I think it was as a warning
to all that,
an Israeli attack
into southern Lebanon,
a ground attack, as it were, or,
an extensive
air campaign
in Lebanon would be significant,
and it would not be to Israel's advantage
because it would open up a second front
while they're continuing
with their actions in Gaza.
But,
truthfully, Israel has to respond
to that kind of attack from Lebanon.
So, again, a proportional response
versus a ground incursion
of southern Lebanon,
or either
a massive airstrike
or an air campaign
against various targets
inside of Lebanon.
And again,
it's early yet that could occur.
More strikes could be conducted.
But this is a signal
if the Israeli government
and the Israeli Defense Forces say
it was a kinetic strike
against an identified target
of an individual
that conducted the command
and control of that strike into,
into Israel a few days ago.
I think we're seeing a good thing.
It's it's
something that
that I was talking to
CNN on Saturday
saying it would be devastating for Israel
to open a second
front with a major ground incursion
or a massive air campaign.
And it appears, at least so far,
that they've limited their strikes
to specifically the target that,
was the commander of
of the strike
that occurred the other day.
Yeah.
general,
if you could stand by for us,
we'll come back to you.
I do want to bring in
Colorado Congressman Jason Crow,
who we had stick around,
with us as we got word of this
news, is a former Army
Ranger is also on the House,
foreign affairs and Intel committees.
As we get word of this,
a targeted strike.
Israel says
Israeli military says
on this Hezbollah commander
that they say,
was behind
this attack that killed 12 children
in northern Israel.
What are you
what are your thoughts
as you see this news?
Well, Israel absolutely has a right
and I'd even say an obligation
to respond to this attack
that killed 12 children by Hezbollah.
But why do we talk about
issues of proportionality
is that it goes directly
to the concern
about escalation
and amount of talk
about why escalation in this case
is a is a larger concern
than maybe it has been in the past.
what we have to do is we have to zoom out
and talk about Iran.
Iran works
through these regional proxies,
these proxy forces.
Right? Hamas is one of them.
Hezbollah is one of them, the Houthis.
They they have other militias
and forces throughout the Middle East.
But Hezbollah is the largest
and the most capable
of all of those proxy forces. Right.
So the concern about escalation
is the most acute
when we're talking about Hezbollah.
Right.
The thing that could lead to a larger
regional war
is if Hezbollah opens up
a northern front,
they have far more rockets
fire more personnel,
far more sophisticated weaponry
and more capability across the board.
And that could be very devastating
in the North.
And Hezbollah has vowed that
depending on the Israeli response,
they wouldn't go to war
with Israel alone.
To your point,
it would be these Iranian backed groups.",20240730
m-HUwFLX6bo,Israel targets Hezbollah chief in Beirut strike,data/en_CNN\Israel targets Hezbollah chief in Beirut strike.jpg,"I want to go to
Jeremy Diamond is standing by in
Jaffa in Israel.
Our CNN military analyst
Cedric Layton,
and our global affairs
correspondent, Matthew Chance.
Jeremy, let me go to you first,
because we do have
the statement from the IDF.
basically saying they
they are responsible.
They carried out
what they called a targeted strike.
they will look
they were attacking, I think,
a number,
well, part of me
talking to strike in Beirut
on a commander,
part of me
of commander responsible
for the murder of the children in my some
it says at the moment
there are no changes in the homefront.
Command defensive guidelines.
What does that mean, Jeremy?
Well, effectively, the home
front guidelines
or the guidelines issued to civilians
in Israel to tell them effectively
what the risk
level is at this moment in terms of,
military action, it's to tell them
whether to cancel large gatherings,
to not go to school.
to be
within reach of a bomb shelter
at all times.
And in this case,
the Israeli military has decided
not to make any changes
to those guidelines, which indicates,
at least for the moment,
that they don't anticipate
that this will immediately escalate
any further than it already has.
But make no mistake,
that possibility is certainly
in the air tonight.
As we have seen, this very significant
Israeli strike
hit the southern suburbs
of the Lebanese capital, Deir,
which is notable in and of itself
for the location
given its proximity to Beirut.
But also in addition to that,
it is the fact that they are targeting
a senior commander in that area.
they say that this commander,
who they have not named in
this statement,
was responsible
for this rocket attack
that killed 12 children,
in the, Israel, controlled,
Golan Heights
in the Syrian Druze community
of marginal Shams.
It has been clear since this weekend
when that rocket attack took place,
when we saw the number
of civilians killed,
the fact that these were all children
who were killed as well,
it became immediately
clear that there was
a possibility of escalation.
And since then, we have heard
clear statements from Israeli officials
vowing that there would be
a severe response,
vowing that Hezbollah
would have a price to pay,
even as Hezbollah,
of course, denied responsibility
for this attack.
and so now we have finally seen
what shape
that response has taken
as the Israeli military,
in just the last couple of hours,
carried out this strike
and then very quickly confirmed it,
making clear that they wanted
to send a message
that, as the Israeli defense
minister says tonight,
a red line
was crossed by Hezbollah
in this rocket attack over the weekend.
And an Israeli response was narrative.
Thanks very much, Jeremy Diamond.
Let's go to Cedric Layton,
who is with us?
And Cedric,
I think it's fair to say
that many were expecting a response.
all expecting some sort of retaliation
for the Golan Heights attack.
What do you make of what we are learning?
This sound?
The IDF saying it was a targeted strike.
yes.
I think
that is really the key thing here.
And if it turns out to be true
that this was a drone strike
instead of a strike
with a manned aircraft,
that also goes to show
that the Israelis
were looking for a very precise action,
they wanted to do this
with a minimum of collateral damage
and that, you think commensurate
with some of the pressure
that the Israelis have probably received,
from the US as well
as other Western nations,
to minimize civilian casualties
in any type of,
response that they would make.
I think everybody expected them
to make this kind of a,
an effort,
this kind of a response in response
to what happened in Marshall Trump.
but the other thing that
they had to consider
was the fact that they needed
to also minimize
the possibility of civilian casualties.
Yeah.
Look,
this is a very dangerous moment, right?
This is not a war zone.
This is happening as we showed
our viewers streets of Beirut.
And that is absolutely terrifying.
We've heard in the last few minutes
from the Lebanese state media
that the strike was conducted
by road, by the dirt,
by drone that fired three missiles.
If we played the video
that we played at the top of the show,
my producers play that out.
From what we see in this video,
once we play it out.
Cedric,
I wonder whether you could tell us
in terms of
of the impact
we're hearing one casualty here.
What more can you
can you dissect from from the video
that we have seen so far,
the images here we go
to playing right now.
Right.
So when you look at
the destruction in this street,
this is commensurate
with a fairly low powered explosive.
you know, something
that on the order of
perhaps the 250 pound bomb or less,
I and I say more or less
with emphasis in the case,
because it would be far
greater destruction to the buildings
if a standard form
I would be used
would have been used
in this particular case.
And so, you see, you know, some of the
you know, obviously
there's building debris
middle of the street there,
some windows appear to be a appear
to have blown out,
and there does seem to be,
you know, a case
where they looked
at a very specific location
within a building,
to go after a very specific
individual target.
So that's what it looks like
to me at the present time.
And I see
these are live pictures right now.
and it does seem as if they're basically
in there
mopping up operation,
but they don't expect,
any secondary or tertiary attacks
after this one.
At least
that's what it looks like right now.
So do stay with us.
Let me go to our Matthew, Chance
and Matthew.
We look at we are in unknown territory.
Yes.
Israel's claim responsibility as we heard
from our Jeremy Diamond there.
But Hezbollah had said
previously, Matthew,
that would meet escalation
with escalation. Right.
speak to the significance
of this moment of the fear,
of course,
that this could widen
out the wider conflict.
Yeah, it's
I think I think the question here is,
is this the start of a broader
Israeli campaign in southern Lebanon,
or will it provoke a broader campaign
in southern Lebanon?
Or is it just,
you know, a very limited action,
that was undertaken in response
to those dreadful killings
in Mashal Shams in the in
the Golan Heights at the weekend
in which
those 12 children, teenagers as well,
were, were killed
and, and, you know,
the whole region is on a knife edge
trying to grapple with that question.
I can certainly tell you,
and I've been up to northern Israel
several times
since the October 7th attacks.
There's a great deal
of political pressure
inside northern Israel, inside Israel
and in northern Israel, particularly
to strike at Hezbollah,
to push that that group back
from the northern border of Israel,
it's under northern
Israel is under constant,
not just a constant
threat of missile attack,
but actually under constant missile
attack as well.
and it's led to whole communities
being evacuated.
They're not able to go back
into their homes.
That fright, fearful that what happened
in, in, you know, from Gaza
in southern Israel
could happen to them
in northern Israel as well.
So there's
enormous amount of political pressure
the government of Benjamin
Netanyahu is feeling
to strike at Hezbollah.
But that has to be balanced with the fact
that Israel is exhausted.
It is already engaged in a bitter
conflict in the south of the country,
inside Gaza,
and just doesn't
have the energy potentially,
it might have the means,
but doesn't actually have the energy
and the political
will to go full on into Lebanon
right now,
not whether it escalates
into something else.
It has a momentum of its own.
We will see.
But that is the
the issue we're confronted with tonight.
Yeah, indeed.
The concern is
how does
Hezbollah retaliate
if it indeed does retaliate to this?
as we have seen tit for tat before,
let me go to Ben
Wedeman, who is in Beirut for us.
Ben, just give us a sense
of what you are learning.
We're looking at these images
out of Beirut.
Streets are part of an ambulance.
We've seen some of the first scenes.
What are you learning?
from authorities
there and importantly,
about casualties at this stage.
Well, this strike happened
just before
8:00 in the evening, local time.
this is a time
when the streets are crowded
with people
and the neighborhood where it happened.
Tarek.
And in southern part
of Beirut
is a very crowded, populous neighborhood.
Now, that is where
many of Hezbollah's leaders
operate out of.
But that's also where
hundreds of thousands of civilians,
live as well.
Now we're
hearing from the National News Agency,
the official Lebanese news agency,
that at least one woman was killed
and several others injured.
There are reports in the local media
that,
hospitals in the area
are calling for donations,
of blood as well.
also,
I'm hearing
that people are lining up,
queuing up at petrol stations
to fill because,
this is an event that,
although it comes in a surprise
in terms of the time and the place,
the fact that it happened
was no surprise at all,
because it was widely expected
that there would be
some sort of Israeli
response to the attack
on the champs
in the Israeli occupied
Syrian Golan Heights that left 12,
people dead.
but, the other day,
I was speaking with the
foreign minister of Lebanon,
who told me
that they, the Lebanese government
had received
assurances through diplomatic channels,
that Beirut, the Beirut airport
and specifically
the southern suburbs of Beirut
would not be struck.
And that was their interpreter
of those assurances.
So clearly, those assurances,
don't amount
in much to much at this point.
Now, we know that, Secretary
General of Hezbollah,
Hassan Nasrallah, has said
time and time again
that striking Beirut
is crossing a red line.
However, on the 2nd of January of this
year, Israel
did launch a strike
that killed a senior Hamas leader,
also roughly in that area, as well.
So we'll have to simply wait
and see how Hezbollah
is going to respond.
But I know that organization well,
they are not
going to go quietly into the night.
There will be some sort of response,
from Hezbollah.
They have said they will meet escalation
with escalation.",20240730

12_YTNLq3NY,"Hamas leader was killed by explosive device planted months before explosion, source says","data/en_CNN\Hamas leader was killed by explosive device planted months before explosion, source says.jpg","More breaking news right now.
And this coming from the Middle
East, tensions
skyrocketing there
after assassinations this week.
And we are getting right now
some brand new details
about exactly
how the assassination
of the Hamas political leader,
Ismail Haniya, went down.
And this
these are incredible details.
A Jeremy Diamond is breaking.
He's in Haifa, Israel,
in northern Israel right now.
And Jeremy,
these details
are pretty stunning.
Yeah, no doubt about it, Erin.
I mean,
this was a quite
sophisticated operation.
I'm told by a source familiar
with the matter
that Ismail Haniyeh
was assassinated
in Tehran early yesterday
morning using a bomb
that was covertly hidden
in the guest house
where he was staying.
But this bomb,
I'm told,
was actually covertly
planted inside that guest house
about two months ago,
and it was only
remotely detonated once.
It was clear
that Ismail Haniyeh,
Hamas's political leader,
was actually inside his room,
inside of that guest house
when that bomb was detonated.
He was killed alongside
his bodyguard,
who was also there.
Now, we should note that
Israel has still
neither confirmed nor denied
its involvement in this.
Iranian officials
and Hamas have said
that Israel was behind
this attack.
I'm also told that Israel
Israeli officials
actually briefed U.S.
officials on this operation,
but only after it took place,
only after
we learned
that Ismail
Haniya had been killed in this.
What's also interesting here
is that this guest house
was actually under the control
of Iran's Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps.
And so this represents
a stunning breach of security
for them,
a very big embarrassment
for the IRGC.
And we've reached out
to Iranian officials
for comment on this.
But we know, of course,
that we heard yesterday
from Iran's supreme
leader vowing revenge,
saying that
Israel has, quote,
paved the way
for your harsh punishment.
This assassination
has put this region
on a knife's
edge, in addition,
of course, to
the Israeli strike in Beirut,
just hours before this, that
took out a senior
Hezbollah commander.
There are now threats
of retaliation
not only from Iran,
but also from Hezbollah
and Hamas
putting this region
and this area
where I am right now
in northern Israel,
very much on edge
as the possibility
of retaliation now looms.
Aaron, thank you very much.
Jeremy Diamond.
Cedric Leighton joins me now.
Colonel Cedric Layton,
Colonel Jeremy's
reporting is really stunning,
and he mentioned this,
but let's just emphasize
this again.
He is reporting
that ostensibly,
some Israeli operatives,
although they
have not confirmed
their involvement,
planted an IED in Tehran
in a guest house controlled
by the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps,
the elite IRGC,
two months ago,
and then remotely detonated it
when they knew that
the guy they wanted to get
was actually staying
in that house.
Holy cow.
Yeah. Holy cow is right, Aaron.
This is very classic operation
in, you know,
kind of in line
with the tradition
of Israeli
intelligence going back,
you know,
almost to the
founding of Israel
and what the Israelis say,
if they did this,
what they were able to do was,
Jeremy pointed out,
was breach
security
in a really remarkable way.
The IRGC,
the Iranian Revolutionary Guard
Corps, is very much in control
of a lot of different
aspects of Iranian life.
but they weren't in direct
control of this guest house,
which was ostensibly
their own guest house.
And whoever breached this and,
you know,
the supposition is
that it was Israel.
But whoever did this did
a remarkable job.
And the fact also
has to be
noted that
this was not detected
for probably over two months.
If you know, if Jeremy's
reporting is
and his sources are accurate,
so that,
that really indicates that,
you know, people were,
quite frankly, overcome by,
you know,
by their own sloppiness
in this particular case and,
this, this very fact
on the Iranian side
shows that Israel
has been able to penetrate,
their security apparatus
quite a bit.
and that, of course, signals,
some major weaknesses
in the Iranian structure.
I mean, Jeremy,
just to emphasize this
and I know, Abby,
I don't know
if your reporting is
is how detailed
is on the form of an IED,
but you have
an improvised explosive
device inside a guest house,
which would presumably mean
no one was sweeping it
or checking it
before this Hamas leader
came in.
Or in fact,
any time in the past
two months,
which would seem to be
just a really basic,
basic point of protocol.
Yeah.
Look, we don't know exactly
what kind of explosive device
this was.
We don't know exactly where
it was hidden,
whether this was something
that could have evaded,
the typical checks
that the IRGC
would conduct on this.
But I think one clear,
failure of security here
is the fact
that this guest house,
the reason
why this bomb was planted
there is because it
was a guest house
where Ismail Haniyeh
was known to have stayed.
And so this indicates
that Hania was a repeat guest
in this same location,
which is obviously a security,
a major security vulnerability
that the Israelis appear
to have exploited here.
and so we don't know
exactly how this happened,
but there's no question
that there will be,
major questions
asked within the IRGC,
within Iran's top political,
and military echelons
about how this could have
possibly, happened.
And I also think it's notable
that yesterday,
Iranian state
media was reporting
that this was a rocket
that was fired from outside
into this, guest house
that actually killed Tania.
But the fact that
it was actually something
that was planted
in the guest house suggests
even additional
layers of of failure.
It also makes clear
that this was not,
fired by a drone
or by a fighter jet
that would have violated
Iranian airspace.
So that also may factor
into how Iran
chooses to retaliate,
for this assassination.
And that's a significant point
as well.
Colonel, it also,
though what
Jeremy saying
does just make one thing
sort of unbelievably clear.
So let's just say in
black and white,
that means a human being
is involved, who's in Tehran,
who actually gets access
to this guest house
and plants something.
At some point
there is a human
being infiltration,
which is different
than what Jeremy's saying.
They had originally been
put out there
about a rocket or a drone.
Right.
Which could be completely done
remotely.
That shows
actual physical human
involvement. Colonel.
It does. Absolutely.
And it's
really a classic case of,
in essence,
a clandestine operation.
these are the
kinds of operations
you would have seen
the British conduct
in World War Two
with a special Operations
executive.
in Europe,
you would have seen the OSS,
the forerunner of the CIA,
doing stuff like this.
Also in that conflict
and the Mossad
has a history
of doing things of this type,
in various countries
around the world.
And, of course,
Iran is a prime target.
I, we know a lot about the,
you know,
many of the nuclear scientists
who have been killed in Iran,
ostensibly by the Israelis,
that kind of operation
and the fact that
these things are continuing
and that there's such
a significant penetration
of IRGC security
at a guest house
that is frequented
by people like Hania.
that really shows that,
as Jeremy said,
there's a significant weakness
in their security apparatus.
And they,
you know, they really didn't
it didn't take care of things.
All right. Thank you very much.

MWCj5pErbl0,Hamas announces Yahya Sinwar as head of political bureau,data/en_CNN\Hamas announces Yahya Sinwar as head of political bureau.jpg,"Hamas, as in
the last few moments, announced
that Yaya Sinwar will replace
Ismail Haniya
as the group's political leader.
Sinwar, of course,
is the group's leader in Gaza.
The change comes after Haniya was killed,
if you remember, last week in Tehran.
We'll have more on that.
But this news just coming in on Hamas
announcing Sinwar
as the head of the political bureau
in the meantime
and staying in the region, U.S.
officials tell CNN Iran
and its proxies
are beginning preparations
for retaliatory attack against Israel.
The entire Middle East
has been on edge for days.
In fact,
after a series of assassinations
blamed on Israel,
including the deaths of senior Hamas
and Hezbollah
figures, two officials say
fears are higher right now
about a major response from Hezbollah
rather than Iran.
Today, Hezbollah leader Hassan
Nasrallah, using the vowed
his group will act whether alone
or with regional allies.
Hezbollah has already declared
a new face,
what it calls
a new phase in its months
long cross-border conflict with Israel.
Today,
it says it fired
a swarm of drones
at Israeli military targets
and a Hezbollah rocket
barrage triggered
fires near Kiryat Shmona
in northern Israel,
adding to the tensions.
The U.S.
military is blaming
Iran backed militias
for a suspected rocket
attack on this airbase in Iraq,
calling it a dangerous escalation.
Seven U.S.
service members were injured.
Let's get more on all these threads.
And Natasha Bertrand
is following developments
for us from the Pentagon.
So, Natasha, we've heard
Iran say they will respond.
The question now is when and how.
What are you hearing from U.S.
sources and U.S.
officials as to what retaliation
that retaliation may look like right now?
Well, U.S.
officials don't seem to know
exactly what that's going to look like.
And that's in part
because they don't know
if Iran even knows at this point
what they're going to do,
but they are more concerned
now, we're told
about what Hezbollah
is going to do about than
what Iran is planning.
We're told that in recent
days, the fears have escalated
about the idea
that Hezbollah could actually act alone
and not be coordinated
with Tehran in its response.
And of course, Hezbollah
is just right there
on Israel's northern border.
And so this could be something
very significant
that we see from Hezbollah.
Or, you know, it could result that
all the diplomacy
that we're seeing in the background
could result in all sides
kind of de-escalating tensions.
It does not seem necessarily like that
is what is going to happen at this point.
U.S.
officials are bracing
for some kind of retaliatory action,
but they're trying
to essentially temper it
and try to make sure
that any kind of action
will not result, of course,
in a large number of civilian casualties,
that it will be more largely symbolic
and allow either
Tehran or Hezbollah
or both to kind of save face,
you know, in
light of these Israeli strikes
in both Beirut and Tehran.
And so we know from U.S.
officials that both Iran
and Hezbollah
have been making
some kind of preparations
for some kind of attack on Israel.
But again, you know, U.S.
officials have declined to say
what exactly that looks like.
I will note, however, that before
the attack, the Iranian attack
against Israel in April, U.S.
officials saw very, very clear
signs of very large movements by Iran,
including the movement of,
for example, major
missile launchers and things
like that into position
to prepare for a major attack.
They're not necessarily
seeing those kinds of huge signs
at this point, forecasting something
potentially as significant
as a massive missile barrage
like we saw a few months ago.
But of course, they're
basically preparing for the worst here
and engaging in this
very frenetic diplomacy
behind the scenes
to try to ease tensions even further.
So we'll have to see if that works.
Natasha, appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
Let's talk
more about the growing threat
of a wider war in the Middle East.
Joining me now is Colin Clarke,
director of policy and research
at the Suzanne Group, a well known face.
He on the show.
Colin, great to see you.
Just some breaking news
that we've had in the last few minutes.
I'm not sure if you quoted.
We've now heard
that Hamas has issued a statement
announcing that its leader in Gaza,
Yahya Sinwar, will replace Ismail Haniya,
of course, who was assassinated
in Tehran last week
as the head of its political bureau.
What do you make of this announcement?
Thanks for having me.
I think the announcement
could be quite significant.
And it's really interesting
because you now
see Hamas potentially attempting to,
bring closer
the political bureau
and the military wing
by having a military leader
like Sinwar
kind of dual hatted,
functioning in both roles.
It certainly points to a victory
for the hardliners within Hamas.
Some of the other names
that have been mentioned, Khalid Meshaal,
has some,
issues and it's his relationship,
with some of the, you know, kind of Hamas
adjacent countries in the region,
including the Syrians and the Iranians.
And so this was likely,
a move to empower,
the more hardline militants in the group.
It could also have
reverberations into the West
Bank as well.
Yeah.
I was gonna say this doesn't bode
well because, of course,
Ismail Haniya
was part of the negotiations.
We so thought as part of the,
the wing,
the political side,
the political bureau of Hamas.
And of course, Israel
has publicly accused Sinwar
of being the mastermind
right behind
the terror attack
against Israel on October 7th.
So it begs the question of where does
where does this leave
any sort of ceasefire,
any hostage negotiations?
Now with, Yahya Sinwar as the head of the
political bureau of Hamas?
Well, I think what it
does first and foremost
is it complicates
today, after we hear a lot of discussions
about the day after and how,
the Israelis haven't
really been planning for that.
They haven't strategized
for the day after.
A lot of that is because of,
the role of Benjamin Netanyahu
and his far right allies.
They refuse to kind of think
about any kind of Gaza governance.
This really, really complicates that,
because let's say the war was to start
this week
and Sinwar was not captured, killed.
He'd be the individual,
you know, representing Hamas there.
And there's no way
the Israelis are going to do business
with Sinwar
in any kind of post
conflict governance in Gaza.
Yeah. Stay with us, Colin.
I want to go to our Jeremy
Diamond, who's in Haifa
for this breaking news.
And, Jeremy,
just as we bring our viewers
up to date on this breaking news,
the Hamas announcing Shinhwa
as the head of the political bureau,
what has been the reaction
from Israel to this?
well, we haven't gotten any
reaction yet,
but but this I can tell you
what the reaction will be.
And that is to say that
he sinwar
taking over as Hamas's political leader,
first of all, increasingly blurs
the lines between Hamas,
his military wing,
and its political wing.
Yahya Sinwar was viewed as very much
the bridge between those two wings.
And in addition to that,
he is also viewed
as responsible
for the October 7th massacre.
the in the same way that Mohammad Deif
was the leader of the military wing.
There is a belief,
a strong belief,
that Yahya Sinwar
would have been intimately involved
if not in the planning,
then certainly in the decision
making about choosing to carry out
such an attack.
And, what this also does is
it makes very clear that he has sinwar
despite more than ten months of war,
is clearly alive, clearly,
still very influential within Hamas
to the point
that he is able to actually seize power
here in the wake of Ismail
Haniyeh assassination.
And what that will do
beyond what I've already mentioned,
is also clearly show that the hardliners
within Hamas are clearly being empowered.
Ismail Haniyeh,
was viewed in many
ways as a more pragmatic voice
within Hamas, as a voice
who was pushing for a cease fire,
who was willing
to make certain concessions
at the negotiating table.
And yet here Sinwar,
who has been consulted
at every step in the cease fire
negotiations, was very much viewed
as carrying the more hardline position.
and so that obviously is
I think it's pretty clear what that means
for the future of cease
fire negotiations,
for how much more difficult
it may be to actually achieve
a cease fire.
And obviously,
this will have tremendous implications.
in, in Gaza itself,
where we know that
the lack of a cease fire
is impacting Gazans, civilians
more than anyone else, perhaps.
Yeah.
And
and I assume that
Yahya Sinwar is in hiding in Gaza.
Do we know what role
he has played in these negotiations?
Well,
of course, when he was still alive,
do we know how prominent
his viewpoint,
how influential he's been in
these negotiations journey?
It's been critical
that every single juncture,
because Hamas's political leadership
outside of Gaza knew
that he could not implement a cease fire.
He could not stop the fighting
without the agreement of,
Hamas leaders in Gaza,
which effectively gave Sinwar
a veto over
every decision
that has been made
at the negotiating table so far.
but now he is in power even further,
because we're not just talking about
a veto,
we're talking about actual decision
making power and authority.
And what other thing that we should note
is that Sinwar, as
he has been consulted
at every critical juncture
that sometimes led to delays
in those negotiated options
because of the fact
that Sinwar is believed
to be hiding in tunnels under Gaza,
most likely under Communist.
it was taking
it could take as little
as our sometimes,
but oftentimes
it would take days for the messages
to go from Doha
or Cairo,
from the mediating,
from the negotiating table
into Gaza
to actually reach Sinwar
in a covert manner
without the Israelis
discovering where he was hiding.
And then for those messages,
to reach back to the negotiating
table thereafter.
And so that is going to be clearly,
another,
factor in the potential future
of those talks.
But we should note that for now,
these negotiations are effectively dead
for the time being,
at least in the short term,
following the assassination
of Ismail Haniya.
There has been no progress towards,
another ceasefire deal.
And instead, what we are talking about,
particularly where I am
now in northern Israel,
is this possibility,
very real possibility
of an Iranian attack against Israel
in retaliation
for the assassination of Ismail Haniya,
as well as potentially attacks
from Hezbollah,
which is just about 30km north of here
in Lebanon.
Jeremy, I appreciate it.
Thank you very much for coming
up for this breaking news.",20240806

is clearly building
on both Israel and Hamas
to return to negotiations
to end the war in Gaza
and to release the remaining hostages.
This new push, underscored
by a grave global concern
right now, that the region,
this region in the Middle East
where I am,
is inching closer
and closer to the threat
of a much wider scale conflict.
Israel is bracing for strikes
from Iran and its heavily armed proxies
after it killed Hezbollah
and Hamas leaders just last week.
The source familiar
with the discussions
tells CNN that the talks are scheduled.
The mediator talks are scheduled
for next Thursday, August 15th.
The Israeli Prime
Minister's office says
Israel will send the negotiations
team to the talks.
The U.S.,
Qatar and Egypt
have issued this joint statement.
They're leading this effort,
the trio of mediators say.
And I'm quoting now,
there is no further time to waste,
nor excuses from any party
for further delay.
It is time to release the hostages, begin
the cease fire and implement
this agreement.
That's the end of the quote
from those three mediators.
Let's dig deeper right now.
Joining us, Leon Panetta.
He served as U.S.
defense secretary
and CIA director under President Obama.
Mr. Secretary.
Always good to have you join us
here on CNN. Thanks very much.
And as you heard that,
as, you know, Egypt,
Israel and cutter,
they want both Israel and Hamas to resume
cease fire and hostage negotiations
this coming week.
In your opinion, Mr.
Secretary, how likely is that to happen?
Well, one thing we know for sure,
and you're there, Wolf, is that
this is a very dangerous moment,
in which,
without question, if,
the wrong steps are taken
by Iran and Hezbollah,
we can have a larger war on our hands.
on the other hand, because, there are
a number of nations,
that you mentioned that are working,
diplomatically to try to get, Iran
and Hezbollah and others to back down,
and hopefully be able to engage,
in negotiations,
get back to the negotiating table.
I'm,
I'm sure that it's having some impact.
but right now,
I think the situation is one
that is a crisis situation.
And I think that I worry,
frankly, that,
that this could result
in an escalated war.
There.
Yeah.
All of us
are worried about that possibility,
especially those of us
who are here in the region.
Mr.
Secretary, the Biden administration
says it will defend Israel
if it comes under attack.
What should the Biden administration
be doing right now,
do you think,
to potentially not further inflame
the regional tensions that are underway?
Well, look, I think
the most important thing
that the United States is doing right now
is deploying our military capabilities
to the region
in order to make sure
that we have in place
everything we need in order to defend
against airstrikes in Israel.
you know, Iran crossed the line,
in April in sending,
almost 300 missiles into Israel itself.
Unfortunately, because,
our allies, Israel,
others were able to knock down
a lot of those missiles,
almost 90% of those missiles.
what happened
did not escalate the situation there.
Whether or not that can happen again,
I think is
what what we're all looking at.
but having the United States
having the time
to be able
to deploy our destroyers, to deploy our,
our air capabilities there as well,
and to prepare for that possibility
is probably the most important thing
that the United States can do right now
and also hopefully urge Israel
and the parties
to get back to the negotiating table.
You were the U.S.
defense secretary.
You know the region well.
You know the issues, very, very closely.
how would you be handling
what's going on right now
if you were still the defense secretary?
And I asked the question specifically
because Israel is now
a member of the U.S.
military's Central Command,
which is in charge of the whole
Middle East, as opposed to
when you were defense secretary
as part of the European Command.
What's the what?
What does that
what what does that suggest to you
about the potential difference?
Well, what it what it means
is that there's, a larger direct focus,
on Israel and, on Israel's enemies.
and that means that,
the United States
plays a much more important role in terms
of trying to defend Israel.
and that's that's as it should be.
the issue then becomes,
if in fact, Iran or the proxies
decide to conduct a massive attack,
in which,
a lot of innocent Israelis are killed.
it leaves the United States
very little option
but to go in and help defend Israel
in that kind of war.
And not just with, military equipment,
but with troops as well.
Is that what you're saying?
Well, you know,
you'd like to believe that,
we could provide
the military capabilities
as we have been.
in order to be able to ensure
that Israel,
can do the fighting
and do the fighting effectively,
I think we'll try to exhaust that option.
But when you're in an escalated war,
everything is on the table.
Yeah, that's what I'm hearing as well.
let me return
to the Israeli prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
he gave an exclusive
interview to time magazine.
Mr.
Secretary, and Netanyahu,
pushes back against claims that he's,
drawing out the Gaza campaign
to ensure that he remains
in political office.
He calls that accusation against him
a canard.
Do you feel that Prime Minister
Netanyahu has resisted
a cease fire deal
for personal political reasons,
as some are alleging?
You know, I, I've known,
Netanyahu for a long time,
going back to the Clinton administration.
he's he's committed to two things.
He's committed to the survival of Israel,
but he's also committed
to his own survival in office.
and that combination,
means that while he's a fighter,
he's not much of a peacemaker.
And that is the Netanyahu
that we're dealing with now.
In that same time magazine interview,
Netanyahu was asked
about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
He denied that Israel has failed
to do enough
to aid civilians,
saying this, and I'm quoting him now.
We've gone out of our way
to enable humanitarian assistance
since the beginning of the war.
Clearly, the Biden administration, Mr.
Secretary, doesn't necessarily agree
with his assessment. Do you?
Well, I you know, I
not Netanyahu sees the situation
through his eyes.
and, that's not necessarily
what's really happening.
you know, he he will
he will make the case that somehow,
Israel bears
no responsibility
for the humanitarian crisis, in Gaza.
but that's not the
that's not really the facts.
anybody who's been there,
anybody who's seen
that situation, knows very well that,
yeah, Israel is
obviously focused on fighting a war,
and not really doing very much
with regards to humanitarian assistance.
and so, right now,
the continuing fighting in Gaza, the,
the threat of an even larger war
with Iran, and its proxies.
I think I think what you're going to see
is a very hard line.
Netanyahu,
trying to confront a very hard line.
Iran.
Would you be surprised, Mr.
Secretary?
if Israel launched a preemptive strike
right now
against his Hezbollah
forces in Lebanon for, for example,
and maybe even against
Iranian forces inside Iran?
Well, I'm sure that kind of thinking
is on the table.
If they if they determined
that they have intelligence
on a potential attack against Israel,
my sense would be that they would take
the opportunity,
to, to
to do a precipitous attack
in order to stop,
that kind of, of confrontation.
So, yeah,
I think they're looking at all
the options right now.
but clearly what is happening
now is that it's a wait and see game.
to determine just whether or not,
Iran and Hezbollah
are going to take a major step
that will, in fact, escalate the war.
look, the record here is that
everybody is pushing now to try to
to try to hopefully reduce the chances
for that kind of escalation
that's worked in the past.
I think the hope is that it can work now.
Let's hope it does.
Leon Panetta,
the former defense secretary,
former CIA director, as usual,
thank you very much for your analysis.
We appreciate it.",20240809

as soon as in the next few days.
With us now,
CNN military analyst
retired Lieutenant General Mark
hurdling and former State
Department Middle East negotiator
Aaron David Miller.
General, starting with you.
What do you expect
from Iran
as compared to the drone
and multi missile attacks?
Some 300 rockets and missiles
that were directed towards
Israel back in April
from Iran, directly
from Iranian territory.
Do you expect something
similar or something different?
You know, Wolf,
you can't really say
it could be a spectrum along that line,
anything from a massive attack
not only from Iran,
but also in coordination with Hezbollah
and with other forces in the area.
The PMF forces in Syria and Iraq,
as well as the Houthis in Yemen.
Or could
we see just a kinetic strike
that's precision
and surgical
in nature
to show Israel and for Iran
to show their own population
that they are doing something
about what's struck in Tehran.
So it could be anywhere
between those two extremes.
but I think they have to do something
just to appease their own population,
but also to show Israel
that they are ready to confront them.
But anything that they do do.
could certainly expand
this region into a,
catastrophic conflict.
And that's
certainly what Israeli military officials
are bracing for.
Right now,
as I can tell you, based on briefings
that I've had over the past few days.
Aaron, there's been some confusion.
Today's, you know, over
how Hamas is treating Thursday,
a scheduled cease fire,
hostage release talks.
What's your read on the statement
they put out earlier today?
You know, the worst thing in negotiation,
Wolf, is to
tell your negotiating partners
that you're in a hurry.
And I suspect part of Hamas's calculation
is they know
that Biden's clock, Netanyahu's clock,
and their own clock
are not really in sync.
The administration
wants this done yesterday,
and they're evidencing,
all sorts of signs,
which are completely understandable,
given how fraught
the situation is for the hostages
and the prospects
of an, escalation in the northern front,
they know if they could get a cease
fire would also come down the north.
the problem is that
the Biden clock is not sync.
It seems to me
either with the Netanyahu clock
or the similar clock,
and Yankees
and wire ensconced in some tunnel
somewhere, is making decisions
based on what he considers to be Hamas's
needs and requirements.
And those require, a cessation,
a true cessation of military activity
by the Israelis and Benjamin Netanyahu,
for his own understandable reasons,
are not prepared to agree.
So, I think on this one, Wolf,
that Hamas
ultimately will show
we'll show for Thursday's meeting
if the whole thing is not undermined
by a major
Hezbollah or Iranian strike
sometime in the next 72 hours,
which is certainly possible.
General Hertling,
is there a scenario
you can foresee where Iran launches its
retaliatory attack
against Israel in the coming days,
and the region
still manages
to avert a much wider regional war?
What needs to happen for that
to be how this goes?
Yeah, certainly, Wolf,
there is that potential and it would be
dependent on Iran holding their fire,
literally not
conducting the kind of large scale attack
they held last time
where a lot of Israeli
citizens could be hurt or killed
if that happens.
What I'd say
is, Katie, bar the door
if if Israel is struck to the point
where there are multiple casualties
or a lot of deaths,
I think we're going to see that conflict
spin out of control.
That's the part where I'm very concerned
because it has to do with
not only what Iranians,
Iran's action will be,
but as
Aaron David just said,
also what Hezbollah and Hamas will do,
to, to to contribute to this,
but it could certainly rise
into a regional conflict
or beyond, in my view.
And I don't think Iran is ready for that.
Or has the military
or the diplomat capability
to do something of that scale.
So they should be very
careful in what they do next.
Yeah.
I think you make a very
important point, general,
because based on the briefings
I've been having here,
if Iran were to do
a direct assault on Israel
and wind up
killing a lot of Israeli civilians,
especially destroying a lot of buildings
in Tel Aviv,
where I am right now
attacking military bases,
Ben-Gurion airport,
the international airport
outside of Tel Aviv,
Israel, would respond
with enormous,
enormous military force
against Iran,
something the Israelis believe
the Iranians would
deliberately, desperately try to avoid.
But they won't be able to do so.
So we'll see if this explodes
into that type of regional war.
Aaron, this forthcoming attack
from Iran, as is now
expected against Israel,
is in response
to the killing of a top Hamas leader
who was in Tehran.
Obviously, there's more to come here,
but how has that already impacted
the region altogether?
You know, I think it has in several ways.
Yeah, it's in wire.
Wolf is now
has now been elevated to the air from us,
which is something
frankly, we all knew from the beginning
that he's the major decision maker.
I will say, though, that Mark
generally raises
a critically important point,
and that is the Hezbollah piece of this.
You know,
it takes 12 minutes
for a cruise missile,
to impact in Israel,
assuming it's not intercepted
once from Iran.
We're talking a minute and a half.
Well,
probably less time
for Hezbollah's high
trajectory weapons
and its precision guided munitions
to strike Israel proper.
The real damage here, frankly,
it is not going to come from Iran.
It's going to come from Hizbollah.
But I really do believe that both.
And again, Hurley's right.
I don't think Hezbollah
nor Tehran is interested
in the kind of strike that would trigger,
a massive Israeli response, a response,
I might add, Wolf.
And the Iranians know this
that could easily,
draw in the United States.
The question is, what will be
the fine line
between doing something
that is significant
but not triggering the
regional escalation?
That would create something
the Middle East Wolf
has never seen before,
a genuine
multi-front
war involving Lebanon, Syria, Iraq.
Yemen, Israel, and perhaps,
even an Israeli
and US military involvement,
against Iran.
Yeah, it's a really,
really dangerous situation right now.
General Hurley, before
I let you go,
I want to close with a quick question
on Ukraine right now,
which is seeing
some serious, deterioration as well.
the Ukrainian government claims
that Russian troops
set fire
near the Zaporizhzhia
nuclear plant in, in in Ukraine.
What's your read on on that situation?
How dangerous is it unfolding right now?
Yeah, I've been watching the,
Ukrainian front
for the last seven days
and have been amazed.
Wolf,
this, fire that's
occurring at the Zaporizhzhia
power plant,
I believe, in all intelligence,
at least all open
source retaliations is saying
that it's the result of
a tire fire in inside or near
the, the, the smokestack or the
the the stack of the
the nuclear power plant.
That is to distract.
And it's a Russian way
of doing distraction.
Remember,
Russia has control of that power plant.
They have forces in the area.
There are IAEA, members
there as well saying what's happening?
They say all radiation is safe still,
but they are very concerned.
They've been saying that for months.
But the fact that Russia would,
would, start a tire fire to envelop
smoke into the area
and indicate that something's going on.
It's just another approach by Mr.
Putin to, conflict.
What's going on in this area
and cause more danger,
to not only Ukraine,
but also the entire region.
Let me follow up a general.
what do you make of
the Ukrainian incursion into Russia?
We're now told some 20 miles.
Ukrainian forces
have moved inside Russia.
Yeah, it's been fascinating for me.
Well, first I thought this was a raid.
They have conducted
these kind of cross-border raids
with small forces in the past.
It now appears
to be more of a demonstration.
I certainly wouldn't
call it an offensive yet.
the key is going to be,
can they sustain this fight?
When you put that many forces
and there's apparently
two brigades or more of Ukrainian forces
have gone across the border,
not just of of, Kurz,
but also in Belgrade.
you need a lot of logistics
for an armored force that goes 20km.
They've been there seven days.
They need
water, fuel, ammunition, supplies, parts.
So we'll see how long they're in there.
They have taken a lot of prisoners.
Estimates are over
a couple of hundred Russian prisoners
that have already been taken.
And there are some indications
of movement
of Russian reinforces
reinforcements into the area
to counter it.
there's no proof of that just yet.
The fighting has not been intense,
other than beyond the border,
the border guards and the forces
that were in the area.
So this is Ukraine
saying we can do the same thing
the other thing that I'd point out,
Wolf, is indications
are that it's Western style vehicles,
the ones that have been given to Ukraine
that are conducting most of this attack.
And one of the things
that I find most fascinating
is having been a Stryker
brigade commander,
it appears that strikers in the air
are in the areas.
They move fast.
They're very mobile, they're very quiet.
And there are exactly fitted
for this kind of operation.
That would be a quick strike
inside of a country.
And then to pull back very quickly
without the need for a lot of logistics.
It's potentially a very,
very dangerous situation
unfolding between Ukraine and Russia
as well.
General Hertling, Aaron
David Miller, to both of you.
Thank you very much for your analysis.",20240811

HfeTzGlFL6c,Israeli military on high alert for potential imminent attack by Iran,data/en_CNN\Israeli military on high alert for potential imminent attack by Iran.jpg,"We begin here in the Middle East,
as the Israeli and U.S.
military's are ramping up preparations
for a possible revenge attack by Iran,
a strike
that potentially could happen at any time.
CNN's Oren Liebermann is standing by
for us over at the Pentagon.
But first, let's bring in CNN's
Nic Robertson.
He's here with me in Tel Aviv Nic.
What's the latest on a potential
retaliation strike from Iran on Israel?
I think is less optimistic
than it was just a couple of days ago.
Diplomats I've been talking to say that
the mood music around these talks set for
Thursday is not as positive and optimistic
as they were hoping for.
We have heard from a diplomat
in the region saying that there is
a likelihood
that Hamas will now attend the talks.
I think you're seeing a lot of posturing
in the run up to the talks.
We've heard that the Iranian president
today has had conversations
with the British prime minister, German
chancellor,
the Chinese foreign minister,
and to all of them.
Iranian media is reporting
he has said that Iran has the right
to respond and strike back at Israel.
So it's a very tough narrative
on all sides at the moment.
People here are bracing for a worst case
scenario.
The Iranians attack
a real concern that Iran is building up
for what may be more than just a limited
attack, that this could be a wider strike.
Of course, the U.S.
naval assets coming into the region will
provide protection for Israel and for U.S.
troops in this region.
But the fact that they've been speeded
up, the fact that they've been announced
all indicates
that the tensions are rising.
The talks Thursday may not even happen.
We might not even get that.
That said, again,
we have to read the machinations
and the language
we're hearing at the moment
as as as the sort of thing that you hear
leading up to high stakes talks
where everyone
setting out their maximalist position,
trying to pressure the other.
There is room for diplomacy, but there's
also room for mistakes and strikes.
There certainly, as our. Nic, standby,
I'm going to get back to you.
Oren Liebermann,
you're over at the Pentagon for us.
The United States has ordered, what,
a submarine, major submarine
to head to the Eastern Mediterranean
aircraft carrier.
Battle groups are on the way as well.
This is
this is a huge decision by the Pentagon.
Absolutely.
And it is arguably the largest buildup
of U.S.
forces in Central Command
in the Middle East
that we've seen since
very early in the war.
In a call with his Israeli
counterpart, Defense Secretary
Lloyd Austin said that he'd ordered
the USS Georgia a cruise missile submarine
that was already in the Mediterranean
towards Central Command,
towards the Middle East.
That is an offensive weapon,
although the Pentagon has described
these adjustments to force posture
as, quote, defensive in nature.
A submarine with its land attack
cruise missiles with its anti-ship
missiles is first and foremost a message
of deterrence to Iran and its proxies.
But it also gives the U.S.
a very powerful offensive weapon
should it choose to use them as it sees
how Iran and its proxies choose
to carry out this anticipated attack.
Austin also ordered the USS Abraham
Lincoln Carrier Strike Group
to accelerate its movements
towards the Middle East.
Just a couple of days ago,
it was in the Pacific Ocean.
So that will take time.
But it's worth noting that
Austin ordered it sped up, essentially
get there as quickly as possible,
and once it arrives,
that means it will have the Abraham
Lincoln Carrier Strike Group,
the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier
Strike Group, at least for the time being,
as well as an amphibious ready group,
which includes
destroyers and other warships
in the Mediterranean Sea.
So you see that buildup.
Of course, the crucial question is
what is Iran planning?
What are its proxies planning,
and how large will this attack be?
You can see in
the US is force posture changes.
The US is preparing for
what could be a very large attack,
at least the possibility
of a large attack.
And Oren, I spent several years
as a Pentagon correspondent.
It's pretty extraordinary
for the Pentagon to be announcing
publicly the deployment of submarines,
especially here in a sensitive area
like the Eastern Mediterranean.
Aircraft carrier battle groups,
they announce where they're heading,
but not necessarily submarines.
This is pretty amazing, isn't it?
Absolutely. Aircraft carriers,
you can track that publicly
and there are accounts that do that.
Not so with submarines.
The movement of U.S.
submarines, whether it's a cruise missile
sub, a fast attack sub, a ballistic
missile sub.
These are very secret
and nearly always done.
Not publicly.
They're they're rarely ever announced.
And if they are, that in
and of itself is a message.
The US publicly saying that the U.S.
is Georgia is headed to the region
that's very public signaling to Iran
and its proxies
that the US effectively means business
here, that the US has very powerful forces
in the region and depending
on what Iran chooses to do,
the US retains the option to use them.
Wolf, it's worth noting
this is not the first time
we have seen the US publicly announce
the moving of a submarine during this war.
Back in November and early November,
the US very publicly moved
the USS Florida, another cruise missile
submarine, into the Middle East again.
That then was a warning to Iran
and its proxies
about what they should choose to do.
This is that same message delivered
with a tremendous amount of other U.S.
forces in the region as well.
You know, the public announcement of these
submarines, where they're heading.
It's a message to Iran.
Clearly, you mess with Israel,
the United States
is going to mess with you.
That's the message
that's being delivered clearly.
Oren, thank you very much.
Nick, thanks to you as well.
I want to get some analysis right now.
Joining us, CNN political and global
affairs analyst Barak Ravid,
along with CNN military analyst,
retired U.S.
Army Major General James Spider Marks.
Let's talk a little bit, Barak,
first of all, you've been doing amazing
reporting on what's going on.
What are you hearing right now
about the timing and preparations
for a possible Iranian attack on Israel?
Good evening, Wolf.
So several things.
First, what I heard just in the last hour
from at least four sources,
two of them U.S.
officials
and two of them Israeli officials.
The assessment is that
this is not happening tonight.
That's that's what I heard from
both sides.
They think it will still
it might happen tomorrow.
It might happen the day after,
but it is not happening tonight.
Another sign for that.
President Biden's top Middle East
adviser, Brett McGurk, is
traveling to the region tonight
to Cairo to start working
or to continue working on the hostage
deal, on the Gaza hostage deal.
So the U.S.
is trying to to say by that
that, you know, business
as usual, plans
as usual, they're moving forward.
And the next thing
is that what I hear from both U.S.
and Israeli officials
is that they see two things.
First, with Hezbollah.
They see the Hezbollah's weapons
systems, long range
missiles are ready to fire at any minute.
And once Nasrallah will give the order,
they can fire on the Iranian side
extensive and significant
steps on the ground in the drone
units in the missile units
for a possible attack on Israel.
The people
are really worried about all of this.
General Marks,
give us your analysis of the U.S.
move to send this missile guided submarine
and to speed up the arrival of the USS
Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier
battle group to the region,
to the eastern Mediterranean, right near
where I am right now.
I think it's a very wise move
on the part of our Department of Defense
to try to get another carrier
strike group into the region
to make sure that that capability has now
doubled
in size and capacity.
The announcement of a sub movement,
I think is
unnecessary
when you have a carrier strike group.
You have submarines that are a part
of that carrier strike group.
The additional announcement,
I understand it sends a strong message,
but that's out of the norm.
What we should try to do
is simply move the capacity in there
and then we've got a very broad array
of capabilities
from which to choose in terms of what
type of a response we want to try to make.
And I think what's important at this
point is if those carrier strike groups
or any element within
those are under attack or get in the way
of what Iran tries
to do, the United States
then has a choice to make in terms of how
it wants to try to respond very directly.
Is it just in support
to help defend Israel or is it to go out,
go after those capabilities
that the Iranians or their proxies
might use to harm
the United States capabilities as well?
And that offensive potential military
capability
is very, very impressive indeed.
Barak, how much would a possible
Iranian retaliation
undermine Thursday's
scheduled ceasefire talks
that are supposed to take place either
in Cairo or Doha, Qatar?
Well, first,
the talks, as far as I understand,
are expected to take place in Doha.
This is still the plan,
at least the US and Israel and the Qatari
and Japan mediators all still say that
they're going to be there on Thursday.
But there's there's Hamas.
And Hamas announced that they don't want
another round of negotiations.
And one of the interpretations of this
statement is that Hamas and its leader
in war in Gaza, in the bunker
100 feet under the ground in Gaza,
is waiting for this Iranian attack
and for a Hezbollah attack, hoping
that after such an attack,
he can get better terms for the deal.
So the possible
the possibility of an Iranian attack
when attacked by Hezbollah
will influence the talks in any case.
So I think this is a very
those two things are intertwined.",20240812

we have seen more than 30

including three day old twins
and their mother.
CNN's Jeremy Diamond has this report.
All of us have.
How do you console a man
whose whole world has been shattered?
I'm not a man who, hours
earlier, was locked in the warm
embrace of his wife and newborn babies,
but now cries out in agony,
begging to see them one last time.
Oh, let us.

according to hospital officials.
I saw

The Palestinian
ministry of Health
says they are among 115 infants born
and killed during the war in Gaza.
Hours earlier, their mother, Jumana,
a pharmacist,
was blissfully responding
to congratulations
and well wishes on Facebook.
I feel like it was a miracle.
Alhamdulillah sister,
everything is going well.
I don't know Jumana.
I saw an usher now lie here in a room
consumed with Mohammed's
inconsolable grief.
That's for us to.
These are the birth certificates,
he says.
While I was getting them,
I received a phone call telling me
our apartment was targeted
and that my wife and children
were at Al-Aqsa hospital.
Neighbors are still sifting
through the aftermath of that strike.
Hospital officials say an Israeli
shell hit the building.
The Israeli military did not respond
to CNN's request for comment.
The victims of several other strikes
in central Gaza
also pour into Al-Aqsa martyrs hospital,
and more parents grieve
the deaths of their children.
How can I live after you, my son?
This mother cries
amid the grief.
There is also anger and exasperation,
including from the dead

does not care about this.

Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Haifa, Israel.
Israel-Hamas cease fire
talks are set to resume
Thursday in Doha
and a lot is riding on them.
There has been some speculation
that Iran
might hold off on plans to attack Israel
if a Gaza cease fire is reached soon.
But some have cast serious doubt on that.
Iran has vowed to retaliate
for the assassination of Hamas's
political leader
in Tehran,
an attack that it blames on Israel.
Meanwhile, sources
tell CNN
Hamas is taking a position
of intentional
ambiguity and ambiguity
about appearing at the Doha talks.
Representatives from Israel, Qatar, Egypt
and the U.S. are all taking part.
Nic Robertson joining us now
from Tel Aviv with the details.
Hi there, Nic.
So Hamas
being very non-committal
about the talks
that are set for Thursday.
What are you watching for?
And if they don't show,
are the talks off?
No.
There's a part of the talks
that's going to happen there.
Proximity talks.
So the U.S.
and Israel
and the intermediaries,
Qatar and Egypt can meet
and are expected to meet in Doha
tomorrow.
we do sort of see this strategic
all this ambiguity,
by Hamas as, as a potential way
to try to put pressure on
the Israeli government
because they're being very specific
about why they have this ambiguity.
They are saying
these are not negotiations
from that point of view,
that the meeting in Doha
should be about implementing,
the framework
that President Biden put forward,
in, over the past couple of months
that they say
that the Israeli government,
Prime Minister Netanyahu,
who has added on additional things
like control
and veto over prisoner exchange,
prisoner release, says about the control
of the Philadelphia Corridor,
the control of the Rafah border crossing,
all of which are huge issues for Hamas
that they say
were not part of that original framework.
So from their perspective.
you know, and speaking to other sources
who are informed about the talks
and about Hamas's position,
it seems clear through this ambiguity
as well, very clear
that if the talks were to go
in Doha between the U.S.
and and Israel and Qatar
and the Egyptians, as Hamas wants,
then they would have somebody available
to have a follow on discussion with,
but I don't think expectations are
at that point.
I think the expectations
really at the moment,
questioning what is going to be different
about these talks than any other,
how much or has there
been any substantial change
on the negotiating position of either
side, either Hamas or Israel?
And that's where things stand.
And of course, that's what
Iran is waiting to see.
And the expectation is,
regardless of the outcome of these talks,
Iran will strike.
It's just a question
of how big that strike would be.
And, Nick,
if you want to talk to us about,
you know, what
you're hearing there in Israel,
because obviously,
Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
has been facing a lot of pressure.
And it seems
there seems to be a difference
between what the public wants versus
the political will
and what the government, is aiming for.
Yeah.
The latest polling,
on some of the channels here
in Israel indicates
about two thirds of the population
would go for a hostage deal.
as it's been outlined already, which
which is a significant number.
But that's not the position
of prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that we know.
And it's certainly not the position
that the hard right
members of his coalition government,
are willing to tolerate.
They threatened to get out of the talks
if he went for that kind of deal.
I think there's been a lot of expectation
in the region, particularly,
you know, in trying to get these talks up
and running tomorrow,
that there would be a lot of U.S.
pressure on Prime Minister
Netanyahu to change his position,
not to have these add ons
that, Hamas talks about,
although his office says they don't
they haven't put any add ons
to President Biden's framework.
and when we had the announcement
yesterday, that, that the United States
was going to clear
$20 billion worth of military,
of military equipment to Israel, not
this is part of a long process,
and it's only part of that process,
and it's only provisional,
the timing of it,
because it's been a long process
that seemed to indicate
that the United States
potentially potentially
trying to
trying to give Prime Minister Netanyahu
something in return for what they may
hope comes out of these talks.
But I would say no
one is holding their breath
that that would be the outcome from this.
Yeah, they understand the complexities
and reality of,
all that is taken into account.

end of November,
when,
the release of, the hostages last release
of hostages from Gaza.
I had an eyewitness say that
she was with him for for a few
for a day or two, and she talked to him,
and he was really emotionally
down, and,
thinking about my son
and what happened, and, that he misses.
I don't know if he knows if we are okay.
And it was a really long time ago
that that day that she told me that
she saw him.
It's unimaginable
that we are sitting right now after this
time, and nothing changed.
He's not back.
They're not back.
They're not all back.
It's.
It's unthinkable.
It's unthinkable and unbearable.
And we live in this.
In this,
In this audacity.
Every day, every hour,
thinking about our loved ones
in in hostage conditions.
Do you have any hope
that these negotiations,
which are taking place
and are about to resume,
will result in a ceasefire
and be the release of the hostages,
including your husband?
Most definitely. Yes. Yes.
the only way that Charlie and 114
other hostages can come back.
Some alive, some dead for
a proper burial,
is the
only way is in in, in a deal.
The only way is in a deal.
You cannot make.
and and and army and,
you know, a mission to to save them all.
You cannot do that.
Well, further complicating
this whole situation
now is the possibility
that Iran might attack Israel. Yes.
And that could happen within days. Yes.
And presumably that would undermine
whatever negotiations
might be taking place
for a cease fire and a hostage release.
Yes, I know, it's like,
it's it's I'm trying not to be.
I'm trying to filter
the ongoing threats from all over
and keep my eye on the hostages and
on sacking my husband, my loved one,
my better half.
the threat is here,
and I think it's been ongoing for,
few months.
It's not a new thing.
I think they need to close this deal.
So all the, all the,
the Middle East can be
relaxed from this situation
because the situation is is burning.
And if the Middle East will become
a battle zone,
it won't be a third World War.
I don't see it.
It will take all the allies
into the situation.
It's horrific.
What do you miss most about your husband?
I miss his voice.
And,
I miss his hugs.
And I miss the,
the time that we have together.
And I miss him.
joking with the kids
and laughing.
And making dinner with him
and watching a movie.
Taking a walk.
I miss every little thing.
It's been too long.
It's unbearable.
We have no air anymore.
They have to come back.
It's part of us.
And your daughter?
My son.
She was killed.
Murdered that day? Yes.
You miss her? Obviously.
Every day too.
Oh, just something.
I feel
is something that, is.
I cannot
grieve about my.
Because I'm in an ongoing war
to save my husband.
I didn't went to see her grave.
I could, and it's going to be a year,
and I need to go and see her,
and I can't.
I need to be here and
we need to do it together.
He needs to see her grave.
He needs to grieve with me.
We need to hold each other through this.
And.
And as all of us know, October 7th.
It's almost.
The year was the worst day
of Jews being murdered
since the Holocaust. Yes.
It's interesting that you are saying,
because today I thought that
I think the mark,
the horrific marks of Jewish
is the Holocaust and the 7th of October.
You're so right.
This is
I think it will be a stain
in Israeli history.
And it will be worse
if the hostages will not come back.
Come back
and I, I will not I will not allow them
to sacrifice my husband
for the sake of war.
How are your other children dealing
with all this now?
Our young kids,
the very young Sean is, 16.
She turned 16
while,
this year has passed.
And,
Yael is, 12,
and she is ten.
there are some good days
and some bad days.
we are all talking about my.
And all the time.
they have some times
that they are breaking down
and crying and missing their sister and.
Yeah.
And a few days ago, Sean came to my room
crying in the middle of the night
and said, I want my daddy,
I want daddy.
I miss my girl and I want that he.
And it's.
And you need to.
And you need to hug her.
And just what can I say to her?
What can I say to her?
What answer is there?
I can't bring her.
Her dad.
I wish I could.
I would have in any means.
I need the government
and everybody that are
in the doing of this deal
to bring home alive.
Like he was taken.
He was taken a line.
He needs to come back alive.
I hope he does.
I hope he comes back soon.
And when he does,
I hope to come and meet him.
I promise you that when he comes back,
we'll do a recap. Good.
I'd like to talk to him,
and I'm keeping the hope.
That's what we said the last time.
We need to know.
And we are 330 days after.
Yeah,
it's a long time.
It's a long time.
It's unbearable.
Wolf, we need to breathe again.
And to breathe.
We need them back.
All of them back.
Let's hope the next time we meet.
Thank you.
Sorry is back.
Oh, it's going to be amazing.
I have this picture that is coming back,
and I'm
meeting in the hospital
with the kids running
toward him and Jane running toward him.
And
it's going to be a strong reunion.
And, we need this circle to be closed.
And so.
But that was,
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
As we say.
Let's hope, let's hope.
Bring them back.
Please. Please, please.",20240816
YZESvtqhfqs,"Israeli settlers attack West Bank village, drawing condemnation from top officials","data/en_CNN\Israeli settlers attack West Bank village, drawing condemnation from top officials.jpg","A second day of
talks in Doha
over a potential Gaza cease
fire and hostage release deal
have now ended.
CNN is told that technical teams
will continue to meet in the coming days,
until the main principals
meet again in Cairo next week.
This comes as the Israeli
military orders evacuations
from parts
of the so-called humanitarian zone
in southern Gaza.
Israel says that it has intelligence
that terrorist activity
is taking place there.
Since October of last year,
more than 80% of the Gaza Strip
has been subjected to evacuation orders.
That's according
to the UN's humanitarian agency.
Meanwhile,
a Palestinian village
in the occupied West
Bank has come under attack
by armed Israeli settlers.
Nic Robertson is tracking this story
for us
with a car behind was set on
fire as the settlers came
into this hilltop village.
The man who owns the car,
I talking to him.
His face is smashed up.
He said he tried to confront the settlers
as they came in.
He described a scenario
that they haven't
witnessed in this particular village
for a long time.
And he said, never before
in fights that they ever seen.
settlers coming
in, firing live rounds, firing tear gas.
And when we arrived in the town here
a little earlier on in the day,
we were witness to the funeral
cortege of Rashid,
said a 23 year old young man
who was shot dead by the settlers.
There was a lot of anger,
in that cortege
at the settlers,
at the Israeli government,
a lot of pain being felt.
This was a young man of the village.
He was being carried at shoulder
height, wrapped in a Palestinian flag.
young men carrying him, older men
watching from the sides.
And at the
at the funeral service in the graveyard
a little after the oration,
there was absolutely powerful,
and very clear in its message
that the people of this village
don't feel safe,
that they believe
that the settlers
were acting with the support
of the Israeli government.
They don't feel in this village
protected by,
the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force.
In fact,
they allege
that the Israeli Defense Force was
was protecting the settlers now.
the IDF did
stop a second attack
overnight getting into this village.
The IDF and the Israeli police
are investigating the incident.
So far, we've heard condemnation
coming from the US ambassador, Jack Lew,
saying it's
absolutely appalled by this
and these attacks must stop.
The defense minister of Israel,
Yoav Gallant, has put his condemnation
out as well, calling it radical violence.
That does not,
he said, does not stand up to the values
of the State of Israel.
Israel's interior
minister has condemned
it as well,
calling it, violent nationalist riots.
Those were his words.
So the condemnation
coming from Israeli
officials, even from right
wing leaders like Itamar Ben-Gvir,
although he did say that
the Israeli Defense Force should do more
to protect the settlers
and Israelis from the stone throwers
whom he calls terrorists
in his in these villages.
That's his allegation.
and he but he did say that this is
this is absolutely unacceptable.
So this is strong condemnation
coming from Israeli officials,
but it just doesn't cut through
in these villages.
People here don't feel safe.
and, and
and I think irrespective
of what they hear
from the Israeli government,
they will continue to believe
that events like last night,
the settlers coming in
unarmed in the village
when no one was expecting,
killing a young man, injuring others.
They think these are coordinated
by the government.
They're in cahoots together.
This is deeply divisive,
particularly at the time of these
very sensitive
talks in Doha about the future of Gaza
going on.
Nic Robertson, CNN, Jeet
and the occupied West Bank.
All right.
Joining us now
from Washington, DC is our chief
national security correspondent,
Alex Marquardt. Alex, good to see you.
Let's circle back to the cease fire.
Talk to me.
What what more do we know
about how these talks ended?
And also what progress was made, if any.
Well, they they ended on a positive note.
And the fact that we know
that more meetings
are going to be happening
in the coming days.
That that is positive.
But by no means are we on the cusp
of any kind of imminent deal renewal
that is important.
These main mediators.
So the heads of intelligence
for the Egypt, for Egypt
and the US, as well as the Katari
prime minister,
they went into these talks
with the Israelis, with Hamas,
trying to bridge some,
some pretty significant gaps.
And what we heard today
from those three mediating countries
in a joint statement,
was that they made progress
by putting forward
what they're calling a bridging proposal,
essentially a document
that takes all of the outstanding issues
and tries
to bring the two sides
closer together in terms
of how those issues
will not only be solved,
but how they will be implemented.
So what we're told
is that in the coming days,
now that these main talks
are over in Doha
at a lower level,
experts on what are called
technical teams will get together
to essentially cross
the T's, dot
the I's and really work
towards a final agreement.
And then towards the end of next week,
the main players again
will get back together
in the Egyptian capital, Cairo.
So we're talking about the CIA director,
Bill Burns,
the Egyptian intelligence director,
Abbas Kamel, the Qatari prime minister,
the Israeli head of the Mossad
intelligence agency, and Hamas.
And so these are encouraging signs.
But no one that I've spoken to,
Hal, is ready to say that
this is certainly something
that is going to happen.
I want to read you
part of the joint statement
that was released
just a short time ago
from the three mediating countries,
that says
it is time to release the hostages
and detainees,
begin the cease fire, and implement
this agreement.
The path is now set for that outcome.
Saving lives, bringing relief
to the people of Gaza and de-escalate
the escalating regional tensions.
One more note, Rachel.
This comes
as the prospect of a major strike
or major strikes
from Hezbollah
and Iran could happen against Israel.
Retaliatory strikes.
And so what the cease fire talks
those involved are hoping to
accomplish is essentially to push those
those potential strikes away to
to keep them at bay.
And in fact,
the Qatari prime minister has reached out
to the Iranian foreign minister
not once, but twice in the past two days
to keep him abreast of the talks
and to say that essentially
that they need to give these
these cease fire
discussions a chance
and that any kind of escalatory,
any kind of escalatory action,
a major strike could derail the prospect
for peace in Gaza.
Rachel and Alex,
I mean, to that end,
Israel is saying
and telling its counterparts
in the UK and France
that it expects their nations,
the UK and France, to attack
Iran if Iran strikes Israel.
Why?
I mean, where do those nations
stand on that?
But also, where is the U.S.
stand on this?
Well,
the US is essentially helping
coordinate that effort.
And let's remind our viewers
why we expect this to happen.
And several weeks ago,
there were a pair of strikes
that Israel is either publicly behind
or is believed to have been behind.
One was against a major figure
in the Hezbollah militant group
in Lebanon, Forward
Shakur, who was killed in an airstrike
in southern Beirut by Israel.
The next day,
there was an operation
that took out the top political leader
for Hamas in the Iranian capital.
Israel did not admit
that they carried that out,
but it is widely believed that they did.
And so now we're in a situation
where it is believed that Hezbollah
and or Iran could respond.
Now, it's been several weeks.
So we've been waiting to see
every single day
whether this is going to happen.
In the meantime,
the US has been assuring Israel
that it will come to its defense.
it is expected that the Brits
and the French
would also help in that defense.
And the major reasons
are not just because
they want to protect Israel.
But if there were major damage
and a lot of deaths in Israel
as a result of those strikes,
we could expect the situation
to really escalate
and potentially spiral out of control.
So the US, and potentially
with the Brits
and the French
are really trying to avoid that scenario.
but right now we are waiting and seeing
whether Hezbollah and Iran
could carry out those kinds of strikes.
Well, we continue to watch.
Alex Marquardt,
thank you for your reporting",20240816

tragedy and loss in war Tor Gaza sham and&nbsp;&nbsp;
sa's story is unlike any other we have come&nbsp;
across in 10 months of War that's because&nbsp;&nbsp;
saah doesn't just accuse Israeli troops&nbsp;
of killing her husband acram and daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

unable to move until she finally&nbsp;
finds the strength to crawl down&nbsp;&nbsp;
the street and into this nearby home&nbsp;
we obtained footage from that house&nbsp;&nbsp;
after our first interview with sah this&nbsp;
is the first time she and Sha are seeing
it and Sham begins to tell my&nbsp;
colleague air Salman what happened to
her an explosion then rocks the&nbsp;

the four people who entered in the area were&nbsp;
caught in the intense exchange of fire between&nbsp;&nbsp;

one soldier if if you could see him again
sana's pain is as raw as ever and seeing her home&nbsp;&nbsp;

emotion mundane objects&nbsp;
are transformed into relics
and saana is taken back in time to&nbsp;
the life she will never get back and&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jeremy's joining us now from Tel Aviv&nbsp;
Jeremy very very powerful story I want&nbsp;&nbsp;
to know whether there's any update to&nbsp;
the fact that you report the IDF says&nbsp;&nbsp;
they're going to send her back with&nbsp;
her daughter is that is that really
possible as of now Israeli authorities are&nbsp;
planning to send s and Sham back to Gaza at&nbsp;&nbsp;
some point early next month but as I understand&nbsp;
it if a third country comes in and says that they&nbsp;&nbsp;
will take them in then there is an option here&nbsp;
for them to not go back to Gaza and I do want&nbsp;&nbsp;
to stress what that could mean if they were&nbsp;
sent back to Gaza I spoke with Sham actually&nbsp;&nbsp;
just in the last sorry I spoke with Sana in&nbsp;
just the last hour and she told me that she&nbsp;&nbsp;
is terrified of going back to Gaza terrified&nbsp;
of what life would be like if she were living&nbsp;&nbsp;
with her family who are currently living in&nbsp;
makeshift shelters they've been displaced&nbsp;&nbsp;
four times in Gaza already so far during this&nbsp;
war but most of all she is terrified about what&nbsp;&nbsp;
going back to Gaza could mean for her daughter&nbsp;
sham uh you know I first met sham five months&nbsp;&nbsp;
ago and and the girl that she is now is very&nbsp;
different from the girl she was 5 months ago&nbsp;&nbsp;
she has opened up so much more and her mother is&nbsp;
terrified that should they go back to Gaza all&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the progress that she has made since then uh&nbsp;
could effectively be erased in an instant it is&nbsp;&nbsp;
incredible how resilient children can be given&nbsp;
half the chance but I want to know what about&nbsp;&nbsp;
the bigger picture in terms of a ceasefire&nbsp;
for everybody's sake uh transfer of hostages&nbsp;&nbsp;
and prisoners um there's all sorts of leaking as&nbsp;
you know and Reporting um of blaming and finger&nbsp;&nbsp;
pointing at the Netanyahu government for for&nbsp;
not pushing these ahead even within the Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp;
establishment there are criticisms for the way&nbsp;
this is going and even Egypt has been leaking that&nbsp;&nbsp;
they don't think the Israelis want a a&nbsp;
ceasefire what do you think is going on&nbsp;&nbsp;
H how much do you how much store do you set&nbsp;
by what the Americans are saying that it's so
close it is so hard to know who or what&nbsp;
information to believe at this stage and so&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think we have to just kind of keep an open mind&nbsp;
about various different possibilities there's no&nbsp;&nbsp;
question though that it very much seems like the&nbsp;
Americans are the most kind of optimistic the most&nbsp;&nbsp;
gung-ho about this current negotiating process and&nbsp;
at times it really does feel like they are almost&nbsp;&nbsp;
trying to will this uh ceasefire agreement&nbsp;
into existence you know yesterday we heard&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Secretary of State Anthony blinkin saying&nbsp;
that Israel has accepted this bridging proposal&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is intended to bridge the gaps between the&nbsp;
Israeli position and the Hamas position but at&nbsp;&nbsp;
the same time we are still hearing doubts in the&nbsp;
Israeli government about Israel's full commitment&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh to the current version of the ceasefire&nbsp;
proposal and in addition to that Hamas is&nbsp;&nbsp;
saying that they believe this bridging proposal&nbsp;
is effectively caving to a series of Israeli&nbsp;&nbsp;
demands which they view as total non-starters so&nbsp;
right now it's it seems difficult to imagine how&nbsp;&nbsp;
a deal could come together this week uh which is&nbsp;
what the United States has said their goal is um&nbsp;&nbsp;
but it is clear that at least negotiations&nbsp;
are continuing and we expect the Secretary&nbsp;&nbsp;
of State Anthony blinkin as he arrives in Doha&nbsp;
cutter to get a better sense from the cutteries&nbsp;&nbsp;
who are the key interlocutors with Hamas about&nbsp;
exactly where their head is at behind the scenes&nbsp;&nbsp;
so these negotiations certainly continuing&nbsp;
very hard to see where they go from here",20240820
PzLBHU9S-go,'I was so shocked': Mom who broke down on DNC stage speaks out,data/en_CNN\'I was so shocked' Mom who broke down on DNC stage speaks out.jpg,"one of the
most moving moments of the DNC
unfolded last night.
It was not the stirring speech
of a gifted politician,
but the heartbroken words
of this man's parents,
23 year old Hirsch Goldberg.
Poland is an Israeli
American hostage held by Hamas.
He is one of eight Americans
still held nearly 11 months.
That's right, 11 months
after the terror attacks on Israel.
Last night,
they took to the stage
wearing the number 320
for the
number of days he's been held prisoner.
In an inflamed Middle East.
We know the one thing
that can most immediately
release pressure
and bring calm to the entire region.
A deal that brings this diverse
group of 109 hostages home
and ends the suffering
of the innocent civilians in Gaza.
So there you go.
Such an incredible moment.
And John and Rachel Goldberg, Poland,
join me now.
Rachel, we should note
you're both wearing 321.
You were wearing 320 last night.
It's not 321.
Did we change it every day? Yeah.
And what did that moment mean to you
last night?
I was so shocked and overwhelmed
because we had been told to anticipate
in neutral to negative reception.
Yeah.
and when we walked out and
suddenly there were
thousands of people who got to their feet
and started to chant, bring them home.
We were just
swelled with support
and it was overwhelming.
And I just started to weep.
Yeah, I think a lot of people were, John,
how did that,
how did that, resonate with you
seeing that?
I mean, because I know this week
what we've been hearing is
obviously there are protests here.
There's a lot of deep opposition
to the war in Gaza.
but there's still
in the hearts of a lot of folks
in this country.
Just pain and agony
for what you're going through.
It's so easy to politicize everything.
And that's the danger
and that's what's been happening.
But it was heartening last night
to see that even before we spoke a word,
I think people understood that
there's a human side to this story.
It's not just an issue.
It's not just numbers and ambiguity.
These are 109 real human beings
with loved ones,
with families waiting for them,
their innocence on all sides.
In the Middle East,
conflict to our suffering.
And I think the people in the room
understood that last night.
Yeah, that was what was so important.
And you've emphasized the diversity
of the hostages, right?
Well, I think that there's
a real misunderstanding
of who
this hostage cohort is
that this is a monolithic
group of people.
And as I mentioned
last night,
they are from 23 different countries.
They are Christian.
They are Jewish.
They're Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists.
And this is something that gets lost
when someone has a very specific reason
to create a narrative a certain way.
And we all so
very much
are constantly saying
we are extremely concerned
and heartbroken
for the innocent civilians in Gaza
and the innocent civilians
in Gaza
who were dragged there on October 7th.
You don't have to choose
one or the other.
This is a humanitarian issue.
Absolutely.
and everybody's feeling it.
Everybody's feeling.
And John Hirsh lost part of his left arm
in the text.
We do.
We know of any idea how he's doing,
how how he's holding up?
120 days ago,
we saw a video
that Hamas released of Hirsh.
It was the first sign of life
we had on him in 201 days,
and the last we've had since.
But that video is something
that no parent would ever want
to see of their kid with a limb missing,
bruising on their face, looking pale.
But at the
same time, when that's
what you get after 201 days,
it just gave us strength
to see him, to hear him,
and it continues to carry us now
that he's a fighter and a survivor
and he's going to keep on going.
And we need him to know
and all the hostages
to know
that we are not stopping
until we get them all out.
And, Rachel, I know I was asking this
during the commercial break,
but do you have any sense?
I mean, there are these talks
that are going on right now.
Do you have any sense
as to where they're going?
Are they finally going
to get to some kind of resolution
so we can bring your son
and the rest of those hostages home?
Well, we're not any more privy to
what is going on
behind the scenes than any,
any regular person
watching the news or following.
We are always hopeful and optimistic.
We know that many of the
people who are participating
in the negotiations,
and in
everything that's happening,
are really trying to lean forward.
At the end of the day,
this is up to two men from the two
primary parties.
Yeah, Prime Minister
Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Senor.
And, I think until each of them decide
that it's time for our children,
our loved ones, the whole entire
mass of people
who are caught
in the crosshairs of this conflict
no longer should be pawns in this game.
It won't end.
And it's so important.
And I do want to go back to that moment
last night that people understand
that the human element of this,
they're real families suffering,
real families in the dark.
And to have that outpouring of support,
it just must have meant so much
that it's still there,
have spite everything
that's in the political,
you know, spectrum right now,
the dialog that's happening
and so much bitter opposition
to what's taking place that
it's still there,
that I mentioned
in my remarks
last night,
that really one of the things
that has carried
all of the hostage families
to get up every morning
and keep on pushing and keep fighting
is the tremendous support,
strength prayers
we get from literally all over the world.
And last night was a microcosm of this.
I don't know, 2020
5000 people in the building.
Not only were they supporting us
as we spoke,
but afterwards just people stopping us.
And as we walked out
shouting, we're with you,
we're supporting you,
our prayers are with you. Keep going.
It was really none of the
none of the reaction
that you were prepared for that
they told you you might receive.
Correct.
That's that's so important.
Yeah. It's so important.
And and I'm
sure it sustains you to some extent.
It's not. It doesn't do everything right.
But it's obviously helpful.
And I think it is really important.
We don't all have to agree.
And that was a big theme last night
that a lot of the different speakers
discussed.
But we have to try to understand.
We don't have to agree.
We just have to try to understand
those with whom we don't share
the same opinions.
That's all right.
That's what
we have to try to understand each other.
Yeah.
There was a lot of talk
about looking out for your neighbors,
you know,
and that that crosses our boundaries.
You know, nations.
We honestly did not even know
that we were speaking on the night
that was under the freedom theme.
Interesting.
But
it makes sense, right?
That's that's what we're pushing for.
That's what
we've been pushing for 321 days
and are going to continue
to fight for it.
Well, thank you very much to both of you.
Really appreciate I know we say it,
time and again, but,
we are thinking of you
and praying for you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you. Appreciate it.
Rachel and John, thanks so much.",20240822
0swtHmeEV3I,Ret. US colonel on what could happen next between Israel and Hezbollah,data/en_CNN\Ret. US colonel on what could happen next between Israel and Hezbollah.jpg,"Tonight, the Pentagon is ordering two
American carrier strike groups to remain
in the region after a major flare up
of strikes between Israel and Hezbollah.
Here to help me break it
all down is retired U.S.
Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton.
So let's start with this order
for the Pentagon to have these carrier
strike groups remain in place.
What is the significance of this?
It's huge, actually, Paula,
because when you look at this part
of the Middle East
and you see Israel here in Lebanon, here
the eastern Mediterranean
is a perfect jumping off
point for the US to exercise
some degree of influence.
But more importantly,
it also, these carrier strike groups
also allow the US to collect intelligence
in this area.
They can provide
tactical intelligence to the Israelis
so that the Israelis better defend
themselves through the Iron Dome system
and other systems that they have to
protect themselves from a missile attack
or any other kind of rocket attack.
Now, we saw attacks coming from
both Israel and Hezbollah.
Talk about the significance
about this exchange.
So when you have this is very interesting
because you had Israel,
of course, doing
preemptive actions in Lebanon.
So they would be attacking
areas in the south right along here.
This is where Hezbollah is concentrated.
So what the Israelis did was
they made a preemptive strike
against all of these areas.
They employed over 100 aircraft,
and these aircraft would go in and attack
these areas.
One of the types of aircraft
that they used was this F-35.
They used this along with several other
aircraft, including F-16s, aerial
refueling, to actually conduct operations
in this area.
Now, what was important here
was they struck these areas first.
But what Hezbollah was doing
once the Israelis attacked
Hezbollah, attacked targets
or tried to attack targets in Israel.
Now, they weren't able to actually strike
many of the targets in Israel.
And what they were able to do with the
Israelis were able to do was
they were able to intercept almost
all of the missiles that were coming in
that were going to strike certain military
targets or certain civilian areas.
And that was a key
element in what what the Israelis
were able to do in this particular case.
Another key question here.
What is the possibility
of a possible response from Iran?
Well, that is something
that is actually quite possible
because, Hezbollah,
this is Lebanon right here,
is of course, concentrated right here,
but they are a proxy for Iran.
Iran has this vast land area right here.
But we'll remember back in April,
they used over 300 missiles
and rockets and drones to attack
Israel, basically about a thousand miles
from the Iranian border to Israel.
And they were able to do this.
But all of this was intercepted through
the Iron Dome system that the Israelis
had. And the Iron Dome system
is designed to detect incoming,
missiles, rockets,
drones and really find out where they are.
They kind of have algorithms that predict
exactly where these rockets might strike.
they assess
whether or not that's going to happen.
And when they intercept
this using the Tamir missile, for example,
they will hit the missile, right where,
at this point,
but they won't hit it directly.
What they'll do is
dismissal will blow up in the proximity
of the incoming projectile,
and it will actually take things out.
So when the Iranians,
did this, this strike
back in April,
they loved a lot of stuff in Israel.
but because of the Iron Dome and U.S.
intelligence and radar activity,
and allied activity,
they were able to keep all of these,
the Iranian, efforts, really?
They held them at bay and made the Iranian
strike ineffective at that point.
What are you watching for
over the next 48 hours?
So over the next 48 hours,
one of the key things to look for is
what happens next with Hezbollah.
They're going to be operating
still in this area.
Are they going to use some of the missiles
that they have in the
in the northern area of, of Lebanon,
right in this area right here?
this area is an area where they store
some of their intermediate range missiles.
they could launch some of those
just from a tactical military perspective.
but the other thing is
what is happening in the peace talks
which are happening here in Cairo,
are they going to
the ones that are affecting these,
the peace talks affecting Gaza?
Are they going to have any impact on what,
Hezbollah does,
but broadening this out to the region?
what is Iran going to do
if Hezbollah is satisfied?
Iran might be satisfied,
at least in the short term.
And if the peace talks, actually
bear fruit, Iran might
hold their fire for a while and might not
be acting in an offensive fashion.
but that remains to be seen
whether or not they actually do that.",20240825
OmnQ8h7aVyE,Israel rescues 52-year-old hostage held by Hamas in Gaza in ‘complex operation’,data/en_CNN\Israel rescues 52-year-old hostage held by Hamas in Gaza in ‘complex operation’.jpg,"Breaking news to CNN.
The Israeli military has just announced
a hostage has been rescued from Gaza.
Jeremy Diamond is following this story.
Jeremy, what do we know?
yeah.
We've just learned that,
a hostage who is being held by Hamas
since October 7th has been rescued
in an Israeli military operation.
Israeli military just releasing
the details that killed Farhan al-Saadi,
a 52 year old, Bedouin man
from Israel was,
rescued in an operation,
a joint operation by the Israeli military
and the Israeli, intelligence
service, the Shin Bet.
they say that he was rescued by Shalit
at 13.
That's, the Israeli equivalent
of the Navy Seals, as well as by Air
Harlem and, Shin Bet forces,
under the command of the 162nd Division.
This happened in the southern Gaza Strip.
and that is the extent of the, details
that we have for now.
He's only one of a handful of,
Israeli, hostages
who have actually been rescued in Israeli
military operations in Gaza.
I believe that there have been at least
six others so far who have been rescued
by the Israeli military.
Most of the hostages, of course,
who have actually gotten out of Gaza,
got out during that November week
long truce.
but no doubt that this is incredible
news for his family,
this 52 year old man, Kaid
Farhan al-Khatib.
He was actually working
as a security guard near
the Gaza border
on the morning of October 7th.
And that is when he was taken
captive by Hamas
and whisked away into the Gaza Strip.
He has been there now, for the last,
ten and a half months
as a captive of Hamas.
So obviously some very rare
and very good news, today, for him
and his family, ten and a half months
in captivity, just incredible.
And of course, we'll, you know,
are awaiting the details of this operation
as to how they were able to pinpoint
where he was, in terms of, you know, the,
the ongoing the, the hostage, release
and ceasefire talks that remain ongoing.
Do you see this
rescue operation impacting the talks
in any way?
Jeremy?
It is really difficult to know the extent
to which
this will actually impact the talks.
I mean, anytime
something happens on the ground,
whether it is a strike in Gaza,
a rescue operation or anything else,
it can have some kind of an impact
if not on the talks themselves,
and certainly
on the psychology of the populations
that are being represented by the
different parties at the negotiated table.
and this will be a boost,
of course, for Israeli morale to see
that another hostage has indeed
been rescued from captivity.
But I think that all of the families
of the hostages are pretty clear eyed
at this point, that they are not counting
on additional Israeli rescue operations
to get all of their loved ones
out of Gaza.
They know and certainly
a big portion of the Israeli government
knows, that it is ultimately a deal
with Hamas that will lead to the release
of the remaining hostages
and the question is, can that happen
quickly enough for, 
more of them to come home alive
rather than dead, as we have seen a number
of the bodies of Israeli hostages,
some of whom, died only in recent months,
being brought back to Israel,
in body bags.
Sadly, rather than coming home alive,
we know that those negotiations
are still ongoing
at a technical level in Cairo right now.
the United States has said
that there has been significant progress
over the weekend towards a deal.
but it is still very difficult to know
whether or not these talks
will actually lead to an agreement
that would see dozens more hostages
released. Yeah.
The last rescue that we saw,
happened, in June
where we for captives were released.
And that came, amid a major Israeli
air and ground
offensive where dozens of people,
were killed as a result.
Are we getting any more information
about this hostage rescue operation?
Jeremy?
As of now, no.
I mean, we are looking.
One of the things that I will be looking
for as well is to see,
you know, how heavy was this Israeli
military operation in terms of,
collateral damage
and casualties on the ground?
We have seen in the past
that when the Israeli military
does carry out these rescue operations,
they tend to, do quite a bit of damage
on the ground, 
bombing the area in order to try and send
their special forces in safely
to rescue these hostages.
But as we saw in the previous instance,
of course, of those four hostages
who were rescued, back in June, dozens
of Palestinians on the ground were killed,
including a number of civilians
who were part of that death.
All right.
Jeremy Diamond,
I know this is a developing story, right?
We have, Gideon
Levy with us now from Haaretz.
to talk more about this.
Jeremy, thank you so much, 
for getting up quickly for that report.
first off, Gideon,
please give me your reaction
to this latest,
hostage rescue operation.
What do you know?
First of all, it's a it's a very it's
happy news.
I mean, on a humanitarian basis,
everyone is something.
And in this case, it's
a Bedouin of Israel.
I think he got a granddaughter, 
by the time that he was
in, in captivity and, and,
you know, each hostages a whole world.
But it shouldn't change our minds.
The hostages will not be released
by such operations
here and there, here at both the.
They're living hostage.
But the hostages will be released
only in a deal which will end this war.
There are no shortcuts.
and I'll ask you the question
that I asked Jeremy about, you know,
how do you see
how do you see these rescue operations?
And the last one in June,
we saw, quite a high number of casualties
on the Palestinian side.
How do you see these hostage
rescue operations potentially impacting,
the ongoing talks where we know
there are huge sticking points.
First of all, the
ongoing talks, leading to nowhere.
So it's not much to put in risk.
But what is in risk, obviously, are lives
of innocent Palestinians
in those operations.
I don't know about this one.
The last operation in which
there were only bodies brought to Israel,
dozens of Palestinians
sprayed in their lives.
And this is obviously unacceptable,
especially when it is
about both these dead bodies
and living hostages.
In this case, I don't know the details yet
because they are not very clear,
but I hope that not too many Palestinians
in their lives, they don't deserve.
if you are just joining
us, we're following breaking news.
we have just learned that a hostage
who was abducted by Hamas on October
7th has been rescued, not released,
rescued by the Israeli military.
This happened today.
his name is Kade.
Farhan. Al Shorty.
he is 52 years old, as we understand it.
And he was rescued by the,
401st Brigade and the Israeli forces.
And moments ago, we heard from a spokesman
from the Israeli government.
Listen.
He's in a stable
medical condition and is being transferred
for medical checks right now
at a Israeli hospital.
His overjoyed family,
has been updated with the details,
and the IDF is accompanying them
at this crucial moment.
Israeli security forces will continue
to operate with all means necessary.
All means necessary to bring home
all of our hostages.
This is truly uplifting news.
Everyone that cares about the lives
of our people here in Israel.
And I think right
thinking people around the world,
it's incredible.
But here he is in stable condition.
This is the 52 year old man
who was rescued.
Jim Sciutto is in Tel Aviv,
with the latest.
Hi there Jim. So what do we know?
I know it's early days,
and we're just getting the information
and a lot of questions about, 
the rescue operation itself.
But what do we know about the
man who is now a free man?
Yeah.
Listen, some rare good news
in this conflict, given that we're close
to 11 months out since the attacks
on October 7th and so many families
in Israel suffering,
waiting for news of their loved ones.
Here's what we know about this
rescued hostage, 52 year
old kid, Farhan al-Khatib.
He was a Bedouin.
and according to the Hostages
Family forum, he was October,
abducted on October 7th
from a security job at Kibbutz Mugen.
down in the south,
of course, close to Gaza.
you heard the Israeli government spokesman
there saying that his family has now
been given the good news
that he is in stable medical condition.
and, they are continuing to do
medical checks on him at a hospital.
it is, as I say, rare news,
to speak of a live rescue of a hostage.
All these months later.
The last one was on June 8th, when four
hostages were rescued from central Gaza.
This operation, taking place
in southern Gaza, involving both
both regular military units
and Israeli special forces.
They have not released further details
as to exactly
how they managed to gain his safety.
but again,
you have to go back to June 8th.
So a number of months
to a successful rescue operation.
Of course, just last week, six hostages,
bodies were recovered from from Gaza.
of course, not the good news
that these hostage families want to hear.
That leaves the total at 108, 108
that are still remaining there.
And Israeli government officials
have acknowledged that many of those 108,
though they have not specified
a number, are no longer alive.
the Hostage Form
Forum has released a statement
saying that this is nothing
short of miracle.
they go on to say that
military operations alone
cannot be expected to gain the freedom
of all these hostages.
Of course, that speaks to the tension
ongoing here between hostage families
and the government, because hostage
families have been quite impatient for
a deal.
A cease fire and hostage
release deal to gain the release of,
the other remaining hostages,
or at least a large number
of the other remaining hostages.
But at least today, for one
family, there is good news.",20240827
ErHNtXvopWw,Israel launches large-scale West Bank raid,data/en_CNN\Israel launches large-scale West Bank raid.jpg,"At least nine Palestinians
have been killed in the West
Bank after the Israeli military
launched rates and airstrikes overnight.
That's according
to the Palestinian Health ministry.
The Israeli military says it launched
a large counter-terror operation
overnight in two refugee camps.
Officials say
the Israeli military was targeting,
quote, Islamic
Iranian terrorist infrastructure.
CNN's Paula Hancocks is live for us
this hour in Abu Dhabi. And Paula.
This marks the largest Israeli operation
in the West Bank. For years.
And we understand we are hearing
there's been a response from Hamas
this hour to what has occurred.
Yeah.
Christina remarks.
This is certainly
a significant operation.
We have been saying for months
that there have been
these limited operations
by the Israeli military
into the occupied West Bank.
Hundreds of Palestinians
have been killed over recent months,
since October 7th of last year.
But this is definitely something
more significant that we are seeing now.
We did hear from the governor
of Jeanine that he said
just after midnight.
So in the early hours of Wednesday,
the Israeli military surrounded
the refugee camp.
And Jeanine itself,
he says that he can still hear gunfire
ongoing in the area.
So it is believed
this operation is still going.
And he says a third of the city
is without electricity at this point.
Now, as you say,
we know that nine
Palestinians have been killed.
We hear from the
the Red Crescent Society,
from the Ministry of Health,
that those deaths
happened from airstrikes,
also from strikes on the ground.
We hear drones are in the air as well.
And when it comes
to the Israeli response so far,
we understand
there are hundreds,
at least hundreds of personnel involved.
We've been told that
there are four battalions of the border
police alone,
including undercover border police.
And that doesn't include the military
and the intelligence element.
So this is a large operation.
Now, one thing I wanted to
mention was a tweet
we had from the Israeli foreign minister,
which was interesting.
He gave a reason for this operation,
saying that it was to thwart
what he called Islamic Iranian terrorist
infrastructure, saying that
Iran is funding
and arming terrorists in the West Bank
as trying to create a situation
similar to Gaza and Lebanon.
And he said, quote,
we must address this threat
just like
we're handling
terror infrastructure in Gaza,
including temporary evacuation
of Palestinian residents
and any step necessary.
This is a war like any other,
and we must win it.
Now, that is significant.
The fact that he's suggesting
there could be evacuations
in the occupied West
Bank, just as there are
and have been in Gaza, putting
really a connection
between those two areas
and the potential Israeli
reaction to those areas.
Now, we've also heard
from the Ministry of Health
in the West Bank
that at least two hospitals
have been blocked
by the Israeli military,
saying that
there have been mounds of dirt,
for example, pushed towards those areas.
we have seen and obtained video
that would back up some of those claims.
You've seen some very heavy
Israeli military assets in those areas.
Bulldozers, for example,
pushing up infrastructure and pavements
and roads in those areas.
and we are still getting information
and video coming in,
showing the extent of this operation.
but what we're hearing
from the Israeli side
is that they are trying to, to to end
the Iranian terrorist infrastructure,
as they put it, in this, this area
from the Palestinian side
and certainly from those in Janine,
one of the key areas
that has been targeted,
certainly from the,
the governor,
they are concerned
about access to hospitals, about,
hundreds, within those hospitals itself.
given that they're claiming that,
that Israel has restricted,
all access that we heard
from the Red Crescent Society
as well, saying,
that their maneuvering of ambulances
has been
heavily restricted
by the Israeli military as well.
Max. Christina.
if this war expands funds from Gaza to,
the West Bank, that's obviously
a big escalation of that war, isn't it?
Just Israel have the
the resources for that.
I mean, I think they
certainly have the resources.
It would be a significant escalation.
The fact that the foreign minister
is connected in the to,
in such a blatant way on zoom,
Twitter is is significant
in itself,
mentioning potential evacuation
of Palestinian residents,
something that we have been seeing
for months, in Gaza
and something
we are still seeing,
the,
the Gaza residents that have been, moved
sometimes a dozen times from area to area
as the Israeli military tries
to clear out
civilians, they say, and target
Hamas militants
that are within
that area, will tunnels
that are within that area.
Now, if that were to be replicated in
in the West Bank, it would be,
very significant, very devastating
when you're talking
about these refugee camps in, in, shams,
for example, in Janine,
they are densely populated.
It a very similar situation
to what we see, in Gaza,
where it would be difficult
for them to be to be evacuated.
And of course, there would be a concern
if this operation
were to be significantly increased
by the Israelis
that there would be civilian casualties
within that as well.
Now, at this point, the Israeli military
not specifying
how wide this operation is
or how long it will go on for,
but suffice to say it is larger
than we have seen in some time.
Paula, thank you very much.
just to add to Paula's excellent
reporting there
that we have
had a response from Hamas,
in the last hour
calling for a general mobilization
and escalation of confrontation
in response to the Israeli operations
in the West Bank.
Although it is
hard to see
how that retaliation
would actually happen
given the scale of what
has been occurring in the West
Bank, as Paula has outlined there.
CNN anchor and chief national security
analyst Jim Sciutto is in Tel Aviv.
Jim, what are you learning about
this operation this morning?
Well, John, it's
the biggest Israeli operation
in the West Bank
since the October 7th attacks.
Israeli officials, the IDF,
say they're going
after what they call
Islamic Iranian terror infrastructure.
The allegation
they're making is that
weapons are coming into the West
Bank, funded by facilitated by Iran,
and that this attack is intended
to target that
the death toll
at this point stands at at least nine.
And what we're hearing
now publicly in response
from Hamas is Hamas
is calling
for a mobilization
of its supporters
and fighters in the West Bank.
So it's a significant operation.
And that reaction from Hamas
is significant.
Israeli officials
make the point
that the terror environment,
the threat is real.
Now, you may remember
a little more than a week ago,
there was a suicide
bombing here in Tel Aviv,
where only the bomber was killed.
So the Israeli
officials, Israeli
officials, are justifying
it based on the nature of the threat.
And what they say is the infrastructure
building in the West Bank.
Where does this put
the the
hostage and ceasefire negotiations?
Listen, you know,
I've covered so many negotiations
like this, and oftentimes
you will see attacks
like this, operations
like this,
in the midst of sensitive negotiations.
And it's hard to say
which way it will cut.
Will it disrupt those negotiations
because it.
Well, when you have Israel and Hamas
carrying out operations
like this against each other
certainly can make it harder
for negotiators.
Can you make the argument
that it allows Israeli
negotiators to show toughness
in terms of counterterror operations,
and therefore make it easier
to make concessions to bring a deal
across the finish line? Maybe.
But let's be frank,
those negotiations are quite sensitive
right now.
It's not clear
that they are making progress
on the most intractable issues.
So any increase in hostilities,
particularly in the West
Bank, are ones
that you have to treat as a risk.
And it's been notable
to hear the Israeli foreign minister
tweeting today that Israel should treat
carry out
operations in the West Bank
like they've been carrying out in Gaza.
That certainly would be quite
an escalation.
Yes it would.
All right.
Jim Sciutto, great to have you there.
Thanks so much,",20240828
FcVtsq068KI,'Soap has become a luxury item': Aid official describes anguish in Gaza,data/en_CNN\'Soap has become a luxury item' Aid official describes anguish in Gaza.jpg,"Former CNN war correspondent
Arwa Damon has been to the enclave
three times during this war
with her charity, Inara,
and she says that each trip reveals
that there is, quote,
less aid and more need.
I reached her this week from Daryl Balla
on the Gaza coast.
Arwa Damon,
welcome back to the program from Gaza.
Thank you for having me on.
Appreciate it.
Well, last time you were here,
after one of your trips,
you were in the studio
and you said essentially,
you know, things
just get exponentially worse.
I asked you last time how it was.
What is it
like this time
compared to when you were last there?
It's a sorrow
that is eclipsing
any kind of sorrow I've seen before.
It's misery beyond the scope of misery.
It's less humanitarian assistance,
less ability
to support those who are in need
and an increasingly growing population
that extends to just
about every single human being
in this wretched stretch of land
who cannot cope with
even the most basic of things.
Christiane, we,
international aid organizations
and local ones
have been reduced to trying to advocate
for something as simple as a bar of soap.
Honestly, it's become a lot.
It's terrible to hear you say that.
And I know you tweeted that.
Just explain what you mean by that
and what
what difference in life
and death would soap make right now?
So the bare bones of it
is that access to soap
and the ability
to maintain a certain level
of hygiene, reduces
the spread of disease by 40%.
What we are seeing right now
is a significant increase
in diseases like hepatitis A.
I went down to Nasser Hospital,
and the head of the pediatric department
there told me that two children
a week are dying just in that hospital
because of hepatitis A.
It also means meningitis is spreading.
It also means that
this horrific skin
disease called impetigo,
which is especially prevalent
in children and highly contagious
and can potentially be lethal
because if left untreated,
it can lead to kidney failure,
which can lead to death
is also all over the place.
These are all diseases
that can be controlled,
which in return would empty
a bed space in these hospitals
to be able
to deal with the catastrophic injuries
that they're getting
from the bomb blasts.
But there's no soap.
We go into these camps
and families are begging us for soap.
What are they use instead of soap?
Well, one family
I spoke to said that they were going down
to the beach, getting sand,
mixing it
with a little bit of salt and lemon.
And that's how they've
been cleaning themselves
for the last five months.
So if the cease fire,
which we've all been advocating for,
to be able
to get more humanitarian aid
and obviously hasn't
materialized for the last ten months,
we are now trying to simplify it
down to soap.
Oh my goodness.
I mean, that's really awful
to hear you say that.
and I just need to say,
because there's a report
that actually where you are, I think
near Deborah. Right.
There's the coast.
There is apparently showing up all brown
and murky
because of massive sewage spills.
So these people are going there
also to try to get clean,
but there's not even clean seawater.
And Christiane,
what people don't realize
when they hear about evacuation
orders is, yes,
we are very familiar
with that horrendous image of people
just carrying what they can.
But each evacuation order
impacts organizations
ability to distribute and produce
safe, clean water.
So the most recent evacuation orders
over the last two weeks from
hand hygiene units
reduced the population's
access to clean water by 70%.
So that has already had an impact
on what people are going through.
But if we extrapolate beyond
that and look at what's
happening in the ICUs,
I was in the ICU at hospital.
There's a 13 year old boy
with severe burn injuries.
He is in the ICU
because he has a blood infection
and signs of early sepsis,
because there weren't enough bandages
to be able
to keep his wounds properly clean.
There was a little year
and a half old girl
who is not stabilizing
from her catastrophic injuries,
because the small piece of plastic
called a tracheotomy or something
is not available in her size.
Now, we were luckily able to secure
some for her
and deliver them to the hospital.
But if this little girl wakes
up, Christiane,
she's going to wake up and find out
that she's an orphan.
Oh, no. Oh, this is just so awful.
We hear about the huge number of children
who have become orphans.
We also hear
a polio reported
for the first time
in 25 years in the Gaza Strip.
Apparently, a ten month old baby
was partially paralyzed.
I don't know whether you've been able
to hear
from the other humanitarians, the U.N.,
but apparently they're trying to start
even in the midst of this war
and destruction
of a polio vaccine program.
Is that possible?
Yeah, they have to.
And, you know,
there is movement in terms of,
you know,
getting a cold chain
in, getting the vaccine in
and training of people
to be able to deliver the vaccine.
The plan is on the table,
but the plan, absolutely, 100%
cannot be implemented
unless there is some sort of a pause
in the fighting that is taking place.
And if that pause does not happen,
and if polio starts to spread,
we are going to start seeing and hearing
more and more horrific stories
of more and more children
ending up paralyzed of something
that, again, is completely preventable.
I do not have the words
to begin to describe
just how hard it is
to provide people
with even the most basic of items,
because things are not available.
I just came back from a fresh
vegetable distribution,
to a couple of the shelters
that that we work with,
some of the families,
and we purchased
this locally, by the way,
because
aid isn't really moving in,
but commercial trucks are.
We purchased
some of these items at 20 times
their original price either.
Doesn't matter because these families
had not eaten
a fresh vegetable
for anywhere from five months,
and then at best, one
month was the last time
they had had fresh vegetables.
Oh, listen,
I mean, is the fighting worse
now than it was
two, three, four months ago?
I mean, the Israelis seem to say
they're busy degrading Hamas.
They're in these cease fire
hostage swap negotiations.
and yet, as you
say, aid is not getting in.
And we can quote also this week, the U.N.
said humanitarian efforts
ground to a halt
because of new Israeli evacuation orders.
The International Rescue Committee
also had to stop aid
during these evacuation orders.
It I mean, it's getting worse.
The international community
says it's trying to get aid
in, but you're saying
is practically at a trickle.
At best, it's less than a trickle.
It's like that
tiny little drop
that barely comes out of the faucet.
And we also had to suspend our usual sort
of programs and activities
for a few days,
because two of our staff
and five of the shelters that we worked
with were under evacuation orders.
And I myself have,
you know,
moved around a couple of times
in the last two weeks
that that I've been here.
The problem we have with
aid is the same as what it was
two months ago, but significantly worse.
We cannot access
the aid that Israel permits
to enter
Kerem Shalom,
because the route that Israel designates
for us to use to get that aid
is basically run by looters
and criminal gangs,
and Israel
is not securing that route,
nor is it providing us
with alternate routes.
There are alternatives that exist.
We can use
what's known as defense route,
where in theory,
Israel had at one point stated
that it would allow 40
trucks to go through there,
mostly trucks carrying medicine and fuel.
These days, on a lucky day.
And it's not even daily
you're getting about 18 trucks
moving through there, items
that get into the north
through eddies right now. So that's soap.
I've been talking about
those hygiene kits.
They actually do get into
the northern part of Gaza,
but we are not permitted to move them
from the north to the south.
So we can't even scale up
what's being sent through the north.
Why they will not give us
a straight answer.
We do not get straight answers
as to why we cannot properly move aid
from the South.
So, for example,
fresh vegetables,
because we have them down here,
we can buy them
and send them to the north.
Nor are we allowed to move
what gets into the north.
Hygiene kits down for
the population in the south.",20240830
99J4g9bwZAY,IDF spokesperson shares how hostages were found,data/en_CNN\IDF spokesperson shares how hostages were found.jpg,"Israelis are
on the streets
protesting, demanding
a cease fire agreement
after defense officials
said they recovered the bodies of six
Israeli hostages murdered by Hamas,
including Israeli-American Hirsh
Goldberg, Poland, who was 23 years old.
An IDF spokesman said
Hamas brutally killed the six
young adults
in an underground tunnel
near Rafah,
a short time before
Israeli forces arrived.
Three of them would have been released
in the early stages
of a ceasefire agreement,
two Israeli officials told CNN.
An agreement,
President Biden said last night
was on the verge of happening,
while Vice
President Harris released a statement
that reads, in part,
the threat Hamas poses
to the people of Israel
and American citizens in Israel
must be eliminated
and Hamas cannot control Gaza.
The Palestinian people, too,
have suffered under Hamas
rule for nearly two decades.
Here with me
now is IDF spokesman
Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshana.
Thank you so much for being here.
We are so incredibly devastated.
for for Israel,
for all of the families.
it's just hard to even imagine
how much pain everybody is in.
And as a spokesperson for the IDF,
I'd like for you to explain
exactly what happened
when these six bodies
were found.
Thank you.
Thank you for having me.
This is,
a very sad morning in Israel.
Very sad news
coming out of the Gaza Strip. And,
announcing today
after we were able
to talk to the families
and inform them about
finding the bodies of their loved ones.
these were six people
that were taken on October 7th, and,
in our operations in Lofa,
in an underground tunnel.
We found their bodies,
and we thought
we brought them back to Israel.
We examined them,
and we found that they were,
murdered by Hamas recently.
and we were able to inform the families
about it
and share the news
today, the very,
very sad news about them.
And and just to be clear, just because
we're obviously,
trying to get information about exactly
how this this happened were, IDF soldiers
actually looking for these six hostages,
or did they find them
as part of a separate,
mission?
But we
we have been operating above
and underground in that area,
combating terrorists and, searching
in the underground tunnels,
as we've done in recent weeks in Lofa.
And this is an area, I remind you, it's,
less than a mile
from where we found off on the,
the hostage that we were able
to rescue alive a few days ago.
So there was some idea of hostages
being in the area,
but this was not a specific mission
to release hostages.
But,
part of our ordinary,
combat missions against
Hamas above an underground.
So you said that you
believe that they were murdered recently?
can you be more specific
about how recently?
Well, we are still, examining
the information
also operationally in the tunnel
and also examining the bodies.
and this is a process
that might take a while,
and we are personally obligated
to inform the families.
and then we'll have the information
more public.
But according to our initial,
inquiry of the situation,
they were murdered recently
by Hamas terrorists.
They were taken alive from Israel.
They were, living in horrible conditions
for almost a month.
And recently,
they were murdered
by the terror organization.
and we were able to find them, yesterday.
do you have any idea?
And I realize this is early
and obviously,
understandably, very delicate. Delicate.
But do you have any idea, based on,
when and where,
these, individuals
and their bodies were found that
they were murdered.
After hearing or sensing
that the IDF was close by.
Well, I
we will be able to put
that information later,
but I think that that's not the question.
Hamas is a terrorist organization
that came to Israel,
murdered thousands of people
and abducted these
innocent civilian
young people from a party,
and and they murdered them.
And that is
because they're a terrorist organization.
And I think
I would
I would not be the one
looking for reasons from us
for why this this. No.
The terror organization
killing innocent civilians.
One of them, an American civilian.
you all know of
that was was killed brutally. Yeah.
I yeah.
And I just want to make no mistake
about this.
Hamas is a terror organization,
and they are the ones, to blame for this.
I guess the reason I was
asking that question is
whether or not
they were close to being rescued.
That was the basis for my question.
Right.
We're we're operating
and we have a moral obligation
and an operational priority
to bring home their two 101 hostages.
And we are working to bring them home
as we have been able to bring,
a few home one. Right.
just last week.
And we're operating for that
and that that was part of our operation
in that area.
Hoping to find hostages.
And sadly, we found them.
we found bodies,
but we're still operating in
all parts of Gaza,
hoping to find hostages.
There are still many hostages alive.
And that's why
it's important for us
to continue this pressure
and to try and bring them home alive.
Lieutenant Colonel Shoshana,
thank you so much for being here.
And again, we are
just devastated
by the news.
Thank you.
My next guest spoke
forcefully at the Republican convention
in July,
leading the crowd in chants
of bring them home!
Here with me now
are Ronen and Orna
Neutra, the parents of Israeli
American citizen Omar Neutra
held hostage by Hamas.
Thank you so much for being here
this morning.
particularly given the fact that I know
how close you are
to all of the hostage families,
but particularly,
the the Goldberg pollens, the two.
Hirsh and Omar, almost the same age.
Omar is
going to turn 23 next month,
and I can't imagine how difficult
it must be
to watch this news, knowing that
your beautiful son is still in captivity.
It's absolutely right, Dana.
There are no words for us, really,
to comfort all the families.
But specifically, we've become very close
with the Goldberg pollens.
They're like our family.
We've traveled the world with.
We've met together with leaders,
and we're completely devastated
by this news.
You know, we were holding on to this
vision that,
Omer and Hirsch are together,
that they would come out together.
And it's just completely devastating
and a stark reminder to the conditions
that these hostages are being held
in, that this is a terrorist group
that is holding on to them,
and that
things have to work much
faster for them to come out.
Well, on that,
Prime Minister
Netanyahu said he is personally committed
to achieving a deal
to free the remaining hostages.
What is your message to him right now?
You know, Dana, we we
we are just hoping
that he's doing everything he can.
the situation is dire.
It's urgent.
We've seen him
putting all kind of hurdles.
We know the Israeli
people are going out in large numbers
and calling the government
to do
what their job is,
to bring the hostages home.
101 hostage is left.
And, dying there.
And every day is huge
risk for each one of them.
So we we urge him to do what
is tasked to do, in Israel.
but just as well,
we are calling on our leaders here
in United States
to do what they want us to do.
We are calling on President
Biden, on Vice
President Harris
to do everything in their power
to reach a deal
and bring the hostages back.
We were
warning about that kind of situation.
It's such a risky time
for all those hostages.
I mean, Hirsch managed to survive
11 months in captivity.
He lost his arm.
And after all of this,
to be killed a few days,
maybe before a deal.
Yeah, it's it's really devastating.
Really is.
Of course it is.
Or not.
Finally, you say a verse from Psalm 23
every day,
the Psalm of David,
to send your son protection.
Can you share what you say
before we let you go?
You know,
I, I not only say the Psalm, you know,
I pray for my son every single day.
I pray for the hostages,
as did Rachel Goldberg.
You know, we
we feel that we're doing our share.
You know, and and
and praying and advocating
and speaking up for them.
It's time for the leaders
to get this done and get them out.
Enough is enough.
You know,
the families
have been warning about this.
The writing was on the wall,
and this negotiation
has been taking way too long.
They need to come out.
The leaders need to do
whatever needs to be done for them
to come out.
Yeah.
And did I want to remind you,
four American living hostages
still in captivity.
And I want to say their name real quick.
And and Alexander Skyler
Callahan, our son, Omer Neutra and Keith
Segal, who was, 64 year old.
We got to bring them home.
The American administration
need to come up with a plan
to bring their own American home
and the rest of the hostages,
and, of course, the deceased hostages.
And, of course,
bring the three deceased hostages.
Daddy, Judy and Italian.
It's a must.
I hear the desperation
and the pain in your voice.
And,
what we hear, I'm
sure, only pales in comparison
to how you feel in your hearts.
331 is on your stickers, on your
on your shirts.
That is the number of days
your beautiful son has been, in captivity
with others.
Thank you so much for on this
very difficult day coming on
and continuing to press
the way you have been so heroically
for so many months. I appreciate it.",20240901
VAd-QXouJUo,Hear the strong message Rep. Schiff has for Hamas after six hostages killed,data/en_CNN\Hear the strong message Rep. Schiff has for Hamas after six hostages killed.jpg,"While it's Labor Day
weekend, the traditional kickoff
to the home stretch
of the presidential campaign.
Here with me
now is the Democratic Senate
candidate from California, Congressman
Adam Schiff.
I want to talk to you
about the campaign in one minute.
But first,
you are in Oakland, California right now.
That is where the Goldberg poll
and family is originally from.
And I want to get your reaction
to the murder
of Israeli American hostage Hirsh
Goldberg.
Poland and five others.
Well,
when I heard the news last night,
I felt sick.
I am just absolutely heartbroken.
for Hirsch's family,
for the families of these other hostages
that were
butchered by these Hamas terrorists.
And,
it just,
is hard to wrap your head around.
I think we all came to know,
Hirsch, through his family, and,
and it's just it's just devastating.
and these,
sons of bitches who did this,
ought to be hunted down
and brought to justice,
no matter how long that takes.
I hope and pray.
I think, as we all do, that
there's a negotiated end to this war.
And soon, and that not another,
innocent person loses their life.
and I just can't imagine how
his family must feel right now.
I mean, you just heard the new tras,
whose son,
Omar, is also in captivity called
not just on Prime Minister Netanyahu,
but President Biden
multiple times to do more to get,
these hostages,
particularly Americans, home.
I mean, I asked her about a prayer
that she says every day,
and she she's clearly done with prayers.
She's frustrated, understandably.
I'm hearing anecdotally
for people from people saying,
this is the United States of America
and the fact that
the American
president and
American administration
can't get
American citizens held
in these conditions
back is very frustrating.
And a little bit,
they're flabbergasted by it.
How can the Biden administration
answer those frustrations right now?
Well, first of all,
I think the parents of the hostages
are doing exactly
what they should be doing,
exactly what I would be doing,
in their shoes.
as difficult
as it is
to imagine the horror of
standing where they're standing,
and that is,
pleading,
advocating, doing everything
possible to get Israeli government
to agree to,
an end to the war
that that releases
their family members
and also, call upon the president
and vice president
to do everything they can.
And I think they are.
I think President Biden
and Vice President Harris
are turning over every stone
in their efforts
to secure the release of the hostages
and protect the lives of the hostages
and achieve a ceasefire.
I don't think they go a waking moment
without focusing on this, where,
you know, we're not putting boots
on the ground,
in these tunnels under Gaza.
So it is a very difficult, situation
in terms of our own ability
to rescue these hostages.
But I
really, sincerely believe
the administration
is doing everything possible.
and, and is committed,
not only to an end to the war
in which the threat from Hamas
is eliminated,
in which we
we are on a path at some point
and I pray soon to a regional,
and two state solution
that,
achieves a lasting peace in the region.
But I really believe they're
doing all they possibly can.
Congressman, I want to turn
back, domestically
to the presidential race,
which is 65 days away.
Election day is,
I want you to listen to how Vice
President
Harris answered my question
this week
about a key issue in the campaign.
In 2019, you said, quote,
there is no question I'm
in favor of banning fracking.
Fracking, as you know,
is a pretty big issue,
particularly in
your must win state of Pennsylvania.
Do you still want to ban fracking?
No, and I made
that clear on the debate stage in 2020
that I would not ban fracking
as vice president.
I did not ban fracking as president.
I will not ban fracking.
You're a co-sponsor of a House bill
right now that would ban fracking.
Are you disappointed
that she supports it now?
well, look, you know, I
favor banning fracking.
And I strongly believe that,
the the pathway to, attacking
climate change is to,
wean ourselves off of fossil fuels.
but, look, I'm
not the vice president United States.
And I do think that
when you are
representing the whole country,
you have a different perspective.
as the vice president pointed out,
her values, though,
have remained consistent.
And that is she is a champion of,
moving ourselves
in the renewable energy direction.
her role in passing the Inflation
Reduction Act,
the most aggressive attack
on climate change in our history,
I think, speaks for itself.
But, but, look, let's, let's compare,
a situation
where,
someone changed their position
four years ago
to Donald Trump,
who's changed his position
four times on abortion
in the last 48 hours.
that, to me,
is, you know, a
much more significant question,
particularly as
when you're talking about abortion,
and you're talking about a, right.
And freedom of the American people
to be so pandering,
wishy washy, flip flopping,
you know, so,
disrespect for the rights and freedoms
of millions of American women,
and do all that in a single day.
that's the contrast here.
and what's more, Dana,
that's a values issue.
That's a values issue.
when on something
like the right to an abortion,
you flip flop, every 15 minutes,
that shows essentially he has no values.
Congressman, special counsel Jack Smith
filed a new indictment
against Donald Trump this week
for election interference,
even after the Supreme Court
ruling on immunity.
And it comes as two
pro-Trump organizations
are slated to hold a January 6th
awards gala at Trump National Golf
Club in Bedminster
to pay tribute to all six defendants.
Now, Trump has been invited to speak.
Organizers say he hasn't ruled it out.
What's your response
to the fact that he's,
whether he goes or not,
that he's allowing his property
to be used for this event?
Well, first of all,
the Justice Department
is exactly right
to be refiling these charges,
after that,
just absurdly
dangerous Supreme Court decision,
attempted to give immunity
to a president to commit crimes
while they were in office.
so he's right to refile these charges.
but for, the president to allow,
you know, this event
to go forward,
celebrating these people who beat
who gas to bear sprayed, who.
we're responsible
for the deaths of police officers
who essentially try to interfere
with the,
peaceful transfer of power
the first time in our history,
shows you that for Donald Trump,
he could,
you know,
give a damn about the country,
about the Constitution,
about the oath of office.
It's only about him.
And to glorify these people.
also is a green light
to further violence.
Should he lose the upcoming election?
so just another dangerous disrespect.
Full, acquiescence
in lawlessness by Donald Trump
and his enablers.
Congressman Adam Schiff,
candidate for Senate
in the great state of California.
Thank you so much for
being here this morning.
Thanks, Dana.",20240902
rLMDQSzUzRM,Cousin of hostage killed by Hamas: Netanyahu's decisions made it impossible for hostages to return,data/en_CNN\Cousin of hostage killed by Hamas Netanyahu's decisions made it impossible for hostages to return.jpg,"Now, the cousin of
Carmel Gat one of the hostages
found dead in Gaza on Saturday.
Penned an emotional tribute
to her on Sunday.
Gil Dickman posted on IG
saying sorry, I'm
sorry we didn't stop
when it was still possible.
Sorry we let them kill you.
He also said
I wish you saw how your friends
fought to bring you back alive.
You also wrote that
I wish that in your memory,
thousands would come out
to demonstrate tonight,
just as I would have done
as you would have done.
40 year old Gat
was taken hostage
by Hamas on October 7th
while staying at her parents home.
And Gil Dickman
joins me now live from Tel Aviv.
Thank you so much for your time.
And can I first begin by saying
how sorry I am, Gil, for your loss
and sorry too, for the suffering
that your family
has been through for the past
11 months, only for it to end this way.
Yeah.
Thank you very, very much.
we can't really believe
that this is how it ends.
We didn't want it to end like this one.
And another ending for this
horrible story.
You know,
if Carmel wasn't
the only hostage from the family.
Her mother was murdered on October
7th by the terrorists
and her sister in law.
Yeah.
Then Ramon was also taken hostage,
and she was returned.
She was brought back home
on the 54th day of the war,
thanks to a ceasefire
that was signed between Israel and Hamas.
And we really hope that
a very similar ceasefire
would be signed between the two sides.
But we found out that it was very,
very hard
to bring the two sides to sign the deal.
Hamas is a terror organization.
I have no expectations from this horrible
that this horrible figure
you have seen while to sign the deal
that will actually
bring my my cousin home.
But we know that
Hamas has agreed to a deal at some point,
and Israel was the one
putting on more and more terms
and actually postponing the deal.
And right now,
we know that the decisions
that our Prime Minister Netanyahu,
is made
made it impossible for Carmel
and other hostages to return
and put their lives in grave danger.
And that's what killed them.
Hamas has said that the hostages
would be alive
if it weren't for the actions
of the Israeli government.
Who do you blame Gil
for the deaths of Carmel?
This blame game is a game to me.
And when I'm here for life and death,
no game.
It's both sides are to blame.
It's first of all,
that terror organization who took her
and all of the hostages.
They shouldn't have taken her.
She is an innocent and decent civilian,
and she wasn't supposed to be taken
in the first place.
A 40 year old woman
not related in any way
to not to the army
and not to anything else.
She was supposed to be at home
with her family,
and she was taken just like
kids and and other innocent
people were taken
and I blame, of course they blame Hamas.
And I also blame my government because
these are these are the
people that
should be in charge of the security
and the peace of,
of of people in Israel.
These are the people
that were supposed
to be responsible
for the life of people here,
and they were responsible
for the lives of all the hostages.
And they decided cold bloodedly
they voted just a few days ago
that the Philadelphia, the border between
Gaza and Egypt
is more important
than the lives of the hostages.
And that means that our government
decided that they're willing to sacrifice
the lives of the hostages.
They all voted.
The cabinet voted for it.
And we were shocked.
And we said, me
and my sister and all my family
and all the families
of all the hostages, we said,
this is crossing the red line.
And that would mean
the death of hostages.
And saying this.
I did not know how true it will be
and how specific and personal
it is going to become.
And and it was mainly
because been anyone else,
but it was Kamel,
and the lives of all the other hostages
are still in danger.
So we must act now.
The Israeli government
and the Israeli people,
these are the people chose to act.
They came out to the streets last night,
and they're out in the streets right now.
And it's very moving.
I'm sorry that we had to go
through this
horrible, horrible situation
in order for them to get out,
but they did.
And I really hope that the government,
our government,
will make the right decision
and push for a deal
that'll bring the hostages home.
It's been too long.
And and that was
what you were calling for
in your tribute to Kamal Gil.
You what?
You are calling on people to come out
and demonstrate in her memory.
And they have done that.
We've seen tens of thousands
and people take to the streets.
We're reporting on nationwide
protests, nationwide strike today.
Do you feel that this is a turning
point we're witnessing here?
I really hope that this is
the turning point, or a breaking point
or some kind of a change in reality,
which may be maybe
help the government
make the right decision.
But if
if it's just a one time thing, it's
it was supposed to be the largest protest
or demonstration
in the history of Israel.
This is very moving,
and I know that Kamal can see this,
but I know that's exactly what
you would have wanted
for people to come out.
And so
to demand the release
of the other hostages,
it's too late for her,
but it's not too late for them.
And I hope that they're not
the government
is not just going to look away
and to choose death over life,
because this is not what we believe
here in Israel,
and that's not what we believe
this war is about.
You know, you're giving a lot of airtime
to this war
because of things that are going on
on both sides of the border.
People think it's Israel versus Palestine
or Jews versus Muslims.
This is and has always been a fight
between people who believe in life
and who choose life,
and who choose a ceasefire.
They'll bring the hostages home
over the people who believe in death
and choose death.
And they know that the organization
that kidnaped Kamal
and that murdered her mother chose death.
They believe that death is sacred.
But I can't believe,
I still can't believe that
my government chose death.
And I urge you, Benjamin Netanyahu,
choose life.
Please sign the deal, seal the deal,
go to ceasefire
and save the hostages that
you can still save
you.
I understand that
you, your family,
had a chance to speak to the president
over the weekend,
that he reached out to
you and wanted to to talk,
but you refused.
Why did you do that?
And what is
what do you make of Benjamin
Netanyahu's actions in all of this?
Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu
has made it public
that he's going to approach the families
in order to speak to them.
Then he decided that he gave us
the message that he wants to speak to us.
We don't want to be a part of this media
circus of the prime Minister Netanyahu,
who is now using the murder of the
of the hostages in order to justify
staying there
and not getting out
and going to to a cease fire
and signing a deal,
which is unbelievable to me.
He's trying to use this to say,
if you murdered the hostages,
you don't want to deal.
And I didn't want to take part in this.
We didn't want to take part in this.
The family comments.
Family believe
that the Prime Minister of Israel is
responsible for her death.
He is her killer.
That's the fact.
He didn't pull the trigger,
but he left her there
knowing that that means she sees
life, danger, death, danger,
and knowing these risks.
This is actually it's killing.
And we we don't want to talk to him.
And we I don't feel like
he he could be convinced
by a conversation. Heart to heart.
I spoke to him.
I saw him
and how he reacted to two hostages
who came back from captivity
and spoke about what
they went through there.
It doesn't look like it moved him.
I don't feel like
his heart is open
to this kind of conversation.
I think we only understand
the language of politics.
That's maybe something that happens to
you after
so many, so many years in your job.
Everything becomes politics.
Even the life
and death of people becomes pure,
pure math
of whether it would bring me more support
or less support
would let him stay in power
or lose power.
And if that's what it is,
then that's the language
that we should speak to him.
We must go out to the streets
and protest in our democratic way.
And this is not an anti-Israeli thing
to do.
The exact opposite.
This is the most Israeli thing to do.
We came out with Israeli flags
and with hostages, yellow flags
to tell him the Democratic thing to do.
If you want to stay in power,
if you want to have any legitimacy
to act in our name, save their lives
and sign the deal now.",20240902

and Vice President Kamala Harris
will hold a critical meeting
with the U.S.

in hopes of crafting a cease fire

Hamas took captive during the October
7th terror
attack on Israel,
97 hostages are still being held,
including seven Americans.
Of those Americans, four
are believed to still be alive.
This weekend's discovery
of six hostages killed in a Hamas
tunnel underscores the sense of urgency
Israel calls it, quote,
cold blooded murder.
Minutes ago,
a funeral began
for the young man on your far
left Israeli American. Hirsh Goldberg.
Poland, Israel's president,
apologized to the family in his eulogy.
As a human being, as a father,
and as the president
of the state of Israel,
I want to say how sorry I am,
how sorry I am, that we
didn't protect others on that dark today.
I'm sorry I am
that we failed to bring him home
in his life and in his death
touched all of humanity deeply.
He has changed the world
and woven his essence of light
and love
into the story of the Jewish people
and into our human story forever.
This morning I saw a clip of a vigil.
It took place in New York last night,
appropriate that the crowd was singing
unevenly time, and some of them,
you and I will change the world
for 23 years of life
that we had with you were blessing.
We now will work to make your legacy
a similar blessing.
You are a really great guy.
I love you.
For the families of the hostages,
it has been nearly 11 months of torment
and agonizing disappointment.
I want to bring in the parents of 20 year
old Eden Alexander.
He is an American member
of the Israeli Defense Forces,
and has been held hostage
since the
Hamas terror attack on October
7th and Yale.
Alexander joins joined us
now from New York.
how is the family holding up?
yeah. I'll, I'll go to you first.
And, your response to,
what's taking place in Israel right now.
Hi. Good morning. Jim.
what happened in Israel
now that everybody at the streets,
there was a strike today?
Everyone was just screaming
and being with the family.
And just to make sure that
they're going to seal
the deal,
they're going to bring our loved ones
home.
Safety like, right.
They're doing whatever they can
just to make a noise.
It's not a political issue,
it's humanitarian issue.
And to see all the crowds
and on the streets,
we are not alone.
You know,
we are fighting this fight for 332 days.
It's almost 11 months
that our son is not with us,
he's not with the family,
and we are going to do everything
in our power
to make it happen
and to bring him home
and to bring the other hostages home.
well,
I just want to say
that you are definitely not alone.
We're all thinking about you.
We're all praying for other safe return.
I do want to play a little bit
of what President Biden,
said, just a few moments ago
about all of us. Let's listen,
Mr.
President, if you think
it's time for prayer,
Prime Minister Netanyahu,
to do more on this issue,
do you think he's doing enough?
No.
So you hear the president there saying
he doesn't think
the Prime minister is doing enough.
What is your thought on that?
I think he's absolutely right.
from the get go, the, US government,
we in touch with the U.S. government.
As you know,
we met Jake Sullivan yesterday
for 15 times,
and we don't see the same,
sense of urgency and the same dedication
from the Israelis
as we see from the Americans.
And, this is devastating.
And it's, actually, very surprising.
Do you think,
what more could be done?
First of all,
on Netanyahu's government,
they have to stop to move
the goalpost of the, negotiation.
They have to stop
to undermine the negotiating team itself,
and they have to seal the deal.
Enough. It's enough.
Exactly.
They need to bring the hostages back
home. That's it.
It's 11 months.
We don't have time
like we saw on Saturday. What happened?
They murder them over there,
so they need to understand.
That's why we urge them
since the beginning, that it's.
They don't have time.
They leave it. Hell.
And when you say that Netanyahu
keeps moving the goalposts,
what do you mean by that?
I mean that I mean by that,
to ramp up additional demand
and, the, Philadelphia,
crossing
as, sticking point of the negotiations.
This is unacceptable.
They put a proposal back in,
May and of May
just stick to this proposal.
They need to move on
and to show us
that they want the hostages back.
Now, I like
I don't know,
I don't know if it's going to happened.
Right.
And I do want to share some of the essay
that you both wrote
for the New York Times.
We can show this to our viewers.
It's not just the fear of losing our son
that now keeps us up at night.
It's the fact that his murder
is becoming the more probable outcome.
And we have no faith in Mr.
Netanyahu's will to change that.
as a parent, reading
that just breaks my heart.
how do you find the hope that Eden
is still alive?
First we have,
some,
eyewitnesses
that were released back in November
that he's that he alive?
so,
we just sticking to this
hope that he's a strong.
He's a strong kid.
He was a professional swimmer
in high school.
Is like,
we call people flight.
And he's a good, like, is amazingly done.
And I'm hoping that is strong.
And he knows that
we are fighting for him.
And he will come back home.
And we're looking at some pictures
of it on now.
And he just looks like a remarkable
young man.
tell us a little bit more about him.
he done,
I don't know, he's
got this beautiful smile.
He love, like to be with friends.
He love to party, love to be at,
at the beach.
He loved to go to restaurants like this.
Is he done?
You know,
when we've been here in New York,
we went to art shows like,
whatever we can to to live life
like this.
Is he done for us?
And I'm hoping it's going to happen soon.
Like we can reunite the whole family
and we will continue.
And what has it been like,
being a part of this, community now,
I suppose, of other families
who are in the same situation.
How do you support one another,
lean on one another,
to get, try to get through this?
Yeah.
We are all big family.
And,
with the lost of heroes on Saturday,
we are devastating.
We were crying.
We are broken. We are.
You know, we.
You know, this is really tough.
This is really, really tough.
But at the end of the day,
you have to have hope in all of this.
Absolutely.
And,
the hope this is what, holding us up.
Hope is mandatory.
Life is mandatory.
Like, Rachel said and,
but said we don't have a choice.
We are going to continue fighting
till they all come back.
And what
what would be your message
to Prime Minister Netanyahu?
you've been very critical of him.
what would be your message
if you could say something
if he were watching,
if his team was watching,
what would you say?
He promised us something
on the white House
in front of Biden and Sullivan last July.
You want to tell him
that he will, proceed the deal?
But our message.
Do not delay it.
Just do not delay the deal.
Military.
More military pressure
brings more of that. Hostages.
Let's execute
the deal and cross the finish line.
All right, y'all, and Audie Alexander,
parents of Iran.
thank you so much for speaking with us.
As I said earlier,
we're all thinking about
you and your family
and all of the families,
and praying for the safe
return of those hostages.
Thank you so much.
We really appreciate it.
Thank you for having us.
Thank you. All right.",20240902

Nations led
polio vaccination
campaign kicked off on Sunday,
giving shots to around 87,000 children.
Now, the UN's agency
for Palestinian refugees
says the
second phase of the campaign
will be focused
on the south of the strip.
All the
all of the initial shots
are scheduled
to be administered by September the 12th.
I remember the promises to immunize
640,000 kids in the enclave.
Let's give us an update
on what is an enormously difficult
logistical challenges.
Rick Peppercorn,
the World Health Organization
representative for the West Bank
and Gaza,
not just organizing
but actually involved
in the administering of these vaccines.
It's good to have you, Rick.
Thank you for joining us.
Firstly,
this this vaccination drive
can only happen
if these temporary ceasefires hold.
Correct.
So tell us how that going at present.
Well, definitely.
And indeed.
And the daunting task for all of us.
And greetings from all of us in Gaza,
the Arabella,
which is also
the polio emergency operation center.
So the task is to indeed reach 90%,
90% vaccination coverage of 640,000
children
every year, rounds for two rounds.
And we welcome this commitment
issue right
set from area
specific humanitarian forces.
And that's why we
we defined it in Gaza in three zones.
So in a in a central zones,
in central zone
and in southern zone
and in northern zone,
each zone
we will vaccinate for three days,
most likely another day, three plus one.
And then we shift to the other zone.
And then four weeks later we do the same.
So we,
we we started yesterday
with the seventh zone and
and the southern zone.
The target
population is one of the 56,583.
Then we moved to the south
target population
three inches 40,000 case
and naught one on the 50.
So yesterday was a good day.
It was actually a successful day.
I was not completely surprised
because the Gaza population
deaths and high
except of for vaccination.
But I think they came out
in their droves.
Families, fathers, modest,
having children.
I visited 6 or 7 of those centers
and happy children
showing their left little finger
that they were
vaccinated and be vaccinated.
More than 86,000 almost 87,000
children in in one day.
Now, this is a
this is a remarkable
challenge and a remarkable feat
that you've
been able
to get these jabs into the arms
of all this vaccine, into the,
into so many kids at this point.
Tell me,
where were these kids coming from?
Who are they coming with?
And what kind of state within
welcoming of Reverend Vitor fathers
which are models, etc..
So today, for example, is the second day
and I went with a few mobile teams
and we went
and maybe you know that from the
from the television
era, from TV,
this, this endless colorful roads,
which is endless, makeshift camps
all over.
We went all over in those camps
with one of these, mobile teams.
And everywhere,
you know,
where we met mothers and fathers
with groups of children.
I mean, in those camps,
almost every child was vaccinated.
So we reached a high target.
And I think maybe we even,
underestimated the target
in the central zone,
because with the recent
evacuation orders,
the Gaza
population is constantly in flux.
but I say there is.
And real appetite for this vaccination.
People realize why and how.
And again,
we should not forget that
Gaza always has a very high coverage
in routine
immunization before this crisis.
coverage over 90, 95%.
You
you are absolutely
relying on these temporary
ceasefires, holding in order to get,
as many of these vaccines
into kids as you can.
What's your message
to Israel and Hamas as we speak?
And what are the consequences for Gaza
and Israel
and indeed surrounding countries
if this polio outbreak
is not brought under control?
Well, I think it's it's
the message is, of course, that,
we have a plan
and all this it's incredibly complex.
I mean, I cannot even describe
to 513 teams operational, etc..
And every day from six till two
and all the other teams
that manages their war
to midnight, actually analyzes
monitoring, independent monitoring.
I can't even describe how complex it is.
I don't the things in Afghanistan
this is way more complex.
So the request is very clear.
All the pieces of this puzzle
have to fit together.
And the most important,
this is, of course, this
area specific humanitarian pause us,
which the parties have to stick to
because otherwise,
if it would have happened,
we will not never reach this goal.
did, this target, the children,
their parents,
everybody will lose their confidence
with the risk
that we do not stop the transmission
within Gaza,
and indeed, that the risk of polio spread
out of Gaza and that we, the World Health
Organization, all member states,
we are working to eradicate
polio of world.
We have only two countries
where you have the wild polio virus
vanished in Pakistan.
You see this
vaccine derived outbreaks always in areas
of strife and war,
children under vaccinators.
So we have to tackle this, problem.
Right on. I want to say one more point.
There is a bit of a fight,
a positive fight
about this polio campaign.
We are only in day two.
We have ten more days to go
and then four weeks later
and the others,
the rest of the health situation
is deeply concerning.
Only yesterday I had another W.H.O.
team going to the north,
bringing few medical supplies,
and taking patients out to get of it.
Yes, from Indonesian hospital.
Come at Walnut Safra.
This was the surge
mission, only approved
out of eight missions over the last week.
And they came back
at 1:00 in the morning.
Highly dangerous, highly risky
and completely unnecessary.
This has to improve.
And my other request,
of course, is everyone.
This would work much better
if if there would be a ceasefire
and we can make other arrangements.
I mean, this is not an ideal campaign.
In ideal situation,
you want to go house to house.
There's very few houses left.
So we made myself
understand for war, people.
Understood.
Well, you've
delineated
very erudite Lee,
just the sort of challenges
that your organization
and others supporting you.
are, facing.
but the numbers at present, as you say,
bode well, which is,
you know, a
small ray of light in
what has been such a dark,
dull, dark ten months.
Thank you very much
indeed for your own work
and for joining us today.",20240902

weekend that IDF forces
recovered the bodies of six hostages,
including 23 year old
Israeli American Hirsh Goldberg.
Pulling it all
been murdered in a tunnel in Gaza.
His story became one of the most
well known, in part
because of the tireless efforts
of his two parents,
Rachel Goldberg and John Poland,
to advocate for their son, Hirsh,
and all the other hostages.
We warn you,
some of the video
you're about to see is graphic.
Five days after the October 7th massacre
at the Nova music
Festival site,
an Israeli
soldier showed me a disturbing video
of a young Israeli man
with his left hand blown off,
being kidnaped,
loaded into a pickup truck.
I didn't know who he was,
but four days later, by coincidence,
I interviewed John Poland
and Rachel Goldberg
for the first time on CNN.
When I turned on my phone,
which I don't normally
use on the Jewish Sabbath,
that's when I saw
two texts
pop up at eight, ten,
eight, 11 in the morning.
The first one said, I love you.
And the second one said, I'm sorry.
And immediately I knew something
horrible must have been happening
or was about to happen.
I didn't know they were
the parents of the young man
I'd seen in that video,
until John said
this during our interview.
And we know from three
eyewitness accounts of survivors
that basically,
there were at least 11 grenades
thrown into the bomb shelter.
Our son, by all accounts,
officer of the witnesses,
had his left arm blown off
at some point during the attack.
That's when I realized
I'd seen their son.
And they had no idea
the video of him
being taken hostage existed.
I waited till
the interview was over and called them
and then sent them the video I had.
I met with them a week later.
First of all, it's it's
a crazy sequence of events
that we talked to you
through a computer screen
and then get a phone
call from you saying,
I have a video of your son.
I didn't want to say on live television,
which is so appreciated.
Of course,
the way everything has unfolded,
the gentleness that you used.
Because at the end of the day,
you're a journalist and journalists
want a story.
And that could have been
dealt with in many other ways
that were not kind and gentle.
Seeing that video in general
gave us a dose of optimism.
How were you able to
get through each day?
I personally feel like
we have to keep running
to the end of the earth to save him,
and we have to try to
go believing that somehow
he got treatment and he's there.
They showed me Hirsch's room,
which Rachel would visit
to feel close to him.
We have reports that face himself,
and I went out Friday night
and it was like screaming to him
and hoping him just because Friday night,
you know,
we bless our children
traditionally in Jewish homes.
You bless your children on Friday night.
So I was screaming.
It's a traditional blessing for us.
The Bible, what is the blessing today?
It says, May God bless you and keep you.
May God
may God's face shine upon
you and be gracious to you.
May God's countenance countenance be lift
up to lifted up towards you,
and give you peace.
In the weeks after Rachel
and John worked tirelessly
to raise awareness about Hirsch
and the other hostages, Richard would.
You're wearing,
a tag that says 26.
Don't tell people what that is.
Well, this morning I realized,
you know what?
It's day 26,
and I
don't know if anyone is really counting.
I don't know how many people really care
every single day
until these people come home.
I'm going to be where and what day it is.
So this is my new.
Fashion statement.
The weeks turned into months.
This was them in April.
We're living on another planet,
so I don't know that we comprehend time
the way that you do.
Or normal people.
We feel that everybody has failed
our leaders.
All of them have failed to make
this suffering on all sides.
Stop.
we feel that we as parents have failed
because as a parent, your job is to
keep your children safe.
It feels good.
But then suddenly,
a few weeks later,
Hamas released
this hostage video of Hirsch.
It was the first proof his parents had.
He was alive.
We were sobbing, tears and emotional,
overwhelmed feelings were just
abounding.
we weren't even listening
to what he was saying.
Just hearing his voice
and seeing him moving
and that he was alive.
Then in late June,
another video
was released by the hostages
and missing families, for
this one taken on October 7th.
Moments after the first video
I'd sent them ended.
You had so much concern about,
you know,
whether Hirsch had made it out
just from his injury alone.
you see a tourniquet
being put on at later on in the video?
That.
I mean,
do you think
that probably saved his life?
Well, I'm happy that
for whatever reasons, that
he was obviously treated because,
as we all know,
on day 201,
we had a video released that shows Hirsch
with a stump
where that jagged bone had been.
But we know from day 201,
thank God that he is alive.
129 days later,
that hope became heartbreak.
On day 330, Hirsch Goldberg Poland's
body was found with five other hostages.
Alexander Loeb in off
Carmel, got Almog Suruchi,
Adin Yerushalmi, and Ori Danilo.
Israel says they were executed
in a tunnel in Gaza,
shot to death at close range.
According to the Israeli
prime Minister's office,
there believed to be about 101 hostages
still remaining in Gaza,
35 are believed to be dead.
Short time ago,
I spoke with Orna and Ronen Neutra,
whose son Omer is another
Israeli American still
being held captive.
Orna Ronen, thank you for
talking with me today.
I know you consider John
Poland and Rachel
Goldberg, Poland family.
How are you dealing with what's happened?
We are completely devastated, Anderson.
This shouldn't have happened.
Hirsch was supposed to come out
in the first phase of a deal
that's been on the table for a long time
now, and it's just completely outrageous
and devastating
that this is what happened.
Hirsch managed
to survive in the 11 most terrible months
with the monsters
of, of of Hamas in Gaza,
and yet was murdered
and executed a couple of days ago
in a most brutal way.
It just heartbreaking.
Rachel, yesterday, at the funeral said,
that that she hopes
that that Hirsch's death will be
what she called a turning point
in this horrible situation.
And, and John said maybe, just maybe,
your death, meaning
Hirsch's death is the stone,
the fuel that will bring home
the remaining 101 hostages.
Do you think that's possible?
Do you feel like
something may be different
now for for Omer and the others?
You know, it's it's not a clear path.
we're seeing still many challenges,
in the region.
We're seeing a prime minister,
that is not willing to make
the compromises
needed to reach a deal
to bring our son
and the other hostages back.
We sure see, the Israeli
public pouring in big numbers
into the streets
and telling the Israeli government that
this event of the six hostages
that were murdered
few days back,
it just unacceptable
that this will continue.
And we just hoping that this
outpour outrage that,
we see in Israel is going to affect
the government
and Bibi Netanyahu himself to,
to reach that so desired deal
and get the hostages
back, as we know, this is urgent.
And among them are 22 year old son,
who, by the way, turns 23 on October 14th
and this will be his second birthday,
being held hostage.
A very true, true.
It's hard to think about that.
No, we can't think that far.
And we really hope that that, a deal,
that the US government is working
so hard
with the partners in the region
will be caught between Israel and Hamas
and the two leaders,
Hamas leader and Israeli, government
must reach that deal,
or else we
won't see our deal once coming back.
Do you have faith on unthinkable
in in the prime minister, in Netanyahu,
he asked for forgiveness
that the six murdered hostages
weren't brought back alive.
He also said
Hamas will pay a heavy price for this.
Do you think he has the hostages
front and center in his priorities?
Well, we don't, unfortunately not.
we met him in the white House
with President Biden.
We looked him in the eyes
and unfortunately,
our feeling
is that he has his own political future
ahead of him
rather than the safety of our son.
It's not just our son.
I don't believe that he has the interest
of the Israeli people,
as his top priority.
anyone you know that's looking at
this can see that
Israelis need the hostages
to come home
for them to be able to recover from this,
to move forward.
But the first step
would be to bring the hostages back to
to make the families
whole, to,
bring back some sense of security. Right.
This was a breach
between the Israeli
government and its people,",20240904

people in Gaza,
they moved from the north to the south.
You're going to have thousands,
20,000 killed.
You're going to have a catastrophe,
a humanitarian catastrophe.
There have no place to go,
no food to eat.
Now, report honestly,
because here's what happened.
They all left.
They went to the humanitarian zone,
which was two miles away. Let's.
On the beach.
They have tents.
We supplied tents for 150,000 people.
The agency supplied the rest,
and some of them
carried over into that place.
We supplied water lines,
sewage lines, food.
There's more to be done.
Medical.
So now we know how many people
were killed.
How many terrorists?
Because we counted them.
And we just passed 2000 terrorists.
Body count of terrorists.
The people left.
How many civilians died?
I asked the commander,
the commander of the, of the division
that did the Rafah operation
and the Philadelphia border.
He said,
Prime Minister,
there are hardly any civilian deaths
because everybody left.
They heeded our warnings.
But he said
there were probably two dozen,
and most of them occurred two dozen.
And most of them occurred
when one of our bombs hit,
Hamas ammunition depot
that was planted inside
a residential area.
40 people died.
About 20 were terrorists,
but 20 were civilians.
And he said, that's most of the deaths.
That's the lowest ratio
of noncombatants to combatants
in the history of urban warfare.
That's it.
Now, report honestly,
because you accused us of something
that is outrageous
and in fact, the accusations against us
outrageously false humanitarian aid,
a million
trucks of aid, a million tons of aid,
700,000 tons of food,
a deliberate starvation policy.
You can say anything
that doesn't make it true.
You repeat a lie
over and over and over again.
It assumes the cachet
of self-evident truth. But it's false.
Israel is doing
and the Israeli army is doing
something that no other army
has done in history.
And we'll continue to do that.
I'm not going to change my policies,
humanitarian policies,
vaccination policies,
combat policies to minimize
civilian casualties.",20240904

hrqXnnPe4FQ,'They told us this area was safe': Designated Gaza safe zone targeted by Israeli airstrike,data/en_CNN\'They told us this area was safe' Designated Gaza safe zone targeted by Israeli airstrike.jpg,"Rescuers have been digging
through sand and debris,
found a camp for displaced Palestinians
after an overnight strike
by Israeli forces left
scores of people
dead, wounded or missing.
The Israeli military says it
struck Hamas terrorists
operating command
center embedded
in the humanitarian safe
zone in Khan Yunis.
Hamas denies its fighters were present.
Civil Gaza civil defense officials say
entire families
disappeared into the sand.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees
says civilians in the alma
area had no way to escape.
If you try and picture
the area,
these are the most crowded surroundings
you could imagine.
There's barely room to walk
in between tents
that are crowded on the beaches.
It was late at night.
Colleagues heard what they believe
was with the strikes
and and and just absolutely devastating.
No way
whatsoever that
the civilians in these areas
were able to protect themselves.
While Israeli forces
have previously here is almost
in their pursuit of Hamas commanders,
a strike in
mid-July killed at least 90 Palestinians.
Or for more.
CNN's Matthew Chance,
monitoring this from
Tel Aviv in Israel and
I know that the detail still coming in.
But what more do we know about this
strike in an area?
As I say, previously struck
by the IDF in pursuit,
they say, of Hamas
terrorists back in July.
Well, Becky, I mean, first thing,
first thing you can notice,
one of the first things you notice as we
look at the video
and the images that are coming
out of the Amira Sea
region
in the Gaza Strip
is that this was a massive attack.
I mean, the
the weaponry that was involved
is extremely powerful.
Clearly,
some of the craters
that have been left
by the strikes are seven meters deep.
And so an extraordinary amount of damage
has been caused
in what would have been a densely
populated sort of area
humanitarian zone in the Gaza Strip.
And of course,
civilians and ordinary people are again
paying that very high price.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah,
there's rescue workers
scrambled for survivors.
Eyewitnesses
say the Israeli strikes targeted
what was meant to be
a safe zone in the southern Gaza Strip,
ripping through tents
and makeshift shelters,
leaving deep craters.
Dozens of killed and injured
people, Judy.
And they told us this area was safe,
says this man.
I swear
the people here were just normal,
he says, not fighters.
And by daylight
you can see the extent
of the destruction.
Israel's
military says
it conducted
a precise strike on Hamas terrorists,
operating a command and control center
inside this humanitarian zone,
and IDF statement says
prior to the strike, numerous steps
were taken to mitigate
the risk of harming civilians.
But this was a heavily populated area
and civilians were caught up
in the powerful blasts.
So many.
This man says his two daughters
were completely buried under the sand.
Only one survived, he says, and he says
he found the body parts of his neighbors
strewn around.
This 12 year old girl is nursing
a broken shoulder,
suffered when her tent collapsed,
she says,
trapping her and her mother inside.
Good thing
I was scared
because the strikes were so close,
she says.
A long walk for
his rail accuses Hamas of using civilians
as human
shields, and insists
the Israeli military
takes extensive measures
to enable civilians in Gaza
to avoid combat zones.
But there's little real security
in this brutal war.
Well, Becky,
as you mentioned,
this exact humanitarian zone,
this camp had been struck
before back in July
with Palestinian health officials
saying that 90 people were killed back
then, Israeli military
saying they were targeting
Hamas militants.
But the health ministry in Gaza,
which is controlled by Hamas, of course,
saying that
these half of that figure
were women and children.
So again, underlining
just what a poor state of security exists
inside the Gaza Strip.
Matthew,
meantime, the IDF has said
an investigation
has been launched into the death last
week of an American
killed in the West Bank.
Now, the US secretary of state
has just weighed in on that.
So I want you and our viewers
just to have a listen to what
Anthony Blinken has just said.
No one,
no one
should be shot
and killed for attending a protest.
No one
should have to put their life at risk
just for freely expressing their views.
in our judgment, Israeli security forces
need to make some fundamental changes
in the way that
they operate in the West Bank,
including changes
to their rules of engagement.
Well, I assume we haven't yet
had an IDF statement
in response to Anthony Blinken.
His words,
which were in the past couple of hours.
But what are the IDF
saying at this point?
They've said that they've launched
the investigation.
Do we have results of that?
the investigation has been launched,
certainly.
to try and get to the bottom of it.
There's been a sort of
preliminary announcement
by the Israeli Defense Forces
saying that they believe that
the killing of this American
Turkish activist, Aisha,
or Ezgi AG, was unintentional.
And indirect.
and they said that
actually what they've learned
is that that
the shots were fired
at one of the protesters,
that would have been
had been hurling stones and burning tires
in front of Israeli forces, in the West
Bank.
but, you know, we're
expecting more information
to come out in the hours ahead.
There's going to be a briefing shortly
with the, the chief spokesperson
for the Israeli Defense Force.
And so we'll get some more, more clarity.
But clearly, the the United States
Secretary of State,
Antony Blinken, they're not happy at all,
that, you know, another American.
And there's been a couple
who have been killed in the West Bank
while protesting.
To recap what he said.
And no one should be killed
for attending a protest.
And, of course,
he called on Israel later on,
to fundamentally change the way
it operates inside the West Bank.
And so signs there
that the United States is
being increasingly critical
of how Israel operates.",20240910
