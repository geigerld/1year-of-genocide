## Timeline
1. 13.09 --> have all the data downloaded + concrete idea of the 3rd part of the exposition.
2. 20.09 --> have the analysis of words, relationships and the histogram of colors of the miniatures, definition of the graphic material for the 3rd part of the exposition.
3. 27.09 --> define phisically the exposition, by that moment we should know where it's going to be (probably in the Linkerladen, the babyantifas place)
4. 06.10 --> everything printed and laminated
